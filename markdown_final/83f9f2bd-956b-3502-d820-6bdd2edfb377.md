## Question

A 38-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) is seen in clinic for routine follow-up. She is asymptomatic and reports no headaches, visual changes, dizziness, or other symptoms. Her oxygen saturation is 89% on room air. Laboratory results show a hemoglobin of 20 g/dL and a hematocrit of 62%. She is otherwise well, with no evidence of iron overload or other complications. Her referring physician asks whether she should undergo prophylactic venesection to lower her hematocrit.

Based on current clinical guidelines, what is the appropriate management regarding venesection for this patient, and what is the rationale?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prophylactic venesection should be performed in an asymptomatic 38-year-old woman with HHT, multiple PAVMs, hypoxemia, and marked erythrocytosis (hemoglobin 20 g/dL, hematocrit 62%) to lower her hematocrit. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking PAVMs, hypoxemia, and secondary erythrocytosis. Then, I should verify what authoritative guidelines say about venesection in this exact scenario. Next, I will examine the balance of risks and benefits of venesection versus no venesection. After that, I should consider alternative, guideline-directed management for PAVMs and iron status. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and monitoring plan with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. PAVMs create right-to-left shunts that bypass the pulmonary capillary bed, producing hypoxemia and stimulating erythropoietin-driven erythrocytosis as a compensatory mechanism to maintain arterial oxygen content. This is a physiologic response rather than a myeloproliferative process, and it helps preserve tissue oxygen delivery despite low saturation, so I need to be cautious about interfering with that compensation unless there is a compelling reason [^9971c383] [^0e368b42].

> Next, I should review the direct guideline statements on venesection in asymptomatic PAVM patients with high hematocrit. The British Thoracic Society explicitly recommends not performing prophylactic venesection in asymptomatic patients with PAVMs who have a high hematocrit, and it further notes that venesection should be considered only if there are symptoms of hyperviscosity, as done in cyanotic congenital heart disease, which is a different context altogether [^1e6833ed] [^7605b944]. Hold on, I should verify whether any other high-credibility guideline contradicts this; the Second International HHT Guidelines focus on screening and treating PAVMs and managing iron deficiency, but do not endorse routine venesection for asymptomatic erythrocytosis in PAVMs, which aligns with a conservative approach here [^ed376f23] [^9f41db23].

> I will now examine the risk–benefit balance. Potential benefits of venesection are theoretical reductions in blood viscosity and theoretical improvement in microcirculatory flow, but in PAVM-related erythrocytosis this could worsen arterial oxygen content and increase cardiac output demands, potentially precipitating ischemia or high-output physiology. Moreover, there is no evidence that venesection reduces stroke or abscess risk in PAVMs, whereas the major risks in PAVMs are paradoxical embolism and hypoxemia-related complications, which venesection does not address [^9971c383] [^f5da931b]. Wait, let me verify the thrombotic angle: iron deficiency, which is common in HHT, paradoxically elevates factor VIII and thrombotic risk, and venesection could compound hypoxemia without mitigating embolic risk, so the net clinical effect is likely unfavorable in this scenario [^ffd0d938] [^32c77d14].

> But wait, what if the hematocrit is "too high" by general hematology thresholds used in other erythrocytoses? I should double-check that distinction. Guidelines for polycythemia vera and idiopathic erythrocytosis support venesection when hematocrit exceeds about 56% or when there are hyperviscosity symptoms, but those recommendations are not designed for HHT with right-to-left shunting physiology, and the BTS PAVM statement specifically advises against prophylactic venesection in asymptomatic PAVM patients, so extrapolating PV targets here would be inappropriate [^9173c4af] [^14b6774a] [^1e6833ed].

> Next, I should review what we should do instead. The priority is to address the PAVMs and the iron status. I need to ensure she has appropriate PAVM screening and consideration of embolization for treatable lesions, because embolization reduces paradoxical embolic stroke and brain abscess risk, and this is where morbidity is highest in HHT with PAVMs. Antibiotic prophylaxis for bacteremia-prone procedures and avoidance of intravenous air are also essential [^f718a500] [^e71702cc] [^f5da931b]. I should confirm iron status and treat iron deficiency aggressively, as iron deficiency impairs hypoxemia compensation and increases thrombotic risk; oral iron is first-line, with IV iron when oral therapy fails or is not tolerated, and this strategy improves oxygen delivery without the hazards of venesection [^9f41db23] [^66fa81a7].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. Prophylactic venesection is not indicated in this asymptomatic patient with HHT, multiple PAVMs, and secondary erythrocytosis. The appropriate course is to avoid venesection, optimize PAVM management and stroke prevention strategies, and correct iron deficiency, with close follow-up of symptoms, oxygenation, and hematologic parameters rather than attempting to suppress the compensatory erythrocytosis [^1e6833ed] [^f718a500] [^9f41db23].

> I should confirm the monitoring plan. She needs periodic reassessment of PAVMs with contrast echocardiography or CT-based protocols, adherence to prophylactic antibiotics for procedures, and surveillance for neurologic symptoms; hematologically, I will track hemoglobin and hematocrit in the context of iron repletion and symptoms, reserving any consideration of venesection only if true hyperviscosity symptoms emerge, recognizing that such symptoms are uncommon in PAVM-related erythrocytosis and that the threshold to intervene is high [^c9147c27] [^e71702cc] [^7605b944].

---

Do not perform prophylactic venesection in this patient. Current guidelines advise against prophylactic venesection in asymptomatic HHT patients with high hematocrit from PAVMs, as the erythrocytosis is a compensatory response to hypoxemia and venesection can worsen hypoxemia and increase stroke risk [^1e6833ed] [^7605b944]. Venesection is only considered if there are symptoms of hyperviscosity or a hematocrit > 65% with ongoing symptoms despite optimal PAVM management. The priority is to optimize PAVM care, monitor for symptoms, and treat iron deficiency; venesection is not indicated here [^f718a500] [^9f41db23].

---

## Pathophysiology of erythrocytosis in HHT with PAVMs

In HHT with PAVMs, right-to-left shunting bypasses the pulmonary capillary bed, causing hypoxemia that drives erythropoietin-mediated erythrocytosis; this compensatory increase in red cell mass helps maintain arterial oxygen content and tissue oxygenation [^9971c383] [^0e368b42]. Thus, the erythrocytosis is physiologic rather than pathologic, and removing red cells can worsen hypoxemia and its complications.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

### British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines

The BTS explicitly recommends **do not perform prophylactic venesection** in asymptomatic patients with PAVMs and high hematocrit [^1e6833ed]. Venesection is only considered if there are symptoms of hyperviscosity (e.g. headache, dizziness, visual disturbances) or if the hematocrit exceeds 65% with ongoing symptoms despite optimal PAVM management [^7605b944].

---

### Second international guidelines for HHT

The Second International Guidelines for HHT emphasize screening and treating PAVMs, managing iron deficiency, and monitoring for complications, but **do not recommend prophylactic venesection** for asymptomatic patients with high hematocrit due to PAVMs [^ed376f23] [^9f41db23].

---

## Risks and benefits of prophylactic venesection

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits are largely theoretical and include reduced blood viscosity and improved microcirculatory flow, but these are **not well documented** in HHT with PAVMs.

---

### Potential risks

- **Worsening hypoxemia**: Reducing red cell mass can decrease arterial oxygen content and exacerbate hypoxemia, potentially increasing the risk of ischemic complications [^9971c383].
- **Increased stroke risk**: Hypoxemia and paradoxical embolization through PAVMs already elevate stroke risk; venesection may further increase this risk by worsening oxygen delivery [^f5da931b].
- **Iron deficiency**: Venesection can precipitate or worsen iron deficiency, which is common in HHT and associated with increased morbidity [^66fa81a7].

---

## Alternative management strategies

Given the lack of benefit and potential harms, management should focus on:

- **PAVM management**: Screen for and treat significant PAVMs with embolization to reduce hypoxemia and embolic complications [^f718a500] [^9abe77b8].
- **Iron deficiency management**: Treat iron deficiency with oral or intravenous iron to maintain adequate erythropoiesis and oxygen delivery [^9f41db23].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor oxygen saturation, hematocrit, and symptoms of hyperviscosity or ischemia [^c9147c27].

---

## Clinical scenarios where venesection may be considered

Venesection may be considered only in **specific circumstances**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for venesection** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic hyperviscosity (headache, dizziness, visual disturbances) | Yes, if symptoms persist despite optimal PAVM management [^7605b944] |
| Hematocrit > 65% with ongoing symptoms despite optimal PAVM management | Yes, as a last resort [^7605b944] |
| Asymptomatic patient with hematocrit 62% | No, prophylactic venesection not recommended [^1e6833ed] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Prophylactic venesection is **not recommended** for this asymptomatic HHT patient with a hematocrit of 62% and multiple PAVMs. The erythrocytosis is a compensatory response to hypoxemia, and venesection could worsen hypoxemia and increase stroke risk. Management should prioritize PAVM treatment, iron deficiency correction, and close monitoring, reserving venesection only for symptomatic hyperviscosity or extreme hematocrit with ongoing symptoms despite optimal care [^1e6833ed] [^7605b944].

### How to manage patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^0cf87416]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare systemic autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of the fibrovascular tissue with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Diagnosis is based on the clinical Curaçao criteria or molecular genetic testing. Dilated vessels can develop into telangiectases or larger vascular malformations in various organs, calling for an interdisciplinary approach. Epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding can result from these vascular defects. Various conservative and interventional treatments have been described for these conditions. However, no optimal therapy exists. Treatment can become especially difficult due to progressive anaemia or when anticoagulant or anti-thrombotic therapy becomes necessary. Screening for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM) should be performed in all confirmed and suspected patients. Treatment by percutaneous transcatheter embolotherapy and antibiotic prophylaxis is normally effective for PAVM. Cerebral or hepatic vascular malformations and rare manifestations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the best course of action for treatment.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management [^be7ec544]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease that occurs in approximately one in 5,000 to 8,000 persons. This multisystem disorder can affect the nose, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver, and brain. Epistaxis is the most common presenting problem, occurring in 90 percent of affected patients. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia will have an arteriovenous malformation in the lungs and more than 10 percent will have one in the brain. The symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are often unrecognized. Many patients, even those with affected family members, may go undiagnosed. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a clinical diagnosis that is based on the presence of three of four criteria (i.e., epistaxis, telangiectasias, visceral arteriovenous malformations, or family history of the disease). Screening and treatment recommendations have been created in an attempt to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Patients with confirmed or suspected hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should be screened for brain and lung arteriovenous malformations using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and contrast echocardiography. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations can be treated with embolization. Patients with a history of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations or those who have not been screened should use antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment, endoscopy, or other procedures that could cause bacteremia because of the risk of paradoxical brain embolism or infection.

Management of GI bleeding

Evidence of GI bleeding or a sharp decline in hematocrit without epistaxis should involve a prompt GI evaluation and an upper and lower endoscopy and, if these do not provide clear results, consideration of video capsule endoscopy. Telangiectasias and AVMs may be visualized in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine and/or colon.If accessible, local endoscopic treatment should be attempted. Patients with recurrent bleeding, multiple AVMs, and small bowel AVMs may require additional pharmacological measures. As in the management of epistaxis, antiangiogenic, antifibrinolytic agents and/or other hormonal agents may be considered. Octreotide therapy has also been proposed in reducing transfusion needsbut is without much supporting data. Management of the anemia and iron deficiency that result from this blood loss is addressed below.

Management of pulmonary, hepatic, and CNS AVMs

Collaboration with a pulmonologist, hepatologist, gastroenterologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, and interventional radiologist with experience in treating HHT patients is crucial to the management of AVMs found in the lungs, liver or brain. Screening is, therefore, important early in the diagnosis of these patients. Management will depend on the size of the AVMs, symptoms and location, and may include embolization of a pulmonary AVMs, surgical intervention for a CNS AVM and/or continued surveillance. Angiographic treatment of hepatic AVMs may be helpful in some patients but is often considered a higher risk by interventional radiologists.

For years, the patient was only able to maintain her hemoglobin with 1-2 units of packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusion weekly plus darbepoetin alfa 300 mcg every other week. After beginning bevacizumab 5 mg/kg at time 0, she became transfusion independent immediately and her hemoglobin normalized within two weeks. Bevacizumab was administered every other week for the first 4 infusions, then monthly as maintenance. Duration of maintenance therapy is patient-dependent and optimal dose and duration is not known.

Published data using bevacizumab to treat chronic bleeding in hereditary human telangiectasia are patients.

Use of anticoagulation in patients with thrombosis

Patients who develop thrombotic complications present a difficult therapeutic dilemma given the inherent bleeding of the disease. The low serum iron levels in HHT patients have been associated with elevated factor VIII levels, along with a 2.5-fold increased risk of VTE events.In those patients who develop a VTE, therapeutic anticoagulation can be administered. This should be managed with caution and the patient should be screened for pulmonary and cerebral AVMs that may increase their bleeding risk.

Key Points
- HHT is a genetic disorder in which blood vessels do not develop normally leading to bleeding that can be serious or life threatening.
- Frequent nosebleeds are the most common sign.
- Complication can vary widely, even among affected family members.
- Treatment to control bleeding and prevent complications may be needed. What it is HHT is a disorder in which some blood vessels do not develop properly. A person with HHT may form abnormal capillaries or abnormal capillary connections between the arteries and veins. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that pass blood from arteries to veins. The abnormal blood vessels formed in HHT are often fragile and can burst, causing bleeding. Men, women, and children from all racial and ethnic groups can be affected by HHT and experience the problems associated with this disorder, some of which are serious and potentially life-threatening. Fortunately, if HHT is discovered early, effective treatments are available.

However, there is no cure for HHT. Signs Nosebleeds are the most common sign of HHT, resulting from small abnormal blood vessels within the inside layer of the nose. Abnormal blood vessels in the skin can appear on the hands, fingertips, face, lips, lining of the mouth, and nose as delicate red or purplish spots that lighten briefly when touched. Bleeding within the stomach or intestines is another possible indicator of HHT that occurs because of abnormal blood vessels lining the digestive tract. Additional signs of HHT include abnormal artery-vein connections within the brain, lungs, and liver, which often do not display any warning signs before rupturing. Causes of HHT HHT is a genetic disorder. Each person with HHT has a gene that is altered, which causes HHT. It takes only one gene with a mutation to cause HHT. Hundreds of possible mutations in several different genes have been linked to HHT. Diagnosis HHT can be diagnosed by performing genetic testing.

Most people with HHT are first diagnosed by using clinical criteria. Complications and Treatments The complications of HHT can vary widely, even among people affected by HHT in the same family. Complications and treatment of HHT depend on the parts of the body that are affected by this disorder. Treatment may include controlling bleeding and anemia and preventing complications from abnormal artery-vein connections in the lungs and brain.

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may be the only clinical criterion present in genetically confirmed hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^b69e2b63]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

One-third of adult patients with genetically confirmed HHT and one-quarter of adult patients with PAVMs and genetically confirmed HHT did not meet clinical diagnostic criteria for HHT. Gene testing is an efficient route to establish the diagnosis of HHT, whether or not HHT is clinically apparent, and is now an important component of care for patients with one or more PAVMs.

### Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia with multiple complications presenting in an older patient [^ebb58dde]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant multi-organ vascular disorder associated with bleeding and a reduced life expectancy. We present a 91-year-old woman with complications of previously undiagnosed HHT. This case demonstrates three potential complications: pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) resulting in a right to left shunt, cerebral infarctions and pericardial effusion. Despite these potentially life-threatening complications and the reduced life-expectancy associated with HHT the patient has survived to an advanced age. Due to the patient's late diagnosis and frailty, the treatment options of AVM embolization and pericardiocentesis were deemed inappropriate. The patient was treated with tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding severity and discharged home with a care package and home oxygen.

Treatment

The patient was transfused with packed red blood cells with a subsequent haemoglobin of 81 g/L. She was involved in a risk-versus-benefit discussion, and despite her low haemoglobin and epistaxis, she was initiated on therapeutic intravenous heparin for the thrombus within the aneurysm and underwent embolisation of the PAVM by interventional radiology (figure 3).

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: an overview of diagnosis and management in the molecular era for clinicians [^f21e505f]. Genetics in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome) is a relatively common, underdiagnosed autosomal-dominant disorder of arteriovenous malformations and telangiectases. DNA testing for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has recently become available in North America, making presymptomatic screening available to relatives with a positive molecular diagnosis. This now enables practitioners to prevent catastrophic complications of undiagnosed pulmonary and CNS arteriovenous malformations and eliminates the need to radiographically screen all at-risk relatives shown to be unaffected by molecular testing. We review the clinical aspects of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, describe the indications, benefits, and limitations of molecular diagnostic testing for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and provide a molecular genetics summary to facilitate genetic counseling before and after DNA testing for this complex disorder.

### A case report of acute myocardial infarction with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^4fe7266b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite the predominant tendency towards bleeding and hemorrhage, HHT can also predispose patients to thrombotic and embolic events, including myocardial infarction, as observed in our patient. Healthcare providers should recognize this association to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of HHT patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Future investigations are warranted to evaluate the potential benefits of screening for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) using pulmonary CTA followed by embolization, as well as to assess the effectiveness of bare-metal stents in managing coronary artery disease in HHT patients.

4.5 Major Acute Bleeding

While most bleeding in HHT is chronic, in recognition of the seriousness and life‐threatening potential of acute bleeds, the expert panel defined a major acute bleed in HHT by adapting the definition for major bleeding from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis to best reflect the HHT disease state. A major acute bleed in HHT is defined as satisfying one or more of the following criteria: (1) acute‐onset severe epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating urgent intervention performed by a healthcare provider (e.g. nasal packing, administration of intravenous antifibrinolytic, or ablative procedure); (2) pulmonary, central nervous system, or other solid organ bleeding due to a ruptured AVM; (3) acute bleeding that results in a drop in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL over a 24‐h period; or (4) acute bleeding that results in hemodynamic instability or a requirement for packed red cell transfusion (in excess of the individual's baseline maintenance red cell transfusion requirements, if any).

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: systemic therapies, guidelines, and an evolving standard of care [^64541dea]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) management is evolving because of the emergence and development of antiangiogenic therapies to eliminate bleeding telangiectasias and achieve hemostasis. This progress is reflected in recent clinical recommendations published in the Second International Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of HHT, in which systemic therapies including antiangiogenics and antifibrinolytics are now recommended as standard treatment options for bleeding. This review highlights the new recommendations especially relevant to hematologists in managing bleeding, anticoagulation, and anemia in patients with HHT.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): a practical guide to management [^68261bf9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the second most common inherited bleeding disorder, is associated with the development of malformed blood vessels. Abnormal blood vessels may be small and cutaneous or mucosal (telangiectasia), with frequent complications of bleeding, or large and visceral (arteriovenous malformations [AVMs]), with additional risks that can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. HHT can present in many different ways and can be difficult to recognize, particularly in younger patients in the absence of a known family history of disease or epistaxis, its most common manifestation. HHT is commonly diagnosed using the established Curaçao clinical criteria, which include (1) family history, (2) recurrent epistaxis, (3) telangiectasia, and (4) visceral AVMs. Fulfillment of 3 or more criteria provides a definite diagnosis of HHT, whereas 2 criteria constitute a possible diagnosis of HHT. However, these criteria are insufficient in children to rule out disease due to the age-dependent development of some of these criteria. Genetic testing, when positive, can provide definitive diagnosis of HHT in all age groups. Clinical course is often complicated by significant epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to anemia in half of adult patients with HHT. The management paradigm has recently shifted from surgical approaches to medical treatments aimed at control of chronic bleeding, such as antifibrinolytic and antiangiogenic agents, combined with aggressive iron replacement with intravenous iron. Guidelines for management of HHT, including screening and treatment, were determined by expert consensus and originally published in 2009 with updates and new guidelines in 2020.

INTRODUCTION

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) poses a substantial burden on otorhinolaryngological practice. Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, HHT is caused by gene defects, most commonly in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4, and leads to the development of nasal and gastrointestinal telangiectasia, in addition to visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 1, 2 Recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) is the hallmark of HHT 1, 2, 3, 4, and results from fragile nasal telangiectasia, which are often lined by a single endothelial layer with no smooth muscles cells or pericytes, despite acting as conduits for blood at arterial pressure 5 (see Supporting Fig. 1 in the online version of this article). Nosebleeds often occur daily, and can be associated with acute hemodynamic disturbances 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and reduced quality of life. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Treatments include surgically based therapies such as cauterization, laser photocoagulation, 13 septal dermoplasty, 14 and Young's procedure, 15 and medical therapies such as antioestrogens, 16 tranexamic acid, 17, 18 and bevacizumab (Avastin). 19, 20 Therapeutics are generally graded according to the severity of epistaxis, 21 and many patients require more than one modality. Further treatment modalities are currently under evaluation in clinical trials.

The epistaxis that can be so difficult to manage in clinical practice also causes additional problems. HHT patients are commonly iron deficient and/or anemic because replacing iron lost through recurrent hemorrhage demands very high iron intakes, and it is difficult to meet the hemorrhage‐adjusted iron requirement by dietary intake alone. 22 The diverse detrimental consequences of iron deficiency 23, 24, 25, 26 include anemia and transfusional requirements that occur because iron deficiency restricts erythropoeisis, 27 leading to low hemoglobin, 28 and reduced arterial oxygen content. 29, 30 The development of iron deficiency predicts development of high output cardiac failure for HHT patients with severe hepatic AVMs. 31 Additionally, low serum iron is associated with venous thromboemboli, 32 paradoxical embolic stroke through pulmonary AVMs, 33 exuberant platelet aggregation to 5HT, 33, 34 and elevated coagulation factor VIII. 32

### Prevention of serious infections in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: roles for prophylactic antibiotics, the pulmonary capillaries-but not vaccination [^f1e55894]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Rodríguez-García et al. recently suggested that vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumonia, and influenza should be considered a potential route to prevent the major deep-seated infections observed in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). However, as pointed out by Al-Samkari et al.there is no current evidence that patients with HHT are more prone to pneumoccal, hemophilus or influenza infections, or would benefit from any different approach to vaccination than the general population. Furthermore, we are concerned that a focus on these pathogens risks missing the relevant necessary foci that require a different approach- transient bacteremias, prophylactic antibiotics, and pulmonary capillary clearance functions.

HHT is caused by pathogenic variants in ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4, and usually results in vascular abnormalities (telangiectasia, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)), recurrent bleeds, and anemia.A subgroup of HHT patients develop occasional deep-seated infections including brain abscesses.HHT members of the European Reference Network for Rare Vascular Diseases (VASCERN) have contributed strongly to published primary data, including recent manuscripts detailing clinical and microbiological features of 65 4 and 27 5 consecutive brain abscess cases. Multidisciplinary discussions on optimal prevention strategies have been taking place with our microbiological colleagues for more than a decade.Additionally, in June 2017, a VASCERN HHT workshop specifically addressed infection in HHT, with proceedings published earlier this year.The workshop was prompted both by considerations on the infections,and the 2016 publication of a manuscript demonstrating modified responses by macrophages from a myeloid-restricted murine model of HHT (Eng fl/fl LysMCre mice).

Regarding specific circumstances for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, HHT-WG 2020 guidelines recommend to approach pregnant patients with HHT not recently screened and/or treated for pulmonary AVM as follows:

- obtain agitated saline contrast TTE or low-dose non-contrast chest CT, depending on local expertise, for initial screening of pulmonary AVMs in asymptomatic patients; obtain chest CT, when performed, early in the second trimester

- obtain low-dose non-contrast chest CT for diagnostic testing in patients with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary AVM (this testing can be performed at any gestational age, as clinically indicated)

- treat pulmonary AVMs starting in the second trimester unless otherwise clinically indicated.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by small telangiectasias and larger multisystem arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Common sites of AVMs include in the nose, lungs, brain and liver. These lesions are prone to rupture, leading to complications including recurrent epistaxis and significant haemorrhage. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can also occur. This review presents an update on the genetics, clinical manifestations, management options, and screening recommendations for children with HHT.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^f5da931b]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs)—stroke and embolic risk evidence is summarized: HHT is an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, and PAVMs are present in nearly half of patients with HHT and are associated with embolic complications, including ischemic stroke and brain abscesses. In a cross-sectional study of 108 patients with HHT, those with PAVM had more total embolic complications and more stroke/TIA, with a 7-fold increased odds for embolic events in an adjusted model; in a multivariate analysis of a retrospective cohort study of 353 patients with HHT, PAVMs were independently associated with SCI; and in a cross-sectional study of 75 individuals with HHT, those with multiple PAVMs had greater odds of having stroke compared with those with a single PAVM. Data from observational research have demonstrated an association between PAVM embolization and reduced rate of stroke, but the findings have not been confirmed in clinical trials, and therefore a multidisciplinary team with HHT expertise, consisting of at minimum specialists in pulmonology, interventional radiology, and neurology/neurosurgery, should weigh the risks and benefits of intervention for patients with PAVMs.

Curaçao Criteria for diagnosing hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia *

The patient is currently asymptomatic and being monitored in the Cincinnati HHT Center of Excellence every 6 months. This Center is a multidisciplinary clinic, with the core specialties involved including a hematologist, a genetic counselor, interventional radiology, and an ear, nose, and throat surgeon. Our Center also includes a pulmonologist, a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, a neurologist, a neuroradiologist, a neurosurgeon, and a plastic surgeon. As part of her monitoring, she will require several clinical tests per international guidelines. She will need a repeat brain MRI upon entering adulthood, as brain AVMs can grow with puberty. She will require repeat bubble echocardiograms every 2–3 years to monitor the state of her existing pulmonary AVMs and evaluate for anticipated complications, such as the risk of embolic and/or infectious events. She will require testing of annual hemoglobin levels starting at age 35 years due to risk for internal bleeding from AVMs (especially GI AVMs), as well as annual liver screening with liver function testing. She will also need routine colonoscopy at age 50 years, or sooner if she has evidence of GI bleed. Finally, she will also require antibiotic prophylaxis due to the risk for infectious emboli secondary to her existing pulmonary AVMs.

Pathogenesis

Pathology

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a disease characterized by vascular lesions, including AVMs and telangiectasias. AVMs are abnormal connections that form between arteries and veins without an intermediary capillary system. They can occur anywhere in the body, such as in the central nervous system (CNS), lungs, liver or spine. Vascular malformations may be composed of small (nidi 1-3 cm) or micro (nidi <1 cm) AVMs, pulmonary sacs, or direct high-flow connections. While the terms “telangiectasia” and “arteriovenous malformation” are often used interchangeably, as they both occur from a direct connection between an artery and a vein whilst bypassing the capillary system, they are actually pathologically-distinct terms. Telangiectasias, by definition, occur on mucocutaneous surfaces, such as the skin, gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, or upper aerodigestive tract. AVMs occur in internal organs, such as the liver, lung, and brain.Histological evaluation of AVMs reveals an irregular endothelium, increased collagen and actin, and a convoluted basement membrane.

### Ischemic stroke and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: a review [^db45e455]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The potential of covert pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) to cause early onset, preventable ischemic strokes is not well known to neurologists. This is evident by their lack of mention in serial American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) Guidelines and the single case report biased literature of recent years. We performed PubMed and Cochrane database searches for major studies on ischemic stroke and PAVMs published from January 1, 1974, through April 3, 2021. This identified 24 major observational studies, 3 societal guidelines, 1 nationwide analysis, 3 systematic reviews, 21 other review/opinion articles, and 18 recent (2017-2021) case reports/series that were synthesized. Key points are that patients with PAVMs have ischemic stroke a decade earlier than routine stroke, losing 9 extra healthy life-years per patient in the recent US nationwide analysis (2005-2014). Large-scale thoracic CT screens of the general population in Japan estimate PAVM prevalence to be 38/100,000 (95% confidence interval 18-76), with ischemic stroke rates exceeding 10% across PAVM series dating back to the 1950s, with most PAVMs remaining undiagnosed until the time of clinical stroke. Notably, the rate of PAVM diagnoses doubled in US ischemic stroke hospitalizations between 2005 and 2014. The burden of silent cerebral infarction approximates to twice that of clinical stroke. More than 80% of patients have underlying hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The predominant stroke mechanism is paradoxical embolization of platelet-rich emboli, with iron deficiency emerging as a modifiable risk factor. PAVM-related ischemic strokes may be cortical or subcortical, but very rarely cause proximal large vessel occlusions. Single antiplatelet therapy may be effective for secondary stroke prophylaxis, with dual antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy requiring nuanced risk-benefit analysis given their risk of aggravating iron deficiency. This review summarizes the ischemic stroke burden from PAVMs, the implicative pathophysiology, and relevant diagnostic and treatment overviews to facilitate future incorporation into AHA/ASA guidelines.

It is unclear whether pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia develop later in life or are preformed in childhood. We show that the prevalence of PAVMs in children is similar to that in their parents, providing evidence against de novo PAVM formation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

### A survey of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation screening, management, and follow-up in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia centers of excellence [^576d1094]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine current practice regarding screening, management, and follow-up of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), particularly those with feeding arteries <3 mm in diameter, in those patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) at HHT Centers of Excellence.

Materials and Methods

A 32-question survey focusing on PAVM screening, management, and follow-up was sent to 147 participants at HHT Centers worldwide.

Results

Thirty-three responses were received (22%); 60% from interventional radiologists and 20% from pulmonologists; 67% from the USA, 21% European, and 6% Asian. In HHT patients with initial negative screening echocardiogram, 60% recommended repeat screening contrast echocardiogram in 5 years, while 15% felt that no additional screening was necessary in these patients. Fifty-nine percentage reported never having seen a patient with initial negative contrast echocardiogram become positive. In patients with grade 1 echocardiograms, 41% recommended contrast-enhanced CT as the next step in management, 22% recommended non-contrast CT, and 22 and 3% recommended repeat echocardiogram in 5 and 10 years, respectively. In patients with grade 1 echocardiograms but no visible PAVMs, opinions regarding the use of bubble filters were evenly divided, while 79% recommended prophylactic antibiotics prior to invasive procedures. Eighty percentages of respondents treat PAVMs with feeding artery less than 3 mm, and 52% treat feeders less than 2 mm. Regarding follow-up, 71% reported seeing PAVM recurrence at the site of a previously completely treated PAVM.

Conclusion

There is inconsistency in practice regarding PAVM screening, management, and follow-up, suggesting a need for further research and guideline development.

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations [^9971c383]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Within the past decade, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have evolved from rare curiosities to not uncommon clinical states, with the latest estimates suggesting a prevalence of ~1 in 2,600. PAVMs provide anatomic right-to-left shunts, allowing systemic venous blood to bypass gas exchange and pulmonary capillary bed processing. Hypoxemia and enhanced ventilatory demands result, although both are usually asymptomatic. Paradoxical emboli lead to strokes and cerebral abscesses, and these commonly occur in individuals with previously undiagnosed PAVMs. PAVM hemorrhage is rare but is the main cause of maternal death in pregnancy. PAVM occlusion by embolization is the standard of care to reduce these risks. However, recent data demonstrate that currently recommended management protocols can result in levels of radiation exposure that would be classified as harmful. Recent publications also provide a better appreciation of the hematologic and cardiovascular demands required to maintain arterial oxygen content and oxygen consumption in hypoxemic patients, identify patient subgroups at higher risk of complications, and emphasize the proportion of radiologically visible PAVMs too small to treat by embolization. This review, therefore, outlines medical states that exacerbate the consequences of PAVMs. Chief among these is iron deficiency, which is commonly present due to concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: iron deficiency impairs hypoxemia compensations by restricting erythropoiesis and increases the risk of ischemic strokes. Management of periodontal disease, dental interventions, pulmonary hypertension, and pregnancy also requires specific consideration in the setting of PAVMs. The review concludes by discussing to what extent previously recommended protocols may benefit from modification or revision.

### Personalised stroke evaluation and management: tailoring individualised patient care for hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^20217c9b]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

This case highlights the importance of using an individualised patient-centred stroke evaluation and thoroughly screening patients who had a stroke with HHT. HHT is often underdiagnosed in patients and poses a challenge to providers due to its rarity and the lack of clinical awareness of the disease. Current guidelines indicate that all patients with possible or confirmed HHT should be screened for PAVMs with the recommended screening modalities, which include CT with a modified angiography protocol or TTCE.

Learning points

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is frequently underdiagnosed in patients due to its rarity and lack of clinical awareness. An individualised patient-centred stroke evaluation, along with extensive screening for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in patients who had a stroke with HHT, is crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention to prevent further complications.
Genetic testing plays a pivotal role in diagnosing HHT, an autosomal dominant disorder. Families with signs of HHT can have their diagnosis confirmed through genetic testing, making it invaluable for those who do not meet Curaçao criteria or are asymptomatic. This early identification allows for personalised care and the management of potential complications.
Ischaemic stroke in HHT patients can be caused by paradoxical embolism due to PAVMs, even though most HHT-related PAVMs are asymptomatic. The risk of stroke in HHT patients with untreated PAVMs increases with age, emphasising the importance of early screening and intervention.
Treatment decisions should be made after considering the patient’s overall health, risks and benefits and may involve interventions such as embolisation for PAVMs to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Regular follow-up and monitoring of the patient’s condition are crucial to ensure appropriate management.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management from the hematologist's perspective [^c1964825]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is a common autosomal dominant disorder that causes abnormal blood vessel formation.The eponym recognizes the 19 th century physicians William Osler, Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu, and Frederick Parkes Weber, who each independently described the disease.Clinical sequelae of HHT include mucocutaneous telangiectasias, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and bleeding, with consequent iron deficiency anemia. Patients with HHT have been found to have abnormal plasma concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)secondary to mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4.There is considerable inter- and intra-family variation in disease onset and clinical severity, even in cases resulting from an identical mutation. Iron deficiency and associated anemia are frequent complications of the disease due to recurrent epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. There are no accepted guidelines on management of patients with HHT beyond supportive measures of iron supplementation, red cell transfusion, and directed treatments to ablate bleeding sites and AVMs.

Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis via VEGF inhibition, appears to be promising in HHT as an intravenous formulation for reducing the frequency and severity of epistaxis and impacting quality of life. However, data on intranasal bevacizumab have been conflicting, and studies investigating the use of intravenous bevacizumab are limited to case reports and retrospective series.Treatment of HHT involves a multidisciplinary approach of specialists in cardiology, pulmonology, hepatology, interventional radiology, ear, nose and throat (ENT), genetics, and hematology. This review focuses on the biology of HHT and the management issues that confront the hematologist, as well as proposing a hematology management scheme.

### International guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^94c76707]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

HHT is an autosomal dominant disease with an estimated prevalence of at least 1/5000 which can frequently be complicated by the presence of clinically significant arteriovenous malformations in the brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract and liver. HHT is under-diagnosed and families may be unaware of the available screening and treatment, leading to unnecessary stroke and life-threatening hemorrhage in children and adults.

Objective

The goal of this international HHT guidelines process was to develop evidence-informed consensus guidelines regarding the diagnosis of HHT and the prevention of HHT-related complications and treatment of symptomatic disease.

Methods

The overall guidelines process was developed using the AGREE framework, using a systematic search strategy and literature retrieval with incorporation of expert evidence in a structured consensus process where published literature was lacking. The Guidelines Working Group included experts (clinical and genetic) from eleven countries, in all aspects of HHT, guidelines methodologists, health care workers, health care administrators, HHT clinic staff, medical trainees, patient advocacy representatives and patients with HHT. The Working Group determined clinically relevant questions during the pre-conference process. The literature search was conducted using the OVID MEDLINE database, from 1966 to October 2006. The Working Group subsequently convened at the Guidelines Conference to partake in a structured consensus process using the evidence tables generated from the systematic searches.

Results

The outcome of the conference was the generation of 33 recommendations for the diagnosis and management of HHT, with at least 80% agreement amongst the expert panel for 30 of the 33 recommendations.

### Pulmonary vascular complications of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^53b114a5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this study is to present the latest advances and recommendations in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary vascular complications associated with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), pulmonary hypertension associated with high output cardiac failure or liver vascular malformations, haemoptysis, haemothorax and thromboembolic disease.

Recent Findings

Transthoracic contrast echocardiography has been validated as a screening tool for PAVM in patients with suspected HHT. Advancements in genetic testing support its use in family members at risk as a cost-effective measure. Therapy with bevacizumab in patients with high output cardiac failure and severe liver AVMs showed promising results. PAH tends to be more aggressive in HHT type 2 patients.

Summary

Patients suffering from this elusive disease should be referred to HHT specialized centres to ensure a standardized and timely approach to diagnosis and management.

Management and follow-up

HHT is a complex disease process that has variable symptoms and presentations that require a multidisciplinary team which can include gastroenterologists, hematologists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, interventional radiologists, genetic counselors, and many more. Multiple screening studies are recommended after a diagnosis of HHT (Table 3). According to the HHT International Guidelines, it is recommended that patients with suspected HHT-related organ involvement be treated at a center with HHT expertise because of the multi-faceted nature of this disease (Faughnan et al.; de Gussem et al.). HHT Centers of Excellence are institutions that have an integrated team of experts that are knowledgeable in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of HHT. These centers are certified to provide appropriate screening, treatment, education, and life-long follow up to these patients with the goal to reduce morbidity and mortality (de Gussem et al.).

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management from the hematologist's perspective [^f1a1638b]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes abnormal blood vessel formation. The diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is clinical, based on the Curaçao criteria. Genetic mutations that have been identified include ENG , ACVRL1/ALK1 , and MADH4/SMAD4 , among others. Patients with HHT may have telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations in various organs and suffer from many complications including bleeding, anemia, iron deficiency, and high-output heart failure. Families with the same mutation exhibit considerable phenotypic variation. Optimal treatment is best delivered via a multidisciplinary approach with appropriate diagnosis, screening and local and/or systemic management of lesions. Anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab have emerged as a promising systemic therapy in reducing bleeding complications but are not curative. Other pharmacological agents include iron supplementation, antifibrinolytics and hormonal treatment. This review discusses the biology of HHT, management issues that face the practising hematologist, and considerations of future directions in HHT treatment.

In 2008, a 67-year-old woman experienced a left posterior choroidal artery stroke with right motor and sensitive hemiparesis. Her medical history included migraine with visual aura, major epistaxis since childhood, an isolated pulmonary arteriovenous malformation surgically removed in 1969, and a diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome1 based on recurrent epistaxis, New York Heart Association Functional Classification II dyspnea, digital clubbing, and cutaneous telangiectases. Clinical examination uncovered cutaneous telangiectases on the face, lips, and fingertips as well as digital clubbing associated with a relative cyanosis of extremities.

Cerebral computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed asymptomatic infarcts in the left cerebellum and right basal ganglia, confirmed the left posterior choroidal artery stroke, and excluded any intracranial vascular malformations. Chest x-ray raised the suspicion of multiple PAVMs, which was confirmed on thoracic computed tomography. Contrast echocardiography and transcranial Doppler showed a massive right-to-left shunt. A splenic aneurysm and a hepatic arteriovenous fistula were also discovered. Morier J, Goncalves-Matoso V, Michel P.

Juvenile polyposis syndrome—hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) screening for SMAD4 carriers is outlined with specific timing and tests. We suggest patients with SMAD4 pathogenic variants be clinically evaluated for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia at the time of the diagnosis, including screening for and appropriate management of cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence) Children with possible or confirmed HHT should be screened for brain AVMs at the time of diagnosis and undergo at least 1 follow-up MRI at puberty; lung AVM screening and surveillance is recommended at diagnosis and then every 3–5 years with pulse oximetry testing and consideration of transthoracic contrast echocardiogram; and in adulthood surveillance should include annual hemoglobin or hematocrit for all patients older than 35 years. Transthoracic contrast echocardiogram as a screen for pulmonary AVMs should be performed at the time of diagnosis, within 5 years preceding planned pregnancy, after pregnancy, and otherwise every 5–10 years, and brain MRI with and without contrast should be performed at birth or at the time of diagnosis to screen for cerebral vascular malformations.

### Bevacizumab in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and severe hepatic vascular malformations (...) [^cb0ceee8]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Median cardiac index at 6 months was significantly lower than before treatment. Among 23 patients with available data at 6 months, we observed CR in 5 cases, PR in 15 cases, and no response in 3 cases. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a dominantly inherited genetic vascular disorder characterized by recurrent epistaxis; cutaneous telangiectasia; and visceral arteriovenous malformations that affect many organs, including the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and brain. Diagnosis is based on the Curaçao criteria and is considered definite if at least 3 of 4 criteria are fulfilled. 1 The criteria are spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasia, family history, and visceral lesions. Hepatic involvement is observed in up to 74% of patients, 2, 3 but no more than 8% of those patients, mainly women, have symptomatic liver shunting.

4, 5 The liver vascular malformations result in 3 complications: high output cardiac failure, in most cases and more rarely portal hypertension, and biliary necrosis. Hepatic shunting, like other extracardiac systemic shunts, is thought to be associated with increased cardiac preload and decreased peripheral vascular resistances, leading to an adaptative increase of cardiac output. High-output cardiac failure usually starts with a progressive increase in cardiac output, in turn leading to elevated left ventricle filling pressures, dyspnea, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.
6. Secondary criteria at 3 months included: dyspnea according to New York Heart Association classification and echocardiographic data and skin, mouth, and nose examination. We used a daily time report and a grid to record daily duration and number of episodes of epistaxis.

Hemoglobin levels and number of blood transfusions were systematically recorded at each visit. Quality of life was evaluated using the Short Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire15 before treatment and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Liver volumes were obtained using CT scan and Vitrea version 5.
1. Liver Doppler ultrasound determined diameter, course, and abnormalities of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic veins. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was recorded and analyzed offline to assess functional modifications of liver hepatic perfusion, enhancement times, and kinetics before treatment and at 15 days, 29 days, 57 days, and 3 months after the beginning of treatment for patients who did not have pulmonary AVMs. Vascular spots, arterial contrast enhancement, transit time between the hepatic artery and hepatic veins, and parenchyma enhancement curve were measured to register early functional changes.

Images were not blinded. Patients with pulmonary AVM before treatment on CT scan underwent a control CT scan at 6 months. Twenty-four received the entire bevacizumab injection schedule, and 1 stopped the treatment after 2 injections for personal convenience and was considered as having nonresponse. All 25 patients had hepatic AVMs with hepatic murmur in 22 cases. Hepatic artery diameter was increased on CT scan in all patients with double hepatic arteries in 8 cases. All patients had a high cardiac index before treatment associated with dyspnea. Fourteen patients had also elevated LV filling pressures and 8 had elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Among 23 patients with available data at 6 months, we observed CR in 5 cases, PR in 15 cases, and no response in 3 cases.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia may be the most morbid inherited bleeding disorder in women [^8686c1a9]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is the second-most common inherited bleeding disorder (BD) worldwide and remains without approved therapies. HHT causes serious mucosal bleeding resulting in severe iron-deficiency anemia, major psychosocial complications, and visceral arteriovenous malformations in the brain, lung, and liver, which can cause life-threatening hemorrhagic complications. No study has examined the relative morbidity of HHT and von Willebrand disease (VWD), which is the most common inherited BD in women. We performed an observational cohort study of women with HHT or VWD, comparing a representative sample of 100 randomly selected women with HHT to 100 randomly selected age-matched women with VWD. In HHT vs VWD, recurrent epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding were more likely (odds ratio [OR], 32.73 [95% confidence interval, 13.81-71.80]; P < .0001 and 5.69 [2.59-12.89]; P < .0001) and heavy menstrual bleeding was less likely (OR, 0.32 [0.18-0.57]; P < .0001). Iron-deficiency anemia was significantly more likely, and the lowest hemoglobin was significantly lower in HHT than in VWD. The odds of iron infusion dependence, requirement for red cell transfusion, and hemostatic surgical procedures were significantly higher-17-fold, threefold, and eightfold higher, respectively-and hospital admissions to manage disease complications were both ∼14 times more frequent in women with HHT vs those with VWD. In conclusion, much higher disease-related morbidity, mortality, and health care use were observed in women with HHT vs VWD, providing evidence that HHT may be the most clinically significant inherited BD in women. Given the vast gap in research funding for HHT compared with both hemophilia (a disease primarily of men) and VWD, these findings have significant implications for gender equity in hematology.

### Second international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^793cb914]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 5000 that is characterized by the presence of vascular malformations (VMs). These result in chronic bleeding, acute hemorrhage, and complications from shunting through VMs. The goal of the Second International HHT Guidelines process was to develop evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management and prevention of HHT-related symptoms and complications.

Methods

The guidelines were developed using the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) framework and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. The guidelines expert panel included expert physicians (clinical and genetic) in HHT from 15 countries, guidelines methodologists, health care workers, health care administrators, patient advocacy representatives, and persons with HHT. During the preconference process, the expert panel generated clinically relevant questions in 6 priority topic areas. A systematic literature search was done in June 2019, and articles meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables, which were used as the basis for recommendation development. The expert panel subsequently convened during a guidelines conference to conduct a structured consensus process, during which recommendations reaching at least 80% consensus were discussed and approved.

Recommendations

The expert panel generated and approved 6 new recommendations for each of the following 6 priority topic areas: epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia and iron deficiency, liver VMs, pediatric care, and pregnancy and delivery (36 total). The recommendations highlight new evidence in existing topics from the first International HHT Guidelines and provide guidance in 3 new areas: anemia, pediatrics, and pregnancy and delivery. These recommendations should facilitate implementation of key components of HHT care into clinical practice.

### Embolization for pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a decision analysis [^0e122265]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although experts recommend presymptomatic coil embolotherapy for patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) who have pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), this approach has not been studied prospectively and is not applied universally. We used decision analysis to evaluate the optimal treatment strategy for HHT patients with asymptomatic PAVMs.

Methods

We developed a Markov model to evaluate the following three strategies: no embolotherapy; embolotherapy only in the event of a PAVM complication; and immediate embolotherapy. Our model incorporated PAVM complications, embolotherapy effectiveness and complications, and the possibility of PAVM growth or reperfusion of successfully embolized PAVMs. The base case was a 40-year-old man with HHT and an asymptomatic PAVM with a 3-mm feeding artery. We modeled the natural history of HHT and the clinical course of embolotherapy based on review of the medical literature. We incorporated quality-of-life weights derived from the direct assessment of patient preferences (n = 45) and a literature review.

Results

No embolotherapy, embolotherapy only in the event of a PAVM complication, and immediate embolotherapy were associated with expected survival times of 37.2, 37.6, and 39.0 years, respectively. After adjusting for quality of life, the corresponding estimates were 32.6, 34.1, and 37.2 quality-adjusted life-years. The outcome of the model was robust to changing model parameters within plausible ranges.

Conclusions

Patients with HHT and a PAVM with a feeding artery of >or= 3 mm have improved life expectancy and quality-adjusted survival with immediate embolotherapy. Embolotherapy should be the standard of care in such circumstances.

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may be the only clinical criterion present in genetically confirmed hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^e679fcfa]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians and patients might be aware that PAVMs can be a familial condition, most commonly due to hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is a multisystemic vascular dysplasia, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and important to diagnose early because screening and interventions have led to reduced morbidity and mortality.If HHT is diagnosed in an individual with PAVMs, broadly speaking, each of their first-degree relatives (child, sibling and parent) has a 50% chance of having HHT, and at least 50% of HHT-affected relatives are expected to have PAVMs.Establishing an HHT diagnosis in the family is therefore critical for optimal management of the greatest number of individuals.

A definite clinical diagnosis of HHT requires three of four Curaçao criteria, namely, recurrent spontaneous nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectasia at characteristic sites, visceral involvement (such as gastrointestinal telangiectasia or pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations) and a positive family history.Many consider that if HHT is present, these clinical features will be clearly evident and do not appreciate the importance of suspecting the diagnosis and offering HHT management to patients with one or two criteria as recommended(online supplemental data 1). This issue was exemplified by the April 2020 release of the National Health Service (NHS) National Genomic Test Directory (online supplemental data 1). For a patient who is the first of their family considered for HHT (the proband), HHT gene testing eligibility was contingent on them already having three Curaçao criteria, that is, a definite clinical diagnosis of HHT. Thus, patients with PAVMs were only eligible if they had two further Curaçao criteria from nosebleeds, telangiectasia and a family history of HHT.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations [^85f89e50]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Most congenital pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. During pregnancy, pulmonary hemorrhage can occur, compromising maternal and fetal health.

Cases

We studied three pregnancies in two women with hemorrhagic telangiectasia complicated by pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. A 28-year-old primigravida's fetus died at 25 weeks' gestation, and she had embolotherapy with coil springs, which corrected the hypoxemic state. In a subsequent pregnancy she delivered a healthy 2315-g infant at 38 weeks' gestation. A 19-year-old primigravida had spontaneous hemothorax at 26 weeks' gestation with severe hypoxemia and a growth-restricted fetus without umbilical artery diastolic flow. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation was diagnosed by computed tomography of the maternal lung. She had continued pulmonary bleeding, so emergency lung lobectomy was done. Maternal hypoxemia and umbilical diastolic flow improved, and she had term delivery of a healthy 2250-g infant.

Conclusion

Antenatal diagnosis and treatment of women with hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations might prevent potentially life-threatening fetomaternal complications.

### A case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with hypoxemia onset in the neonatal period [^69743004]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The described patient details a neonatal male presenting with hypoxemia and found to have a cerebral AVM as well as a suspected pulmonary AVM in addition to telangiectasias and epistaxis. This constellation of symptoms and findings is highly suggestive of HHT. HHT is a hereditary, relatively common, systemic disease characterized by multiple vascular bed telangiectasias and AVMs, affecting about 1 in 5,000–8000 individuals worldwide. However, clinical manifestations of HHT exhibit an age-related penetrance, and telangiectasias and epistaxis are uncommon in children and predominantly seen in late childhood or adulthood, resulting in the diagnosis being frequently delayed until later stages. For example, epistaxis is the most common clinical manifestation of HHT, and the average age of onset is 12 years. Diagnostic delays primarily occur because children seldom fulfill existing clinical criteria known as the Curaçao criteria including recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, multiple characteristic telangiectasias, visceral vascular malformation, first-degree family member meeting HHT criteria. Throughout the entire course, this patient met only one diagnostic criterion, which does not qualify as HHT according to the diagnostic criteria. Thus, current standards lack sensitivity while maintaining specificity in pediatric populations.

### Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^0e368b42]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by loss-of-function pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins of the BMP signalling pathway. Up to 90% of disease-causal variants are observed in ENG and ACVRL1, with SMAD4 and GDF2 less frequently responsible for HHT. In adults, the most frequent HHT manifestations relate to iron deficiency and anaemia owing to recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) or bleeding from gastrointestinal telangiectases. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the lungs, liver and the central nervous system cause additional major complications and often complex symptoms, primarily due to vascular shunting, which is right-to-left through pulmonary AVMs (causing ischaemic stroke or cerebral abscess) and left-to-right through systemic AVMs (causing high cardiac output). Children usually experience isolated epistaxis; in rare cases, childhood complications occur from large AVMs in the lungs or central nervous system. Management goals encompass control of epistaxis and intestinal bleeding from telangiectases, screening for and treatment of iron deficiency (with or without anaemia) and AVMs, genetic counselling and evaluation of at-risk family members. Novel therapeutics, such as systemic antiangiogenic therapies, are actively being investigated. Although HHT is associated with increased morbidity, the appropriate screening and treatment of visceral AVMs, and the effective management of bleeding and anaemia, improves quality of life and overall survival.

A 3 week old infant presented with persistent hypoxaemia and was diagnosed with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Her family history was positive for hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia. She was treated successfully with coil embolotherapy at the age of 4 months. Transcatheter embolisation may be considered the primary treatment for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations in infancy.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^2d09e688]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, iron treatments remain essential, but we suggest there is a rationale to consider reduced strength iron tablets, closer to the recommended dietary allowance. More frequent administration of lower individual iron dosages may be helpful for individual HHT patients reporting that their nosebleeds increase after commencing or escalating iron treatments for anemia.

### Personalised stroke evaluation and management: tailoring individualised patient care for hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^dad17e2f]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Summary

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 5000–8000 individuals globally with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) affecting approximately 15%–50% of HHT patients. Ischaemic stroke is a known complication of PAVMs that affects ≤30% of patients with PAVMs. Studies have shown that patients with PAVMs have ischaemic stroke a decade earlier than routine stroke. The predominant mechanism of ischaemic stroke in HHT patients is paradoxical embolism due to PAVMs, but most HHT-related PAVMs are asymptomatic. Additionally, HHT is often underdiagnosed in patients and poses a challenge to physicians due to its rarity. We present a case of a patient with ischaemic stroke who was subsequently diagnosed with HHT and found to have a PAVM on further evaluation. This case highlights the importance of using an individualised patient-centred stroke evaluation and screening for PAVMs in patients who had a stroke with possible or suspected HHT and definite HHT.

### Iron deficiency responses and integrated compensations in patients according to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasiaandgenotypes [^66fa81a7]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

To provide further detail, HHT is a complex, heritable vasculopathy that is estimated to affect between one in 3,000-8,000 people, and is characterized by nosebleeds (epistaxis), mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). In hematological circles, the greatest concern is the management of iron deficiency anemia secondary to HHT bleeding. This was a focus of recent International HHT Guidelines, and is an active area of pharmaceutical development.HHT patients develop iron deficiency when dietary iron is inadequate to provide both their usual iron requirements, and to replace additional iron losses due to bleeding from the nose, the gastrointestinal tract, menstruation, blood donation, and other losses as quantified by the hemorrhage-adjusted iron requirement.Iron deficiency anemia can have significant consequences for HHT patients and is one of the strongest predictors of mortality in HHT.As for any anemia, iron deficiency anemia reduces arterial oxygen content necessitating higher cardiac output to maintain tissue oxygenation, and this is a particular problem in HHT where visceral AVM lower the systemic vascular resistance, also resulting in higher cardiac outputs. Additional complications associated with iron deficiency and its treatment are reported in HHT, in particular patients with hepatic or pulmonary AVM. Furthermore, in HHT, ongoing bleeds mean that conventional transfusional support algorithms need to be modified.PanHHT genotyping is identifying more variable expressivity in all genotypes than previously expected, including paucity of clinical signs in patients presenting by less conventional routes (e.g. organ-specific AVM rather than clinical genetics, hematology or ENT surgery; AVM/HHT rather than juvenile polyposis gastroenterology).That said, there is clear evidence that particular AVM distribution patterns differ between the major HHT genotypes,and that SMAD4 +/- patients can have additional phenotypes including juvenile polyposis and aortopathy.

### How I treat bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^53bc87c7]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) affects 1 in 5000 persons, making it the second most common inherited bleeding disorder worldwide. Telangiectatic bleeding, primarily causing recurrent epistaxis and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, is the most common and most important manifestation of this multisystem vascular disorder. HHT-associated bleeding results in substantial psychosocial morbidity and iron deficiency anemia that may be severe. Although there remain no regulatory agency-approved therapies for HHT, multiple large studies, including randomized controlled trials, have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of antifibrinolytics for mild-to-moderate bleeding manifestations and systemic antiangiogenic drugs including pomalidomide and bevacizumab for moderate-to-severe bleeding. This has led to a recent paradigm shift away from repetitive temporizing procedural management toward effective systemic medical therapeutics to treat bleeding in HHT. In this article, 4 patient cases are used to illustrate the most common and most challenging presentations of HHT-associated bleeding that hematologists are likely to encounter in daily practice. Built on a framework of published data and supported by extensive clinical experience, guidance is given for modern evidence-based approaches to antifibrinolytic therapy, antiangiogenic therapy, and iron deficiency anemia management across the HHT disease severity spectrum.

### Cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab therapy in the care of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^fd406a5c]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, although patients seen at an HHT Center of Excellence will be treated according to the international guidelines, only 30 such centers currently exist in North America, and the majority of community-based physicians remain less familiar with bevacizumab use in HHT or HHT itself.This lack of awareness, combined with underrecognition and delayed diagnosis, a substantial problem in HHT care, means that many patients currently experience worse outcomes and quality of life than is necessary, at an increased cost to all payers. Our work highlights the importance of educating both physicians and patients about the benefit of bevacizumab therapy in HHT, as well as providing a quantitative, value-based analysis for the inclusion of an HHT-specific bevacizumab indication for those making coverage decisions. Finally, our analysis further supports the value of decision science and cost-effectiveness studies in evaluating therapeutic options in multisystemic, rare disease spaces such as HHT, especially because patients would benefit before large randomized controlled trials can accrue and reach completion.

Because of its wide variety of symptoms ranging from epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding to less specific signs such as dyspnea from lung arteriovenous malformations or headaches, local and community physicians, including primary care doctors, cardiologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, and neurologists, should all be prepared to serve as primary points of contact and care for patients with HHT. As such, our results have broad implications for providers across the country, regardless of specialty. However, many are unfamiliar with the important, multisystem manifestations of the disease, which may lead to delayed screening, diagnosis, and initiation of guideline-directed therapies. Therefore, bridging this gap in knowledge while continuing to advocate for multispecialty, interdisciplinary collaboration in the treatment of patients with HHT remains of utmost importance in improving the overall quality of care.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM): 2023 update [^7016b329]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) occur in 30% to 50% of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic disease to complications resulting from the right to left shunting of blood through the PAVM such as paradoxical stroke, brain abscesses, hypoxemia, and cardiac failure. Radiology plays an important role both in the diagnosis and treatment of PAVM. Based on different clinical scenarios, the appropriate imaging study has been reviewed and is presented in this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

RESULTS

HHT Population Demographics

The 2012 survey was completed by 1,467 international respondents, with the majority of respondents residing in the USA. One hundred seventy‐nine had no suggestion of HHT–many had completed the survey as spouses, friends, or staff members. A total of 1,288 who stated they had HHT or were blood relatives of an HHT patient reported nosebleeds, telangiectasia in characteristic sites, and/or AVMs. Their median age was 55 years, and 732 (57.3%) were women. Six hundred one (46.6%) had pulmonary AVMs, 216 (16.8%) hepatic AVMs, 100 (8.5%) gastrointestinal HHT, and 105 (8.1%) cerebral AVMs, rates comparable to those reported in other HHT series. Nosebleeds affected 1,262 of 1,288 (98%), including 523 (40.6%) at least once daily, a further 405 (31.4%) weekly, and 183 (14.2%) at least once per.

Of these 1,288 respondents, 837 (65.0%) had used iron tablets, 273 (21.2%) had received iron infusions, and 396 (30.8%) had received blood transfusions. One hundred five of 1,288 (8.1%) had been transfused on at least 10 different occasions. The majority of the 396 receiving blood transfusions had also received iron tablets (364 of 396, 91.9%). Similarly, 258 of 273 (94.5%) iron infusion users had received iron tablets, including 220 who answered a question about concurrent usage. When iron infusions were commenced, more than half of these respondents had their iron tablets stopped (137 of 220, 62.3%). Smaller proportions continued using iron tablets (92 of 220, 42%), or described varying patterns of cessation (13, 5.4%).

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-AAFP (...) [^2137c09d]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

What is hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder of the blood vessels. It is also called Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. People with HHT have abnormal blood vessels that tend to burst open and bleed. Who gets it. HHT affects men and women from all racial and ethnic groups. The abnormal gene comes from one parent who has HHT. If a parent has HHT, his or her children have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene and developing HHT. It is possible to have HHT with symptoms so mild that you don't notice them. How can I tell if I have it. HHT is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms caused by abnormal vessels. These vessels have a greater chance of rupturing and bleeding compared with normal blood vessels. They can occur in the nose, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and brain. HHT can be diagnosed with genetic tests.

If the gene is found in one family member who is known to have HHT, other family members can be tested to see if they have HHT. What are the symptoms. About nine out of 10 people with HHT have nosebleeds that keep coming back. These can happen every day or only once in a while. The bleeding may be light or heavy. Abnormal vessels in the stomach or intestines can cause black or bloody stools or anemia. In the lungs, they can cause shortness of breath and possibly strokes if they become large. There is a higher risk of bleeding during pregnancy. In the brain, abnormal vessels can be dangerous if they bleed. Often they don't cause warning symptoms, so anyone with known or suspected HHT should be screened. Some people with HHT have abnormal vessels in the liver, but these don't usually cause problems in most people. No one with HHT has all of the signs and symptoms. Most symptoms vary, even within a family. A parent may have bad nosebleeds, but no abnormal vessels in an internal organ.

Yet, his or her child may have a nosebleed only rarely but abnormal vessels in one or more internal organs. Doctors can't predict how likely someone is to have one of the hidden, internal abnormal vessels based on how many nosebleeds or skin telangiectasias they have. How is it treated. There is no way to stop the abnormal blood vessels from forming, but most can be treated if they cause problems. Using a humidifier or ointments in the nose can help nosebleeds. Laser therapy or other surgeries can also help. Abnormal blood vessels in the lungs or brain are treated by embolization, which closes off the blood vessel to keep it from rupturing. Telangiectasias of the skin can be treated with laser therapy if they bleed often. Who should be screened for HHT. Anyone with a family history of HHT should be checked for the disease.

If someone in a family has the disease, other family members should see their doctor, who can help arrange for genetic testing. The symptoms of HHT can be mild, so even family members without symptoms should be screened. Where can I get more information.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^638cbb4c]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) diagnostic criteria and epidemiology—the disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable penetrance and occurs in 1 in 5000 to 18,000 individuals; the Curacao criteria include recurrent epistaxis, multiple telangiectasia of typical sites, arteriovenous malformations in major organs, and a first-degree relative with HHT; the presence of ≥ 3 criteria is a “definite” diagnosis, 2 criteria are “possible or suspected,” and fewer than 2 criteria makes HHT unlikely; identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ACVRL1, ENG, GDF2, and SMAD4 establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive; nosebleeds from telangiectasias are the main symptom in > 90% of patients with HHT and often increase with age, leading to anemia, need for iron and blood transfusions, extensive medical expenses, and a significantly reduced QOL.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: diagnosis and management from the hematologist's perspective [^4cdef84f]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations

Patients with HHT vary in disease severity and bleeding complications. This variability is likely attributed to other genes, inflammation, and the environment that modify the primary genetic defect. Common AVM complications include epistaxis, GI bleeding, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, brain abscess, high output heart failure, and liver failure.

It is suggested that certain mutated genes in HHT may be associated with specific clinical manifestations. ENG mutations may be associated with more pulmonary and brain AVMs; ACVRL1 with more liver AVMs, spinal AVMs, epistaxis and pulmonary hypertension; and MADH4 with juvenile colonic polyposis.

Pulmonary AVMs

Pulmonary AVMs will develop in at least 50% of HHT patients and are more common in HHT1 than HHT2. Since approximately 70% of pulmonary AVMs are due to HHT, the diagnosis of HHT1 should be considered in all patients with pulmonary AVMs. Migraines are quite frequent in patients with pulmonary AVMs.Between 5 and 30% of patients may have pulmonary AVMs that may be asymptomatic or present as hemoptysis, dyspnea, hypoxemia or digital clubbing. Brain abscesses and stroke may occur following “dirty” procedures (e.g. dental cleaning) if bacteria can bypass the pulmonary filtration system via right to left shunting from AVMs.Polycythemia may occur if there is significant AV shunting. The locus designated as HHT3 appears to predispose to pulmonary AVM formation.

Liver AVMs

Liver AVMs may be seen in up to 70% of patients with HHT. HHT2 appears to be associated with more liver AVMs. Although often asymptomatic, the shunting of blood through these AVMs in the liver can precipitate high-output heart failure, liver failure, or portal hypertension.

### Personalised stroke evaluation and management: tailoring individualised patient care for hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^d8b38fe9]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1 
Graphical representation of the vascular complications of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, including cerebral arteriovenous malformations (A), skin and mucous telangiectasias (B), pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (C) and hepatic arteriovenous malformations (D), illustrated by Minaanandag on the Fiverr application.

A PAVM is an abnormal connection between a pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein that bypasses the normal pulmonary capillary bed which may lead to an intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt in the setting of low resistance and high blood flow. If untreated, these malformed connections can lead to various complications, such as cerebral abscess, stroke, paradoxical emboli and hypoxaemia.A strong association has been documented between a single PAVM with a feeding artery (FA) diameter exceeding 3 mm and neurological complications, with increased prevalence in patients with multiple PAVMs.This suggests that a greater number of malformations increases the predisposition for paradoxical embolisation. Acute ischaemic stroke is a known complication of HHT that affects ≤30% of patients with PAVMs.Overall, PAVMs are estimated to be prevalent in 15%–50% of HHT patients and are often symptomatic, and HHT eventually manifests in roughly 80%–90% of patients who present with PAVMs.Embolisation of PAVMs has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment.We present a case of acute ischaemic stroke secondary to paradoxical embolism in an HHT patient in order to discuss the importance of an individualised patient-centred stroke evaluation.

### British thoracic society clinical statement on pulmonary arteriovenous malformations [^fea8372a]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are structurally abnormal vascular communications that provide a continuous right-to-left shunt between pulmonary arteries and veins. Their importance stems from the risks they pose (>1 in 4 patients will have a paradoxical embolic stroke, abscess or myocardial infarction while life-threatening haemorrhage affects 1 in 100 women in pregnancy), opportunities for risk prevention, surprisingly high prevalence and under-appreciation, thus representing a challenging condition for practising healthcare professionals. The driver for the current Clinical Statement was the plethora of new data since previous hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) guidelines generated in 2006 and a systematic Cochrane Review for PAVM embolisation in 2011. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) identified key areas in which there is now evidence to drive a change in practice. Due to the paucity of data in children, this Statement focused on adults over 16 years. The Statement spans the management of PAVMs already known to be present (interventional and medical), screening and diagnosis (for PAVMs and HHT) and follow-up of patients following a first diagnosis, intervention or negative screen for PAVMs. The Good Practice Points (in bold) were generated for a target audience of general respiratory, medical and specialist clinicians and were approved by the BTS Standards of Care Committee, before formal peer review and public consultation. The Statement spans embolisation treatment, accessory medical management and issues related to the likelihood of underlying HHT.

### Lobar embolization for treatment of diffuse pulmonary arteriovenous malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a case report [^a1fbfed4]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal communications between pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins that are most commonly associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The authors report a case of lobar artery embolization for the treatment of diffuse PAVMs in a patient with HHT who was experiencing recurrent transient ischemic attacks despite anticoagulation and multiple previous embolizations. The right lower lobar and interlobar arteries were embolized to achieve complete occlusion of multiple PAVMs in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe. In conclusion, lobar embolization can be considered for the relief of neurologic symptoms in patients with diffuse PAVMs.

### Prevalence and predictors of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary-malformation arteriovenous malformation syndrome among children with neurovascular malformations [^3cd82eb7]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the prevalence and predictors of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and capillary-malformation arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) syndrome among children with no prior personal or family history of these diseases who presented with an arteriovenous shunt lesion.

Study Design

A retrospective chart review was completed on patients aged 0 through 21 years with arteriovenous shunt lesions evaluated at our Cerebrovascular Center. Diagnosis of definite or suspected HHT or CM-AVM was based on clinical features and genetic testing. Associations between final diagnosis and type and number of lesions, epistaxis, telangiectasias, CM, and pulmonary AVMs were assessed.

Results

Eighty-nine patients were included. Thirteen (14.6%) had definite HHT, 11 (12.4%) suspected HHT, and 4 (4.5%) definite CM-AVM. Having ≥2 episodes of epistaxis/year and ≥ 2 sites with telangiectasias were each associated with definite HHT (P < .001). Having ≥ 2 CM was associated with definite CM-AVM (P < .001). Pulmonary AVM was associated with increased odds of having definite HHT (OR = 6.3, 95% CI: 1.2-33.4). Multiple lesions (OR = 24.5, 95% CI: 4.5-134.8) and arteriovenous fistulas (OR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.9-20.3) each increased the likelihood of having definite HHT or CM-AVM. Genetic testing was positive in 31% of patients tested.

Conclusions

We recommend that children with neurovascular shunt lesions be offered genetic testing and undergo further evaluation for HHT and CM-AVM. Awareness and early diagnosis of these conditions is a critical step toward improving long-term outcomes and preventing disease-associated complications.

### A rare cause of hepatic arteriovenous fistula: hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^3960d948]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old man, who provided consent for this publication, experiencing frequent nosebleeds was diagnosed with anemia 10 years ago. Physical examination revealed the presence of dilated capillaries in the nasal mucosa. Laboratory tests indicated a hemoglobin level of 63 g/L and a prolonged prothrombin time of 14.3 seconds. Maximum projection density on abdominal computed tomography angiography revealed a significant thickening of the celiac trunk, common hepatic artery, and innominate hepatic artery, with a tortuous and malformed course (A). Cinematic rendering and volume rendering revealed a notable thickening of the inferior vena cava. The portal vein was markedly thickened and its course was tortuous and malformed (B /Cover). Digital subtraction angiography revealed a marked thickening of the hepatic arteries and the formation of a fistula between the left hepatic artery and vein. Chest computed tomography scan also showed a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in the patient's left lung. The patient was treated with spring coil interventional embolization of the left hepatic artery-left hepatic vein fistula (C). The patient symptoms were relieved after interventional treatment.

Owing to recurrent epistaxis, skin and mucosal telangiectasia, and multiple hepatic venous malformations, the diagnostic criteria for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a rare vascular disorder caused by multiple genetic abnormalities, were determined. Treatment depends on the organs involved and the severity of the symptoms; affected patients may have involvement of the lungs, brain, gastrointestinal, and hepatic systems. Interventional embolization is effective against visceral vascular malformations and bleeding in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The interventional therapy aimed to prevent bleeding and right-sided heart failure, and decrease cardiac output, decreases clinical symptoms such as weakness and fatigue in patients.

### Imaging of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^53adfd44]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

This pictorial review is based on our experience of the follow-up of 120 patients at our multidisciplinary center for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Rendu-Osler-Weber disease or HHT is a multiorgan autosomal dominant disorder with high penetrance, characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasis, and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The research on gene mutations is fundamental and family screening by clinical examination, chest X-ray, research of pulmonary shunting, and abdominal color Doppler sonography is absolutely necessary. The angioarchitecture of pulmonary AVMs can be studied by unenhanced multidetector computed tomography; however, all other explorations of liver, digestive bowels, or brain require administration of contrast media. Magnetic resonance angiography is helpful for central nervous system screening, in particular for the spinal cord, but also for pulmonary, hepatic, and pelvic AVMs. Knowledge of the multiorgan involvement of HHT, mechanism of complications, and radiologic findings is fundamental for the correct management of these patients.

### A case report of acute myocardial infarction with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^0d6e34d8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) affecting the lungs, liver, and brain. Owing to its rarity and diagnostic challenges, early identification is often elusive. Underdiagnosis and prolonged diagnostic delays are prevalent. Here, we present the case of a 63-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Subsequently, he underwent placement of a drug-eluting stent in the right coronary artery (RCA). However, recurrent postoperative epistaxis resulted in severe anemia, prompting further investigation leading to the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia through comprehensive medical history and genetic testing. Future studies are warranted to evaluate reperfusion strategies in HHT patients presenting with myocardial infarction.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: a review of 76 cases [^daec2670]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia has long been viewed as a rare condition. Recent evidence indicates that the disorder is more frequent than previously thought. Recalcitrant epistaxis is a salient feature of this disease, and the otolaryngologist is often called on to make the diagnosis and guide the primary management of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Wider recognition of this condition, awareness of the natural history and associated findings, appropriate workup and screening for arteriovenous malformations (lungs, brain, liver), and knowledge of appropriate interventions can help avoid the considerable morbidity associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Methods

Records of patients treated by the senior author (S.M.S.) for hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia from 1993 to 2000 were reviewed.

Results

Seventy-six patients were identified, 98% of whom had epistaxis as their presenting complaint, with 75% having a family history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The severity of epistaxis varied in the patients: 66% had mild, 21% moderate, and 13% severe epistaxis. Sixty-four percent of patients had no transfusions, 25% had 1 to 10 transfusions, and 11% of patients had more than 10 transfusions. Complications of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia were documented in 30% of patients. Screening for arteriovenous malformations was performed in only 34% of patients. Eighty-two percent of patients received a variable number of Nd:YAG laser treatments.

Conclusions

The study presents the largest retrospective review of patients treated for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia by a single otolaryngologist. The importance of a multidisciplinary approach facilitated by the otolaryngologist for evaluation of concomitant complications and morbidity (arteriovenous malformations) from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is demonstrated. An algorithm for controlling the epistaxis is presented.

### PAVM embolization: an update [^4f43380e]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are most often associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Untreated, they represent a serious threat due to paradoxical embolization that may manifest as stroke or brain abscess. PAVM treatment is challenging even in the most experienced hands.

Conclusion

Fortunately, new tools and techniques are emerging that may improve the outcomes associated with embolization and reduce some of the risks associated with treating these high-flow lesions. New trends in overall PAVM management are also developing.

Iron deficiency/iron deficiency anemia

Iron deficiency/iron deficiency anemia is common in HHT. The underlying cause of iron deficiency in this patient population is the chronic blood loss from telangiectasias (e.g. nasal mucosa or intestinal tract) leading to iron store depletion. Approximately 5% of patients with HHT may have severe hemorrhages from epistaxis and/or intestinal AVMs. This consequently leads to a microcytic or normocytic anemia and symptoms of fatigue. Cardiopulmonary complications as described above can develop.

Other events

Though other events are not frequently reported, they include thromboembolic disease, pulmonary hypertension, liver disease, high-risk pregnancies, and spinal events. There is a 1% risk of mortality during pregnancy due to hemorrhage from cerebral or pulmonary AVMs.Patients are also affected socially and psychologically due to uncontrolled bleeding episodes. They commonly face difficulties with work, travel, social phobias, isolation, anxiety, and depressive disorders.

Juvenile polyposis

Juvenile polyposis is a rare association with HHT and results from a germline mutation in MADH4.This condition is also an autosomal dominant disorder. Mutations in MADH4 may manifest phenotypically as juvenile polyposis alone, HHT alone, or the combined syndrome of JP-HHT.The polyposis is best characterized by numerous hamartomatous polyps (i.e. 5-100) that are typically benign, but some patients may develop gastric or colorectal cancer, and so screening is encouraged. Patients with JP-HHT associated with MADH4 mutations are at an increased risk for early colorectal cancer.These patients may also have thoracic aorta dilation.

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may be the only clinical criterion present in genetically confirmed hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^a061a504]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are capillary-free vascular communications between pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins, resulting in an anatomical intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt.PAVM prevalence was estimated by general population screening thoracic CT imaging at 38 per 100 000 individuals in Japan (95% CI 18 to 76), corresponding to 1/2631 (95% CI 1/1315 to 1/5555).Although this seems high for respiratory clinical practice, the majority of PAVMs are asymptomatic and undiagnosed,despite continuous right-to-left shunting, which impairs gas exchange and places individuals at high risk of neurological complications from paradoxical emboli.Neurological risks are present whether or not the individual has symptoms from the PAVM(s).Details of appropriate management of patients with PAVMs are outlined in recent British Thoracic Societyand Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europestatements.

3 Defining the Goals of Treatment

Research initiatives in HHT have been impeded by an absence of standardized severity definitions, outcomes criteria, and terminology. The manuscript by Al‐Samkari et al. proposes consensus‐based standardized terminology and definitions for outcomes and severity classification for bleeding and anemia in HHT to improve consistency in clinical trial design, aid therapeutic treatment guideline development, and provide a framework for regulatory agencies. The panel consisted of international expert HHT clinician‐investigators from the Global Research and Medical Advisory Board (GRMAB) of the Cure HHT foundation, external experts in HHT and bleeding disorders, lived experience experts, and patient advocates.

The manuscript aims to standardize the goals of treatment, bleeding severity classification, as well as specific measures and outcomes pertaining to epistaxis, hematologic measures, health‐related quality of life, and bleeding severity classification.

The consensus on the primary therapeutic goal is to reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of HHT‐related epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding. These endpoints are clinically meaningful and lend themselves to standardized measurement in clinical trials.

Secondary treatment goals include reducing other HHT‐related bleeding sources (e.g. visceral and mucocutaneous), correcting iron deficiency and anemia, minimizing red cell transfusion and iron infusion requirements, and improving health‐related quality of life. Importantly, these outcomes must be achieved with minimal treatment‐related toxicity, particularly in patients with less severe bleeding phenotypes.

The panel also identified emerging areas for investigation. The impact and confounding effect of heavy menstrual bleeding, reported by the majority of women with HHT, warrants systematic evaluation in future trials. Additionally, therapies that promote vascular remodeling may offer disease‐modifying potential by targeting telangiectasia and visceral AVMs. While these endpoints remain exploratory, their inclusion in clinical studies could provide valuable insights into long‐term therapeutic impact.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pregnancy [^01bfec8a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare but life-threatening disease characterized by telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations in different organs. When it is associated with pregnancy, this disease causes significant morbidity and mortality.

Case

We describe the pregnancy course of a primigravida with severe hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Her antepartum course was complicated by reduced pulmonary function, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. An amniocentesis was performed at the 32nd week for hydramnios. Because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern, she was delivered by cesarean of a female infant. At the beginning of the postpartum period, her pulmonary function spontaneously improved, and mother and female infant were discharged in good condition.

Conclusion

Pregnancy is complicated in women with severe hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, but can be managed successfully.

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in children [^76e60a83]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are rare abnormalities observed mainly in children with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). A majority of patients are asymptomatic at the time of detection. However, complications such as hypoxemia, stroke, cerebral abscess and massive hemoptysis can arise if larger PAVMs remain untreated. Larger PAVMs are usually managed successfully with embolization, although reperfusion of PAVMs have been reported post procedure. Early screening for PAVMs is recommended in asymptomatic children with HHT or those at risk for HHT. Longer term surveillance is also essential, to enable timely identification and management of PAVMs.
