## Question

would a shorter woman mean an a1c of 5.6 would be high for her?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an A1c of 5.6% would be considered high for a shorter woman, and specifically whether height modifies A1c interpretation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard diagnostic thresholds for A1c and what 5.6% means. Then, I should verify which non-glycemic factors are known to alter A1c independent of glucose and check if height appears on that list. Next, I will examine evidence on the A1c–glucose relationship across subgroups to see if stature modifies it. After that, I should review literature linking height with diabetes risk or with glycemic control in childhood to avoid conflating association with causation. Finally, I will apply these findings to the clinical scenario and confirm if any exceptions apply, such as anemia, kidney disease, or hemoglobin variants that might distort A1c readings [^116uj2d1] [^114gKbcS] [^115GNwpN] [^112MpBcB].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic categories, because if I misremember the cut points, I could give the wrong answer. Wait, is 5.6% within the "prediabetes" range? I should double-check before concluding. Hold on, I should verify against ADA guidance: prediabetes is defined as A1c 5.7–6.4%, and diabetes at A1c ≥ 6.5%, so an A1c of 5.6% is below the prediabetes threshold and is considered normal by diagnostic criteria, although risk is continuous and begins to rise even from 5.5% in cohort data [^116K7P11] [^113Hz7at] [^116hxmN2].

> Next, I should review which factors can make A1c higher or lower for the same mean glucose, because if height were one of them, interpretation would change. Let me think about the established nonglycemic influences: variation in red blood cell lifespan and turnover, anemia and iron deficiency, kidney disease, hemoglobin variants, and demographic effects such as race and age can all shift A1c independent of glycemia; however, adult height is not listed among clinically meaningful modifiers of A1c interpretation in major reviews or guidelines, so I should be careful not to infer a height effect where none is documented [^1125RrvJ] [^116HzUgf] [^112MpBcB] [^115GNwpN] [^1174knuW] [^1144AW1A] [^116C9TmM] [^117NBcc8].

> I will now examine whether the core A1c–average glucose equation varies by body size. The ADAG study defined a robust linear relationship between A1c and average glucose and found it consistent across pre-specified subgroups by age, sex, diabetes type, race/ethnicity, and smoking status; height was not identified as a modifying factor in that relationship, and no standard source lists stature as a determinant of A1c calibration, so height should not change the interpretation of a measured 5.6% in an adult [^114gKbcS] [^111XYuEL].

> But wait, what about studies linking height and diabetes or growth and glycemia; could that be a confounder? Let me reconsider the directionality. Shorter adult stature has been associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes and adverse glycemic traits in some cohorts, indicating that height can be a risk marker, not that it changes the biological meaning of a given A1c value. Conversely, in childhood type 1 diabetes, poor glycemic control has been associated with reduced adult height, which is the reverse direction of effect and again does not imply that shorter height alters A1c assay interpretation in adults [^11221R61] [^116Hqu4z] [^115616So] [^116UuW4B].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm there is no hidden exception where smaller body size alters erythrocyte kinetics and thereby A1c. I need to ensure I'm not missing guidance on special populations. Reviews emphasizing variability in erythrocyte lifespan and ADA recommendations on evaluating A1c–glucose discordance do not identify stature as a source of systematic bias; instead they point clinicians to look for anemia, renal disease, hemoglobinopathies, or assay issues when A1c does not fit the glucose profile, so height per se is not an interpretive modifier [^112MpBcB] [^115GNwpN] [^111zru9N] [^1125RrvJ].

> Applying this to the specific question, I should double-check my conclusion. For an adult woman who is shorter, an A1c of 5.6% is not high by diagnostic criteria and remains below the prediabetes threshold; individual risk is a continuum and may warrant lifestyle counseling if other risk factors exist, but height does not change the cut points or the A1c–glucose relationship. If her fingerstick or CGM glucose profile seems discordant with the laboratory A1c, then I would check for iron deficiency, kidney disease, hemoglobin variants, or assay issues and consider alternative markers such as glycated albumin or CGM metrics, but none of these steps hinge on height alone [^116K7P11] [^116hxmN2] [^1174knuW] [^111jEtNG] [^111zru9N].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. No, being a shorter woman does not make an A1c of 5.6% "high", because standard ADA thresholds apply regardless of stature and the validated A1c–glucose calibration does not include height as a modifier; 5.6% is below the prediabetes range, with recognition that diabetes risk increases gradually across the mid-5% range in population studies [^114gKbcS] [^111XYuEL] [^116K7P11] [^116hxmN2].

---

No, shorter stature does not make an A1c of 5.6% high; A1c thresholds are **height-independent** and reflect average glycemia over ~3 months [^114gKbcS]. An A1c of 5.6% is at the **upper end of normal** and indicates slightly increased diabetes risk [^116hxmN2]; height does not alter its interpretation [^111NptJS]. Clinical context and risk factors — not stature — should guide follow-up [^113Hz7at].

---

## A1c thresholds and clinical interpretation

The ADA defines **A1c categories** as follows:

| **A1C category** | **A1C range** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal | < 5.7% | Low diabetes risk |
| Prediabetes | 5.7–6.4% | Increased diabetes risk |
| Diabetes | ≥ 6.5% | Diagnostic for diabetes |

---

An A1c of 5.6% is just below the prediabetes threshold and **considered normal**, though at the high end of normal and it may indicate a slightly increased future diabetes risk [^116hxmN2] [^111NptJS].

---

## Relationship between height and A1c levels

There is **no direct physiological relationship** between height and A1c; A1c reflects average blood glucose over approximately three months [^114gKbcS]. Factors influencing A1c include age, sex, race/ethnicity, and certain medical conditions, but height is not a recognized determinant [^1144AW1A] [^115GNwpN].

---

## Clinical implications of A1c 5.6% in shorter women

Although height does not directly influence A1c interpretation, shorter stature has been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in some studies [^11221R61] [^113KRzye]; this association does not alter how A1c is interpreted. An A1c of 5.6% in a woman of shorter stature **remains within the normal range**, and may warrant closer monitoring given the slightly increased diabetes risk [^116hxmN2].

---

## Individualized clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should consider individual risk factors such as age, family history, BMI, and lifestyle habits; height alone **does not necessitate a different interpretation** of A1c levels. Clinicians should focus on comprehensive risk assessment and individualized care plans rather than height-specific adjustments [^116EALdB].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

An A1c of 5.6% is **not considered high** for a shorter woman, as height does not directly influence A1c interpretation. Clinicians should consider individual risk factors and provide appropriate counseling and monitoring. Regular follow-up and lifestyle modifications may be recommended if additional risk factors are present.

Categories of increased risk for diabetes (prediabetes):

In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal. These persons were defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG levels 100–125 mg/dl [5.6–6.9 mmol/l]) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2-hour PG values in the OGTT of 140–199 mg/dl [7.8–11.0 mmol/l]). It should be noted that the World Health Organization (WHO) and a number of other diabetes organizations define the cutoff for IFG at 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l).

Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but as risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.

Several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^114gKbcS]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The A1c assay, expressed as the percent of hemoglobin that is glycated, measures chronic glycemia and is widely used to judge the adequacy of diabetes treatment and adjust therapy. Day-to-day management is guided by self-monitoring of capillary glucose concentrations (milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter). We sought to define the mathematical relationship between A1c and average glucose (AG) levels and determine whether A1c could be expressed and reported as AG in the same units as used in self-monitoring.

- **Research design and methods**: A total of 507 subjects, including 268 patients with type 1 diabetes, 159 with type 2 diabetes, and 80 nondiabetic subjects from 10 international centers, was included in the analyses. A1c levels obtained at the end of 3 months and measured in a central laboratory were compared with the AG levels during the previous 3 months. AG was calculated by combining weighted results from at least 2 days of continuous glucose monitoring performed four times, with seven-point daily self-monitoring of capillary (fingerstick) glucose performed at least 3 days per week.

- **Results**: Approximately 2,700 glucose values were obtained by each subject during 3 months. Linear regression analysis between the A1c and AG values provided the tightest correlations (AG(mg/dl) = 28.7 x A1c - 46.7, R² = 0.84, P < 0.0001), allowing calculation of an estimated average glucose (eAG) for A1c values. The linear regression equations did not differ significantly across subgroups based on age, sex, diabetes type, race/ethnicity, or smoking status.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: A systematic review [^116hxmN2]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

This systematic review of prospective studies confirms a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes risk. Individuals with an A1C value of ≥ 6.0% face a very high risk of developing clinically defined diabetes in the near future, with 5-year risks ranging from 25 to 50% and relative risks frequently 20 times higher compared with A1C < 5%. However, persons with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% also have a substantially increased risk of diabetes, with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%. The level of A1C appears to have a continuous association with diabetes risk even below the 5.5% threshold, although the absolute levels of incidence in that group are considerably lower.

In light of recent interest in adopting A1C for the diagnosis of diabetes, these findings may be useful to guide policies related to the classification and diagnosis of individuals at high risk of developing diabetes prior to preventive intervention. The progression of diabetes risk with A1C is similar in magnitude and shape to what has been previously described for fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour glucose, suggesting that A1C may serve as a relevant indicator of future risk. The ideal decision regarding which A1C cut point to use for intervention should ultimately be based on the capacity for benefit as shown in clinical trials. Our findings suggest that an A1C range of 5.5 to 6.5% will capture a large portion of people at high risk, and if interventions are applied to this target population, it may lead to significant absolute risk reduction.

### Glycemic control and adult height: A nationwide Swedish cohort study on childhood type 1 diabetes [^116Hqu4z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

To assess adult height outcomes across levels of glycemic control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, as well as to investigate the impact of sex, age at disease onset, and timing of glycemic control in relation to puberty, this population-based Swedish cohort study collected data from the National Diabetes Register. Data on glycemic control and height were obtained from specialist healthcare visits of all individuals with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes.

Using linear and logistic regression, the study compared suboptimal (HbA1c 53–75 mmol/mol [7.0–9.0%]) and poor (HbA1c > 75 mmol/mol [> 9.0%]) glycemic control to optimal (HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol [< 7.0%]) glycemic control in relation to final adult height and the risk of short stature.

Poor glycemic control was associated with lower final adult height (-2.91 cm [95% CI -3.48, -2.33] for males; -1.83 cm [-2.42, -1.23] for females) as well as a higher risk of short stature in males (odds ratio 1.90 [1.07, 3.35]) but not in females (0.73 [0.36, 1.51]). For females, adult height was only lower among those with type 1 diabetes since before puberty and if the poor glycemic control occurred before puberty. For males, adult height was lower irrespective of their age at diabetes onset, but only if they had poor glycemic control during or after puberty.

Poor glycemic control after the onset of type 1 diabetes, compared to optimal control, is associated with lower adult height in both males and females. The prepubertal period seems to be more critical for females than males.

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^111cT5v7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In order to prevent β-cell loss and late complications, the time for aggressive treatment should be at the very early stages of the disease. The goal is to aim for A1C levels of 6.5%, if possible, with a drug that prevents acceleration of β-cell loss and dysfunction. It should not cause weight gain or hypoglycemia, and it should have a large safety margin and justified cost. The midway stepwise approach in the treatment of newly diagnosed patients is essential.

### Racial differences in the relationship of glucose concentrations and hemoglobin A1c levels [^1144AW1A]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Debate exists as to whether the higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels observed in Black persons compared to White persons are due to worse glycemic control or racial differences in the glycation of hemoglobin.

- **Objective**: To determine whether a racial difference exists in the relationship of mean glucose and HbA1c.

- **Design**: Prospective, 12-week observational study.

- **Setting**: 10 diabetes centers in the United States.

- **Participants**: 104 Black persons and 104 White persons aged 8 years or older who had type 1 diabetes for at least 2 years and had an HbA1c level of 6.0% to 12.0%.

- **Measurements**: Mean glucose concentration, measured by using continuous glucose monitoring and compared by race with HbA1c, glycated albumin, and fructosamine values.

- **Results**: The mean HbA1c level was 9.1% in Black persons and 8.3% in White persons. For a given HbA1c level, the mean glucose concentration was significantly lower in Black persons than in White persons (P = 0.013), which was reflected in mean HbA1c values in Black persons being 0.4 percentage points (95% CI, 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points) higher than those in White persons for a given mean glucose concentration. In contrast, no significant racial differences were found in the relationship of glycated albumin and fructosamine levels with the mean glucose concentration (P > 0.20 for both comparisons).

- **Limitation**: There were too few participants with HbA1c levels less than 6.5% to generalize the results to such individuals.

- **Conclusion**: On average, HbA1c levels overestimate the mean glucose concentration in Black persons compared to White persons.

### Management of type 2 diabetes: Are we making progress [^112bvCUs]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Glycated hemoglobin, abbreviated as HbA1c, is a key marker used to assess long-term glucose control in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have highlighted both progress and ongoing challenges in managing this condition. Various treatment strategies have been developed, focusing on maintaining target HbA1c levels to reduce the risk of complications. Despite advancements, many patients continue to struggle with achieving optimal glycemic control, indicating the need for continued innovation and education in diabetes management.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116uj2d1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically concerning glycemic targets, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend setting an HbA1c goal of less than 7% (less than 53 mmol/mol) for many nonpregnant adult patients with diabetes who do not experience severe hypoglycemia or frequent hypoglycemia affecting health or quality of life.

### Empirically establishing blood glucose targets to achieve HbA1c goals [^115GpKbF]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Recent diabetes management guidelines specify that treatment goals should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and duration of disease. The American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommends a goal of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol), while the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) suggests a goal of ≤ 6.5% (≤ 48 mmol/mol) in otherwise healthy patients. Although HbA1c is the target, it is measured once every 3 months. Day-to-day self-management of diabetes to achieve and maintain the individualized target HbA1c is facilitated by self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values, especially in patients treated with insulin.

- **Recommendation of professional bodies**: To achieve the recommended HbA1c goals, the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the AACE, and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have recommended SMBG targets, the origins of which are obscure but appear to be based predominantly on expert opinion. As a result, there is wide variation in the recommended SMBG targets to achieve an HbA1c < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol), and there is little guidance to help clinicians and patients achieve other individualized targets.

A study was conducted to determine the average fasting, postprandial, and bedtime glucose values, based on empirical data, to achieve and maintain target HbA1c levels in the outpatient setting.

### Physiologic concepts that may revise the interpretation and implications of HbA1C in clinical medicine: An American perspective [^112MpBcB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

HbA1c, a routinely used integrated measure of glycemic control, is traditionally thought to be equivalent to mean blood glucose in hematologically normal individuals. Particularly as the methodology of measuring HbA1c has been standardized, clinical decisions dependent on mean blood glucose are often predominantly made based on the interpretation of measured HbA1c.

In this commentary, however, now that a more routine method of measuring red cell lifespan has been developed, evidence is presented that the relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose is influenced by variation in red blood cell survival, even in the hematologically normal. This variation has consequences for the appropriate interpretation of HbA1c in diverse clinical conditions such as the diagnosis of diabetes and the management of diabetes in chronic kidney disease.

### Adult stature and diabetes complications in patients with type 1 diabetes: The FinnDiane study and the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [^113KRzye]. Diabetes (2009). High credibility.

Of the eligible 1,246 patients, 666 were men and 580 were women, and 96.8% were white. At baseline, the mean age was 28.7 ± 5.7 years (range 18–39), duration of diabetes 5.8 ± 4.3 years, BMI 23.6 ± 2.8 kg/m², and A1C 8.8 ± 1.5%. The mean height was 178.7 ± 7.1 cm in men and 164.9 ± 6.1 cm in women. The mean age at the onset of diabetes was 22.9 ± 7.2 years, with less than 18 years in 25.6% of the patients.

Short stature was associated with a lower age at the onset of diabetes, a longer duration of diabetes, and a higher insulin dose per body weight. At baseline, stature was not associated with renal status. However, none of the patients had nephropathy because baseline nephropathy was an exclusion criterion in the DCCT. At close-out, 8.4% of patients within the lowest quartile of height had developed nephropathy class 4–6 compared with 3.1% in the top three quartiles (P < 0.001). In patients diagnosed with diabetes after the age of 18 years, the corresponding proportions were 5.4% and 2.5% (P = 0.039), respectively. In a Cox regression model for progression to nephropathy class 4–6, patients within the lowest quartile of height had a 2.39-fold higher risk of nephropathy when adjusting for conventional risk factors and the duration of diabetes before the age of 18 years. Omitting the total duration of diabetes from the final model did not change the main results.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113eP4Uv]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 1, particularly regarding glycemic targets, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2025 guidelines suggest aiming for HbA1c levels lower than the standard goal of 7% (53 mmol/mol) as a viable and potentially beneficial option. This approach should be pursued if it can be implemented safely without causing frequent or severe hypoglycemia or other adverse treatment effects. Such decisions should be based on the healthcare professional's judgment and the patient with diabetes's preferences.

### Hba1c and mean glucose derived from short-term continuous glucose monitoring assessment do not correlate in patients with Hba1c > 8 [^114CFSYe]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Optimum therapy for patients with diabetes depends on both acute and long-term changes in plasma glucose, generally assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. However, the correlation between HbA1c and circulating glucose has not been fully determined. Therefore, we carefully examined this correlation when glucose levels were assessed by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

- **Methods**: Fifty-one patients (70% female, 30% male) were examined; among them were 28 with type 1 diabetes and 23 with type 2 diabetes. Clinically determined HbA1c levels were compared with blood glucose determined by CGM during a short time period.

- **Results**: Changes in HbA1c levels up to 8.0% showed a clear and statistically strong correlation (R = 0.6713; P < 0.0001), whereas no correlation was observed at HbA1c levels > 8.0%.

- **Conclusion**: Short-term CGM appears to be a good clinical indicator of long-term glucose control (HbA1c levels); however, caution should be taken while interpreting CGM data from patients with HbA1c levels > 8.0%. Over- or underestimation of the actual mean glucose from CGM data could potentially increase the risks of inappropriate treatment. As such, our results indicate that a more accurate analysis of CGM data might be useful to adequately tailor clinical treatments.

### Do race and ethnicity impact hemoglobin A1c independent of glycemia [^115P6fnB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is widely used as an index of mean glycemia, a measure of risk for the development of diabetes complications, and a measure of the quality of diabetes care. Emerging literature suggests that, although HbA1c levels change little over time within persons without diabetes, they vary considerably among individuals, suggesting that factors other than glycemia may impact HbA1c. Racial and ethnic differences in HbA1c have been described that do not appear to be explained by differences in glycemia. It is imperative that the nonglycemic factors that affect HbA1c be more clearly defined. Even more important, it must be determined whether differences among individuals or groups correlate with susceptibility to complications or merely reflect variation in hemoglobin glycation.

### Hemoglobin A1c is associated with increased risk of incident coronary heart disease among apparently healthy, nondiabetic men and women [^113487o5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Anthropometric data, lifestyle behavior, and diet were derived from the questionnaire administered in 1990 to women and in 1994 to men, with missing information substituted from previous questionnaires. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight divided by height squared. Average nutrient intake was computed using the semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Physical activity was expressed as metabolic equivalent-hours. The validity and reproducibility of the questionnaires and measurements have been previously reported.

### Translating the A1C assay into estimated average glucose values [^111XYuEL]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Our results strongly support a simple linear relationship between mean glucose and A1C levels in a clinically relevant range of glycemia. Our data fulfilled the a priori quality criterion; i.e. 90% of the estimates fell within the ± 15% range of the regression line. This criterion was considered realistic, allowing for the imprecision of the A1C assay, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and self-monitored blood glucose tests.

The large population allowed us to demonstrate that the relationship between A1C and estimated average glucose (AG) was consistent across prespecified subgroups. The tight and consistent relationship across different subgroups suggests that, for many patients with diabetes, there are no significant factors affecting the relationship between mean glucose levels and A1C. There was a suggestion (P = 0.07) that the regression line was different for African Americans, indicating that for a given A1C value, African Americans might have a slightly lower mean glucose level. This borderline result requires further study to confirm whether there is no relationship between ethnicity and the relationship between mean glucose and A1C.

Furthermore, there was a suggestion that age may affect the relationship between AG and A1C; however, the effect was not monotonic. The regression lines for each age group crossed at an A1C of 7%, with the first and last tertiles being similar and the middle tertile differing. We suspect this is a spurious finding. Other well-recognized clinical factors, such as anemia and altered erythrocyte turnover, can affect A1C results.

### Understanding the relationship between the frequency of HbA1c monitoring, HbA1c changes over time, and the achievement of targets: a retrospective cohort study [^117G9rxu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines from professional organizations, such as the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), recommend testing HbA1c at 6-monthly intervals (NICE) or at least two times a year (ADA) for patients meeting treatment goals and with stable glycaemic control. Patients who are not meeting glycaemic control goals should be tested 3–6 monthly (NICE) or quarterly (ADA). However, unlike recommendations for glycaemic control targets that are based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, recommendations for the frequency of HbA1c monitoring are largely based on expert opinion. This is due to the limited number of in-depth studies investigating the impact of testing frequency on clinical outcomes.

Moreover, the evidence base for glycaemic control targets, as well as the available studies on the impact of testing frequency, are all from high-income countries (HICs), which may not be generalisable to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to context-specific factors. These factors, relevant for other aspects of type 2 diabetes (T2D) management, include variations in healthcare infrastructure, accessibility to healthcare services, socioeconomic disparities, competing health priorities, behavioural factors, and differing healthcare policies.

This study, therefore, evaluates the short-term impact of HbA1c monitoring intervals on changes in HbA1c levels. Additionally, the study aims to provide evidence supporting testing recommendations in South Africa by examining associations between glycaemic control, longitudinal HbA1c changes, and adherence to recommendations.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112JqXxK]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

For specific circumstances regarding type 1 diabetes mellitus, particularly in pediatric patients and their glycemic targets, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend considering less stringent HbA1c goals (such as < 7.5%; < 58 mmol/mol). These recommendations apply to young patients who are unable to articulate symptoms of hypoglycemia, have hypoglycemia unawareness, lack advanced insulin delivery technology and/or continuous glucose monitoring, are unable to check blood glucose regularly, or have nonglycemic factors increasing HbA1c (such as being high glycators).

### HbA1c: A review of non-glycaemic variables [^115GNwpN]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Identification of the correlation between HbA1c and diabetic complications has yielded one of the most clinically useful biomarkers. HbA1c has revolutionized the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus. However, with the widespread adoption of HbA1c, there is increasing recognition that non-glycaemic variables can also affect HbA1c, with varying clinical significance. Furthermore, the identification of a discrepancy between predicted and measured HbA1c in some individuals, known as the 'glycation gap', may be clinically significant.

We aimed to review the body of evidence relating to non-glycaemic variables to quantify any significance and provide subsequent suggestions. A PubMed-based literature search was performed using various search terms to retrieve articles detailing the non-glycaemic variables suggested to affect HbA1c. Articles were reviewed to assess the relevance of any findings in clinical practice, and where possible, guidance is provided.

A range of non-glycaemic variables has statistically significant effects on HbA1c. While the clinical implications are generally irrelevant, a small number of non-glycaemic variables do have clinically significant effects. Alternative biomarkers should be considered instead of, or in addition to, HbA1c. While clinicians should have an awareness of those non-glycaemic variables with clinical significance, the vast majority of non-glycaemic variables have no clinical relevance.

### The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has been actively involved in the development and dissemination of diabetes care standards, guidelines, and related documents for many years. Introduction [^116EALdB]. Diabetes Care (2009). High credibility.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, a classification system was developed to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence. Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations that lack evidence from clinical trials, where clinical trials may be impractical, or in situations with conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large, well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the appropriate population. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but lack comprehensive support. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses following a given recommendation.

Evidence, of course, is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; therefore, guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^1125RrvJ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The A1C test is subject to certain limitations. Conditions that affect erythrocyte turnover, such as hemolysis and blood loss, and hemoglobin variants must be considered, particularly when the A1C result does not correlate with the patient's clinical situation. In addition, the A1C test does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability, especially those with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with severe insulin deficiency, glycemic control is best judged by a combination of self-monitoring results and the A1C. The A1C may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient's glucose meter or the patient's reported SMBG results, as well as the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.

Table 8 contains the correlation between A1C levels and mean plasma glucose levels based on data from the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) trial, which utilized frequent SMBG and CGM in 507 adults (83% Caucasian) with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes. The ADA and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry have determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. The table in pre-2009 versions of the "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes", which described the correlation between A1C and mean glucose, was derived from relatively sparse data (one 7-point profile over 1 day per A1C reading) in the primarily Caucasian type 1 diabetic participants in the DCCT. Clinicians should note that the numbers in the table are now different.

### Shorter height is associated with diabetes in women but not in men: Nationally representative evidence from Namibia [^113nLAoc]. Obesity (2019). Low credibility.

Our outcome was diabetes using WHO cutoff points. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) were defined as diabetes. Plasma glucose was measured in capillary whole blood after an overnight fast. Although the WHO recommends venous plasma glucose as the standard method for measuring glucose concentrations in blood, capillary sampling is widely used, particularly in low-resource settings. Fasting values for venous and capillary plasma glucose are considered to be identical. All respondents included in our study confirmed that they had fasted for at least 8 hours prior to measurement. In addition to a blood test, participants were asked whether they were taking medication for diabetes: "Are you currently receiving prescribed medication such as insulin for your high blood glucose or diabetes?" Individuals reporting use of drugs for diabetes were classified as having diabetes, irrespective of their biomarker values. Our outcome for diabetes was treated as a dichotomous variable (diabetes/no diabetes).

Our key exposure was attained adult height as a continuous variable in centimeters. Adult height was measured once in a standing position using a Shorr height board (Weight and Measure, LLC, Maryland, USA). Measurements were performed by trained staff following a detailed field manual.

We included sex, age (continuous), residency (urban, rural), educational attainment (level attained at the time of the survey), and household wealth quintile as covariates to control for potential confounding in our analysis, in addition to body mass index (BMI).

### Utility of hemoglobin-A1C in nondiabetic women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^11557ZWZ]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) ≥ 5.7% is now accepted as a biomarker for identifying individuals at risk for diabetes. Compared to the general population, women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a higher risk for diabetes. Our goal was to determine what glucose homeostasis abnormalities can be identified by A1C ≥ 5.7% in women with PCOS.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional study, nondiabetic women with PCOS (according to the National Institutes of Health [NIH] criteria) were divided into two groups based on A1C (< 5.7% [n = 23] and ≥ 5.7% [n = 25]). Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FS-IVGTT) were conducted, and body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, and sex steroid levels were assessed.

- **Results**: Compared to women with A1C < 5.7%, those with A1C ≥ 5.7% were older (35.1 ± 1.1 years vs. 31.1 ± 1.1 years; p = 0.04), had higher glucose levels at fasting and during OGTT, and had a lower insulin sensitivity index (SI: 2.0 ± 0.2 vs. 4.2 ± 0.6; p = 0.0195) and disposition index (DI: 1,014 ± 82 vs. 1,901 ± 217; p = 0.011) during FS-IVGTT. They also had higher triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) levels. There was no difference in serum androgen levels.

- **Conclusion**: A1C ≥ 5.7% identified the subgroup of PCOS patients with higher insulin resistance, inadequate compensatory insulin response, impaired glucose disposition, and increased cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, A1C represents an inexpensive and informative biomarker to identify PCOS patients at risk.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111o1Dnc]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly concerning glycemic targets, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the achievement of lower HbA1c levels than the standard goal of 7% (53 mmol/mol), provided it can be accomplished safely without frequent or severe hypoglycemia or other adverse treatment effects. This approach should be based on the healthcare professional's judgment and the preferences of the patient with diabetes.

### Choice of HbA1c threshold for identifying individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes and implications for diabetes prevention programmes: a cohort study [^114ws9Xy]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Within the included participants (n = 4227), 3.4% (n = 144) progressed to diabetes within a 5-year period. The mean (SD) time to progression to diabetes was 45.6 (17.9) months, and the mean follow-up time (SD) was 28.4 (14.0) months. Follow-up data were available for 4227 out of 6434 participants who provided baseline HbA1c. These participants had a heavier BMI (mean 95% CI difference 0.8 kg/m² [0.6, 1.0 kg/m²]) and were 3.7 years (3.1, 4.3 years) older. Their baseline HbA1c was 1.7 mmol/mol (1.5, 1.9 mmol/mol), 0.15% (0.14, 0.17%), higher than those without follow-up, suggesting those who followed up with clinical HbA1c testing had a higher risk of diabetes.

- **Baseline characteristics of the cohort**: Mean (SD) or percentage reported. A shorter follow-up time in those who progressed to diabetes compared to those who did not is due to the censoring of time at the point of progression to type 2 diabetes.

### Influence of glycemic variables on hemoglobin A1c [^115WRBLw]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

To assess the influence of a wide variety of glucose variables on hemoglobin A1c (A1C), researchers utilized the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial database. This analysis was restricted to volunteers whose 7-point daily capillary glucose profiles were complete in 80% or more of quarterly collections and who participated in the study for at least four years. Regression analyses were conducted to develop an equation for estimating A1C based on concurrent and prior mean blood glucose (MBG) values. The multivariate coefficient of determination (R²) was calculated for MBG, mean postprandial blood glucose, mean preprandial blood glucose, digestive glycemia, interdigestive glycemia, individual time points of the 7-point glucose profile, range of blood glucose, standard deviation (SD) of blood glucose, M-value, and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions in relation to A1C. Using regression analysis, the correlation between A1C and MBG within each study subject was determined.

The most accurate prediction of A1C was obtained from the concurrent MBG. Univariate analysis showed that all glucose variables correlated significantly with concurrent A1C, with the strongest correlation seen with MBG. In multivariate analysis, MBG emerged as the primary predictor of A1C, while other glucose variables added no additional predictive value to the models. Within-subject correlations between MBG and A1C showed considerable variation.

A1C correlates best with MBG derived from 7-point daily capillary glucose profiles. However, the influences of glucose measured at specific time points during the day or various measures of glucose variability were not as significant.

### Gaps remain for achieving HbA1c targets for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes using insulin: Results from NHANES 2009–2020 [^113uMGaM]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Glycemic control is a key element of diabetes management to avoid microvascular and macrovascular complications. Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is an important measure to assess glycemic control and predict diabetes complications. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends an HbA1c goal of < 7% for non-pregnant adults (18–64 years). The ADA also emphasizes the need for individualized treatment targets based on various factors.

People with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are insulin deficient and require exogenous insulin, which can be delivered via multiple daily injections (MDI) or pumps. People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often initiate insulin use when glycemic targets are not achieved with other agents.

Prior studies evaluating glycemic targets have shown that 21–64% of people with diabetes (PwDs) achieve the ADA-recommended glycemic target of < 7%. The range in results may depend on differences in study characteristics, including the population studied (e.g. diabetes type), treatment regimen, and data source (e.g. clinical trial data). However, limited information exists on trends in HbA1c among PwDs who use insulin. To address this gap, this study aimed to describe the trends in HbA1c among PwDs using mealtime insulin (MTI) or basal-only insulin, using the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^111jEtNG]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically with respect to monitoring glycemic status, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing glycemic status by HbA1c and/or appropriate continuous glucose monitoring metrics, such as time in range, time above range, and time below range. Consider obtaining fructosamine or continuous glucose monitoring for glycemic monitoring when an alternative to HbA1c is required.

### Choice of HbA1c threshold for identifying individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes and implications for diabetes prevention programmes: a cohort study [^112Z1Lc1]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is common and increasing in prevalence. It is possible to prevent or delay T2D using lifestyle intervention programmes. Entry to these programmes is usually determined by a measure of glycaemia in the 'intermediate' range. This paper investigated the relationship between HbA1c and future diabetes risk and determined the impact of varying thresholds to identify those at high risk of developing T2D.

- **Methods**: We studied 4,227 participants without diabetes aged ≥ 40 years recruited to the Exeter 10,000 population cohort in South West England. HbA1c was measured at study recruitment with repeat HbA1c available as part of usual care. Absolute risk of developing diabetes within five years, defined by HbA1c ≥ 48mmol/mol (6.5%), according to baseline HbA1c, was assessed by a flexible parametric survival model.

- **Results**: The overall absolute five-year risk (95% CI) of developing T2D in the cohort was 4.2% (3.6, 4.8%). This rose to 7.1% (6.1, 8.2%) in the 56% (n = 2358/4224) of participants classified 'high-risk' with HbA1c ≥ 39mmol/mol (5.7%; ADA criteria). Under IEC criteria, HbA1c ≥ 42mmol/mol (6.0%), 22% (n = 929/4277) of the cohort was classified as high-risk with a five-year risk of 14.9% (12.6, 17.2%). Those with the highest HbA1c values (44–47mmol/mol [6.2–6.4%]) had a much higher five-year risk, 26.4% (22.0, 30.5%) compared with 2.1% (1.5, 2.6%) for 39–41mmol/mol (5.7–5.9%) and 7.0% (5.4, 8.6%) for 42–43mmol/mol (6.0–6.1%). Changing the entry criterion to prevention programmes from 39 to 42mmol/mol (5.7–6.0%) reduced the proportion classified as high-risk by 61%.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^113Hz7at]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Individuals with an A1C of 5.7–6.4% should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies, such as weight loss and physical activity, to lower their risks. As with glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so that as A1C rises, the risk of diabetes rises disproportionately. Accordingly, interventions should be most intensive and follow-up should be particularly vigilant for those with A1C levels above 6.0%, who should be considered to be at very high risk. However, just as an individual with a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dl (5.4 mmol/l) may not be at negligible risk for diabetes, individuals with A1C levels below 5.7% may still be at risk, depending on the level of A1C and presence of other risk factors, such as obesity and family history.

Evaluation of patients at risk should incorporate a global risk factor assessment for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Screening and counseling about the risk of diabetes should always be in the pragmatic context of the patient's comorbidities, life expectancy, personal capacity to engage in lifestyle change, and overall health goals.

### The correlation of hemoglobin A1c to blood glucose [^114js3PP]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) represents the average blood glucose level of patients over the previous 120 days underlies the management of diabetes. Even in making such a statement, we speak of "average blood glucose" as though "blood glucose" were itself a simple idea. When we consider all the blood glucose forms — arterial versus venous versus capillary, whole blood versus serum versus fluoride-preserved plasma, fasting versus non-fasting — we can start to see that this is not a simple issue. Nevertheless, it seems as though HbA1c correlates to any single glucose measurement.

Having more than one measurement and taking those measurements in the preceding month improves the correlation further. In particular, by having glucose measurements that reflect both the relatively lower overnight glucose levels and measurements that reflect the postprandial peaks improves not only our ability to manage diabetes patients but also our understanding of how HbA1c levels are determined. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices may take thousands of glucose results over a week. Several studies have shown that CGM glucose averages account for the vast proportion of the variation of HbA1c.

The ability to relate HbA1c to average glucose may become a popular method for reporting HbA1c, eliminating concerns regarding differences in HbA1c standardization. Hemoglobin A1c expressed as an average glucose may be more understandable to patients and improve not only their understanding but also their ability to improve their diabetes management.

### Insulin-like growth factor 1 and sex hormones for assessment of anthropometric and pubertal growth of Egyptian children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (single center study) [^116UuW4B]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Short stature in diabetic patients could be related to metabolic control as indicated by HbA1c levels. In our study, we found that short stature in diabetic patients was significantly related to higher HbA1c compared to those with normal stature. This finding aligns with the study by Zurita-Cruz et al, which reported that HbA1c and poor glycemic control were lower in patients with normal growth parameters compared to those with growth alterations. On the other hand, several studies found no significant correlation between metabolic control and linear growth in diabetic boys or girls. This suggests that diabetic control, as reflected by HbA1c levels, might not be the only determinant of short stature in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM).

Interestingly, we illustrated that short stature in our patients was significantly related to an earlier age at diagnosis and a longer duration of diabetes compared to those with normal stature. Previous studies have shown that adult height was negatively correlated with the duration of diabetes. Conversely, some studies concluded that the decrease in height gain was independent of the duration of TIDM or the degree of metabolic control. With improvements in therapeutic regimens, regular diet, and physical activity; normal growth should be expected in children with TIDM. However, data on growth and pubertal development remain controversial. Above all, it is unclear whether the degree of metabolic control or the duration of the disease affects final height.

Short stature in diabetic patients could also be related to anthropometric measures.

### Influence of variables on hemoglobin A1c values and nonheterogeneity of hemoglobin A1c reference ranges [^117NBcc8]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values are influenced by both analytical interferences, such as HbF and hemoglobin variants, and clinical factors like increased red cell turnover. Additionally, demographic factors such as race, age, and sex also play a role in influencing HbA1c values. The HbA1c reference range should be homogeneous in the United States, based on the use of National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program certified methods and recommendations in the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry guidelines.

- **Methods**: Data on age, race, sex, HbA1c, and glucose values were extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination study conducted over a three-year period. Reference range data for laboratories in the United States were also sought using the Google search engine.

- **Results**: Extracted data align with published findings regarding the influence of age, sex, and smoking status on HbA1c values. There is notable heterogeneity in HbA1c reference ranges among laboratories in the United States.

- **Conclusion**: Age, sex, and smoking status are influential factors on HbA1c values. Despite standardization of HbA1c methods and existing recommendations, there remains a wide heterogeneity in HbA1c reference ranges across the United States.

### A view beyond HbA1c: Role of continuous glucose monitoring [^115Y2NRj]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used as an index of average blood glucose measurement over a period of months and is a mainstay of blood glucose monitoring. This metric is easy to measure and relatively inexpensive to obtain, and it predicts diabetes-related microvascular complications. However, HbA1c provides only an approximate measure of glucose control; it does not address short-term glycemic variability (GV) or hypoglycemic events. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a tool which helps clinicians and people with diabetes to overcome the limitations of HbA1c in diabetes management. Time spent in the glycemic target range and time spent in hypoglycemia are the main CGM metrics that provide a more personalized approach to diabetes management. Moreover, the glucose management indicator (GMI), which calculates an approximate HbA1c level based on the average CGM-driven glucose level, facilitates individual decision-making when the laboratory-measured HbA1c and estimated HbA1c are discordant. GV, on the other hand, is a measure of swings in blood glucose levels over hours or days and may contribute to diabetes-related complications. In addition, addressing GV is a major challenge during the optimization of glycemia. The degree of GV is associated with the frequency, duration, and severity of the hypoglycemic events. Many factors affect GV in a patient, including lifestyle, diet, the presence of comorbidities, and diabetes therapy. Recent evidence supports the use of some glucose-lowering agents to improve GV, such as the new ultra-long acting insulin analogs.

### Outcomes for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion users in young adults from lower socioeconomic backgrounds [^1169eT9U]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The primary outcome was HbA1c (%) measurements obtained at 3–6, 7–12, 13–18, and 19–24 months following the assignment of treatment modality. HbA1c values were considered if they occurred at least 3 months after CSII prescription. We used the last HbA1c for every patient with multiple HbA1c records per each 3-month interval. For graphical illustrations, laboratory data in the form of HbA1c were analyzed at 6-month intervals.

The secondary outcome was hospitalization for DKA. Unique DKA encounters were defined as an inpatient diagnosis code for DKA corresponding to a distinct inpatient visit encounter ID. We calculated the total number of unique DKA episodes per subject over the 24-month follow-up period.

- **Covariates**: We controlled for the age, race, ethnicity, gender, and income of the subject. Age was classified as 18–26 years and 27 or older at the time of first encounter. This classification was based on the knowledge that parental healthcare coverage for dependent children ends after age 26. Blacks, Asians, and other races were grouped into one racial category and compared to whites in this analysis. Ethnicity was also re-categorized into Hispanics vs. other ethnicities. Subjects making less than $45,000 a year were considered low-income individuals. Because adult endocrinologists may differ in their approach to prescribing CSII to their patients when compared to physicians from other specialties, a composite variable was generated specifying if the subject had at least one encounter with an adult endocrinologist and was adjusted for in the analysis.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^116HzUgf]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The A1C test is subject to certain limitations. Conditions affecting erythrocyte turnover, such as hemolysis and blood loss, and hemoglobin variants must be considered, particularly when the A1C result does not align with the patient's clinical situation. Additionally, A1C does not measure glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability, especially type 1 diabetic patients or type 2 diabetic patients with severe insulin deficiency, glycemic control is best assessed by combining results from SMBG testing and the A1C. The A1C may also verify the accuracy of the patient's meter or the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.

Table 9 presents the correlation between A1C levels and mean PG levels based on data from the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) trial. This trial utilized frequent SMBG and CGM in 507 adults — 83% Caucasian — with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes. The ADA and the American Association of Clinical Chemists have determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. In previous versions of the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, the table describing the correlation between A1C and mean glucose was derived from sparse data, primarily using one seven-point profile over 1 day per A1C reading in Caucasian type 1 participants in the DCCT. Clinicians should note that the numbers in the table are now different, as they are based on more comprehensive data.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess, and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands.

When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required between: (1) achieving a reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia, and (2) what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by clinicians to take into account the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required, and level of commitment to the treatment.

Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs, and treatment outcomes when formulating diabetes management plans. The relative properties of the different glucose variables — fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), and glycated protein — are discussed in terms of their convenience.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115An8B8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Testing to detect type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic individuals, which was previously controversial, is now recommended for those at risk of developing the disease. The ADA proposes that all asymptomatic individuals aged 45 years and older undergo screening in a healthcare setting. Appropriate screening evaluations include an HbA1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT. The IDF suggests that health services in each country decide on diabetes screening implementation, recommending FPG as the test of choice. In contrast, the International Expert Committee and the ADA support the use of HbA1c for diabetes screening (refer to the section on HbA1c below).

If an FPG result is less than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and/or a 2-h plasma glucose concentration is less than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year intervals. Screening should be considered at a younger age or performed more frequently in individuals who are overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) or obese and have at least one additional risk factor for diabetes. Due to the rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children, screening in this population is now advocated. Beginning at age 10 years, or at the onset of puberty if it occurs earlier, testing should be conducted every three years in overweight children who have two other risk factors, including family history, race/ethnicity associated with increased risk, signs of insulin resistance, and a maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation.

Additionally, A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability — especially those with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with severe insulin deficiency — glycemic control is best judged by the combination of results from SMBG testing and the A1C. The A1C may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient's meter, the patient's reported SMBG results, and the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.

Table 9 contains the correlation between A1C levels and mean plasma glucose levels based on data from the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) trial. This trial utilized frequent SMBG and CGM in 507 adults (83% Caucasian) with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes. The American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Chemists have determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. The table in previous versions of the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, which described the correlation between A1C and mean glucose, was derived from relatively sparse data (one 7-point profile over one day per A1C reading) in primarily Caucasian type 1 diabetic participants in the DCCT. Clinicians should note that the numbers in the updated table differ.

### Association between iron deficiency and A1C levels among adults without diabetes in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2006 [^1174knuW]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The odds of having an A1C ≥ 5.5% by iron deficiency status are shown in Table 2. Among women, iron deficiency was associated with increased odds of an A1C ≥ 5.5% before and after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, waist circumference, parity, and hysterectomy. Among men with and without iron deficiency, the odds of having an A1C ≥ 5.5% did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for covariates. The odds of having an A1C ≥ 6.5% by iron deficiency status for women is also shown in Table 2, with no statistically significant association, although the number of iron-deficient women with A1C ≥ 6.5% was small. Because only one man had iron deficiency and an A1C ≥ 6.5%, multivariate regression was not performed.

- **Odds ratios (95% CI)**: For iron deficiency predicting high A1C among adults aged ≥ 18 years, NHANES 1999–2006

Table 3 illustrates the predicted prevalence of women with an elevated A1C by iron status before and after adjustment for covariates. The difference in the predicted prevalence of an A1C ≥ 5.5% between women with and without iron deficiency was small, although statistically significant. There was no significant difference in the predicted prevalence of an A1C ≥ 6.5% between women with and without iron deficiency, although again, the number of women with iron deficiency and an A1C ≥ 6.5% was small.

- **Predicted prevalence**: Elevated A1C among adults aged ≥ 18 years with and without iron deficiency

### Accuracy of anthropometric parameters in predicting prediabetes among adolescents in eastern Sudan: A community-based cross-sectional study [^111ysL74]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

For HbA1c analysis, 3 mL of blood was collected from each adolescent in an EDTA tube under aseptic conditions. The HbA1c levels were measured using an Ichroma machine following the manufacturer's instructions (Republic of Korea), as detailed in our previous study. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, prediabetes was defined as an HbA1c level between 5.7% and 6.4%, while Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus was diagnosed with an HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher. HbA1c has been recognized as an effective diagnostic tool for prediabetes and diabetes in children and adolescents across various studies. Additionally, the ADA criteria for HbA1c measurement are particularly suitable for resource-limited settings like Sudan, where conducting Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests (OGTT) and FBG assessments can be challenging.

The ADA 2025 guidelines for diagnostic investigations in type 2 diabetes mellitus specifically address HbA1c and blood glucose testing. They recommend restricting point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. FDA. These tests should be conducted at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratories, which perform testing at moderate complexity or higher and are operated by trained personnel.

### The contribution of glycemic control to impaired growth during puberty in young people with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria [^115616So]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

In adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D), short stature has been associated with risk for cardiovascular disease and nephropathy. However, there are no available data on the potential relationship between growth patterns during puberty and the development of vascular complications. Our aim was to assess whether pubertal growth is impaired in young people with T1D who develop microalbuminuria (MA).

- **Methods**: Repeated height measurements during adolescence were available for 206 young people (107 boys) with T1D followed in the Oxford Regional Prospective Study. Longitudinal data on albumin-creatinine ratios and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were also collected from the study participants. Height standard deviation scores (SDS) were compared between subjects with (MA+; n = 66) and without MA (MA-; n = 140).

- **Results**: In the group as a whole, mean [95% CI] height SDS progressively declined during puberty, from 0.145 [0.015; 0.274] to -0.003 [-0.145; 0.138], p < 0.001. However, the decline in height SDS was significantly different between the MA+ and MA- groups (p = 0.023), with a mean difference in final height of 4.29 [1.87; 6.72] cm, p = 0.001. Final height was inversely associated with MA (HR [95%CI]: 0.942 [0.908; 0.979], p = 0.002), although this association was no longer significant after adjusting for HbA1c, which was higher in the MA+ group.

- **Conclusion**: In this study, we found a significant impairment in growth during puberty in young people with T1D, particularly in those developing MA. Poor glycemic control as well as other genetic or environmental factors could explain these findings.

### Relationship between average glucose levels and HbA1c differs across racial groups: A substudy of the GRADE randomized trial [^116C9TmM]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

To determine whether the relationship between average glucose (AG) levels and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) differs across racial/ethnic groups, we performed a prospective substudy of GRADE, a comparative effectiveness randomized trial conducted in 36 centers in the U.S. A total of 1,454 of the 5,047 participants in the GRADE cohort were included in the substudy. This included 534 non-Hispanic White (NHW), 389 non-Hispanic Black (NHB), 327 Hispanic White patients, and 204 patients of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed for 10 days to calculate AG10. Immediately after CGM, HbA1c and glycated albumin were measured. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glucose area under the curve (AUC) were derived from a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.

- **Results**: The relationship between AG10 and HbA1c was significantly different for NHB compared with NHW patients and those of other racial/ethnic groups. HbA1c levels were 0.2–0.6 percentage points higher in NHB than in NHW patients for AG10 levels from 100 to 250 mg/dL. For an HbA1c of 7%, AG10 was 11 mg/dL higher for NHW than for NHB patients. Similar findings were observed across races for relationships of FPG and AUC with HbA1c and for glucose measurements with glycated albumin levels. Differences in the relationship between AG10 and HbA1c across racial groups remained after adjustments for any demographic or other differences between racial/ethnic subgroups.

- **Conclusions**: The relationship between several measures of glucose with HbA1c and glycated albumin was consistent, reflecting variations among racial groups.

### Prototype of an evidence-based tool to aid individualized treatment for type 2 diabetes [^113nyD78]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

- **Statistical methods**: The predicted treatment outcomes were determined using the prespecified mixed models for repeated measurements from the original trial protocols for the chosen efficacy endpoints, which are changes in HbA1c level and body weight. Both endpoints are quantified on a continuous scale and were therefore analyzed using a linear normal model. This aligns with how these endpoints were analyzed according to the protocols for all the individual RCTs included. The model has been adopted and modified only by the inclusion of additional covariates and interaction terms. Additional covariates (e.g. renal function) were specified in some trials to represent individuals' characteristics, where available.

The predictions used the estimated coefficients for the baseline characteristics determined in the model using the totality of the data. For example, in the interface illustrated in Figure 1 — for a 55-year-old woman who has had T2D for 5 years, with an HbA1c of 9% (75 mmol/mol), BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m^2, and normal renal function — the estimated reduction in HbA1c was determined using a mixed model for repeated measurements nested within treatment visits. Thus, there is an intercept, main effects for all input variables, as well as interaction terms with visits, and also between HbA1c at baseline and diabetes duration.

### Epidemiologic relationships between A1C and all-cause mortality during a median 3.4-year follow-up of glycemic treatment in the ACCORD trial [^1155qcKK]. Diabetes Care (2010). High credibility.

- **Objective**: Randomized treatment comparing an intensive glycemic treatment strategy with a standard strategy in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial was ended early because of an unexpected excess of mortality in the intensive arm. As part of ongoing post hoc analyses of potential mechanisms for this finding, we explored whether on-treatment A1C itself had an independent relationship with mortality.

- **Research design and methods**: Participants with type 2 diabetes (n = 10,251 with mean age 62 years, median duration of diabetes 10 years, and median A1C 8.1%) were randomly assigned to treatment strategies targeting either A1C 7%.

- **Conclusions**: These analyses implicate factors associated with persisting higher A1C levels, rather than low A1C per se, as likely contributors to the observed outcomes.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114MLFFv]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 1, particularly in pediatric patients (glycemic targets), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend considering more stringent HbA1c goals. These can be set to < 6.5% (< 48 mmol/mol) in selected individuals if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, excessive weight gain, negative impacts on well-being, or undue burden of care. This also applies in cases where nonglycemic factors decrease HbA1c, such as lower erythrocyte life span. It is advisable to consider setting lower goals during the honeymoon phase.

### Capillary glycated hemoglobin A1c percentiles and the risk factors associated with abnormal HbA1c among Chinese children aged 3–12 years [^115mNUvU]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Low credibility.

Our study did not detect statistically significant differences in HbA1c levels between boys and girls, which was consistent with a previous study. However, Jansen et al. reported that boys had higher HbA1c levels than girls in a study population consisting solely of children aged 8–9 years. One plausible explanation could be that the inclusion of children across a broad age range may have mitigated the impact of pubertal hormonal fluctuations on HbA1c levels, thereby minimizing gender-related differences.

HbA1c levels were not uniformly and linearly correlated with age in our study. Explanations for the relationship between HbA1c levels and age are rare, particularly concerning children. Rhee et al. pointed out that glucose levels increase significantly with age because of age-related impairments to glucose handling. Both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion exhibit a decline with age, as evidenced by numerous studies in the literature, aligning with the observed rise in diabetes prevalence associated with aging. As age increases, glucose metabolism impairs, and insulin action decreases.

Another possible influencing factor was the onset of puberty. According to previous studies, hormones such as growth hormones and sex hormones may increase insulin resistance, and the A1C level was elevated before the onset of puberty in both sexes. However, it remains unclear to what extent this elevation is due to the onset of puberty. Further investigation into pathophysiological changes occurring with increasing age in childhood is recommended to gain a more comprehensive understanding.

### Should A1C targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against [^116Tc2ws]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Over 280 million people worldwide are known to have diabetes, and this number is projected to grow to 438 million by 2030. Diabetes treatment guidelines encourage a multifaceted therapeutic approach. Central to these recommendations are early diagnosis and active intervention to realize and maintain glycemic control. The aim is to stop the development of microvascular complications, reduce the risk of macrovascular events, and ameliorate the symptoms of acute hyperglycemia.

The prognostic significance of A1C with regard to the incidence of diabetes complications, and the risk reductions associated with improvements in A1C, have been documented in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This has led to the underscoring of the importance of achieving A1C targets. Many organizations around the world, including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Canadian Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation, and the U.K. National Institute for Clinical Excellence, currently advocate a general target level for A1C of 6.5–7.0%. They also emphasize that the targets of therapy must be individualized. Recently, a joint position statement from the American College of Cardiology, ADA, and the American Heart Association, released in response to the premature discontinuation of the glycemic intervention in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, recommended that an appropriate A1C target is generally < 7.

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one [^115q9jH7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100–125 mg/dL) has traditionally been used to identify individuals in the U.S. at high risk for the subsequent development of diabetes. Recent guidelines have also endorsed the use of HbA1c levels of 5.7–6.4% to identify those at risk. However, multiple studies, including one conducted among older persons, suggest that HbA1c may identify different individuals at risk for diabetes than traditional glucose measures. Although several recent investigations confirm that HbA1c is strongly predictive of future diabetes in predominantly middle-aged populations, less is known about how well HbA1c identifies older persons at risk for diabetes.

Despite the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes among the elderly (10.9 million Americans in 2010) and the high incidence (390,000 new cases in 2010) of late-onset type 2 diabetes (> 65 years), there are few specific studies on the prediction of diabetes in this group. One such study, based on an earlier Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) analysis, developed a prediction rule for diabetes development which included several factors such as advanced age, female sex, elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and triglyceride levels. However, HbA1c was not examined as a potential predictor. In the Cardiovascular Health Study of men and women aged ≥ 65 years, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and weight gain were associated with a higher risk of diabetes, but the impact of glycemic measures on diabetes was not specifically examined. An Italian study of older adults (age 65–84 years) found that the combination of abnormal…

### Short adult stature predicts impaired β-cell function, insulin resistance, glycemia, and type 2 diabetes in Finnish men [^11221R61]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Recent studies have highlighted the role of height in complex diseases, although conflicting information has been reported on height as a predictor of changes in glycemia and risk of type 2 diabetes.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to investigate the association of height with insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, glycemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a large prospective population-based study.

- **Design**: The study included 8,746 Finnish men (mean ± standard deviation, age 57.2 ± 7.1 years, body mass index 26.8 ± 3.8 kg/m²) selected from a population-based Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted at Kuopio University Hospital and University of Eastern Finland.

- **Participants**: The participants were nondiabetic at recruitment, and 5,401 subjects have participated in the follow-up study. During the follow-up, a total of 693 subjects converted to type 2 diabetes and 351 were diagnosed with a new CVD event.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were the incidence of type 2 diabetes and CVD.

- **Results**: Height measured at baseline was significantly associated with lower levels of 2-hour glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test, an increase in insulin secretion, and a decrease in the risk of type 2 diabetes [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.83, confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90] and CVD [HR = 0.75, CI 0.67 to 0.83] during the follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: Short stature is associated with unfavorable changes in glucose metabolism and predicts an increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events.

### Comparability of hemoglobin A1c level measured in capillary versus venous blood sample applying two point-of-care instruments [^113Y3yM7]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The present study is designed to evaluate the validity of measuring capillary blood hemoglobin A1c levels in comparison with venous blood hemoglobin A1c.

- **Methods**: The data of this cross-sectional study were collected from a sample of 45 Iranian diabetic patients referred to a particular laboratory for the assessment of HbA1c levels during the period from April to December 2013. Venous and simultaneous capillary blood samples were obtained from each subject for measurement of hemoglobin A1c levels. Both samples were tested using two different NGSP-certified systems: CERA STAT 2000 (Ceragem Medisys Inc) and NycoCard Reader II (Axis-Shield).

- **Results**: The mean hemoglobin A1c in venous and capillary blood samples measured using CERA STAT 2000 assays were 6.30 ± 1.68% and 6.34 ± 1.65%, respectively (p = 0.590). However, when the NycoCard Reader II assay was employed, the mean hemoglobin A1c in venous and capillary blood samples were 6.73 ± 1.35% and 6.92 ± 1.50% (p = 0.007). Moreover, a strong correlation was observed between venous and capillary hemoglobin A1c levels, with Pearson's concordance correlation coefficients of 0.96 and 0.94 with the use of NycoCard Reader II and CERA STAT 2000 assays, respectively. Application of CERA STAT 2000 demonstrated a considerably higher value using the ROC curve analysis assay (AUC = 0.991). Also, similar analysis using the NycoCard Reader II assay showed that capillary hemoglobin A1c measurement had high value for differentiating uncontrolled from controlled blood glucose levels (AUC = 0.935).

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^114EY8j5]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Individuals with an A1C of 5.7–6.4% should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies, such as weight loss and physical activity, to lower their risks. As with glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, meaning that as A1C levels rise, the risk of diabetes increases disproportionately. Accordingly, interventions should be most intensive, and follow-up should be particularly vigilant for those with A1C levels above 6.0%, who should be considered at very high risk. However, just as an individual with a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dl (5.4 mmol/l) may not be at negligible risk for diabetes, individuals with A1C levels below 5.7% may still be at risk, depending on the level of A1C and presence of other risk factors, such as obesity and family history.

Evaluation of patients at risk should incorporate a global risk factor assessment for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Screening for and counseling about the risk of diabetes should always be addressed within the pragmatic context of the patient's comorbidities, life expectancy, personal capacity to engage in lifestyle change, and overall health goals.
