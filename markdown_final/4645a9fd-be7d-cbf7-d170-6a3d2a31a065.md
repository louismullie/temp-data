## Question

A 3-year-old boy is referred to the metabolic clinic after a newborn screening test revealed elevated phenylalanine levels. His most recent laboratory results show an untreated blood phenylalanine concentration of 420 mcmol/L. He has no neurological symptoms and is developing normally. His parents are concerned about the need for dietary restrictions and ask whether treatment is necessary, and if so, for how long.

Based on current ESPKU guidelines, should this child be started on treatment for phenylketonuria, and if so, for how long should treatment be continued?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 3-year-old with an untreated phenylalanine level of 420 μmol/L should be started on treatment for phenylketonuria, and if so, for how long, according to current ESPKU guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the severity of hyperphenylalaninemia and whether this level crosses treatment thresholds. Then, I should verify what ESPKU 2017 and the 2025 European revision say about indications for treatment and duration by phenylalanine level. Next, I will reconcile any apparent discrepancies between sources and confirm the most authoritative current stance. Finally, I will translate this into a practical recommendation and counseling points for the family, including monitoring and therapeutic options.

> Let me first confirm the classification of the child's untreated phenylalanine level. An untreated blood phenylalanine concentration of 420 μmol/L falls into the mild-to-moderate hyperphenylalaninemia range and is above the commonly cited treatment threshold of 360 μmol/L, which distinguishes mild hyperphenylalaninemia from phenylketonuria requiring therapy, even though the child is currently asymptomatic and developing normally [^8bd47b90] [^ee277b0c].

> Wait, let me verify the ESPKU 2017 recommendations on treatment thresholds and duration. ESPKU 2017 advises initiating treatment for untreated phenylalanine levels above 360 μmol/L, and it stratifies duration: for levels 360–600 μmol/L, treatment is recommended until age 12 years, whereas for levels above 600 μmol/L, treatment is recommended for life. Importantly, it also notes that no intervention is required if untreated phenylalanine is consistently below 360 μmol/L, which this child's 420 μmol/L exceeds [^ee277b0c] [^3b78cdd6] [^5b302db5].

> Hold on, I should verify whether the 2025 European revision changes this stance. The 2025 first revision of the European PKU guidelines reaffirms and updates the 2017 framework but does not overturn the 360 μmol/L treatment threshold; it continues to endorse lifelong treatment for untreated levels above 600 μmol/L and supports individualized, lifelong management strategies, while maintaining that levels above 360 μmol/L warrant treatment, with the exact duration tailored to severity and response, which in practice often still means treatment through childhood for those in the 360–600 μmol/L range unless a specialist determines otherwise [^18c51e1d] [^8bd47b90].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating different guideline nuances. Some summaries describe a "treat until 12 years" approach for 360–600 μmol/L, but this is not a blanket license to stop; rather, it reflects the 2017 ESPKU phrasing and the historical pediatric focus, whereas contemporary practice increasingly emphasizes individualized, often lifelong strategies, especially as neurocognitive risks can persist or emerge with poor control and adherence wanes in adolescence and adulthood [^3b78cdd6] [^7a1c189f] [^d947df19].

> Let me consider the evidence basis for acting now. Even in early-treated patients, sustained elevations above 360 μmol/L correlate with lower IQ and executive dysfunction, and lowering phenylalanine toward 120–360 μmol/L improves outcomes; thus, starting treatment at 420 μmol/L is justified to prevent cumulative neurocognitive harm, even if the child appears normal today [^66e7c933] [^d7e9f5ab] [^3de87e24].

> Next, I should review practical management steps. I should confirm the diagnosis with quantitative plasma amino acids and exclude BH4-responsive variants with pterin analysis and, when feasible, PAH genotyping, because this can inform prognosis and whether sapropterin may help. Then, initiate dietary protein restriction with phenylalanine-free medical foods and consider sapropterin if indicated, with close monitoring to keep phenylalanine in the 120–360 μmol/L range during childhood and reassessing strategy through adolescence into adulthood [^9dc73ac4] [^bf97eaa7] [^b5f35ff4].

> I should double-check the counseling message for the family. The bottom line is that, yes, treatment is indicated now because 420 μmol/L exceeds the 360 μmol/L threshold, and the duration should be at least through age 12 years per ESPKU 2017, with many centers and updated guidance favoring individualized, often lifelong management to preserve neurocognitive outcomes and to mitigate risks that can emerge with poor control or during reproductive years, even if the child is currently asymptomatic [^ee277b0c] [^18c51e1d] [^66e7c933].

---

Based on current ESPKU guidelines, **treatment is indicated** for this 3-year-old with an untreated phenylalanine level of 420 μmol/L because it exceeds the 360 μmol/L threshold [^ee277b0c]. Treatment should continue **until at least age 12 years** [^3b78cdd6], with ongoing reassessment of phenylalanine levels and neurocognitive status to guide long-term management [^8bd47b90]. Lifelong treatment is not mandated at this level, but continued control beyond 12 years may be considered if levels remain elevated or if neurocognitive risks emerge [^notfound].

---

## Indications for treatment according to ESPKU guidelines

ESPKU guidelines classify hyperphenylalaninemia into **three categories** based on untreated blood phenylalanine levels:

| **Category** | **Untreated blood phenylalanine level** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild hyperphenylalaninemia | < 360 μmol/L | No treatment required [^5b302db5] |
| Moderate hyperphenylalaninemia | 360–600 μmol/L | Treatment until age 12 years [^3b78cdd6] |
| Classic PKU | > 600 μmol/L | Lifelong treatment [^640cebb2] |

---

In this case, the child's untreated phenylalanine level of 420 μmol/L falls into the **moderate hyperphenylalaninemia** category, for which ESPKU recommends treatment until age 12 years [^3b78cdd6].

---

## Rationale for treatment

Although the child is currently asymptomatic and developing normally, **elevated phenylalanine levels can cause subtle neurocognitive impairments** if left untreated [^5f1ad64a]. Early and continuous treatment maintains phenylalanine within the target range (120–360 μmol/L) [^01afb873] and prevents these adverse outcomes [^5f1ad64a].

---

## Duration of treatment

According to ESPKU guidelines, treatment should continue **until the child reaches 12 years of age** [^3b78cdd6]. After this age, management should be individualized based on ongoing phenylalanine levels, neurocognitive assessments, and patient-specific factors [^7a1c189f]. Lifelong treatment is not mandated at this level, but continued control beyond 12 years may be considered if phenylalanine levels remain elevated or if neurocognitive risks emerge [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of blood phenylalanine levels and neurocognitive assessments are essential to ensure **optimal outcomes** [^8bd47b90]. Adjustments to dietary restrictions or pharmacological treatments (such as sapropterin) may be necessary based on these assessments [^e436816f].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Treatment is indicated** for this 3-year-old with an untreated phenylalanine level of 420 μmol/L, as it exceeds the 360 μmol/L threshold [^ee277b0c].
- **Treatment should continue until at least age 12 years**, with ongoing reassessment of phenylalanine levels and neurocognitive status [^3b78cdd6].
- Lifelong treatment is not mandated at this level, but continued control beyond 12 years may be considered if phenylalanine levels remain elevated or if neurocognitive risks emerge [^notfound].

---

Current ESPKU guidelines recommend **initiating treatment** for this child and continuing it until at least age 12 years, with individualized management thereafter based on ongoing assessments [^3b78cdd6].

### Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: diagnosis and management guideline [^b4c7d7a2]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, traditionally known as phenylketonuria, results in the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood of affected individuals and was the first inborn error of metabolism to be identified through population screening. Early identification and treatment prevent the most dramatic clinical sequelae of the disorder, but new neurodevelopmental and psychological problems have emerged in individuals treated from birth. The additional unanticipated recognition of a toxic effect of elevated maternal phenylalanine on fetal development has added to a general call in the field for treatment for life. Two major conferences sponsored by the National Institutes of Health held > 10 years apart reviewed the state of knowledge in the field of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, but there are no generally accepted recommendations for therapy. The purpose of this guideline is to review the strength of the medical literature relative to the treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and to develop recommendations for diagnosis and therapy of this disorder. Evidence review from the original National Institutes of Health consensus conference and a recent update by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was used to address key questions in the diagnosis and treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency by a working group established by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. The group met by phone and in person over the course of a year to review these reports, develop recommendations, and identify key gaps in our knowledge of this disorder. Above all, treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency must be life long, with a goal of maintaining blood phenylalanine in the range of 120–360 µmol/l. Treatment has predominantly been dietary manipulation, and use of low protein and phenylalanine medical foods is likely to remain a major component of therapy for the immediate future. Pharmacotherapy for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is in early stages with one approved medication (sapropterin, a derivative of the natural cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase) and others under development. Eventually, treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency will be individualized with multiple medications and alternative medical foods available to tailor therapy. The primary goal of therapy should be to lower blood phenylalanine, and any interventions, including medications, or combination of therapies that help to achieve that goal in an individual, without other negative consequences, should be considered appropriate therapy. Significant evidence gaps remain in our understanding of the optimum therapies for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, nonphenylalanine effects of these therapies, and long-term sequelae of even well-treated disease in children and adults.

### European guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of phenylketonuria: first revision [^18c51e1d]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of phenylalanine metabolism caused by deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. Untreated, PKU results in elevated phenylalanine levels in blood and brain, which cause severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. For this first revision of the European PKU Guidelines previous recommendations were re-evaluated and updated according to new research findings. Twenty-one professionals were divided across four working groups and supported by a coordinator and chair. In addition to an update of the previous 70 recommendations, 20 new topics were included, resulting in a total of 87 statements in this first revision of the guidelines. Research publications were reviewed up until September 2022. Evidence was graded as high, moderate, low, very low or expert opinion and the recommendations were graded conditional or strong according to GRADE methodology. All recommendations were discussed during 14 plenary online or in person meetings. Recommendations were accepted if more than 75% of the professionals were in agreement. When recommendations were not amended, the text reported in the European guidelines of 2017 remains valid.

### Challenges and pitfalls in the management of phenylketonuria [^14b83cba]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances in the management of phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia, important questions on the management of this disorder remain unanswered. Consensus exists on the need for neonatal screening and early treatment, yet disagreement persists over threshold levels of blood phenylalanine for starting treatment, target blood phenylalanine levels, and the management of older patient groups. The mainstay of treatment is a phenylalanine-restricted diet, but its application varies between and within countries. Beyond diet treatment, there is a lack of consensus on the use of newer treatments such as tetrahydrobiopterin. Although neonatal screening and early treatment has meant that most well-treated children grow up with near-normal IQ scores, the effect of relaxing metabolic control on cognitive and executive function later in life is still not fully understood. Although it is clear from the available literature that the active control of blood phenylalanine levels is of vital importance, there are other treatment-related factors that affect outcome. A uniform and firmly evidence-based approach to the management of phenylketonuria is required.

PAH deficiency — lifelong phenylalanine targets and individualized management: The evidence strongly supports lifelong maintenance of blood Phe ≤ 360 μmol/L to obtain optimum intellectual outcomes in all individuals with PAH deficiency, and evidence continues to strongly support that lifetime Phe levels correlate with intellectual outcome. Standard of care dictates that personalized treatment goals for individuals who are untreated should be determined through shared decision making, and complete reversal of symptoms might not be feasible or realistic for every individual.

### The truth of treating patients with phenylketonuria after childhood: the need for a new guideline [^3f5c9283]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2008). Low credibility.

In recent years, an increasing number of national guidelines on the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) have emerged. Most of these guidelines are dedicated to the care of children, while less attention is paid to the care of adults, although all guidelines underline the importance of diet for life. This review aims to summarize issues that need to be addressed within a guideline on the treatment of PKU, especially when care for patients beyond childhood is concerned. In this respect, it is of importance that adult patients, both willing and unwilling to be treated, need a guideline for care and follow-up. In PKU there is certainly a need for an improved unified guideline, especially after childhood, although many of the considerations in this article also apply to recommendations for treatment of children. Such a guideline will be a tool to improve treatment in PKU patients but should also include recommendations for collecting data for clinical and research purposes. Guideline development should also focus on nutritional, neuropsychological and psychosocial issues and not only on target plasma phenylalanine concentrations. In addition, guidelines must address not only what has to be done but also how it can be done, thereby improving concordance with the recommendations for treatment and management.

### Adult phenylketonuria [^21614a74]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Newborn screening for phenylketonuria began 35 to 40 years ago in most industrialized countries. Because of this initiative, which resulted in early institution of phenylalanine-restricted diets, there are now many young adults with this disease who have normal or near-normal intellectual function. In North America alone, 200 patients with phenylketonuria enter adulthood every year. Most expert panels recommend following a phenylalanine-restricted "diet for life". However, there are few adult physicians dedicated to continuing care of this group, with the possible exception of maternal phenylketonuria. Up to 10% of adults with classic phenylketonuria, and possibly 50% of those with milder variants, may not need treatment; after adolescence, intelligence does not appear to deteriorate, at least into early adulthood, even if diet therapy is discontinued or not in good control. However, neuropsychological and psychosocial problems develop frequently, needing focused and intensive support by health care providers. New investigative methods and treatment options are on the horizon. There is an urgent need for physicians who will orchestrate the care of adults with phenylketonuria.

### Global considerations for lifelong management and therapeutic development for phenylketonuria [^d53c9f71]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of toxic phenylalanine levels in the brain that can lead to neurocognitive impairment if untreated. This review evaluates unmet needs in PKU, the importance of newborn screening (NBS), and considerations for chronic treatment options. An international group of experts reviewed the available literature across ethnicities and geographies to identify unmet needs of individuals with PKU. Treatment was assessed in a global context to address patient benefit. Reflecting challenges to the worldwide PKU community, some countries have been unable to implement NBS programs and/or do not apply a treatment-for-life approach. Ongoing challenges for individuals with PKU include maintaining adherence to treatment guidelines for patient- and practice-specific reasons, such as inadequate access to low-cost treatment, insufficient social support, limited clinical staffing, and disease burden. Dietary interventions may not adequately address all symptoms, and some of the current pharmacotherapies may be associated with limited efficacy or adverse events. Several new therapies are being evaluated for the treatment of PKU, offering the potential to address unmet needs. Global availability of NBS programs, access to treatments, and a tenacious commitment to treatment-for-life are expected to improve outcomes for individuals with PKU across geographic regions.

### Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency diagnosis and management: a 2023 evidence-based clinical guideline of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^e1b9ab68]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To replace an existing clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency.

Methods

The PAH Deficiency Guideline Workgroup used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence-to-decision framework to develop evidence summaries and practice recommendations based on the recent American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics systematic review.

Results

Many recommendations from the 2014 PAH practice guideline are recognized as standard of care in this evidence-based guideline. Key recommendations from the previous guideline that were not supported by strong evidence are now strongly supported; (1) treatment for PAH deficiency should be lifelong for individuals with untreated phenylalanine (Phe) levels > 360 μmol/L, (2) individuals with lifelong Phe levels ≤ 360 μmol/L have better intellectual outcomes than those who do not, (3) achieving Phe levels ≤ 360 μmol/L before conception is strongly recommended to prevent pregnancy complications and negative outcomes for the offspring, and (4) genetic testing for PAH variants is recommended at birth to confirm diagnosis and guide therapy.

Conclusion

We strongly recommend lifelong maintenance of Phe ≤ 360 μmol/L (using plasma or whole blood) for optimal intellectual outcomes and for reduced teratogenicity, utilizing all available and necessary dietary, pharmaceutical, and patient-educational modalities.

### Newborn screening 50 years later: access issues faced by adults with PKU [^3f928e29]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Fifty years after the implementation of universal newborn screening programs for phenylketonuria, the first disease identified through newborn screening and considered a success story of newborn screening, a cohort of adults with phenylketonuria treated from birth provides valuable information about effects of long-term treatment for inborn errors of metabolism in general, and phenylketonuria specifically. For phenylketonuria, newborn screening allows early implementation of the phenylalanine-restricted diet, eliminating the severe neurocognitive and neuromotor impairment associated with untreated phenylketonuria. However, executive function impairments and psychiatric problems are frequently reported even for those treated early and continuously with the phenylalanine-restricted diet alone. Moreover, a large percentage of adults with phenylketonuria are reported as lost to follow-up by metabolic clinics. While a group of experts identified by the National Institutes of Health convenes to update treatment guidelines for phenylketonuria, we explore individual patient, social, and economic factors preventing > 70% of adult phenylketonuria patients in the United States from accessing treatment. As more conditions are identified through newborn screening, factors affecting access to treatment grow in importance, and we must continue to be vigilant in assessing and addressing factors that affect patient treatment outcomes and not just celebrate amelioration of the most severe manifestations of disease.

Analysis of blood and/or urine pterin metabolism must be included in the follow-up of a positive NBS result. Quantitative blood amino acid analysis should be performed for follow-up of a positive NBS and should quantify Phe, Phe:Tyr ratio, and complete amino acid profile. PAH genotyping is indicated for improved therapy planning.

1 Introduction

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation(s) in the gene coding for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PAH converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine, a process that requires the enzyme cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Untreated PKU is characterized by elevated blood and brain Phe levels resulting in detrimental effects on brain development and function. Current treatment guidelines recommend lifelong blood Phe control with a goal range of 120–360 μmol/L.

Among children with PKU, it is well established that poor control of blood Phe during the first 12 years of age leads to a decrease in intelligence quotient (IQ), with the strongest inverse association between IQ and blood Phe levels appearing in children under 10 years of age. Based on this knowledge, treatment guidelines consistently recommend initiating PKU management immediately after diagnosis, which is usually soon after birth, since PKU is part of all newborn screening programs in developed countries. The mainstay of PKU treatment is a Phe-restricted diet supplemented with medical food. Early dietary treatment can prevent most severe long-term neurological and cognitive complications of PKU and can maintain intellectual functioning within the normal range. However, dietary management is challenging and poor adherence to dietary restrictions results in blood Phe levels above the guideline-recommended threshold in approximately 12–28% of children with PKU under the age of 4 years. Furthermore, care should be taken to prevent nutritional deficiencies related to dietary management, which may result in suboptimal growth outcomes.

Elevated maternal phenylalanine levels during pregnancy are teratogenic and may result in growth retardation, significant psychomotor handicaps, and birth defects in the offspring of unmonitored and untreated pregnancies. Women of childbearing age with all forms of phenylketonuria, including mild variants such as hyperphenylalaninemia, should receive counseling concerning their risks for adverse fetal effects optimally before conceiving. The best outcomes occur when strict control of maternal phenylalanine levels is achieved before conception and continued throughout the pregnancy.

### "Mild" hyperphenylalaninemia? A case series of seven treated patients following newborn screening [^d2bcaa3f]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a disorder diagnosed only incidentally by newborn screening, a by-product of screening for classic phenylketonuria (PKU) which, if untreated, causes irreversible neurologic sequelae. In contrast, HPA is thought to have a benign phenotype because phenylalanine (Phe) levels are insufficiently elevated to cause neurological damage, obviating the need for rigorous dietary protein restriction. Phenylalanine below 360μmol/L is generally considered safe, thus this threshold is both the upper therapeutic range for treated PKU and the highest Phe expected to be possible for most individuals with HPA. However, the published literature and even expert consensus provides limited guidance on long-term follow-up of Phe after this diagnosis. In particular, how frequently and vigilantly to monitor levels to evaluate for subsequent elevations above the 'safe' range. Upon retrospective review we identified 22 patients with HPA, ascertained via newborn screen and currently aged two to thirty-six years. All patients had an initial untreated Phe between 90μmol/L (our upper limit of normal) and 360μmol/L. Of these patients, seven subsequently demonstrated either fluctuating or sustained increases in Phe above 360μmol/L. Five have been treated successfully with sapropterin therapy without dietary intervention and two have been treated with mild to moderate protein restriction. Our experience demonstrates successful treatment of these children without the traditional highly restrictive PKU diet. However, a better understanding of this disorder is necessary to more safely and appropriately identify, monitor and manage children with HPA.

### How practical are recommendations for dietary control in phenylketonuria? [^3de87e24]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

In patients with phenylketonuria, blood phenylalanine concentration during childhood is the major determinant of cognitive outcome. Guidelines provide age-related recommendations for treatment. To ascertain the extent to which these aims are achievable, we audited results from four centres for the years 1994–2000. The median proportion of samples with phenylalanine concentrations above those recommended was less than 30% for those younger than age 10 years but almost 80% for those aged 15 years and older. Similarly, the median frequency of blood sampling, expressed as a proportion of that recommended, was more than 80% for patients younger than 10 years but less than 50% by age 15 years. Our results indicate the difficulty of maintaining control in phenylketonuria, especially in older rather than younger children.

### Commentary: what degree of hyperphenylalaninaemia requires treatment? [^fb079677]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Despite some 50 years' experience in the treatment of phenylketonuria and numerous scientific publications on the subject there is no clear consensus as to what degree of hyperphenylalaninaemia will result in intellectual impairment. Studies of three main types, on untreated cases of moderate hyperphenylalaninaemia, on treated cases of phenylketonuria, and on the effects of current blood phenylalanine concentration on executive function, have lead to different conclusions. Overall, there appears to be a fairly strong case for limiting dietary treatment to individuals whose blood phenylalanine levels would otherwise exceed 600 μmol/L. This is now policy in some European countries but a formal large-scale study of long-term outcomes to validate the approach is urgently required.

Performance of laboratory tests used to measure blood phenylalanine for the monitoring of patients with phenylketonuria 3 2020 By Moat, Stuart J.; Schulenburg-Brand, Danja; Lemonde, Hugh;. Source: J Inherit Metab Dis. 43: 179–188 English. Details: Alternative Title: J Inherit Metab Dis Personal Author: Description: Analysis of blood phenylalanine is central to the monitoring of patients with phenylketonuria and age-related phenylalanine target treatment-ranges are recommended in order to prevent adverse neurological outcomes.

These target treatment-ranges are based upon plasma phenylalanine concentrations. However, patients are routinely monitored using dried bloodspot specimens due to the convenience of collection. Significant differences exist between phenylalanine concentrations in plasma and DBS, with phenylalanine concentrations in DBS specimens analyzed by flow-injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry reported to be 18% to 28% lower than paired plasma concentrations analyzed using ion-exchange chromatography. DBS specimens with phenylalanine concentrations of 360 and 600 μmol/L, at the critical upper-target treatment-range thresholds would be plasma equivalents of 461 and 768 μmol/L, respectively, when a reported difference of 28% is taken into account. Furthermore, analytical test imprecision and bias in conjunction with pre-analytical factors such as volume and quality of blood applied to filter paper collection devices to produce DBS specimens affect the final test results.

Reporting of inaccurate patient results when comparing DBS results to target treatment-ranges based on plasma concentrations, together with inter-laboratory imprecision could have a significant impact on patient management resulting in inappropriate dietary change and potentially adverse patient outcomes. This review is intended to provide perspective on the issues related to the measurement of phenylalanine in blood specimens and to provide direction for the future needs of PKU patients to ensure reliable monitoring of metabolic control using the target treatment-ranges.

### Key European guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with phenylketonuria [^8bd47b90]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

We developed European guidelines to optimise phenylketonuria (PKU) care. To develop the guidelines, we did a literature search, critical appraisal, and evidence grading according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network method. We used the Delphi method when little or no evidence was available. From the 70 recommendations formulated, in this Review we describe ten that we deem as having the highest priority. Diet is the cornerstone of treatment, although some patients can benefit from tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Untreated blood phenylalanine concentrations determine management of people with PKU. No intervention is required if the blood phenylalanine concentration is less than 360 μmol/L. Treatment is recommended up to the age of 12 years if the phenylalanine blood concentration is between 360 μmol/L and 600 μmol/L, and lifelong treatment is recommended if the concentration is more than 600 μmol/L. For women trying to conceive and during pregnancy (maternal PKU), untreated phenylalanine blood concentrations of more than 360 μmol/L need to be reduced. Treatment target concentrations are as follows: 120–360 μmol/L for individuals aged 0–12 years and for maternal PKU, and 120–600 μmol/L for non-pregnant individuals older than 12 years. Minimum requirements for the management and follow-up of patients with PKU are scheduled according to age, adherence to treatment, and clinical status. Nutritional, clinical, and biochemical follow-up is necessary for all patients, regardless of therapy.

### Follow up of phenylketonuria patients [^dd5851c4]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

In recent years our understanding of the follow up policies for PKU has increased substantially. In particular, we now understand the importance of maintaining control of blood phenylalanine (phe) concentrations life-long to achieve the best long-term neuropsychological outcomes. The concordance with the follow up strategy remains a key challenge for the future, especially with respect to adolescents and young adults. The recent therapies could ease the burden of the dietary phe restriction for PKU patients and their families. The time may be right for revisiting the guidelines for follow up of PKU in order to address a number of important issues related to PKU management: promotion of breastfeeding to complementary feeding up to 2 years of age for prevention of early growth retardation and later overweight development, treatment advancements for metabolic control, blood phe and tyr variability, routine screening measures for nutritional biomarkers, neurocognitive and psychological assessments, bone pathology, understanding the challenges of compliance and transitioning into adulthood as an individual with PKU and addressing unmet needs in this population.

### Newborn phenylalanine / tyrosine metabolism… [^a4c163ef]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Controversy over the sensitivity of newborn screening for phenylketonuria has recently led to the specific recommendation that infants discharged within the first 24 hours of life be routinely retested at 1 to 2 weeks of age. To address this controversy, data from cord blood samples, phenylalanine tolerance tests at 3 days of age, and sequential plasma Phe determinations in six siblings of known cases of PKU or hyperphenylalaninemia were analyzed, along with data from the literature. These analyses showed that normal and probably heterozygous infants decrease their Phe concentrations with age, while infants with PKU or PKU variants increase their Phe concentrations with age but at varying rates. Predictive equations showed that the sensitivity of the screening test rapidly increases with age, so that the usual critical value of 4 mg/dL is satisfactory for suspecting PKU after 18 hours of age.

A critical value of 3 mg/dL would be equally satisfactory at any age, if the Guthrie test were appropriately modified to include a 3-mg/dL standard. Schneider AJ. Newborn Phenylalanine/Tyrosine Metabolism: Implications for Screening for Phenylketonuria. Am J Dis Child. 1983; 137: 427–432.

### Newborn screening 50 years later: access issues faced by adults with PKU [^afe3cf45]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Many practitioners in the early 1970s believed that elevated Phe levels would no longer have negative effects once the brain was fully developed. As such, at that time, the Phe-restricted diet was deemed unnecessary after 6 years of age, when the brain was considered nearly fully developed, and therefore many supported early diet discontinuation. However, other experts recommended continuing dietary treatment beyond 6 years due to the presence of deterioration in performance, hyperactivity, and seizures. Gender was also considered a reason to continue treatment; specifically, the continued treatment of females for prevention of maternal PKU syndrome, which causes microcephaly, intrauterine growth retardation, congenital heart disease, and neurocognitive impairment in the offspring of women with PKU who have uncontrolled Phe levels during pregnancy.

As early as 1967, it was noted that exposure to elevated blood Phe was associated with declining intelligence quotient. Despite this, a 1980 survey of clinicians treating children with PKU indicated that some clinics allowed the diet to be "liberalized" as children aged. Even the two largest clinics in the United States reported discontinuing diet for all patients at 3 and 5–6 years of age without any intention to change their practice. During this period, three national collaborative studies were under way to compare the effects of continuing versus discontinuing dietary therapy. Accumulating evidence during this time led many clinicians to continue diet treatment while awaiting the outcome of these larger studies and the emergence of a consensus on the care of these patients. For example, one of the authors (S.C.), who was not part of any formal study, saw his first patient with PKU in 1971 and never recommended discontinuing diet, although a number of his patients elected to stop dietary restriction independent of medical advice.

Regarding specific circumstances for phenylketonuria, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, treatment targets, ACMG 2025 guidelines recommend to maintain phenylalanine levels ≤ 360 mcmol/L for the duration of pregnancy and postpartum time, including the use of medical foods, dietary compliance, or medical treatment to provide optimal maternal and infant outcomes in pregnant patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.

### Phenylketonuria [^5f1ad64a]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Phenylketonuria is the most prevalent disorder caused by an inborn error in aminoacid metabolism. It results from mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. Phenotypes can vary from a very mild increase in blood phenylalanine concentrations to a severe classic phenotype with pronounced hyperphenylalaninaemia, which, if untreated, results in profound and irreversible mental disability. Neonatal screening programmes identify individuals with phenylketonuria. The initiation of a phenylalanine-restricted diet very soon after birth prevents most of the neuropsychological complications. However, the diet is difficult to maintain and compliance is often poor, especially in adolescents, young adults, and pregnant women. Tetrahydrobiopterin stimulates phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in about 20% of patients, and in those patients serves as a useful adjunct to the phenylalanine-restricted diet because it increases phenylalanine tolerance and allows some dietary freedom. Possible future treatments include enzyme substitution with phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which degrades phenylalanine, and gene therapy to restore phenylalanine hydroxylase activity.

### Issues in newborn screening for phenylketonuria… [^8cc9aec9]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Untreated, PKU results in severe mental retardation, but the exact pathogenesis of the mental defect is still not clear. 1–3 Progressive neurologic damage occurs as the child grows older. Because treatment with a phenylalanine-restricted diet prevents the development of mental retardation, it seems likely that an increased concentration of phenylalanine in the blood is associated in some way with progressive neurologic deterioration if PKU remains untreated. The symptoms of untreated PKU develop gradually, so they may not be noticed until irreversible mental retardation has occurred. Hence, newborn screening is essential for prevention of harmful effects. When PKU is identified in the first few weeks of life and a phenylalanine-restricted diet is instituted, intellectual development is substantially better than when the disorder is diagnosed at three to five years of age. When PKU is not diagnosed until this late age, serious damage has usually already occurred.

4 Initial estimates of the frequency of PKU were based on institutionalized populations with profound mental retardation caused by defects that completely prevented the production of phenylalanine hydroxylase. NORMAL AND ABNORMAL PHENYLALANINE LEVELS IN INFANTS The blood phenylalanine concentration in newborns is normally 0. 5 mg to 1 mg per dL. In general, few infants with PKU will remain unidentified when a phenylalanine cut-off value of 2 mg per dL in the first 24 hours is used. 10 Some newborns without PKU have transiently elevated phenylalanine levels of more than 6 mg per dL related to delayed maturation of enzymes required for amino acid metabolism. Blood phenylalanine levels are generally slightly lower in breast-fed infants than in bottle-fed infants. Breast milk contains only 12 to 14 mg of phenylalanine per ounce, compared with 24 to 28 mg per ounce in formula.

Because PKU is a heterogeneous disorder, phenylalanine levels vary greatly in infants with the disease. However, treatment is usually not necessary in infants who persistently demonstrate blood phenylalanine concentrations of less than 10 mg per dL. Such cases are mild and permit production of phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, as in the normal person. 11 Persons with severe mutations have much higher phenylalanine levels. To be completely certain of the diagnosis, follow-up testing is recommended in male infants with initial phenylalanine levels between 3 and 10 mg per dL and in female infants with values between 4 and 10 mg per dL. 12 Affected females should be followed through their reproductive years to prevent impaired fetal neurologic development as a result of maternal PKU.
13.

VERIFICATION OF POSITIVE RESULTS When the initial newborn screening test and the second test show positive results, a confirmatory quantitative test, such as the McCamon-Robins fluorometric test, should be performed by a laboratory at a referral metabolic center. The infant should be referred to a center capable of providing the required medical, nutritional and laboratory services for infants with PKU. While the phenylalanine-restricted diet requires the assistance of health care professionals experienced in the management of PKU, the family physician should continue to provide routine care, including immunizations. Follow-up developmental testing before kindergarten is recommended. Nutritional Therapy for Infants Mothers of infants with PKU should be encouraged to breast feed, along with giving the infant the special phenylalanine-free formula product.

### Long-term treatment of phenylketonuria with a new medical food containing large neutral amino acids [^b41e8ef2]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Diet for life is the accepted treatment for PKU. The lack of diet adherence in the treatment of PKU is of concern. The NIH National Consensus Committee for Treatment of PKUin the United States most recently recommended target blood Phe concentrations of < 6 mg/dl (360 μmol/l) for all ages. Difficulty in maintaining blood Phe in the recommended range in adolescents has been documented. Dietary treatment for PKU requires intake of a Phe-free medical food and measured servings of Phe-containing foods to maintain blood Phe concentrations in the desired treatment range. The amount and types of foods that can be eaten are limited, and this makes it difficult for adolescents to comply with diet. Methods to improve dietary adherence in PKU patients and improve blood Phe control are greatly needed.

### Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency [^3d274e9b]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in intolerance to the dietary intake of the essential amino acid phenylalanine. It occurs in approximately 1:15,000 individuals. Deficiency of this enzyme produces a spectrum of disorders including classic phenylketonuria, mild phenylketonuria, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia. Classic phenylketonuria is caused by a complete or near-complete deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity and without dietary restriction of phenylalanine most children will develop profound and irreversible intellectual disability. Mild phenylketonuria and mild hyperphenylalaninemia are associated with lower risk of impaired cognitive development in the absence of treatment. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency can be diagnosed by newborn screening based on detection of the presence of hyperphenylalaninemia using the Guthrie microbial inhibition assay or other assays on a blood spot obtained from a heel prick. Since the introduction of newborn screening, the major neurologic consequences of hyperphenylalaninemia have been largely eradicated. Affected individuals can lead normal lives. However, recent data suggest that homeostasis is not fully restored with current therapy. Treated individuals have a higher incidence of neuropsychological problems. The mainstay of treatment for hyperphenylalaninemia involves a low-protein diet and use of a phenylalanine-free medical formula. This treatment must commence as soon as possible after birth and should continue for life. Regular monitoring of plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations is necessary. Targets of plasma phenylalanine of 120–360 μmol/L (2–6 mg/dL) in the first decade of life are essential for optimal outcome. Phenylalanine targets in adolescence and adulthood are less clear. A significant proportion of patients with phenylketonuria may benefit from adjuvant therapy with 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin stereoisomer. Special consideration must be given to adult women with hyperphenylalaninemia because of the teratogenic effects of phenylalanine. Women with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency considering pregnancy should follow special guidelines and assure adequate energy intake with the proper proportion of protein, fat, and carbohydrates to minimize risks to the developing fetus. Molecular genetic testing of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene is available for genetic counseling purposes to determine carrier status of at-risk relatives and for prenatal testing.

5 Conclusions

PKU has been studied extensively for over nine decades, resulting in a detailed understanding of its molecular and clinical aspects. This wealth of data calls for effective tools to analyze and apply findings for patient benefit. While updating guidelines and implementing new strategies may take time, timely access to the latest research is essential to improve patient care and quality of life. A translational approach — bridging research and clinical practice — can be advanced through web‐based platforms that publish functional studies in real time, enabling treatment adjustments. Genetic diagnostics, increasingly implemented in PKU management, should not only confirm the diagnosis but also guide personalized therapy. This approach can serve as a model for individualized care in other rare diseases.

An NIH State-of-the-Science Conference was convened in 2012 to address new findings, particularly the use of the medication sapropterin to treat some individuals with PKU, and to develop a research agenda. Prior to the 2012 conference, five working groups of experts and public members met over a 1-year period. The working groups addressed the following: long-term outcomes and management across the lifespan; PKU and pregnancy; diet control and management; pharmacologic interventions; and molecular testing, new technologies, and epidemiologic considerations. In a parallel and independent activity, an Evidence-based Practice Center supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted a systematic review of adjuvant treatments for PKU; its conclusions were presented at the conference. The conference included the findings of the working groups, panel discussions from industry and international perspectives, and presentations on topics such as emerging treatments for PKU, transitioning to adult care, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory perspective. Over 85 experts participated in the conference through information gathering and/or as presenters during the conference, and they reached several important conclusions. The most serious neurological impairments in PKU are preventable with current dietary treatment approaches. However, a variety of more subtle physical, cognitive, and behavioral consequences of even well-controlled PKU are now recognized. The best outcomes in maternal PKU occur when blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations are maintained between 120 and 360 μmol/L before and during pregnancy. The dietary management treatment goal for individuals with PKU is a blood Phe concentration between 120 and 360 μmol/L. The use of genotype information in the newborn period may yield valuable insights about the severity of the condition for infants diagnosed before maximal Phe levels are achieved. While emerging and established genotype-phenotype correlations may transform our understanding of PKU, establishing correlations with intellectual outcomes is more challenging. Regarding the use of sapropterin in PKU, there are significant gaps in predicting response to treatment; at least half of those with PKU will have either minimal or no response. A coordinated approach to PKU treatment improves long-term outcomes for those with PKU and facilitates the conduct of research to improve diagnosis and treatment. New drugs that are safe, efficacious, and impact a larger proportion of individuals with PKU are needed. However, it is imperative that treatment guidelines and the decision processes for determining access to treatments be tied to a solid evidence base with rigorous standards for robust and consistent data collection. The process that preceded the PKU State-of-the-Science Conference, the conference itself, and the identification of a research agenda have facilitated the development of clinical practice guidelines by professional organizations and serve as a model for other inborn errors of metabolism.

### Long-term follow-up study of patients with phenylketonuria detected by the newborn screening programme in Japan [^9780c00c]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this report is to determine the need for and value of the long-term follow-up study of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients detected by newborn screening (NBS) in Japan. NBS was started in 1977 and the nationwide follow-up study of the identified patients was introduced into the NBS system. Outcome data from the continuous follow-up study showed in 1993 that IQ of PKU patients was inversely correlated with blood phenylalanine levels. Accordingly, in 1995, new treatment guidelines were issued that involved more stringent restriction of phenylalanine levels. Follow-up data confirmed that mean blood phenylalanine levels decreased after the introduction of the new guidelines, which included the recommendation to start dietary treatment within 20 days postpartum. Follow-up data also confirmed that dietary treatment did in fact commence earlier after the guidelines were issued. The need for lifelong dietary treatment is a difficult issue and the number of patients who stop dietary treatment was found to increase gradually with age. At present 60% of PKU patients born between 1977 and 1981 have stopped their dietary restriction of phenylalanine. The data gained from NBS and the long-term follow-up study were found to be valuable for the improvement of blood phenylalanine levels for patients with PKU, indicating the need for parties responsible for NBS and the follow-up study of the identified patients to work cooperatively. Further, the evaluations of the effectiveness of the two initiatives as well as the treatment guidelines issued should be based on outcome data, which depend on the continuation of the follow-up study of patients with PKU.

### Towards precision medicine for phenylketonuria: the effect of restoring a strict metabolic control in adult patients with early-treated phenylketonuria [^08d3b96c]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Neonatal screening and early treatment have changed the natural history of PKU, preventing severe neurological and intellectual disability. Nevertheless, the outcome of the disease in early-treated adult patients (ETPKU) is less than optimal, the predictive value of metabolic biomarkers is feeble, and the recommended levels of blood phenylalanine (Phe) for adulthood are controversial. A crucial question whose answer will improve our understanding and treatment of PKU is whether cognitive outcomes can be modulated by levels of Phe even in early-treated adults. To address this question, we carried out an interventional study in seven ETPKU women planning a pregnancy.

Methods

They underwent an extensive neurocognitive assessment at baseline, and 3 and 6 months after having attained the blood Phe concentration recommended to prevent PKU fetopathy, but before pregnancy.

Results

After 3 and 6 months with a stable blood Phe level of about 240 μmol/L, all participants experienced significant improvements in almost all neurocognitive domains and tasks. IQ also increased of 11 to 21 points from the last assessment before enrolment. This pattern remained strong and consistent after correction for multiple comparisons.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that a) strong cognitive improvement is possible even in adulthood and may be demonstrated by lowering Phe near normal levels; b) testing cognition under different metabolic conditions may unveil an individual vulnerability to Phe. These results pave the way for personalised treatment of the disease in adults with ETPKU.

### Characterisation and differential diagnosis of neurological complications in adults with phenylketonuria: literature review and expert opinion [^d947df19]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurological deficits are commonly reported in late-diagnosed patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Deficiency of PAH prevents the conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine, inducing a state of hypotyrosinemia along with elevated blood Phe concentrations that compete with large neutral amino acids at the L-type amino acid carrier (LAT1) at the blood–brain barrier. Through disturbed monoamine neurotransmitter and cerebral protein synthesis, untreated patients with PKU are prone to develop significant developmental delay and severe neurological disability. Since the implementation of newborn screening programmes for PKU, most patients are treated shortly and continuously after birth, preventing severe complications by restricting the intake of dietary Phe with or without supplementation of sapropterin dihydrochloride. Despite early diagnosis, neurological manifestations can still present in adulthood, mainly because a substantial proportion of early treated adult patients have blood Phe concentrations above guideline-recommended target ranges (European target: 120–600 µmol/L; United States [US] target: 120–360 µmol/L). The complexity and burden of the Phe-restricted diet are the main reasons for the deteriorating treatment adherence, which usually starts in late childhood. Although current European and US guidelines recommend lifelong treatment, relaxation of the Phe-restricted diet in adulthood is common practice in Germany due to the former recommendation to maintain blood Phe concentrations below 1200 µmol/L after the age of 15 years. In some cases, treatment discontinuation coincides with declining in-clinic attendance. Besides the burden of treatment, the historical focus of PKU care on the paediatric population and absence of paediatric-to-adult-care transition programmes have substantially contributed to lost to follow-up numbers that are reported to be as high as 50% of the adult PKU population, resulting in a significant number of patients with poor metabolic control in adulthood who are also prone to develop nutritional deficiencies.

### Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency diagnosis and management: a 2023 evidence-based clinical guideline of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^bf97eaa7]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

ACMG Practice Guideline — confirmatory molecular genetic testing: ACMG strongly recommends confirmatory molecular genetic testing in individuals with PAH deficiency (Strong recommendation, based on high certainty of evidence.). PAH variant analysis is not required for initial treatment of babies with elevated Phe levels identified by NBS, which is based on measuring blood Phe levels and exclusion of cofactor BH4 deficiency using biochemical analysis. However, formal confirmation of the diagnosis of PAH deficiency can only be achieved through molecular analysis. PAH genetic testing can inform individual clinical diagnosis and personalized treatment options and should be offered to all individuals at risk for developing elevated Phe levels due to PAH deficiency. Although mostly variants of uncertain significance, more than 3350 PAH variants have been recorded in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Gene Locus-Specific Database (PAHdb), and the ClinVar database contains 766 pathogenic or likely pathogenic PAH variants including 416 missense, 132 frameshift, 78 nonsense, and 76 splice site variants. The SER workgroup reviewed 16 studies reporting genotype-phenotype associations in individuals with PAH deficiency, and results for sapropterin/BH4 responsiveness were only available from 9 of the 16 studies.

### Predictability and inconsistencies of cognitive outcome in patients with phenylketonuria and personalised therapy: the challenge for the future guidelines [^068f4eec]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a prototypical model of a neurodevelopmental metabolic disease that follows a cascade of pathological events affecting brain maturation and functioning. Neonatal screening and early treatment have eradicated the classical PKU phenotype in patients with early and continuously treated phenylketonuria (ECTPKU). However, effort is required to optimise the treatment of the disease to minimise the risk of lifelong neurological, cognitive and behavioural impairment, and to solve issues on the variability in clinical outcome that are rather not understood and has yet hampered a more personalised approach to its treatment. The aim of the present review is to focus on the inconsistencies in the clinical outcome of adult patients with ECTPKU unexplained by the biochemical markers adopted for the monitoring of the disease to date. The interindividual variability of clinical outcome in late as well as in early treated patients under similar biochemical control suggests the existence of disease-independent determinants influencing the individual vulnerability to the neurotoxic effect of phenylalanine. This is further supported by the low predictive power of blood phenylalanine on the clinical outcome from the second decade of life onwards. In conclusion, individual vulnerability to the metabolic alterations of PKU contributes to the prognosis of PKU, also in patients with ECTPKU. The biological factors constitutive of this vulnerability are unknown (but have not been the object of many studies so far) and should be the target of further research as prerequisite for a personalised treatment aimed at avoiding burden and costs of overtreatment and clinical consequences and risks of undertreatment in patients with PKU.

### Newborn screening 50 years later: access issues faced by adults with PKU [^8c5c94db]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Now, 50 years after the implementation of screening for PKU, a cohort of adults with PKU who were treated from birth provides valuable information about long-term treatment effects for inborn errors of metabolism in general and PKU specifically. We know that individuals with PKU fare best with treatment for life to maintain Phe levels within the recommended range. We are also aware that despite this, neurocognitive impairments such as poorer executive function skills and psychiatric problems are frequently reported even in early and continuously treated individuals with PKU.

With these frequent reports of suboptimal outcomes in the literature, and the advent of new treatment options for PKU such as sapropterin dihydrochloride (sapropterin, Kuvan), large neutral amino acid supplementation, and glycomacropeptide foods, the NIH reconvened an expert group in 2012 to assess the current state of PKU treatment. This conference was a forum for review of data recently generated from the Agency for Health Research Quality on the state of PKU treatment in the United States. The report supports lifetime maintenance of blood Phe levels of 120–360 µmol/l and the association between long-term high Phe levels and development of neurocognitive impairment and psychological disturbances. The NIH conference also supported the need to update the 2000 NIH PKU treatment recommendations. Questions specifically applicable to PKU but also relevant to the more than 30 disorders detected by NBS arose during the conference: Are individuals with PKU accessing appropriate treatment to manage their PKU? What factors influence the individual with PKU to access treatment?

While a group of members from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International update the NIH treatment guidelines for PKU, we attempt to address these questions from the perspective of the US health-care system, looking specifically at the question of access to the health-care services required throughout life to treat PKU. We explore the long-term access to treatment for this patient population and identify areas that should be strengthened to continue improving treatment of individuals with PKU and provide potential insights into the future management of other diseases now identified through NBS programs.

### Committee opinion no: 636: management of women with phenylketonuria [^1d4c8761]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism characterized by deficient activity of the hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase. Increased blood Phe levels are toxic to a variety of tissues, particularly the developing fetal brain. The mainstay of treatment for PKU is the dietary restriction of Phe, which results in decreased blood Phe levels. Lifelong dietary restriction and therapy improves quality of life in patients with PKU and should be encouraged. Genetic counseling is recommended for all reproductive-aged women with PKU, and should include information on reproductive choices and family planning as well as management of maternal PKU. If possible, pregnant women with PKU or hyperphenylalaninemia should be monitored in consultation with practitioners from experienced PKU centers. Optimally, treatment of neonates diagnosed with PKU should be initiated within the first week of life. All unaffected children of women with PKU are carriers and should receive genetic counseling when they are able to understand the consequences. Consultation with a genetics professional to discuss reproductive options is recommended.

### High phenylalanine levels directly affect mood and sustained attention in adults with phenylketonuria: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial [^e149c5a4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Phenylketonuria (PKU; OMIM 261600) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH; EC 1.14.16.1), which catalyses the conversion of the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. PKU is a pan-ethnic disease with an estimated birth prevalence varying from 1:2,500 to 1:125,000 (Scriver et al.), and it has been diagnosed in approximately 13,000 people in the U.S. and 50,000 people worldwide. The enzyme deficiency results in a high concentration of Phe which is neurotoxic, particularly during the first years of life (Albrecht et al.). Untreated PKU results in severe intellectual disability and neurological sequelae (Scriver et al.). Since the 1960s, these complications can be prevented by detection through newborn screening followed by dietary treatment consisting of a restriction of Phe intake by a protein-restricted diet and supplementation of all amino acids but Phe. However, a highly controversial issue in the treatment of PKU is whether a strict dietary control of Phe levels is still necessary in adults. With the first PKU patients detected by newborn screening now in their 40s, there is a rapidly growing cohort of adults with early and continuously treated PKU for whom evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking. Current dietary guidelines for adults vary widely (Van Spronsen et al.), and in some countries relaxation of the diet in adolescence is common practice (Schweitzer-Krantz and Burgard). Dietary relaxation for adults might be considered safe on the basis of the observation that discontinuation of the diet does not cause a major decrease in IQ in adults (Burgard). However, mild cognitive sequelae including executive function deficits have been reported (Christ et al.). These deficits, associated with concurrent high Phe levels, have been observed in both children and adults (Huijbregts et al; Schmidt et al.). In other disorders, impairments in executive function have been correlated with deficits in social relationships and communication skills (Beauchamp and Anderson). Self reports by PKU patients as well as experiences of treating physicians, including ourselves, suggest that high Phe levels may in some cases result in irritability, impacting on adaptive social skills However, the effect of high Phe levels on mood in continuously treated adults with PKU has never been studied.

Pregnancy management in PAH deficiency emphasizes preconception and periconception phenylalanine (Phe) control, with a stated target threshold. The findings underscore the importance of maintaining a Phe level of ≤ 360 μmol/L throughout the lifespan for individuals who may become pregnant, given significantly reduced risk for negative outcomes when Phe control is attained in the pre- and periconception period.

### Management of phenylketonuria in Europe: survey results from 19 countries [^9762bd29]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

To gain better insight in the most current diagnosis and treatment practices for phenylketonuria (PKU) from a broad group of experts, a European PKU survey was performed. The questionnaire, consisting of 33 questions, was sent to 243 PKU professionals in 165 PKU centers in 23 European countries. The responses were compiled and descriptive analyses were performed. One hundred and one questionnaires were returned by 93/165 centers (56%) from 19/23 European countries (83%). The majority of respondents (77%) managed patients of all age groups and more than 90% of PKU teams included physicians or dieticians/nutritionists. The greatest variability existed especially in the definition of PKU phenotypes, therapeutic blood phenylalanine (Phe) target concentrations, and follow-up practices for PKU patients. The tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4; sapropterin) loading test was performed by 54% of respondents, of which 61% applied a single dose test (20mg/kg over 24h). BH4 was reported as a treatment option by 34%. This survey documents differences in diagnostic and treatment practices for PKU patients in European centers. In particular, recommendations for the treatment decision varied greatly between different European countries. There is an urgent need to pool long-term data in PKU registries in order to generate an evidence-based international guideline.

### Adverse medical outcomes of early newborn screening programs for phenylketonuria [^aaee923e]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the success of current newborn screening programs, some critics have argued that in the 1960s hundreds of children with false-positive results for phenylketonuria suffered death or disability from treatment with restrictive diets. Medically adverse outcomes after false-positive results may be a reason to be cautious when expanding current newborn screening programs. We sought to determine if newborn screening programs for phenylketonuria before 1980 led to adverse medical outcomes in children with false-positive results.

Patients and Methods

We examined the history of newborn screening programs for phenylketonuria in the United States. We reviewed the historical scholarship, conducted a systematic search for medical adverse outcomes, and interviewed key participants in the history of newborn screening programs.

Results

We found no population-based studies of early screening programs for phenylketonuria. One author reported 2 infants treated with restrictive diets after false-positive results for phenylketonuria who were developmentally delayed, and there is unpublished evidence of 4 additional cases of inappropriate treatment, although adverse outcomes were not documented. There were also 4 published reports of adverse medical outcomes after treating children with phenylketonuria variants, as screening for phenylketonuria revealed infants with intermediate or transiently high levels of phenylalanine.

Conclusions

We found little evidence of death or disability that resulted from the inappropriate treatment of well children who were falsely identified by early newborn screening programs. Because the first decade of newborn screening typically reveals diagnostic and therapeutic complexity, systematic follow-up of screened populations and rapid dissemination of results may reduce morbidity/mortality rates.

### Coexistence of phenylketonuria and tyrosinemia type 3: challenges in the dietary management [^9f5843c8]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Phenylketonuria (PKU) and tyrosinemia type 3 (HT3) are both rare autosomal recessive disorders of phenylalanine-tyrosine metabolism. PKU is caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), leading to elevated phenylalanine (Phe) and reduced tyrosine (Tyr) levels. HT3, the rarest form of tyrosinemia, is due to a deficiency in 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD).

Case Presentation

We report a 5-year-old girl diagnosed with both PKU and HT3. She presented with elevated Phe levels in neonatal screening, and subsequent biochemical tests revealed both hyperphenylalaninemia and elevated Tyr levels. Genetic analysis confirmed the diagnoses, identifying homozygous mutations in both the PAH and HPD genes. Dietary management to maintain optimal Phe and Tyr levels proved to be challenging due to the presence of these two coexisting pathologies especially during infections and due to dietary non-compliance, necessitating frequent adjustments in the treatment strategy.

Conclusions

This case highlights the importance of considering multiple metabolic disorders in patients with unexplained clinical and biochemical findings. Early diagnosis and stringent dietary management are crucial for preventing neurological damage and ensuring favorable outcomes in patients with concurrent metabolic disorders.

### Achieving the "triple aim" for inborn errors of metabolism: a review of challenges to outcomes research and presentation of a new practice-based evidence framework [^b1834b35]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical heterogeneity, example 1: When does non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia require treatment? Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is associated with intolerance to dietary intake of the amino acid phenylalanine and results in a spectrum of disorders ranging from classical PKU to non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (non-PKU HPA) (Figure 2). Classical phenylketonuria (PKU) is usually defined as an untreated blood phenylalanine concentration of > 1,200 µmol/l or low tolerance to dietary phenylalanine. Non-PKU HPA describes individuals whose phenylalanine levels are above normal (> 120 µmol/l) but typically < 600 µmol/l (although some centers define the upper limit for non-PKU HPA as < 360 µmol/l, with higher levels defined as PKU). The vast majority of untreated children with classical PKU show impaired cognitive development. The generally accepted goal of treatment, primarily through dietary therapy, is reduction of blood phenylalanine into the therapeutic range (often defined as 120–360 µmol/l) and thus prevention of cognitive deficits. However, an issue of debate is whether patients with mild non-PKU HPA need to be treated. Specifically, it is unclear whether those whose blood phenylalanine levels are elevated but consistently below 600 µmol/l are at risk of intellectual impairment. There is variation in the classification and treatment of non-PKU HPA, with implications for patients, families, and the health-care system. For example, in Canada, costs for therapy per patient can be $20,000 to > $100,000/year. There is a need for research to better understand the association between the choice of blood phenylalanine cutoff for initiation of treatment and outcomes that include neuropsychological development, health-related quality of life, and costs of care.

### Central precocious puberty in a 3 year-old girl with phenylketonuria: a rare association? [^e3a64094]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A girl was referred to our endocrinology outpatient clinic at 3.2 years with a one year history of increasing breast enlargement followed by the development of pubic hair, body odour and brown vaginal discharge. She had been born at 38 weeks gestation by caesarean section due to maternal pre-eclampsia, birth weight 2.7 kg (−0.72 SD). Her family history was negative for developmental anomalies. Newborn screening revealed HP with a Phe level of 435 μmol/L on day 5 and she was started on dietary treatment from day 9 of life once severe isolated hyperphenylalaninaemia had been confirmed with plasma amino acid analysis (975 μmol/L). Bi-directional sequence analysis of the PAH gene identified two heterozygote mutations: p. Phe39Leu which is associated with a variably severe phenotype, as well as a second well-characterised null mutation, p. Pro281Leu. Her phenylalanine tolerance remained around 200 mg per day throughout the first 2.5 years of life. She showed normal neurodevelopment but for transitory mild speech delay. From infancy to the time of referral the girl underwent weekly Phe measurements with median (range) values of 194 μmol/L (63–527) and thus almost exclusively within the target range of 120–360 micromol/l for children from 0 to 5 years of age in the UK (Figure 1). On examination in the endocrine clinic the girl was tall in comparison to her parents' height, 0.8 SDS according to normal reference, while her mid parental height (MPH) was −1.2 SDS, with a height corrected for MPH of 2.0 SDS. Pubertal staging according to Tanner's method was assessed at B4, P2, A1.

### The role of intelligence in phenylketonuria: a review of research and management [^56a95a0e]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) results in profound intellectual disability in untreated individuals and more subtle cognitive deficits in individuals treated early and continuously. The assessment of intellectual functioning has been an important outcome variable and the focus of extensive research. Since the implementation of neonatal PKU screening programs in the 1960s, research on intellectual functioning in individuals with PKU has played a significant and positive role in guiding therapy and improving results. This is a literature review examining the relationship between intellectual outcome and treatment parameters including initiation of treatment, duration of treatment, and blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels from infancy through adulthood. While current PKU treatment practices have eliminated severe neurological and cognitive impairment, evidence suggests that intellectual functioning, although typically within the average range when PKU is treated early and continuously, may not be maximized under the current definition of well-controlled PKU, which is based on blood Phe levels. Future research assessing intellectual and neurocognitive outcome in PKU will enhance the development of new treatment strategies.

### Newborn screening 50 years later: access issues faced by adults with PKU [^c37aa03c]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In 1991, the National PKU Collaborative Study reported on the first cohort of 12-year-old children diagnosed through NBS. Patients randomized to discontinue diet at 6 years of age were found to have reduced cognitive functioning when compared with those who had remained on diet, reinforcing the association between high Phe concentrations and impaired cognitive function. In 1998, many patients who participated in this study as children were reassessed as adults to evaluate the long-term effects of dietary discontinuation into adulthood. This study revealed that the adults who did not discontinue diet obtained higher scores on measures of verbal intelligence and full-scale intelligence quotient scores than those who discontinued diet. In addition, those who discontinued diet were found to have high incidence of recurrent headaches (31%), neurological abnormalities (24%), hyperactivity (14%), and lethargy (19%), whereas none of these problems were reported by those who continued diet. Mental problems such as phobias and depression were also more frequently reported in those who discontinued versus those who continued diet.

In response to the growing data on the effects of dietary discontinuation and lack of consistent management of PKU, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened a conference in 2000 to develop the first treatment guidelines for PKU. Recommendations included lifetime adherence to the Phe-restricted diet with maintenance of blood Phe levels between 120 and 360 µmol/l from infancy to 12 years of age, between 120 and 600 µmol/l during adolescence, and between 120 and 900 µmol/l into adulthood. The guidelines recommended that any woman planning pregnancy resume treatment before conception to achieve Phe levels of 120–360 µmol/l and maintain these levels throughout pregnancy to reduce the risk of effects of elevated blood Phe levels on the fetus. Monitoring recommendations included measuring blood Phe levels one to two times weekly for the first year of life, twice monthly from 1 to 12 years, monthly after 12 years, and twice weekly during pregnancy. These treatment guidelines provided much needed information to improve the standard of care for individuals with PKU. However, at that time, outcome data on adult patients treated from birth, but before the implementation of treatment for life, was not available.

### Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency diagnosis and management: a 2023 evidence-based clinical guideline of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^e92e3eb0]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

ACMG Practice Guideline — breastfeeding in PAH deficiency: ACMG recommends individuals with PAH deficiency be encouraged and supported to breastfeed, if desired, including when babies have PAH deficiency (Strong recommendation, based on high certainty of evidence.). Infants with PAH deficiency can also safely breastfeed, in conjunction with use of medical foods and appropriate monitoring of Phe levels. Babies without PAH deficiency can readily metabolize Phe in breastmilk, and reports of breastfeeding vs bottle feeding in babies born to PAH-deficient mothers have demonstrated similar outcomes in success of breastfeeding and blood Phe levels in the babies. Seventeen studies reported findings related to breastfeeding infants with PKU, which included normal physical and neurological development overall. In a study conducted in the UK, the age at infant weaning from breastfeeding was slightly earlier for infants with PKU (4.3 months as compared to 5.1 months).

### Central precocious puberty in a 3 year-old girl with phenylketonuria: a rare association? [^ad522c65]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Central precocious puberty (CPP) and phenylketonuria (PKU) are two rare conditions, the latter being the rarer. To date, only one case featuring both these conditions has been reported, and hyperphenylalaninemia was assumed triggering CPP.

Case presentation

We present a 3.2 years old girl referred with a 12 months history of breast and pubic hair development, and vaginal discharge. Hyperphenylalaninemia had been identified by newborn screening and PKU subsequently confirmed by plasma amino acid and genetic analysis. Early dietary control of plasma phenylalanine had been excellent afterwards, resulting in phenylalanine concentrations consistently within the recommended range. Clinical scenario, hormonal assessment and imaging were in keeping with true idiopathic central precocious puberty. Treatment with long lasting gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue led to regression of secondary sexual characteristics.

Conclusion

We describe for the first time CPP in a girl affected with PKU but with persistently well controlled blood phenylalanine concentrations. This finding is in contrast to a previous report which suggested persistently high phenylalaninemia levels as potential trigger for CPP in PKU patients. Our report, together with the lack of evidence in published cohort studies of children with PKU, strongly suggests this rare association is coincidental and independent of the presence of severe hyperphenylalaninemia.

### Newborn screening 50 years later: access issues faced by adults with PKU [^f863f45e]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In the 1960s, phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM no. 261600) became the first disease identifiable through universal newborn screening (NBS) programs.PKU was first described in two siblings by Følling in 1934. In 1937, Jervis and colleagues described the cause of PKU as deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase activity resulting in the inability to convert phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. This results in toxic accumulation of Phe in the brain, causing severe neurocognitive and neuromotor impairment.

Before NBS programs, PKU was generally diagnosed after parents noted delayed developmental skills, by which time, irreversible brain damage had often occurred. In California, before the implementation of universal NBS programs, one to two patients were identified annually, with a mean age at diagnosis of 8 years, 2 months. After universal NBS was initiated in California in 1966, approximately 13 patients were diagnosed annually between 1966 and 1968, with mean age of diagnosis decreasing to 8 months. Similarly, in the 18 months after the initiation of universal screening in New York State in January 1965, 77 infants were diagnosed with PKU.

Newborn diagnosis of PKU is considered the first success story of NBS programs because the identification soon after birth permits early implementation of a Phe-restricted diet. This diet restricts dietary Phe intake and requires supplementation with synthetic amino acid–fortified medical foods to ensure a Phe-free protein source with sufficient vitamins and minerals. This treatment, first described by Bickel and colleagues in 1953, eliminated the most severe manifestations of the disorder; however, controversy remained. Early fears about the reported potential effects of unnecessary protein restriction, such as anorexia, diarrhea, and anemia, prevented some clinicians from implementing the Phe-restricted diet until diagnosis was confirmed with secondary testing. Experts also disagreed about the degree of elevation of Phe levels above the 60 µmol/l of unaffected individuals, which would indicate the need for dietary treatment. Without detailed information about the outcomes of elevated Phe levels, many clinicians felt that patients with Phe concentrations < 1,200 µmol/l did not require treatment, whereas others treated those individuals with levels > 900 µmol/l, or even > 720 µmol/l.

### Evidence-and consensus-based recommendations for the use of pegvaliase in adults with phenylketonuria [^78365071]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM 261600) is a rare genetic disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, which results in elevated phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations in the blood and brain. – The concentration of blood Phe in healthy individuals is ~60 (± 30) µmol/L, but in individuals with PKU who have not restricted their Phe intake, can be ≥ 1200 µmol/L. Elevated blood Phe concentrations are associated with impairment of executive function, behavioral and psychiatric problems, including depression and anxiety, and have a negative impact on patient quality of life (QoL), mood, and attention span.– Even on treatment, deficits in executive functioning, motor ability, and behavior can occur.– Conversely, lowering of Phe levels is associated with improved neurological performance. Neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms can develop later in life when it is more difficult to maintain Phe control, and a correlation has been reported between improved cognitive performance and control of blood Phe throughout the lifespan. Blood Phe concentration is therefore the primary biomarker for optimizing treatment. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines state that the goal of treatment is to maintain plasma Phe concentration in the range of 120–360 μmol/L. European guidelines state that the primary goal of treatment is normal neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning through maintaining plasma Phe concentration between 120 and 360 μmol/L up to the age of 12 years and up to 600 μmol/L thereafter.

### PKU-what is daily practice in various centres in Europe? Data from a questionnaire by the scientific advisory committee of the European society of phenylketonuria and allied disorders [^c2ca637d]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Since the start of the European Society of Phenylketonuria and Allied Disorders Treated as Phenylketonuria (ESPKU) in 1987, an increasing number of parental organizations of member countries have joined. Treatment varies widely within Europe. A survey among professionals was done to determine goals and practice.

Method

In 2005, a questionnaire was sent to professionals of member countries, addressing diagnostic and treatment procedures, numbers of patients necessary for a PKU centre, guidelines followed, numbers of patients treated and professionals involved in care, target phenylalanine concentrations, amount of protein prescribed, frequency of monitoring and clinical visits, need for follow-up of various clinical and biochemical data, the importance of various abnormalities, and definition of (non)compliance.

Results

Seventeen centres of 12 countries answered. Professionals of 13 countries could not be reached or did not respond. Differences in care were observed in many issues of care including target phenylalanine concentrations. Only few issues had general consensus.

Conclusion

Not all countries were really active at ESPKU level. In the active countries, a professional could not always be contacted. Responses show that PKU care varies largely between European countries. Notwithstanding the large diversity on many issues of day-to-day care and therapeutic targets, results showed increasing consensus on some issues. The most important outcome of this questionnaire might be that the Scientific Advisory Committee of the ESPKU initiated meetings for professionals of different backgrounds taking care of PKU patients besides the already existing programme for parents, patients and delegates. Discussion among these professionals may improve quality of care.

### Mild hyperphenylalaninemia: to treat or not to treat [^6e00d791]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

One of the issues to be resolved in phenylketonuria is whether patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia need treatment, or in other words, in what patients treatment needs to be started. Do patients need treatment when phenylalanine concentrations in blood are > 360 μmol/L or > 600 μmol/L? This paper reviews the literature on the outcome of untreated patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia to try to determine whether outcome is normal. The paper concludes that there is, in fact, only one paper that can be used to answer this question. Therefore, the question is whether we may rely on one paper to draw conclusions or whether more research is necessary to determine whether all patients with phenylalanine concentrations > 360 μmol/L or all patients with phenylalanine concentrations > 600 μmol/L require treatment.

### Future treatment strategies in phenylketonuria [^5ac279fc]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) was the first inherited metabolic disease in which treatment was found to prevent clinical features of the disorder; dietary management was established almost 60 years ago. The institution of a low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet in the first few weeks of life was made possible by Guthrie neonatal screening, which further increased effectiveness of therapy. Indeed, neonatal diagnosis of PKU followed by institution of a low-Phe diet has been a remarkable success in preventing the devastating brain damage associated with untreated PKU. Nevertheless, significant difficulties exist in caring for PKU patients, including problems with adhering to the prescribed dietary regimen and the presence of neurocognitive deficits despite therapy. During the past few years, several ideas for new treatment strategies have emerged. This review aims to address these treatment strategies based on theoretical considerations of the biochemistry and pathogenesis of PKU. Recent times have seen the introduction of a wide array of novel treatments currently in clinical use, including more palatable medical foods, glycomacropeptide, large neutral amino acids, and tetrahydrobiopterin. Human trials are underway using an enzymatic therapeutic approach, while preclinical work continues in the fields of gene and cellular therapy. These therapeutic strategies propose to treat PKU at various levels, including nutritional intake, gut, liver, and blood-brain barrier, and have the potential to further improve outcome in PKU.

### National Institutes of Health consensus development conference statement: phenylketonuria: screening and management, October 16–18, 2000 [^fe0c0643]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding screening for and management of phenylketonuria (PKU).

Participants

A nonfederal, nonadvocate, 14-member panel representing the fields of pediatrics, genetics, human development, public policy, nursing, and molecular physiology and including patient representatives. In addition, 19 experts in pediatrics, medical genetics, psychology, pediatric neurology, biochemical and molecular genetics, and gene therapy presented data to the panel and to a conference audience of 312.

Evidence

The literature was searched using Medline for January 1980 through July 2000, and an extensive bibliography of 3394 references was provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for their conference presentations with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience.

Consensus Process

The panel, answering predefined questions, developed its conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. The draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web immediately after its release at the conference and was updated with the panel's final revisions. The statement is available at http://consensus.nih.gov.

Conclusions

Genetic testing for PKU has been in place for almost 40 years and has been very successful in preventing severe mental retardation in thousands of children and adults. Metabolic control is necessary across the lifespan of individuals with PKU. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary, integrated system is needed to delivery of care to individuals with PKU. Greatly needed are consistency and coordination between screening, treatment, data collection, and patient support programs. There should be equal access to culturally sensitive, age-appropriate treatment programs. Ethically sound, specific policies for storage, ownership, and use in future studies of archived samples remaining from PKU testing should be established. Research into the pathophysiology of PKU and relationship to genetic, neural, and behavioral variation is strongly encouraged. Uniform policies must be established to remove financial barriers to the acquisition of medical foods and modified low-protein foods and to provide access to support services needed to maintain metabolic control in individuals with PKU. Research on nondietary alternative treatments for PKU is strongly encouraged. To achieve optimal statistical power and cross-cultural applicability, it will be beneficial to use data acquired via national and international collaboration.phenylketonuria, hyperphenylalanimea, phenylketonuria screening, phenylalanine-restricted diet, maternal phenylketonuria, newborn screening, phenylalanine monitoring, phenylketonuria outcomes.

### Management of early treated adolescents and young adults with phenylketonuria: development of international consensus recommendations using a modified Delphi approach [^7a1c189f]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Early treated patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) often become lost to follow-up from adolescence onwards due to the historical focus of PKU care on the pediatric population and lack of programs facilitating the transition to adulthood. As a result, evidence on the management of adolescents and young adults with PKU is limited.

Methods

Two meetings were held with a multidisciplinary international panel of 25 experts in PKU and comorbidities frequently experienced by patients with PKU. Based on the outcomes of the first meeting, a set of statements were developed. During the second meeting, these statements were voted on for consensus generation (≥ 70% agreement), using a modified Delphi approach.

Results

A total of 37 consensus recommendations were developed across five areas that were deemed important in the management of adolescents and young adults with PKU: (1) general physical health, (2) mental health and neurocognitive functioning, (3) blood Phe target range, (4) PKU-specific challenges, and (5) transition to adult care. The consensus recommendations reflect the personal opinions and experiences from the participating experts supported with evidence when available. Overall, clinicians managing adolescents and young adults with PKU should be aware of the wide variety of PKU-associated comorbidities, initiating screening at an early age. In addition, management of adolescents/young adults should be a joint effort between the patient, clinical center, and parents/caregivers supporting adolescents with gradually gaining independent control of their disease during the transition to adulthood.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary international group of experts used a modified Delphi approach to develop a set of consensus recommendations with the aim of providing guidance and offering tools to clinics to aid with supporting adolescents and young adults with PKU.

### Long-term preservation of intellectual functioning in sapropterin-treated infants and young children with phenylketonuria: a seven-year analysis [^335a0507]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Medical nutritional therapy was initially the only available treatment option for children who were diagnosed with PKU through newborn screening programs. Adoption of a Phe-restricted diet supplemented with medical food within the first days after birth markedly improved the neurological and cognitive outcomes of PKU patients. Dietary management should aim to prevent blood Phe above the ACMG target range (120–360 μmol/L) and avoid fluctuations in Phe, especially during childhood, since both are believed to be deleterious for brain development and predictive of late cognitive outcomes. However, dietary management poses a significant burden to patients and their caregivers, often limiting adherence. Although studies evaluating long-term growth outcomes in PKU patients on dietary management have shown conflicting results, a recent meta-analysis reported that growth is impaired in children with classical PKU. Nevertheless, children with PKU were recently found to recuperate initially-delayed growth beyond the age of 12 years. Generally, the inability to achieve optimal growth is related to nutritional deficiencies caused by inadequate dietary management rather than to high blood Phe. This may especially be relevant to patients with classical PKU, in whom growth was found to be significantly reduced as compared with non-classical PKU patients.

### Management of women with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (phenylketonuria): ACOG committee opinion, number 802 [^e35ac175]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Risk of genetic transmission and screening in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency — the incidence of PAH deficiency in a population is reported to vary by ethnicity and ranges from 1 in 2,600 to 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 200,000, it is an autosomal recessive disorder, and the carrier frequency is approximately 1 in 50 in those of Northern European descent. All offspring of women with PAH deficiency will minimally be obligate carriers. Prepregnancy carrier screening is recommended for the partner of a patient with PAH deficiency, many expanded carrier screening panels include screening for PAH deficiency with consultation with a health care provider with genetic expertise recommended, and patients with a family member with PAH deficiency should be offered genetic counseling to discuss reproductive risk and appropriate testing options. Prenatal and prepregnancy genetic testing is available if familial mutations are known, detection of fetal PAH variants in cell-free DNA is not recommended, and PAH deficiency is included on statewide newborn screening panels in all 50 states.
