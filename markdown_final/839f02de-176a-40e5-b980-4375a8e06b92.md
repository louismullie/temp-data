## Question

What rapid insulin best for pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which rapid-acting insulin is best for pregnancy and how to choose among options like insulin aspart, insulin lispro, faster aspart, and insulin glulisine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why rapid-acting analogs are preferred in pregnancy. Then, I should verify which agents have the strongest safety and efficacy evidence in pregnancy. Next, I will examine head-to-head data and guideline positions. After that, I need to consider ultra-rapid options like faster aspart and whether they change the recommendation. Finally, I will integrate practical considerations such as availability, cost, and regimen flexibility before stating a clear recommendation with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why rapid-acting analogs matter here. Pregnancy drives dynamic insulin resistance with rising requirements after mid-gestation, and postprandial hyperglycemia becomes a key driver of adverse outcomes; therefore, prandial insulin with predictable, rapid onset and offset helps match meal-related glucose excursions while minimizing late hypoglycemia, which is why guidelines prefer rapid-acting analogs over regular insulin in pregnancy when available [^115NwvFw] [^115uZNUD].

> I need to check which rapid-acting insulins have the most robust pregnancy data. Insulin aspart and insulin lispro have the longest track record and strongest guideline endorsement; both are FDA-recognized as acceptable in pregnancy, with aspart specifically categorized as Category A in some jurisdictions and supported by randomized data showing improved postprandial control without excess hypoglycemia, while lispro has decades of reassuring safety data in pregnancy and is widely used in basal-bolus regimens during gestation [^116tvkrM] [^111VrTtR] [^113nzoqX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about newer agents; I should review ultra-rapid aspart (faster aspart). The CopenFast randomized trial in pregnant women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes showed faster aspart had similar fetal growth and HbA1c versus aspart, with fewer severe hypoglycemia events, and a secondary analysis suggested favorable sensor-derived glycemic metrics; expert consensus also notes improved prandial control and predictability without new safety signals, though data are still more limited than for aspart/lispro and URLi lacks pregnancy-specific data at this time [^117J2mWU] [^111oWQ4V] [^111czUQk].

> Wait, let me verify where insulin glulisine fits. I initially thought glulisine might be interchangeable, but I should double-check guideline positions; the Endocrine Society advises against glulisine in pregnancy due to limited pregnancy-specific safety data and lack of FDA approval for this indication, so glulisine should not be the first choice when aspart or lispro are available, even though mechanistically it is a rapid-acting analog [^113nzoqX].

> Next, I should review guideline hierarchies to ensure alignment. The Endocrine Society and AACE recommend rapid-acting analogs (aspart or lispro) in preference to regular insulin for pregnant patients, and the ADA Standards endorse insulin as the preferred therapy for type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes in pregnancy, with postprandial monitoring and intensified regimens to achieve tight but safe targets; this supports choosing aspart or lispro as standard options and integrating them into basal-bolus or pump regimens as appropriate [^115NwvFw] [^115uZNUD] [^115ZLxth] [^115baues].

> I will now examine comparative advantages among the preferred analogs. Head-to-head pregnancy data directly comparing aspart versus lispro are sparse; meta-analytic and randomized data show both improve postprandial control versus regular insulin with similar or lower hypoglycemia risk, and no consistent maternal-fetal safety differences between aspart and lispro have emerged, so either is reasonable; faster aspart may reduce severe hypoglycemia versus aspart in CopenFast, but availability and payer coverage vary, and switching solely for marginal pharmacokinetic gains may not be necessary if already well controlled on aspart or lispro [^111VrTtR] [^117J2mWU] [^111czUQk].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a pump or considering hybrid closed loop in pregnancy? I need to ensure device compatibility and safety. Rapid-acting analogs (aspart, lispro, glulisine) are standard for pump therapy, and emerging guidance allows consideration of automated insulin delivery in selected pregnant patients with type 1 diabetes, recognizing that most systems do not yet incorporate pregnancy-specific targets; thus, aspart or lispro remain appropriate pump insulins, with shared decision-making and experienced team oversight [^112BvSx4] [^115sq7VF] [^117L3KZA].

> Let me consider practical factors that could tilt the choice. Cost, formulary access, and patient familiarity often determine selection between aspart and lispro; both are available in pen and vial formats, compatible with pumps, and supported by long-standing clinical experience in pregnancy, so continuity of a pre-pregnancy regimen that is already effective is sensible unless there is a compelling reason to switch, such as persistent postprandial spikes or recurrent hypoglycemia where faster aspart might be trialed with close monitoring [^115uZNUD] [^111czUQk].

> I should confirm dosing and titration principles to avoid oversimplification. Pregnancy typically requires frequent adjustments: insulin needs often fall in early gestation and rise linearly from around 16 weeks, roughly doubling by late third trimester, then drop sharply postpartum; structured SMBG or CGM with pre- and postprandial targets, and patient-centered titration algorithms, improve time-in-range and outcomes, which is why the specific analog choice is only one piece of an integrated plan anchored by close surveillance and education [^115kuNyc] [^113GfW9r] [^112zRsi3].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my recommendation is clear and evidence-based. The best rapid-acting insulin for pregnancy is either insulin aspart or insulin lispro, with aspart having slightly more contemporary randomized pregnancy data and regulatory language supporting use, and lispro having extensive historical safety; faster aspart is a reasonable alternative when available and may reduce severe hypoglycemia, but data are less mature and access may be limited, while insulin glulisine should be avoided in pregnancy due to insufficient safety data and lack of approval for this indication [^116tvkrM] [^115NwvFw] [^117J2mWU] [^111czUQk] [^113nzoqX].

> Final recommendation, with caveats: use insulin aspart or insulin lispro as first-line prandial insulins in pregnancy, selecting based on patient preference, prior experience, access, and cost; consider faster aspart if postprandial control remains suboptimal or if recurrent severe hypoglycemia occurs on aspart or lispro, recognizing the need for additional monitoring and shared decision-making; avoid initiating insulin glulisine in pregnancy, and default to regular insulin only when rapid-acting analogs are unavailable or contraindicated, with the understanding that analogs are preferred when accessible [^115uZNUD] [^111czUQk] [^113nzoqX].

---

Insulin aspart and insulin lispro are the **preferred rapid-acting insulins** for pregnancy because they improve postprandial control [^113nzoqX] and reduce hypoglycemia compared to regular insulin, with no increase in adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [^113nzoqX] [^1121PgPd]. Faster aspart is **safe and non-inferior** to aspart in pregnancy, with fewer severe hypoglycemia events, but it is not yet first-line pending broader data [^117J2mWU] [^111czUQk]. Insulin glulisine is not recommended due to limited pregnancy data [^113nzoqX]. Regular insulin is acceptable if analogs are unavailable, but rapid-acting analogs are preferred when accessible [^115CCqDb].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

Rapid-acting insulins have a **faster onset and shorter duration** than regular insulin, better matching meal-related insulin needs and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia [^112RRUrj]. This profile supports tighter, safer glycemic control in pregnancy, where postprandial spikes are common [^113nzoqX].

| **Insulin type** | **Onset (min)** | **Peak (min)** | **Duration (h)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aspart | 10–20 | 30–90 | 3–5 |
| Lispro | 10–20 | 30–90 | 3–5 |
| Glulisine | 10–20 | 30–90 | 3–5 |
| Regular insulin | 30–60 | 90–180 | 6–8 |

## Clinical evidence supporting rapid-acting insulin analogs in pregnancy

### Insulin aspart

- **Safety and efficacy**: Extensive data show aspart is safe and effective in pregnancy, with improved postprandial control and less hypoglycemia than regular insulin [^113nzoqX] [^111VrTtR].
- **FDA approval**: Aspart is FDA-approved for pregnancy and is widely used internationally [^113nzoqX].
- **CopenFast trial**: Faster aspart was non-inferior to aspart, with fewer severe hypoglycemia events, supporting safety and potential benefits [^117J2mWU] [^111czUQk].

---

### Insulin lispro

- **Safety and efficacy**: Lispro has a long record of safe use in pregnancy, with better postprandial control and less hypoglycemia than regular insulin [^112RRUrj] [^111xMJuP].
- **Guideline support**: Endocrine Society and AACE recommend lispro as a preferred rapid-acting insulin in pregnancy [^115NwvFw] [^115uZNUD].

---

### Insulin glulisine

Limited data and **lack of approval** mean glulisine is not recommended in pregnancy; more research is needed before routine use [^113nzoqX].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and safety

- **Aspart vs lispro**: Both improve postprandial control and reduce hypoglycemia vs regular insulin, with similar maternal and fetal outcomes; no clear superiority between them [^112RRUrj] [^111VrTtR].
- **Faster aspart**: Non-inferior to aspart with fewer severe hypoglycemia events, but not yet first-line pending broader data [^117J2mWU] [^111czUQk].
- **Regular insulin**: Acceptable if analogs are unavailable, but analogs are preferred when accessible [^115CCqDb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommended rapid-acting insulin** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Endocrine Society | Aspart, lispro | Preferred over regular insulin [^115NwvFw] |
| AACE | Aspart, lispro | Preferred over regular insulin [^115uZNUD] |
| ADA | Aspart, lispro | Preferred over regular insulin [^notfound] |

---

## Potential risks and benefits

Benefits include **improved postprandial control**, reduced hypoglycemia, and greater flexibility, all of which support tighter, safer glycemic targets in pregnancy [^1121PgPd] [^113nzoqX]. No increase in **adverse outcomes** has been observed with aspart or lispro compared with regular insulin, including no excess congenital anomalies, macrosomia, or neonatal hypoglycemia [^1121PgPd] [^111VrTtR].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Patient-specific factors**: Tailor insulin choice to glycemic profile, hypoglycemia risk, and preferences [^113jJAg7].
- **Monitoring**: Use frequent glucose monitoring or CGM to guide dosing and detect hypoglycemia [^113GfW9r].
- **Education**: Provide training on timing, dosing, and hypoglycemia management [^113jJAg7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Insulin aspart and insulin lispro are the **preferred rapid-acting insulins** for pregnancy, with robust evidence for safety and efficacy [^115NwvFw]. Faster aspart is a promising option with fewer severe hypoglycemia events, but more data are needed before it becomes first-line [^111czUQk]. Glulisine is not recommended due to limited data [^113nzoqX]. Regular insulin remains acceptable if analogs are unavailable, but rapid-acting analogs are preferred when accessible [^115CCqDb].

Ultra-Rapid-Acting Insulins in Diabetes Mellitus During Pregnancy

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common condition, with a global prevalence of approximately 14% in pregnant women. It is accompanied by an increased risk of preterm delivery, macrosomia, or neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Accordingly, treatment of GDM was shown to reduce perinatal morbidityand screening for GDM is therefore largely recommended in current guidelines for pregnant women at elevated risk. Many pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion, pre-eclampsia, macrosomia, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome are even more common in women with T1D and T2D during pregnancy. It is therefore particularly important to ensure optimal glycemic control in all pregnant women with diabetes.

Insulins are the central pillar for diabetes therapy during pregnancy, as other glucose-lowering medications often lack positive safety data or can cross the placenta with potential adverse effects on the fetus. Both MDI and CSII therapy are equally appropriate treatment options for pregnant women with diabetes. An important factor to consider during pregnancy is the changing insulin physiology, with increased insulin sensitivity in the first trimester but greatly reduced sensitivity and increased insulin requirements in late pregnancy. Yet, even a small 5% increase in time above range during the second and third trimesters in women with T1D is associated with an increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Therefore, monitoring of both fasting and postprandial blood glucose is recommended during pregnancy in all women with diabetes mellitusand underlines the importance of a good predictability of insulin action to ensure stable glycemic control and to prevent hypoglycemia.

### Faster-acting insulin aspart versus insulin aspart in the treatment of type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy and post-delivery (copenFast): an open-label, single-centre, randomised controlled trial [^117J2mWU]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Faster-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) is considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding but has not been evaluated in this population. We aimed to evaluate the effect of faster aspart versus insulin aspart on fetal growth, in women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy and post-delivery.

Methods

This open-label, single-centre, superiority trial was conducted at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. Participants aged 18 years or older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were stratified by diabetes type and insulin treatment modality (multiple daily injections or insulin pump), randomly assigned 1:1 to faster aspart or insulin aspart, from 8 weeks and 0 days (8 +0) of gestation to 13 +6 weeks of gestation, and followed up until 3 months post-delivery. Primary outcome was infant birthweight SD score. Secondary outcomes included HbA 1c as well as maternal and fetal outcomes in all participants during the trial. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03770767.

Findings

Between Nov 11, 2019 and May 10, 2022, 109 participants were included in the faster aspart group and 107 in the insulin aspart group. Primary outcome data were available in 203 (94%) of 216 participants, and no participants discontinued treatment during the trial. Mean birthweight SD score was 1.0 (SD 1.4) in the faster aspart group versus 1.2 (1.3) in the insulin aspart group; estimated treatment difference -0.22 [-0.58 to 0.14]; p = 0.23. At 33 weeks of gestation, mean HbA 1c was 42 mmol/mol (SD 6 mmol/mol; 6.0% [SD 0.9%]) versus 43 mmol/mol (SD 7 mmol/mol; 6.1% [SD 1.2%]); estimated treatment difference -1.01 (-2.86 to 0.83), p = 0.28. No additional safety issues were observed with faster aspart compared with insulin aspart.

Interpretation

Treatment with faster aspart resulted in similar fetal growth and HbA 1c, relative to insulin aspart, in women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Faster aspart can be used in women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy and post-delivery with no additional safety issues.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid-acting insulin analogs in special populations with type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112RRUrj]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

To assess the efficacy and safety of three available rapid-acting insulin analogs (insulins lispro, aspart and glulisine, respectively) in pregnant women, children/adolescents and people using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with type 1 diabetes.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Reviews were searched electronically, and their bibliographies examined to identify suitable studies for review and inclusion in a meta-analysis. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that reported data on relevant clinical outcomes. A different reviewer abstracted data for each of the three subpopulations, and one reviewer abstracted data for all three. Any differences were resolved by consensus or by consulting a fourth reviewer.

Results

In people on CSII, rapid-acting insulin analogs lowered postprandial plasma glucose post-breakfast to a greater extent than did regular human insulin (RHI) (mean difference: − 1.63 mmol/L [95% confidence interval − 1.71; − 1.54]), with a comparable risk of hypoglycemia and a trend for lower glycated hemoglobin. In the pediatric population, glycemic control was similar with rapid-acting insulin analogs and RHI, with no safety concerns. Meta-analysis indicated severe hypoglycemic events were comparable for rapid-acting insulin analogs versus RHI (risk difference: 0.00 [95% confidence interval − 0.01; 0.01]). In the pregnancy group, insulin lispro and insulin aspart were safe and effective for both mother and fetus, with glycemic control being at least as good as with RHI. There were no data on insulin glulisine during pregnancy.

Conclusion

Rapid-acting insulin analogs appear generally safe and effective in these special populations; however, additional trials would be helpful.

1.3a–d. Evidence

Rapid-acting insulin analogs are likely more able than regular human insulin to help a woman achieve postprandial blood glucose targets and are less likely to cause hypoglycemia; fetal outcomes, however, seem comparable. Compared with NPH insulin, use of the long-acting insulin analogs insulin detemir or insulin glargine is associated with lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Insulin detemir, but not insulin glargine, is approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during pregnancy. Both of these long-acting insulin analogs, however, are widely used in pregnancy, with evidence of safety in this setting. Long-acting insulin analogs are, however, more expensive than NPH insulin.

1.3a–d. Remarks

The issues of insulin glargine not being FDA-approved for use during pregnancy and glargine's theoretical mitogenicity should be discussed preconceptionally with women with diabetes who are using insulin glargine. When appropriate, insulin glargine may be replaced by insulin detemir or NPH insulin. Glulisine is not yet proven safe for use during pregnancy (studies are ongoing) and is not currently FDA-approved for this indication; as such, insulin aspart and lispro (both of which have been found to be safe in pregnancy and are FDA-approved) are preferred. For additional remarks, please refer to Remarks 5.1a–b.

Folic acid supplementation

1.4. We recommend that beginning 3 months before withdrawing contraceptive measures or otherwise trying to conceive, a woman with diabetes take a daily folic acid supplement to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. (1|⊕⊕○○) We suggest a daily dose of 5 mg based on this dose's theoretical benefits. (2|⊕⊕○○)

1.4. Evidence

Taking a daily folic acid supplement preconceptionally reduces the risk of neural tube defects. The optimal amount of folate that should be taken is uncertain, but 5 mg/d has a good rationale.

5.0. Blood glucose-lowering pharmacological therapy during pregnancy

Insulin therapy

5.1a. We suggest that the long-acting insulin analog detemir may be initiated during pregnancy for those women who require basal insulin and for whom neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, in appropriate doses, has previously resulted in, or for whom it is thought NPH insulin may result in, problematic hypoglycemia; insulin detemir may be continued in those women with diabetes already successfully taking insulin detemir before pregnancy. (2|⊕⊕⊕⊕)

5.1b. We suggest that those pregnant women successfully using insulin glargine before pregnancy may continue it during pregnancy. (2|⊕⊕○○)

5.1c. We suggest that the rapid-acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart be used in preference to regular (soluble) insulin in pregnant women with diabetes. (2|⊕⊕⊕O)

5.1d. We recommend the ongoing use of continuous sc insulin infusion during pregnancy in women with diabetes when this has been initiated before pregnancy (1|⊕⊕⊕○), but suggest that continuous sc insulin infusion not be initiated during pregnancy unless other insulin strategies including multiple daily doses of insulin have first been tried and proven unsuccessful. (2|⊕⊕○○)

Noninsulin antihyperglycemic agent therapy

5.2a. We suggest that glyburide (glibenclamide) is a suitable alternative to insulin therapy for glycemic control in women with gestational diabetes who fail to achieve sufficient glycemic control after a 1-week trial of medical nutrition therapy and exercise except for those women with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes before 25 weeks gestation and for those women with fasting plasma glucose levels > 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), in which case insulin therapy is preferred. (2|⊕⊕○○)

5.2b. We suggest that metformin therapy be used for glycemic control only for those women with gestational diabetes who do not have satisfactory glycemic control despite medical nutrition therapy and who refuse or cannot use insulin or glyburide and are not in the first trimester. (2|⊕⊕○○)

### Insulin therapy in pregnancy [^114zda1S]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Insulin therapy is essential for optimal glycemic control during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes and is frequently required to optimize control in women with type 2 diabetes. Less commonly, women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) require insulin for glycemic control. However, because of its greater prevalence, GDM is the most common reason for insulin use in pregnancy. The most frequently used insulin regimen in pregnancy is a basal/bolus combination of long- and short-acting insulin preparations. There is no evidence base to support one treatment regimen over another. Therapy should be individualized and based on local expertise.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1121PgPd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

5.1a–b. Remarks

Of the two available long-acting insulin analogs, detemir has a theoretical advantage over glargine during pregnancy because glargine's much higher affinity for the IGF-1 receptor raises concerns about increased mitogenic activity. Nonetheless, glargine is unlikely to cross the placenta, animal studies have not shown glargine to be embryotoxic, and women treated with insulin glargine during the first trimester have a similar rate of congenital malformations as women treated with insulin NPH. Insulin detemir is now approved (Category B) by the FDA for use during pregnancy, whereas insulin glargine does not currently have such approval.

Before instituting insulin glargine or detemir in a pregnant woman, the clinician should fully and frankly discuss their advantages and possible disadvantages compared with NPH therapy and, in the case of insulin glargine, its lack of FDA approval for use in pregnancy.

5.1c. Evidence

Compared with human regular (soluble) insulin, rapid-acting insulin used during pregnancy allows greater lifestyle flexibility, greater patient satisfaction, and improved quality of life and may also provide better postprandial blood glucose control and HbA1C reduction. Rapid-acting insulin is, however, more expensive than regular insulin. In most other respects, rapid-acting insulin and regular insulin are comparable during pregnancy (,–). Moreover, both are associated with similar rates of prematurity, cesarean delivery, worsening of retinopathy, hypertensive complications, rates of shoulder dystocia, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Rapid-acting insulin does not increase the risk of teratogenicity (,–).

5.1c. Remarks

We suggest glulisine not be used during pregnancy because it is not FDA-approved for use in pregnancy and does not offer a proven advantage over lispro or aspart.

5.1d. Evidence

Compared with multiple daily doses of insulin, continuous sc insulin infusion used during pregnancy in women with overt diabetes provides comparable or better glycemic control and pregnancy outcomes with no greater risk or possibly lower risk of maternal hypoglycemia. Additionally, compared with multiple daily doses of insulin, continuous sc insulin infusion provides greater lifestyle flexibility, easier blood glucose management in women experiencing morning nausea, less blood glucose variability, and facilitates managing glucose control in the peridelivery setting. An increased risk of maternal ketoacidosis and neonatal hypoglycemia has, however, been reported.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^115uZNUD]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Diabetes in pregnancy — goals and pharmacotherapy: For women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), treatment goals are recommended as preprandial glucose concentration ≤ 95 mg/dL and either a 1-h postmeal glucose ≤ 140 mg/dL or a 2-h postmeal glucose ≤ 120 mg/dL, to decrease adverse fetal outcomes. All women with preexisting diabetes mellitus (T1D, T2D, or previous GDM) need access to preconception care and counseling. Rapid-acting insulin analogs (insulin lispro, insulin-aspart) should be used to treat postprandial hyperglycemia in pregnant women, and basal options include long-acting insulin (eg, NPH, detemir, or glargine) or rapid-acting insulin via a CSII; regular insulin, although not recommended as first-line therapy, is acceptable when rapid-acting insulin analogs are not available. Insulin is the preferred therapeutic choice for pregnant women with GDM or T2D, but metformin has been given a category B for pregnancy with accumulating evidence of safety; it has been shown to improve pregnancy and fetal outcomes except for increased rates of infants with SGA and later onset of obesity, and prescribers should discuss potential risks and benefits and the need for longer-term outcome studies.

### Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115GLxpD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes that mainly occurs in individuals with autoimmune type 1 diabetes, but it is not uncommon in some people with type 2 diabetes. The treatment of DKA is traditionally accomplished by the administration of intravenous infusion of regular insulin that is initiated in the emergency department and continued in an intensive care unit or a high-dependency unit environment. It is unclear whether people with DKA should be treated with other treatment modalities such as subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues.

Objectives

To assess the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Search Methods

We identified eligible trials by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We searched the trials registers WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of last search for all databases was 27 October 2015. We also examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they were RCTs comparing subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus standard intravenous infusion in participants with DKA of any age or sex with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.

Main Results

Five trials randomised 201 participants (110 participants to subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues and 91 to intravenous regular insulin). The criteria for DKA were consistent with the American Diabetes Association criteria for mild or moderate DKA. The underlying cause of DKA was mostly poor compliance with diabetes therapy. Most trials did not report on type of diabetes. Younger diabetic participants and children were underrepresented in our included trials (one trial only). Four trials evaluated the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue lispro, and one the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart. The mean follow-up period as measured by mean hospital stay ranged between two and seven days. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated trials was unclear in many domains and high for performance bias for the outcome measure time to resolution of DKA. No deaths were reported in the included trials (186 participants; 3 trials; moderate- (insulin lispro) to low-quality evidence (insulin aspart)). There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin lispro versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: mean difference (MD) 0.2 h (95% CI -1.7 to 2.1); P = 0.81; 90 participants; 2 trials. In one trial involving children with DKA, the time to reach a glucose level of 250 mg/dL was similar between insulin lispro and intravenous regular insulin. There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin aspart versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: MD -1 h (95% CI -3.2 to 1.2); P = 0.36; 30 participants; 1 trial. There was low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin on hypoglycaemic episodes: 6 of 80 insulin lispro-treated participants compared with 9 of 76 regular insulin-treated participants reported hypoglycaemic events; risk ratio (RR) 0.59 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.52); P = 0.28; 156 participants; 4 trials. For insulin aspart compared with regular insulin, RR for hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.00 (95% CI 0.07 to 14.55); P = 1.0; 30 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence. Socioeconomic effects as measured by length of mean hospital stay for insulin lispro compared with regular insulin showed a MD of -0.4 days (95% CI -1 to 0.2); P = 0.22; 90 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence and for insulin aspart compared with regular insulin 1.1 days (95% CI -3.3 to 1.1); P = 0.32; low-quality evidence. Data on morbidity were limited, but no specific events were reported for the comparison of insulin lispro with regular insulin. No trial reported on adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, and no trial investigated patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review, which provided mainly data on adults, suggests on the basis of mostly low- to very low-quality evidence that there are neither advantages nor disadvantages when comparing the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin for treating mild or moderate DKA.

### The role of ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogs in diabetes: an expert consensus [^116Sj9HE]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Consensus Recommendations

As stated in the previous chapter, URAA provide a faster onset and offset of action compared with RAA and regular insulin and have been shown in clinical trials to provide improved prandial glycemic control. Accordingly, we now provide tailored recommendations for use of URAA in specific groups of people living with diabetes or in specific situations that are relevant to the management of diabetes mellitus below (see Tables 2–12). The recommendations are summarized in Table 13. We used the ADA grading system to indicate the level of scientific evidence for each recommendation. Accordingly, evidence from large, well-conducted RCTs or meta-analyses was graded A, evidence from well-conducted cohort or case-control studies was graded B, evidence from poorly controlled clinical studies was graded C, and E was used for expert consensus or clinical experience in the absence of evidence from clinical trials or in the case of conflicting evidence.

### Insulin management for gestational and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy [^113jJAg7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Insulin is preferred as the first-line agent for glucose management of gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy when nutritional and lifestyle modifications are unable to achieve pregnancy-specific glucose targets. Individual heterogeneity in defects of insulin secretion or sensitivity in liver and muscle, unique genetic influences on pregnancy glycemic regulation, and variable cultural and lifestyle behaviors that affect meal, activity, sleep, and occupational schedules necessitate a personalized approach to insulin regimens. Newer insulin preparations have been developed to mimic the physiologic release of endogenous insulin, maintaining appropriate basal levels to cover hepatic gluconeogenesis and simulate the rapid, meal-related, bolus rise of insulin. Such physiologic basal-bolus dosing of insulin can be administered safely, achieving tighter glycemic control while reducing episodes of hypoglycemia. Insulin initiation and titration require understanding the pharmacodynamics of different insulin preparations in addition to a patient's glycemic profiles, effect of variable nutritional intake and mealtimes, physical activity, stress, timing of sleep cycles, and cultural habits. Educating and empowering patients to learn how their glucose responds to insulin, portion and content of meals, and physical activity can increase personal engagement in therapy, flexibility in eating patterns, and improved glycemic control. This Clinical Expert Series article is focused on optimizing insulin management (initiation, dosing, and titration) of gestational and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy.

Glucose monitoring approach — Reflecting pregnancy physiology, fasting and postprandial blood glucose monitoring is recommended to achieve glycemic goals in pregnant people with diabetes. Preprandial testing is also recommended when using insulin pumps or basal-bolus therapy so that the prandial rapid-acting insulin dosage can be adjusted. Postprandial monitoring is associated with better glycemic outcomes and a lower risk of preeclampsia.

### Dysglycemias in pregnancy: from diagnosis to treatment. Brazilian consensus statement [^111ZjWGX]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

For optimal glycemic control during pregnancy in women with pre-existing diabetes, intensified insulin regimens with multiple doses of subcutaneous long and short-acting insulins or continuous insulin infusion, usually give the best results. In women who were using insulin before pregnancy, it is generally necessary to reduce the dose in about 10 to 20% during the first trimester. Between the 18th and the 24th gestation week this dose must be increased. During the third trimester, the increased production of hormones by the placenta with antagonistic effects to insulin makes it necessary to increase insulin dose again, generally requiring doses that are the double or triple of those used before pregnancy. For converting women with T2D to insulin therapy, an initial total daily dose of 0.7–1.0 unit/kg actual body weight is often effective, adjusted according to subsequent blood glucose concentrations. After delivery, insulin requirements fall dramatically, and many times in the following days, insulin doses must be adjusted to half of those used at the end of pregnancy or return to pre-pregnancy doses. The rapid acting insulin analogs, such as insulin aspart and lispro are safe during pregnancy, leading to better postprandial glycemic levels and causing less hypoglycemia (B). NPH human insulin is still the first choice for basal insulin (A). There are not consistent data regarding the use of the long acting insulin analogs, detemir and glargine in pregnancy, although many isolated reports and data of some studies have shown promising results with their use (C). Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion can be used when available. The ideal sites for insulin injections during pregnancy are the abdomen and hips (C).

### Different insulin types and regimens for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes [^116fnd2G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin requirements may change during pregnancy, and the optimal treatment for pre-existing diabetes is unclear. There are several insulin regimens (e.g. via syringe, pen) and types of insulin (e.g. fast-acting insulin, human insulin).

Objectives

To assess the effects of different insulin types and different insulin regimens in pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 October 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (17 October 2016), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; 17 October 2016), and the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different insulin types and regimens in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. We had planned to include cluster-RCTs, but none were identified. We excluded quasi-randomised controlled trials and cross-over trials. We included studies published in abstract form and contacted the authors for further details when applicable. Conference abstracts were superseded by full publications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias, and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

The findings in this review were based on very low-quality evidence, from single, small sample sized trial estimates, with wide confidence intervals (CI), some of which crossed the line of no effect; many of the prespecified outcomes were not reported. Therefore, they should be interpreted with caution. We included five trials that included 554 women and babies (four open-label, multi-centre, two-arm trials; one single centre, four-arm RCT). All five trials were at a high or unclear risk of bias due to lack of blinding, unclear methods of randomisation, and selective reporting of outcomes. Pooling of data from the trials was not possible, as each trial looked at a different comparison.1. One trial (N = 33 women) compared Lispro insulin with regular insulin and provided very low-quality evidence for the outcomes. There were seven episodes of pre-eclampsia in the Lispro group and nine in the regular insulin group, with no clear difference between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.30). There were five caesarean sections in the Lispro group and nine in the regular insulin group, with no clear difference between the two groups (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.39). There were no cases of fetal anomaly in the Lispro group and one in the regular insulin group, with no clear difference between the groups (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.08). Macrosomia, perinatal deaths, episodes of birth trauma including shoulder dystocia, nerve palsy, and fracture, and the composite outcome measure of neonatal morbidity were not reported.2. One trial (N = 42 women) compared human insulin to animal insulin, and provided very low-quality evidence for the outcomes. There were no cases of macrosomia in the human insulin group and two in the animal insulin group, with no clear difference between the groups (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.30). Perinatal death, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, fetal anomaly, birth trauma including shoulder dystocia, nerve palsy and fracture and the composite outcome measure of neonatal morbidity were not reported.3. One trial (N = 93 women) compared pre-mixed insulin (70 NPH/30 REG) to self-mixed, split-dose insulin and provided very low-quality evidence to support the outcomes. Two cases of macrosomia were reported in the pre-mixed insulin group and four in the self-mixed insulin group, with no clear difference between the two groups (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.54). There were seven cases of caesarean section (for cephalo-pelvic disproportion) in the pre-mixed insulin group and 12 in the self-mixed insulin group, with no clear difference between groups (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.32). Perinatal death, pre-eclampsia, fetal anomaly, birth trauma including shoulder dystocia, nerve palsy, or fracture and the composite outcome measure of neonatal morbidity were not reported.4. In the same trial (N = 93 women), insulin injected with a Novolin pen was compared to insulin injected with a conventional needle (syringe), which provided very low-quality evidence to support the outcomes. There was one case of macrosomia in the pen group and five in the needle group, with no clear difference between the different insulin regimens (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.76). There were five deliveries by caesarean section in the pen group compared with 14 in the needle group; women were less likely to deliver via caesarean section when insulin was injected with a pen compared to a conventional needle (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.97). Perinatal death, pre-eclampsia, fetal anomaly, birth trauma including shoulder dystocia, nerve palsy, or fracture, and the composite outcome measure of neonatal morbidity were not reported.5. One trial (N = 223 women) comparing insulin Aspart with human insulin reported none of the review's primary outcomes: macrosomia, perinatal death, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, fetal anomaly, birth trauma including shoulder dystocia. nerve palsy, or fracture, or the composite outcome measure of neonatal morbidity.6. One trial (N = 162 women) compared insulin Detemir with NPH insulin, and supported the outcomes with very low-quality evidence. There were three cases of major fetal anomalies in the insulin Detemir group and one in the NPH insulin group, with no clear difference between the groups (RR 3.15, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.67). Macrosomia, perinatal death, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, birth trauma including shoulder dystocia, nerve palsy, or fracture and the composite outcome of neonatal morbidity were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

With limited evidence and no meta-analyses, as each trial looked at a different comparison, no firm conclusions could be made about different insulin types and regimens in pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or 2 diabetes. Further research is warranted to determine who has an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. This would include larger trials, incorporating adequate randomisation and blinding, and key outcomes that include macrosomia, pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, fetal anomalies, and birth trauma.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, during pregnancy, ES 2013 guidelines recommend to consider prescribing long-acting insulin analog detemir during pregnancy in patients requiring basal insulin, if NPH insulin, in appropriate doses, has previously resulted in problematic hypoglycemia, or would result in a high risk of problematic hypoglycemia. Consider continuing insulin detemir in patients already successfully taking insulin detemir before pregnancy.

### Sensor-derived glycaemic metrics in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes randomised to faster acting insulin aspart or insulin aspart – A secondary analysis of the copenFast trial [^111oWQ4V]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Insulin doses, in particular mealtime insulin doses, increased during pregnancy. Pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes is characterised by alterations in insulin requirements from week to week. From around 16 weeks, insulin requirements increase gradually, and it is typically necessary to mainly increase mealtime insulin dose. The basal insulin dose also increases gradually, but to a smaller extent than the mealtime insulin. The higher doses of faster aspart and IAsp seen from 21 to 35 weeks compared to basal insulin doses thus reflect what can be expected during pregnancy. The observed lower basal insulin dose between the groups at 35 weeks may be coincidental since basal insulin doses were similar between the groups at all other trial visits.

In general, isCGM is the most commonly used CGM device worldwide, which is also the case in our centre. Additionally, there might be differences between values obtained by isCGM and rtCGM; thus, to ensure data homogeneity, we decided to analyse data only from women using this device.

This is, to our knowledge, the first report with detailed data on sensor‐derived glycaemic metrics during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes randomised to faster aspart or IAsp. Based on the favourable effects of faster aspart on glycaemic metrics and maternal hypoglycaemia, in the CopenFast trial, we suggest that women with type 1 diabetes can be offered faster aspart as part of pregnancy planning, so they can make informed choices regarding insulin treatment in a future pregnancy. To reduce potential temporarily fluctuating glucose values during pregnancy, a change in insulin type should ideally be made before pregnancy or after organogenesis is completed.

Strengths of this secondary analysis include the pre‐planned trial design based on a randomised control trial with prospectively collected data in a well characterised cohort of women with type 1 diabetes. All women were treated according to the same treatment recommendations by the same diabetes team. The isCGM data were continuously collected throughout pregnancy, and large amounts of data were included in this secondary analysis. The amount of missing isCGM data was low in both groups and is not likely to inflict bias.

### The role of ultra-rapid-acting insulin analogs in diabetes: an expert consensus [^111czUQk]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

According to data from retrospective studies and a limited number of RCT, IAsp or ILispro is not associated with adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. - Similarly, there are no reported safety issues with the additional excipients in URAA. Large study data in pregnant women are usually lacking and this is also true for RAA; caution is therefore still warranted. Nevertheless, the available data suggest that IAsp and ILispro in combination with the additional excipients are a safe option for pregnant women with diabetes during pregnancy and lactation. For URAsp, data from two clinical studies in pregnant women are now available. The first was a retrospective study of women with GDM on MDI therapy and reported significantly lower postprandial PPG levels and lower glycemic variability in women using URAsp compared with those using IAsp. The CopenFast trial was an open-label RCT of women with pre-existing T1D or T2D using URAsp in MDI or pump therapy during pregnancy. The results demonstrated comparable fetal growth and HbA1c values but significantly fewer severe hypoglycemic events with URAsp versus IAsp. Other pregnancy or three months postdelivery outcomes as well as TEAE were comparable.

In conclusion, the rapid onset and offset of URAA may offer a benefit to pregnant women with either GDM or pre-existing T1D or T2D by providing better predictability of insulin action and improved postprandial glycemic control without increasing safety outcomes, although definitive data from studies on URLi in pregnancy are currently not available. Bearing in mind the risk of hyperglycemia for both mother and infant in the light of the existing safety data, we support the use of URAA during pregnancy where achievement of PPG control is a priority.

### Type 1 diabetes in pregnancy [^114dqxoT]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital malformations and perinatal mortality rates remain severalfold higher in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes than in the background population, and still only a minority of women plan their pregnancy. Optimizing glycemic control is the accepted goal, but remains challenging, and must be constantly balanced against the risks of hypoglycemia. Recent advances including Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems, Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion, Closed Loop Devices and very Fast Acting Insulin Aspart analogs offer new possibilities to increase glucose time in target in selected, motivated patients, however their relative roles and indication for use require further elucidation. The importance of education cannot be overstated.

### Insulin aspart (Novolog) [^116tvkrM]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of insulin aspart IV (also known as Novolog, Merilog, Kirsty) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. Insulin aspart does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of major birth defects or adverse pregnancy outcomes based on available human data, and it is considered one of the preferred rapid-acting insulin options during pregnancy. When used appropriately and adjusted to maintain near-target maternal glucose levels, it can help reduce the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The drug insulin aspart IV (also known as Novolog, Merilog, Kirsty) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

4.4. Evidence

There is no indication that pregnant women with overt or gestational diabetes should not follow the same guidelines for nutrient intakes that are indicated for all pregnant women, with the exception of folic acid supplementation for which there is theoretical benefit to be achieved by taking higher than usual doses (see Evidence 1.4).

5.0. Blood glucose-lowering pharmacological therapy during pregnancy

Insulin therapy

5.1a. We suggest that the long-acting insulin analog detemir may be initiated during pregnancy for those women who require basal insulin and for whom NPH insulin, in appropriate doses, has previously resulted in, or for whom it is thought NPH insulin may result in, problematic hypoglycemia; insulin detemir may be continued in those women with diabetes already successfully taking insulin detemir before pregnancy. (2|⊕⊕⊕⊕)

5.1b. We suggest that those pregnant women successfully using insulin glargine before pregnancy may continue it during pregnancy. (2|⊕⊕○○)

5.1c. We suggest that the rapid-acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart be used in preference to regular (soluble) insulin in pregnant women with diabetes. (2|⊕⊕⊕○)

5.1d. We recommend the ongoing use of continuous sc insulin infusion during pregnancy in women with diabetes when this has been initiated before pregnancy (1|⊕⊕⊕○) but suggest that continuous sc insulin infusion not be initiated during pregnancy unless other insulin strategies including multiple daily doses of insulin have first been tried and proven unsuccessful. (2|⊕⊕○○)

5.1a–b. Evidence

In nonpregnant women, insulin detemir is associated with less hypoglycemia than NPH insulin. Insulin detemir has not shown adverse maternal or neonatal effects. Glargine use during pregnancy was not associated with unexpected adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in a large cohort study; however, the lack of a control group and the restrospective nature of this study limit the interpretation of the findings. Several retrospective cohort and case-control studies of pregnant women found that overall, the outcome with insulin glargine treatment was no different from, or was superior to, NPH insulin (,–).

Results

Our search of the PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Reviews databases resulted in the identification of seven eligible studies in pregnancy, nine in pediatric patients and 13 in people using CSII. Records were assessed to be ineligible and thereby excluded from the systematic review and meta-analysis for numerous reasons, including the study not being a RCT (observational studies, letters, case reports or review articles were excluded); ineligible population; in vitro or animal studies; study dealt with one of the RAIAs in mixture formulations; outcomes of interest were not reported; PK/PD studies in which basal insulins were the focus of the study; study primarily addressing stability in pumps; health–economics studies without efficacy or safety outcomes; paper written in a language other than English; duplicate record; or study not applicable to this review for other reasons. A flow diagram showing the number of retrieved, excluded and included records is shown in Fig. 1. Prior to submission of this manuscript (August 2017), PubMed and the Cochrane Reviews were searched as previously described and no additional studies that would have been provisionally eligible were identified.

Women with Pre-Existing T1D

Persson et al. compared treatment with insulin lispro with RHI treatment in a group of 33 pregnant women with T1D and found that the BG level was significantly lower after breakfast (but not after other meals) with insulin lispro (0.40 ± 3.20 vs. 1.81 ± 3.42 mmol/L; p < 0.01) (Table 1). The 95% confidence interval (CI) was not significantly different between treatments, either at 24 weeks gestation or before delivery. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia was low (zero and two episodes for insulin lispro and RHI, respectively) and there were no differences in perinatal outcomes or neonatal complications.

The largest trial was an international, parallel-group trial enrolling 322 women with T1D who at enrollment were pregnant for ≤ 10 weeks or planning to become pregnant. Women were randomized to either insulin aspart or RHI, both in combination with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin as the basal insulin. HbA1c levels were comparable in the two groups at the end of the second and third trimesters (treatment difference, insulin aspart–RHI: − 0.04% [95% CI − 0.18; 0.11], − 0.4 mmol/mol [95% CI − 2.0; 1.2]; and − 0.08% [95% CI − 0.23; 0.06], − 0.9 mmol/mol [95% CI − 2.5; 0.7], respectively). Mean plasma glucose levels at 90 min post-breakfast were significantly lower in those women receiving insulin aspart arm than in those receiving RHI (p = 0.044 and p = 0.001 for end of first and third trimesters, respectively). The mean PPG increment across all meals was lower for the insulin aspart arm than for the RHI arm at the end of the first and third trimesters (estimated treatment difference: –0.75 [95% CI − 1.25; − 0.25], p = 0.003 and − 0.40 [95% CI − 0.80; − 0.01], p = 0.044, respectively). The risk of major hypoglycemic events was numerically lower, but not significantly different, for insulin aspart (rate ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.36; 1.46]).

1.2. Evidence

Maternal hyperglycemia in the first few weeks of pregnancy increases the risk of fetal malformations, spontaneous abortions, and perinatal mortality. Ideal preconception blood glucose levels have not been definitively established, and the exact degree of risk of a congenital anomaly for a given HbA1C is not precisely known. It has been reported that the risk progressively rises in concert with the degree of periconceptional HbA1C elevation, although an increased risk compared with the general childbearing population has been observed with an HbA1C as low as 6.4%. It has, however, also been reported that there is a stable degree of anomaly risk of 3.9% to 5.0% with a periconceptional HbA1C of up to 10.4%, with this risk then climbing to 10.9% if the HbA1C is 10.4% or higher.

Insulin therapy

1.3a. We recommend that insulin-treated women with diabetes seeking to conceive be treated with multiple daily doses of insulin or continuous sc insulin infusion in preference to split-dose, premixed insulin therapy, because the former are more likely to allow for the achievement and maintenance of target blood glucose levels preconceptionally and, in the event of pregnancy, are more likely to allow for sufficient flexibility or precise adjustment of insulin therapy. (1|⊕⊕○○)

1.3b. We suggest that a change to a woman's insulin regimen, particularly when she starts continuous sc insulin infusion, be undertaken well in advance of withdrawing contraceptive measures or otherwise trying to conceive to allow the patient to acquire expertise in, and the optimization of, the chosen insulin regimen. (Ungraded recommendation)

1.3c. We suggest that insulin-treated women with diabetes seeking to conceive be treated with rapid-acting insulin analog therapy (with insulin aspart or insulin lispro) in preference to regular (soluble) insulin. (2|⊕⊕○○)

1.3d. We suggest that women with diabetes successfully using the long-acting insulin analogs insulin detemir or insulin glargine preconceptionally may continue with this therapy before and then during pregnancy. (2|⊕⊕○○)

### Diabetes in pregnancy and major new advances in diabetes care using long-acting and ultralong-acting insulins [^113PobKR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregestational diabetes complicates 1–2% of all pregnancies. Achievement of euglycemia prevents adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. Insulin is the first line and the backbone of diabetes treatment in and out of pregnancy, but the delicate balance between stringent control and hypoglycemia, along with the complexity and interruption of multiple injections per day, continue to make glycemic control challenging. The ideal basal insulin has a flat pharmacodynamic profile with minimal variability, and is relatively easy for patients and clinicians to use. Insulin analogs, such as insulins glargine and detemir, are the most common basal insulins used in pregnancy at this time, but insulin degludec, which has advantages like prolonged duration of action in the non-pregnant population, was recently shown to be equally as effective as detemir in pregnancy. The ease of a once daily injection without an increased risk of hypoglycemia is attractive to patients and clinicians who wish to simplify insulin regimens. Furthermore, there are current clinical trials evaluating once-weekly basal insulin regimens in the general population. This would decrease basal injections from a minimum of 365 per year to 52 per year, potentially increasing adherence and improving glycemic control. This review will discuss the evidence for insulin degludec in pregnancy as well as discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of once-weekly ultralong acting basal insulins in pregnancy.

Methods

Sources of Data and Search Criteria

The search terms "insulin lispro" (MeSH Terms) OR "insulin" (All Fields) AND "lispro" (All Fields) OR "insulin lispro" (All Fields) OR "lispro" (All Fields) OR aspart (All Fields) OR glulisine (All Fields) were used to search the PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Reviews databases electronically on 1 June 2016 to identify records for further examination. The titles and abstracts (and, when necessary, full papers) were then screened to identify papers potentially reporting relevant in vivo data on safety or efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving one of three special populations (children and adolescents with T1D; pregnant women with pre-gestational T1D or gestational diabetes [GDM]; people with T1D using CSII). We did not set a date range and therefore included any study published up to the date of the search. Reference lists of retrieved publications and targeted review articles of RAIAs were also searched to identify additional records that might be provisionally relevant.

Selection of Studies and Eligibility Criteria

Records identified as provisionally relevant were then further examined for eligibility to verify that they were indeed RCTs, either blinded or open-label and of parallel or crossover design, in one of the target special populations and that they reported data on one of the identified clinical outcomes of interest. Eligibility for the three study populations was as follows: for the pregnancy population, women with either pre-gestational T1D or GDM; for the pediatric population, children or adolescents aged < 18 years with T1D; for the CSII population, people with T1D of any age using an insulin pump.

The criterion for the treatment in eligible studies was the administration of one of the three RAIAs compared with either RHI or each other; trials in which the effect of the RAIA could not be isolated (as in basal–bolus trials in which different basal insulins were used in each arm) were excluded. We did not pre-specify a minimum duration for the studies, although very short-term (e.g. 1- to 2-day meal tests designed to study PK/PD) were excluded. Outcome measures of interest included glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG) or plasma glucose, PPG after any or all of the three main meals, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis and/or pump/catheter occlusion and, for pregnancy, fetal outcomes.

### Successful outcomes with insulin degludec in pregnancy: a case series [^115myRrP]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Optimal glycaemic control pre-conception and throughout pregnancy is paramount to achieve the best outcomes and to minimise the risk of complications for the mother and baby. Current long-acting insulin analogues that have been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK for use in pregnancy include glargine and detemir. In many patients, these treatments have limitations because of their pharmacokinetic properties thus not enabling optimal glycaemic control. Efforts at rapidly achieving the recommended blood glucose targets with these analogues can be associated with recurrent and/or disabling hypoglycaemia. Degludec is a second-generation ultra-long-acting insulin analogue, which has been shown to mimic endogenous basal insulin production by the pancreas. This may offer patients better control with less hypoglycaemia where first-generation insulins fail. There are currently no randomised controlled studies to support the use of insulin degludec in pregnancy. We report three cases of women who were on insulin degludec during pregnancy and achieved successful outcomes. Two of them were commenced on this during pregnancy because of hypoglycaemia with licenced insulin therapy. All the women showed an improvement in glycaemic control during pregnancy. There was attenuation of a wide glycaemic variability as demonstrated by a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system in one of the patients. They all delivered healthy babies. This case series highlights the urgent need for large randomised control trials to establish the safety and efficacy of insulin degludec in pregnancy.

### Short-acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for adult, non-pregnant persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111YvW9P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The use of short-acting insulin analogues (insulin lispro, insulin aspart, insulin glulisine) for adult, non-pregnant people with type 2 diabetes is still controversial, as reflected in many scientific debates.

Objectives

To assess the effects of short-acting insulin analogues compared to regular human insulin in adult, non-pregnant people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Search Methods

For this update we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the WHO ICTRP Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov to 31 October 2018. We placed no restrictions on the language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials with an intervention duration of at least 24 weeks that compared short-acting insulin analogues to regular human insulin in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes, who were not pregnant.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed dichotomous outcomes by risk ratios (RR), and Peto odds ratios (POR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed continuous outcomes by mean differences (MD) with 95% CI. We assessed trials for certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 10 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, randomising 2751 participants; 1388 participants were randomised to receive insulin analogues and 1363 participants to receive regular human insulin. The duration of the intervention ranged from 24 to 104 weeks, with a mean of about 41 weeks. The trial populations showed diversity in disease duration, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. None of the trials were blinded, so the risk of performance bias and detection bias, especially for subjective outcomes, such as hypoglycaemia, was high in nine of 10 trials from which we extracted data. Several trials showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods and results. None of the included trials defined all-cause mortality as a primary outcome. Six trials provided Information on the number of participants who died during the trial, with five deaths out of 1272 participants (0.4%) in the insulin analogue groups and three deaths out of 1247 participants (0.2%) in the regular human insulin groups (Peto OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 6.64; P = 0.48; moderate-certainty evidence). Six trials, with 2509 participants, assessed severe hypoglycaemia differently, therefore, we could not summarise the results with a meta-analysis. Overall, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events was low, and none of the trials showed a clear difference between the two intervention arms (low-certainty evidence). The MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change was -0.03% (95% CI -0.16 to 0.09; P = 0.60; 9 trials, 2608 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction ranged between -0.31% and 0.25%. The MD in the overall number of non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes per participant per month was 0.08 events (95% CI 0.00 to 0.16; P = 0.05; 7 trials, 2667 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between -0.03 and 0.19 events per participant per month. The results provided for nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were of questionable validity. Overall, there was no clear difference between the two short-acting insulin analogues and regular human insulin. Two trials assessed health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction, but we considered the results for both outcomes to be unreliable (very low-certainty evidence). No trial was designed to investigate possible long term effects (all-cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes), especially in participants with diabetes-related complications. No trial reported on socioeconomic effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Our analysis found no clear benefits of short-acting insulin analogues over regular human insulin in people with type 2 diabetes. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was poor and results on patient-relevant outcomes, like all-cause mortality, microvascular or macrovascular complications and severe hypoglycaemic episodes were sparse. Long-term efficacy and safety data are needed to draw conclusions about the effects of short-acting insulin analogues on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Use of insulin glargine during pregnancy: a review [^111FWcnb]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Backgound and Aims

Hyperglycemia during pregnancy is increasing globally. Insulin therapy is considered the standard of care for its optimum management. Insulin glargine, in spite of widespread use in non-pregnant adults, lacks randomized controlled trial evidence as safe basal insulin during pregnancy. Aim of this review is to discuss major available evidences and recommendations on the use of insulin glargine during pregnancy.

Methods

Evidences related to use of insulin glargine during pregnancy, including animal studies, placental transfer studies, case reports as well as observational studies were retrieved using PUBMED & Google scholar. Recommendations regarding use of insulin glargine during pregnancy by international and Indian organizations were reviewed.

Results

Trans-placental transfer studies show that insulin glargine does not cross placenta when used at therapeutic concentrations. Although there are no randomized controlled trials on insulin glargine in pregnancy, it's use during pregnancy is not associated with any adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes as shown in many case reports and observational studies (both prospective and retrospective). It's use during pregnancy is hence considered safe by many organizations across the globe.

Conclusions

Insulin glargine can be continued safely during pregnancy in women who are already taking it prior to pregnancy and have achieved good glycemic control with it. However we require preferably randomized controlled trials or large prospective observational studies to establish it as first line or preferred basal insulin for management of hyperglycemia during pregnancy.

### Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in diabetes: patient populations, safety, efficacy, and pharmacoeconomics [^112BvSx4]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The level of glycaemic control necessary to achieve optimal short-term and long-term outcomes in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) typically requires intensified insulin therapy using multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. For continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, the insulins of choice are the rapid-acting insulin analogues, insulin aspart, insulin lispro and insulin glulisine. The advantages of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion over multiple daily injections in adult and paediatric populations with T1DM include superior glycaemic control, lower insulin requirements and better health-related quality of life/patient satisfaction. An association between continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and reduced hypoglycaemic risk is more consistent in children/adolescents than in adults. The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is widely recommended in both adult and paediatric T1DM populations but is limited in pregnant patients and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. All available rapid-acting insulin analogues are approved for use in adult, paediatric and pregnant populations. However, minimum patient age varies (insulin lispro: no minimum; insulin aspart: ≥ 2 years; insulin glulisine: ≥ 6 years) and experience in pregnancy ranges from extensive (insulin aspart, insulin lispro) to limited (insulin glulisine). Although more expensive than multiple daily injections, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is cost-effective in selected patient groups. This comprehensive review focuses on the European situation and summarises evidence for the efficacy and safety of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, particularly when used with rapid-acting insulin analogues, in adult, paediatric and pregnant populations. The review also discusses relevant European guidelines; reviews issues that surround use of this technology; summarises the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion on patients' health-related quality of life; reviews relevant pharmacoeconomic data; and discusses recent advances in pump technology, including the development of closed-loop 'artificial pancreas' systems. © 2015 The Authors.

### Diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112ycyxB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

1.0. Preconception care of women with diabetes

Preconception counseling

1.1. We recommend that preconception counseling be provided to all women with diabetes who are considering pregnancy. (1|⊕⊕○○)

Preconception glycemic control

1.2. We suggest that women with diabetes seeking to conceive strive to achieve blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels as close to normal as possible when they can be safely achieved without undue hypoglycemia. (2|⊕⊕○○) (See Recommendations 3.2a–d.)

Insulin therapy

1.3a. We recommend that insulin-treated women with diabetes seeking to conceive be treated with multiple daily doses of insulin or continuous sc insulin infusion in preference to split-dose, premixed insulin therapy, because the former are more likely to allow for the achievement and maintenance of target blood glucose levels preconceptionally and, in the event of pregnancy, are more likely to allow for sufficient flexibility or precise adjustment of insulin therapy. (1|⊕⊕○○)

1.3b. We suggest that a change to a woman's insulin regimen, particularly when she starts continuous sc insulin infusion, be undertaken well in advance of withdrawing contraceptive measures or otherwise trying to conceive to allow the patient to acquire expertise in, and the optimization of, the chosen insulin regimen. (Ungraded recommendation)

1.3c. We suggest that insulin-treated women with diabetes seeking to conceive be treated with rapid-acting insulin analog therapy (with insulin aspart or insulin lispro) in preference to regular (soluble) insulin. (2|⊕⊕○○)

1.3d. We suggest that women with diabetes successfully using the long-acting insulin analogs insulin detemir or insulin glargine preconceptionally may continue with this therapy before and then during pregnancy. (2|⊕⊕○○)

Folic acid supplementation

1.4. We recommend that beginning 3 months before withdrawing contraceptive measures or otherwise trying to conceive, a woman with diabetes take a daily folic acid supplement to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. (1|⊕⊕○○) We suggest a daily dose of 5 mg based on this dose's theoretical benefits. (2|⊕⊕○○)

### Efficacy and safety of rapid-acting insulin analogs in special populations with type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112UqM9G]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the safety and efficacy of RAIAs in populations of patients who are either typically excluded from clinical trials (i.e. due to pregnancy) or require dedicated trials (i.e. children and adolescents, patients using CSII). Overall, for insulin lispro and insulin aspart, data across all three special populations indicate that their safety and efficacy are comparable with, and in some cases significantly better than, RHI. Data also suggest, from the more limited results available, similar characteristics for insulin glulisine.

There are no head-to-head RCTs individually comparing all three RAIAs with each other in the pediatric CSII setting. However, in 2009, the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care in Germany, acknowledging the limited amount of data at the time, concluded that there were no significant differences between RHI and any of the three RAIAs in terms of key efficacy and safety endpoints. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines specifically indicate that RAIAs are preferred over RHI for use in CSII for pediatric patients.

Given the lack of any major safety concerns when the three RAIAs were studied individually, there is no a priori reason to suspect that head-to-head trials would reveal any substantive differences in safety among them in special populations. However, without randomized comparative trials in these special populations, that conclusion remains speculative. Due to the limited number of studies and the heterogeneity of the outcome measures, only limited meta-analysis was possible, primarily in the CSII population. Those results indicate that RAIAs in CSII lower post-breakfast BG and possibly HbA1c to a greater extent than RHI, without an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Although many trials have been published using CSII versus multiple daily injections (MDI) in pediatric subjects, we did not review those here because it was impossible to separate the effects of the RAIA from those of the mode of treatment (CSII or MDI).

### Rapid-acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin: a meta-analysis of effects on glycemic control in patients with diabetes [^112dMKTu]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

Data Sources and Searches

We searched PubMed for studies published between 1999 and 29 June 2016, using the following search string: 'insulin, short-acting' OR 'insulin lispro' OR 'insulin aspart' OR 'insulin glulisine' OR 'Novorapid' OR 'Apidra' OR 'Humalog' OR 'protamine suspension' OR 'insulin aspart protamine drug combination 30:70' OR 'Novolog' NOT ('pregnancy' OR 'pregnant women' OR 'hospitalization' OR 'institutionalization' OR 'paediatric' OR 'child' OR 'childhood' OR 'infant' OR 'newborn'). The search was then filtered to identify RCTs only.

The bibliographies of included studies and relevant reviews were searched to identify additional studies for inclusion.

Study Selection

We included all RCTs of patients with diabetes published from 1999 to 29 June 2016 that assessed the effects of RAIAs or RHI on glycemic control, with a focus on pre- and postprandial BG and HbA1c. All identified abstracts and study titles were initially reviewed independently by Antonio Nicolucci and Marco Orsini Federici. Subsequently, full articles of potentially appropriate trials were downloaded and screened for inclusion. The following article types and studies were excluded: reviews, editorials, case reports, clamp studies, studies of less than 4 weeks' duration, studies involving healthy volunteers, animal studies, and studies published in languages other than English.

Two reviewers (Antonio Nicolucci and Marco Orsini Federici) discussed and decided upon the final studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Only studies that reported both means and standard deviations (SDs) for the outcomes of interest were included in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed independently by Antonio Nicolucci and Marco Orsini Federici, who prepared a data extraction spreadsheet containing data collated from the final studies selected. Extracted data included study reference details, patient numbers, patient characteristics, measures of GV, incidence of hypoglycaemia, and other relevant study information. Any discrepancies in the data gathered were discussed by Antonio Nicolucci and Marco Orsini Federici until a consensus was reached.

### Management of diabetes in pregnancy: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115kuNyc]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Insulin therapy and dosing changes in pregnancy — type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and GDM — specify that insulin should be used to manage type 1 diabetes in pregnancy and is preferred for the management of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy and GDM; in early pregnancy many with type 1 diabetes have lower insulin requirements with an increased risk for hypoglycemia, after which at around 16 weeks total daily insulin doses increase linearly by ∼5% per week through week 36, usually resulting in a doubling of daily insulin dose compared with the prepregnancy requirement.

### Insulin use during gestational and pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy: a systematic review of study design [^114B56Ht]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The recommendations from current standard of care of diabetes management in pregnant women are beyond regular blood glucose level monitoring, lifestyle behavioral changes, medical nutrition therapy (MNT), physical exercise and pharmacotherapy (metformin, glyburide or insulin). Insulin is considered the most efficacious pharmacotherapy for all types of diabetes in pregnancy, including GDM and pregestational diabetes. The 2023 update of the the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists-2018 (ACOG-2018) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines recommend use of insulin as a first-line pharmacological therapy for management of pre-existing diabetes and GDM over other oral anti-diabetic agents.

Recent advances in insulin therapy are focused on improving the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin. These goals enable prolonged profile of action, flexible dosing regimen and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. However, well-powered randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in pregnant women with diabetes are often conducted well after non-pregnant populations, if it is done at all, which leads to delayed implementation of evidence-based practices for insulin use in pregnancy. In addition, designing studies to demonstrate the achievement of stringent glycemic targets as recommended by the guidelines remains challenging for this unique population. A variety of insulins have been commercially available globally, many of which have limited data on their use in pregnancy. Real-world barriers such as access to insulin or newer insulins, access to glucose monitoring and delayed prenatal care can further make adhering to guidelines difficult, if not impossible. Considering the different insulin options available in the global market and understanding the use and effects of types of insulin and/or insulin regimens on glycemic, maternal and fetal outcomes may support clinical practice. This may as well aid in improving study designs for treatment of diabetes in pregnancy. Therefore, to assess and evaluate the current body of evidence including RCTs and real-world observational data, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to better understand and summarize the evidence for insulin use in pregnancy to harmonize future study design in this special population.

### Successful outcomes with insulin degludec in pregnancy: a case series [^115fH9BY]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Optimal glycaemic control before and throughout pregnancy plays an important role in minimising detrimental effects on the foetus, pregnant women, and neonates. Insulin remains the gold standard of treatment for achieving blood glucose targets during pregnancy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in those with type 2 or gestational diabetes mellitus where metformin monotherapy is not tolerated or unlikely to achieve glycaemic targets.

Insulin analogues, such as rapid-acting lispro and aspart, and long-acting (or basal) glargine and detemir are licensed and have been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in diabetes during pregnancy in the UK. The basal insulins analogues have been, in theory, designed to mimic the secretion of endogenous basal insulin. Whilst they have demonstrated good glycaemic control in pregnant women, they have limitations due to their pharmacokinetic profiles. Their activity rises to a peak/plateau gradually and then declines, thereby producing peaks and troughs that can potentially cause hypo- and hyperglycaemia. Degludec is a newer ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogue that has shown a prolonged duration of action (> 42 h) and the absence of peak in plasma concentration/activity in non-pregnant subjects. It reaches a steady-state concentration with 3 days of administration. A half-life of > 25 h ensures lower intra-subject variability within a 24-h dosing interval. This would provide a potential advantage for its use in pregnancy to achieve glycaemic goals without the increased risk of maternal hypoglycaemia. However, there is no evidence from controlled studies about the long-term safety and efficacy to support the use of insulin degludec in pregnancy.

We report three cases of women with pre-existing diabetes under our joint diabetes and antenatal clinic at a district general hospital who successfully conceived on therapy with degludec during pregnancy. The women had made an informed choice to be continued (case 1) or commenced (cases 2 and 3) on insulin degludec as a therapeutic trial to help them achieve their glycaemic goals in pregnancy. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants for being included in the case series.

### U-500R and aspart insulin for the treatment of severe insulin resistance in pregnancy associated with pregestational diabetes [^114C3LGN]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Severe insulin resistance as a complication of diabetes in pregnancy is seen with increasing frequency. Treatment with large doses of insulin (> 300 units perday) can be practically difficult. A woman with preexisting Type 2 diabetes mellitus and poor glycemic control presented in early pregnancy requiring over 1000 units of insulin daily. She was transitioned to subcutaneous U-500 (concentrated regular insulin) in combination with a rapid-acting insulin analog achieving good glycemic control and good maternal and fetal outcomes. U-500R insulin in conjunction with a rapid-acting insulin analog can be used safely in early pregnancy to improve glycemic control in severe insulin resistance due to pregestational diabetes.

### Insulin therapy in pregnancy complicated by diabetes: are insulin analogs a new tool? [^117Gk4yx]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

It has been demonstrated that good metabolic control maintained throughout pregnancy can reduce maternal and fetal complications in diabetes. To achieve good metabolic control, before conception and throughout pregnancy, insulin therapy needs to be optimized, and, in this context, the new insulins currently on the market may help. We therefore review here what is known about the potential benefits and risks related to the use of these new insulins in pregnancy. Clinical and experimental data on insulin lispro strongly suggest that lispro does not have adverse maternal or fetal effects during pregnancy in women with preexisting diabetes, and also that its use in these women results in improved glycemic control, fewer hypoglycemic episodes, and improved patient satisfaction. In women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the use of insulin lispro is efficient in reducing postprandial hyperglycemia and some neonatal features related to hyperglycemia, thus stressing its usefulness in this condition. As for insulin aspart, clinical data on GDM patients shows the same efficacy as insulin lispro in lowering postprandial hyperglycemia, indicating that insulin aspart may be used in GDM when this condition is characterized by postprandial hyperglycemia. The results of a multicentric study now in progress on the efficacy and safety of insulin aspart in type 1 pregnant diabetic patients will definitely be useful in establishing whether this insulin is safe in pregnancy. For the moment, the use of insulin glargine during pregnancy is not recommended owing to the lack of data on maternal and fetal effects.

### Rapid, patient-led titration of basal insulin can be used to achieve tight glycaemic control in gestational diabetes mellitus with insulin resistance [^1142qy6k]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and significant insulin resistance in her third pregnancy was diagnosed with a fasting blood glucose reading of 5.7 mmol/L (103 mg/dL) at 28+1 weeks gestation and referred to our diabetes team. Using a rapid, patient-led approach to basal insulin titration this patient achieved therapeutic doses and glucose targets in the limited time available during pregnancy, without causing significant hypoglycaemia. This method of insulin titration empowers women with GDM to take control of their own management and could reduce complications in GDM pregnancies at negligible additional cost. The only additional cost being that of the higher insulin doses used.

### Rapid-acting insulin analogues in basal-bolus regimens in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^116kfJBp]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare rapid-acting insulin analogues with regular human insulin in terms of hemoglobin A1c, hypoglycemia, and insulin dose when used in a basal-bolus regimen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

MEDLINE and congress proceedings were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing prandial insulins in a basal-bolus regimen in adults or children/adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Studies in pregnancy, observational studies, studies that compared premixed insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion/insulin pumps, and studies where the basal insulin was also changed were excluded. Only studies reporting baseline-endpoint change in insulin dose, or baseline and/or endpoint values, were included.

Results

Twenty-eight studies were identified (insulin glulisine, 4; insulin aspart, 7; insulin lispro, 17). Twenty-five studies compared a rapid-acting insulin analogue with regular human insulin, and 3 trials compared 2 rapid-acting insulin analogues. Overall, rapid-acting insulin analogues in a basal-bolus regimen provided similar or greater improvements in glycemic control than regular human insulin at similar insulin doses, as well as a lower incidence of hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

Results of the studies identified in this literature review indicate that a basal-bolus regimen with prandial rapid-acting insulin analogue provides advantages over basal-bolus regimens using prandial regular human insulin, providing improvements in glycemic control comparable to those obtained with regular human insulin, as well as a lower incidence of hypoglycemia.

### Fast-acting insulin aspart: the rationale for a new mealtime insulin [^113EFPEe]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

The Clinical Pharmacology of Faster Aspart

FAsp has been specifically developed with a view to deliver its glucodynamic and kinetic effects more quickly compared with current prandial analogue insulins, and thus to more rapidly mimic endogenously produced insulin (Fig. 1). This has been achieved through the inclusion of niacinamide as an absorption modifier and-arginine as a stabiliser for the insulin aspart (IAsp) preparation (Fig. 2). In a pooled analysis of six euglycaemic clamp studies in people with type 1 diabetes, faster aspart showed an approximate 5-min earlier onset of appearance, early insulin exposure that was twice as high, and a 74% greater early glucose-lowering effect compared with IAsp. Furthermore, loss of glucose-lowering effect and insulin occurred up to 14 min sooner with FAsp than with IAsp. Similar pharmacological properties have been observed in a Japanese population, the elderly, children and adolescents.

Fig. 1

Fig. 2
Formulation of faster insulin aspart

Since FAsp is essentially IAsp with modified absorption kinetics, it has the same immunogenicity and teratogenicity safety profile as that of IAsp.

In elderly subjects, total insulin exposure and the peak insulin concentration of FAsp were 30% greater than in younger subjects. No age-related differences in glucodynamic effects have been noted, however. Based on these pharmacological properties, FAsp may have the potential for both pre- and postprandial dosing and could also be used to address the issues of late postprandial hypoglycaemia and early postprandial hyperglycaemia that may occur with prandial insulin therapy, particularly in the area of the increasingly widespread use of flash glucose monitoring, where such issues may be more readily identified.

When transferring to FAsp from another prandial insulin, close glucose monitoring is recommended, with conversion being made on a unit-for-unit basis. FAsp can be used in pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Since FAsp can be administered up to 20 min before the start of a meal or up to 20 min after starting a meal, the time to onset of action must be considered when prescribing to patients with concomitant conditions where a delayed absorption of food might be expected, such as those with established gastroparesis.

Insulin is the primary treatment in all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (A).
Typically, patients with T1DM will require initiation with multiple daily injections at the time of diagnosis. This is usually short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue given 0 to 15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulin. Two or three premixed insulin injections per day may be used (A).
The target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all children with T1DM, including preschool children, is recommended to be < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol). The target is chosen aiming at minimizing hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic unawareness, and reducing the likelihood of development of long-term complications (B).
For patients prone to glycemic variability, glycemic control is best evaluated by a combination of results with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (B).
Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy (B).
In T2DM patients, with regards to achieving glycemic goals, insulin is considered alone or in combination with oral agents when HbA1c is ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol); and is essential for treatment in those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), when diet, physical activity, and other antihyperglycemic agents have been optimally used (B).
The preferred method of insulin initiation in T2DM is to begin by adding a long-acting (basal) insulin or once-daily premixed/co-formulation insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin, alone or in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (B).
If the desired glucose targets are not met, rapid-acting or short-acting (bolus or prandial) insulin can be added at mealtime to control the expected postprandial raise in glucose. An insulin regimen should be adopted and individualized but should, to the extent possible, closely resemble a natural physiologic state and avoid, to the extent possible, wide fluctuating glucose levels (C).
Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of effective insulin therapy and should not be omitted in the patient's care plan. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values should be used to titrate basal insulin, whereas both FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG) values should be used to titrate mealtime insulin (B).
Metformin combined with insulin is associated with decreased weight gain, lower insulin dose, and less hypoglycemia when compared with insulin alone (C).
Oral medications should not be abruptly discontinued when starting insulin therapy because of the risk of rebound hyperglycemia (D).
Analogue insulin is as effective as human insulin but is associated with less postprandial hyperglycemia and delayed hypoglycemia (B).
The shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular (IM) injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them (A).
Many patients in East Africa reuse syringes for various reasons, including financial. This is not recommended by the manufacturer and there is an association between needle reuse and lipohypertrophy. However, patients who reuse needles should not be subjected to alarming claims of excessive morbidity from this practice (A).
Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (A).

### Hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic pregnancy: role of preconception insulin aspart treatment in a randomized study [^114F5AAc]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Severe hypoglycemia is common in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, with observed rates up to 15 times those reported by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, and severe hypoglycemia occurs in 19–44% of patients treated with intensive insulin therapy during pregnancy. The risk of experiencing a severe event is usually highest in early pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester.

The risk factors that predict severe hypoglycemic episodes during pregnancy include duration of diabetes, a history of previous severe episodes (recurrent events), hypoglycemic unawareness, a change in insulin treatment (such as regimen or dosing) or a high insulin dose, and A1C < 6.5%. However, because normoglycemia is universally recommended in diabetic pregnancy, with A1C levels between 4.0 and 6.0% advocated to optimize pregnancy outcome, minimizing the risk of severe hypoglycemia is a major challenge to those caring for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.

Preconception care programs are associated with both reduced malformations and fewer early fetal losses in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, perhaps due to improved glycemic control in the first stages of pregnancy. It is possible that working with women to improve metabolic control and optimize their insulin regimen before pregnancy might also help to reduce the high rate of severe episodes of hypoglycemia postconception, but this has yet to be demonstrated.

We recently completed a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multinational, multicenter study investigating maternal and fetal outcomes in 322 women with type 1 diabetes treated with either prandial insulin aspart (IAsp) or human insulin. IAsp injected immediately before eating was as effective and well tolerated as human insulin administered 30 min before eating. Although the study was somewhat underpowered, there were strong trends toward improved postprandial glucose control and prevention of severe hypoglycemia in the IAsp group. This study supports the conclusions of trials in nonpregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes, which suggest that the advantages of rapid-acting insulin analogs are most likely to be seen in those with tight control.

The aim of this exploratory analysis was to compare the incidence of severe hypoglycemia during pregnancy between women enrolled into the trial either preconception or early in the first trimester. Finally, we also compared the effects of the different insulins on rates of severe hypoglycemia according to the time of enrollment of (pregnant) women into the study.

### Hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic pregnancy: role of preconception insulin aspart treatment in a randomized study [^114QjMeR]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Our data show an apparent rise in hypoglycemia in the weeks immediately before birth. This finding might relate to a fall in insulin requirements in the immediate predelivery period. A further intriguing finding was that the benefit of a rapid-acting insulin analog (IAsp) associated with a lower risk of severe hypoglycemia than that with human insulin tended to be most pronounced in women who were randomly assigned preconception. This result may be related to their experience with the use of insulin IAsp before the influence of the metabolic changes of pregnancy. The rate of severe hypoglycemia immediately postpartum was considerably higher than that in the last half of pregnancy and was also higher than that seen in observational data in nonpregnant diabetic populations, suggesting that women should focus on reducing their postpartum insulin dose and returning to preconception glycemic control goals.

This analysis suggests that the initiation of insulin analog treatment preconception as opposed to during early pregnancy results in a lower risk of severe hypoglycemia in women with type 1 diabetes. The reasons for this finding remain unclear but might include the influence of preconception planning. Although the limitations of exploratory analyses prevent any firm conclusions, these data suggest another potential advantage of prenatal care that is worthy of further investigation. The observation should also be taken into account in future clinical trials during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes.

### Insulin degludec versus insulin detemir, both in combination with insulin aspart, in the treatment of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (EXPECT): an open ‑ label, multinational, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^112JKMDX]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Insulin degludec (degludec) is a second-generation basal insulin with an improved pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile compared with first-generation basal insulins, but there are few data regarding its use during pregnancy. In this non-inferiority trial, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of degludec with insulin detemir (detemir), both in combination with insulin aspart (aspart), in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.

Methods

This open-label, multinational, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial (EXPECT) was conducted at 56 sites (hospitals and medical centres) in 14 countries. Women aged at least 18 years with type 1 diabetes who were between gestational age 8 weeks (+0 days) and 13 weeks (+6 days) or planned to become pregnant were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive web response system, to degludec (100 U/mL) once daily or detemir (100 U/mL) once or twice daily, both with mealtime insulin aspart (100 U/mL), all via subcutaneous injection. Participants who were pregnant received the trial drug at randomisation, throughout pregnancy and until 28 days post-delivery (end of treatment). Participants not pregnant at randomisation initiated the trial drug before conception. The primary endpoint was the last planned HbA 1c measurement before delivery (non-inferiority margin of 0.4% for degludec vs detemir). Secondary endpoints included efficacy, maternal safety, and pregnancy outcomes. The primary endpoint was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who were pregnant during the trial. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who were pregnant during the trial and exposed to at least one dose of trial drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03377699, and is now completed.

Findings

Between Nov 22, 2017, and Nov 8, 2019, from 296 women screened, 225 women were randomly assigned to degludec (n = 111) or detemir (n = 114). Mean HbA 1c at pregnancy baseline was 6.6% (SD 0.6%; approximately 49 mmol/mol; SD 7 mmol/mol) in the degludec group and 6.5% (0.8%; approximately 48 mmol/mol; 9 mmol/mol) in the detemir group. Mean last planned HbA 1c measurement before delivery was 6.2% (SE 0.07%; approximately 45 mmol/mol; SE 0.8 mmol/mol) in the degludec group and 6.3% (SE 0.07%; approximately 46 mmol/mol; SE 0.8 mmol/mol) in the detemir group (estimated treatment difference -0.11% [95% CI -0.31 to 0.08]; -1.2 mmol/mol [95% CI: -3.4 to 0.9]; p non-inferiority < 0.0001), confirming non-inferiority. Compared with detemir, no additional safety issues were observed with degludec.

Interpretation

In pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, degludec was found to be non-inferior to detemir.

### Insulin pump for type 2 diabetes: use and misuse of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in type 2 diabetes [^117NkYcD]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Is pump a useful adjunct for type 2 diabetic women during pregnancy?

Pregnancy outcomes in women with pregestational type 2 diabetes seem to be either similar or worse in comparison with type 1 diabetic patients. Lack of comprehensive and intensive metabolic control of pregestational type 2 diabetic patients before and during gestation has been hypothesized to underlie such serious adverse fetal outcome. Several organizations such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and International Diabetes Federation's Global Diabetes in Pregnancy Guideline recommend insulin as optimal therapy ideally initiated prior to pregnancy, which is often not done. As the glycemic target in type 2 diabetic pregnancies is similar to that in type 1, the majority of women will therefore require complex multiple daily dose regimens. Additionally, insulin requirements vary according to the phase of the pregnancy, adding to the complexity of treatment in patients who usually are unaccustomed to intensive insulin therapy. Intensification in the management of pregnancy in type 2 diabetes women would greatly improve pregnancy outcome, as shown in the Atlantic Diabetes in Pregnancy (Atlantic DIP) intervention. In such circumstances, CSII use has the potential to be one of the components in assisting patients with type 2 diabetes with the complexity of insulin therapy regimens during gestation. The potential advantages of CSII use in type 2 during pregnancy includes 1) a better glucose control than with MDI; 2) allowance of temporary basal rates and flexible boluses, which are important throughout pregnancy and are not available with MDI; 3) a decrease in hypoglycemia rate; 4) assistance for weight maintenance; and 5) an improvement in quality of life. Data downloads from insulin pumps, glucometers, and continuous glucose monitoring systems facilitate insight into patients' control, behavior, and educational needs. Average insulin requirements for women with type 2 diabetes using CSII range from 0.6 units/kg during the first trimester to 0.8 units/kg in second trimester and 1.03 units/kg in the last trimester, but the variability is high (O. Cohen, unpublished observation). Approximately 50% of the total daily insulin is administered as long-acting insulin analog. Hitherto, no randomized control study on pump use in type 2 diabetes during pregnancy has been published. Retrospective data have shown that in selected "difficult to manage" patients with type 2 diabetes from ethnic backgrounds with high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, failing to reach target glycemia or with fetal growth acceleration on high doses of insulin with at least four injections per day, insulin pump therapy was safe and effective. It is our prediction that with the growing concern over pregnancy outcomes in type 2 diabetes, more retrospective data and prospective randomized trials will be available using current pumps, modern consumables (catheters, tubing, etc.), and updated data-management systems.

### Insulin glargine use during pregnancy [^112aRWuo]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature regarding the use of insulin glargine during pregnancy, specifically addressing the issues and concerns surrounding mitogenicity, placental transfer, and maternal and fetal safety.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature search using MEDLINE and BIOSIS Previews up to March 2011. Additional studies were identified by hand-searching reference lists from original articles. Inclusion was limited to studies and abstracts in the English language.

Results

A total of 23 reports with 1001 pregnancies managed with insulin glargine contained relevant information regarding the maternal and fetal safety of its use during pregnancy. Insulin glargine does not appear to have enhanced mitogenic activity when compared with the mitogenic activity of native human insulin. The transplacental transfer of insulin glargine appears to be negligible, although it is possible that antibody-bound insulin glargine may gain access to the fetal compartment. The available data suggest that there are no identifiable, consistent adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with the use of insulin glargine during pregnancy, including during the first trimester.

Conclusions

Use of insulin glargine during pregnancy should be seriously considered in uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy and in those patients taking insulin glargine before conception, because the benefits from improved glycemic control would be expected to outweigh any, as yet, unproven risks of insulin glargine exposure.

Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy — conditional use of metformin in select type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subgroups may be reasonable when insulin use is difficult, as 'Notably, some subgroups with mild T2DM may respond well to metformin and require little insulin', and 'those reluctant to inject multiple doses of insulin or who have psychological, financial, access, or other barriers that reduce the safe and effective use of insulin may benefit from metformin', with the guidance that 'In these individuals, metformin could be considered, especially if cost savings are appreciable and patient preference is strong, to minimize the frequency or dosing required of insulin injections'.

### Dysglycemias in pregnancy: from diagnosis to treatment. Brazilian consensus statement [^11255xRt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

The decision to begin insulin therapy may be a choice for a gestational diabetic woman and her physician when the medical nutrition therapy is too difficult to maintain glycemic levels in acceptable ranges. Those with pregestational diabetes generally have to change their insulin regimen. Depending on the type, severity, and stage of diabetes, patients may have only elevated postprandial glucose levels and normal fasting blood glucose levels, or the fasting glucose levels may be elevated as well. If postprandial glucose is the target of treatment, the rapid-acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart, appear to be as safe and effective as regular human insulin, achieving better postprandial glucose concentrations with less late prandial hypoglycemia. If the patient has elevated fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels and requires multiple daily injections to achieve good glycemic control, a basal-bolus regimen should be considered. The long-acting insulin analogs do not have as pronounced a peak effect as NPH insulin and therefore cause less nocturnal hypoglycemia. However, the safety of these insulin analogs needs to be further established in pregnant women. Issues that will need to be further clarified include the question of whether these insulin analogs have teratogenic effects on the developing fetus, alter the balance between the binding affinity to IGF-I receptor and insulin receptor, are associated with increased risk of retinopathy, or show increased antibodies levels. Because the lack of information, large-scale controlled clinical trials are warranted.

Discontinue angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, due to its association with embriopathies and fetopathies, before pregnancy or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, and substitute them with alternative anti-hypertensive agents suitable for use during pregnancy (A). These agents are: methyldopa, long acting nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers with partial beta agonist activity like carvedilol, labetalol and pindolol; the use of atenolol has been associated with fetal growth restriction and must be avoided (C).

Discontinue statins before pregnancy or as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, due to its potential teratogenic effects (A).

It is still not clear if the use of fibrates in pregnancy is safe or not; it should be used only in cases of severe hypertrygliceridemia, when no response to diet is met and if there is an increased risk of developing acute pancreatitis (D).

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^115G9Vba]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia should be confirmed prior to ordering, dispensing, or administering insulin (A). Insulin is the primary treatment in all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (A). Typically, patients with T1DM will require initiation with multiple daily injections at the time of diagnosis. This is usually short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue given 0 to 15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulin. Two or three premixed insulin injections per day may be used (A). The target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all children with T1DM, including preschool children, is recommended to be < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol). The target is chosen aiming at minimizing hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic unawareness, and reducing the likelihood of development of long-term complications (B). For patients prone to glycemic variability, glycemic control is best evaluated by a combination of results with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (B). Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy (B). In T2DM patients, with regards to achieving glycemic goals, insulin is considered alone or in combination with oral agents when HbA1c is ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol); and is essential for treatment in those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), when diet, physical activity, and other antihyperglycemic agents have been optimally used (B). The preferred method of insulin initiation in T2DM is to begin by adding a long-acting (basal) insulin or once-daily premixed/co-formulation insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin, alone or in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (B). If the desired glucose targets are not met, rapid-acting or short-acting (bolus or prandial) insulin can be added at mealtime to control the expected postprandial raise in glucose. An insulin regimen should be adopted and individualized but should, to the extent possible, closely resemble a natural physiologic state and avoid, to the extent possible, wide fluctuating glucose levels (C). Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of effective insulin therapy and should not be omitted in the patient's care plan. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values should be used to titrate basal insulin, whereas both FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG) values should be used to titrate mealtime insulin (B). Metformin combined with insulin is associated with decreased weight gain, lower insulin dose, and less hypoglycemia when compared with insulin alone (C). Oral medications should not be abruptly discontinued when starting insulin therapy because of the risk of rebound hyperglycemia (D). Analogue insulin is as effective as human insulin but is associated with less postprandial hyperglycemia and delayed hypoglycemia (B). The shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular (IM) injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them (A). Many patients in East Africa reuse syringes for various reasons, including financial. This is not recommended by the manufacturer and there is an association between needle reuse and lipohypertrophy. However, patients who reuse needles should not be subjected to alarming claims of excessive morbidity from this practice (A). Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (A).

### The effect of real-time continuous glucose monitoring in pregnant women with diabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^113EQdMK]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Twenty-seven (22%) women with type 1 diabetes were on insulin pump therapy (mainly initiated before pregnancy) with rapid-acting insulin analogs. Most of these women used insulin pumps that could be connected to the prescribed real-time CGM system. The majority were using the bolus calculator, but they did not have the possibility of low glucose suspend. Women with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections were treated with rapid- and long-acting insulin analogs (n = 66), rapid-acting insulin analogs with intermediate NPH insulin (n = 19), human short-acting and intermediate NPH insulin (n = 9), or human short-acting insulin and long-acting insulin analog (n = 2). All but one of 31 women with type 2 diabetes received insulin therapy in pregnancy with insulin aspart mix (n = 14), intermediate NPH insulin combined with rapid-acting insulin analog or human short-acting insulin (n = 12), or solely intermediate NPH insulin (n = 3) or rapid-acting insulin analog (n = 1). Patients were recommended to administer rapid-acting insulin shortly before meals throughout pregnancy. During labor and delivery, intravenous glucose infusion was given, and if indicated, insulin was administered subcutaneously. Self-monitored plasma glucose measurements were performed hourly, aiming for plasma glucose levels of 4.0–7.0 mmol/L.

For study purpose, participants were asked to perform eight daily self-monitored plasma glucose measurements for 6 days, including measurements at 3at study visits at 8, 12, 21, 27, and 33 weeks. Registration of self-monitored plasma glucose values for study purpose was handled as previously described. All women were offered free use of a blood glucose meter with corresponding test strips (Contour; Bayer, Wakimachi, Japan). Results on HbA 1c and insulin doses were obtained at all five study visits and shortly before delivery at median 36 (range 29–39) weeks. Mild hypoglycemia was defined as events familiar to the patient as hypoglycemia and managed by the patient, whereas severe hypoglycemia was defined as self-reported events with symptoms of hypoglycemia requiring help from another person to actively administer oral carbohydrate or injection of glucose or glucagon in order to restore normal blood glucose level. Information on mild and severe hypoglycemic events was obtained in detailed questionnaires and structured interviews at all study visits and shortly after delivery, as previously described.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid-acting insulin analogs in special populations with type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115YHhqd]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

In a publication reporting additional data on pregnancy outcomes by Mathiesen et al. Hod et al. indicated that preterm delivery occurred in 20.3 and 30.6% of pregnancies in women receiving insulin aspart and RHI, respectively (p = 0.053). Other secondary publications from these trials indicated that there were 137 and 131 live births, 14 and 21 fetal losses, and six and nine congenital malformations in these groups of women on insulin aspart and RHI, respectively. Furthermore, maternal and cord blood antibody levels for both RHI and insulin aspart remained low for both treatments and were similar at 36 weeks gestation for the 97 women who participated in the substudy. In a secondary analysis of data from the same trial, Lloyd et al. reported that these benefits were attained without increasing the cost of treatment compared to RHI.

Women with GDM

The characteristics of four RCTs using RAIAs in GDM are summarized in ESM Table S2. The results indicate that insulin lispro was at least as effective as RHI and sometimes demonstrated improved glycemic control (ESM Table S2). Insulin aspart was associated with significantly lower post-meal BG compared with RHI. In the single trial involving a head-to-head comparison of insulin aspart and insulin lispro, mean 1-h post-breakfast BG was similar for the two products (6.75 ± 1.12 vs. 6.6 ± 1.05 mmol/L, respectively).

In Mecacci et al. hypoglycemia was not reported and, in another trial, there were no hypoglycemic events reported for insulin aspart, insulin lispro or RHI. In a study of women (n = 27) using insulin aspart or RHI, the reported percentage of participants experiencing symptomatic hypoglycemic events was similar for both treatments (71 vs. 69%), but more participants using insulin aspart reported minor hypoglycemia (79 vs. 39%). In the latter case, this was largely due to two participants being prone to hypoglycemia. Neonatal outcomes (weight, length, physical exam) were good for both insulin aspart and RHI.

Meta-Analysis

The pregnancy studies were deemed to be too heterogeneous or to lack relevant information for meta-analysis of either efficacy or safety outcomes for any of the three RAIAs.

### Insulin degludec (Tresiba) [^1174qkVB]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of insulin degludec SC (also known as Tresiba) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk; there are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy. Insulin requirements generally decrease in the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimester; after delivery, insulin requirements generally return to pre-pregnancy values. Intensified blood glucose control and monitoring are recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy.

### Achieving better outcomes in pregnancies complicated by type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116cMcoh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an increased rate of adverse outcomes for both mother and fetus.

Objective

This article reviews the data available on achieving better outcomes in pregnancies complicated by DM.

Methods

Background materials for this article were gathered based on a PubMed search of English-language articles (up to and including August 2007) using the search terms diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, glycemic control, mortality, and morbidity. This review article was based on a presentation given at a satellite symposium entitled "Realising the Value of Modern Insulins: Reaching Further with Rapid-Acting Insulin Analogues" that was convened during the XIXth World Diabetes Congress, December 3, 2006, in Cape Town, South Africa.

Results

There is clear evidence that optimized metabolic control, from preconception through pregnancy, can reduce the risk of maternal and fetal complications in women with DM. The risk of fetal congenital abnormalities in pregnant women with DM is intricately related to the level of glycemic control in early pregnancy; thus, strict metabolic targets as close to normal glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (ie, 4.0%-6.0%) as possible are recommended. However, these HbA1c and postprandial plasma glucose targets are challenging for the physician and the patient. The rapid-acting insulin analogues, insulin aspart and insulin lispro, may be useful because they can reduce postprandial hyperglycemia without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia and even provide a small improvement in HbA1c compared with regular human insulin. In a recent, prospective, randomized controlled study of pregnant women with type 1 DM (N = 322), maternal hypoglycemia, metabolic control, and tolerability, including perinatal outcomes, were compared between those randomized to mealtime insulin aspart or human insulin. The results from this study suggest that insulin aspart is at least as effective and well tolerated as human insulin in basal-bolus therapy with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin. Overall, 80% of study participants in both groups achieved HbA1c levels ≤ 6.5% in the second trimester. In addition, insulin aspart was associated with lowered postprandial blood glucose levels, as well as reduced risk of hypoglycemia, suggesting that it may offer clinical advantages in this population.

Conclusions

Women with DM who are of reproductive age should be identified as members of a high-risk group. Access to specialized prepregnancy clinics should be made available where their DM can be intensively managed throughout pregnancy by a combined obstetrical/endocrine multidisciplinary team. Use of multiple insulin injection regimens, including use of insulin aspart during pregnancy, is both well tolerated and effective and may offer some benefits with respect to postprandial glycemic control.

5.1d. Remarks

Owing to the potential risk of temporarily worsened blood glucose control, ketoacidosis, and hypoglycemia when continuous sc insulin infusion is initiated, its use during pregnancy should be limited to those patients already successfully using this method of insulin administration before pregnancy and to those women who, during pregnancy, have not succeeded with other insulin strategies including multiple daily doses of insulin.

Noninsulin antihyperglycemic agent therapy

5.2a. We suggest that glyburide (glibenclamide) is a suitable alternative to insulin therapy for glycemic control in women with gestational diabetes who fail to achieve sufficient glycemic control after a 1-week trial of medical nutrition therapy and exercise except for those women with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes before 25 weeks gestation and for those women with fasting plasma glucose levels > 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), in which case insulin therapy is preferred. (2|⊕⊕○○)

5.2b. We suggest that metformin therapy be used for glycemic control only for those women with gestational diabetes who do not have satisfactory glycemic control despite medical nutrition therapy and who refuse or cannot use insulin or glyburide and are not in the first trimester. (2|⊕⊕○○)

### Successful outcomes with insulin degludec in pregnancy: a case series [^1149sVnP]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Poor glycaemic control causes significant risk to the mother in addition to increased foetal morbidity and mortality due to increased rates of miscarriage, preterm labour, congenital malformations, macrosomia, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. These complications could be prevented by promoting tight glycaemic control. This is however difficult to achieve without the associated risk of hypoglycaemia.

The safety and efficacy of the insulin analogue in pregnant women were first reported in 1999 with lispro. This has led to larger-scale clinical trials that confirmed its beneficial effects in rapidly lowering the postprandial glucose levels during pregnancy without causing additional harm to the foetus. Long-acting insulin analogues are required along with short-acting insulin analogues to manage glycaemia through the day. Long-acting insulin analogues currently approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in pregnancy are glargine and detemir. Insulin glargine is associated with within-subject variability and high affinity for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor, leading to unexpected hypoglycaemia and concerns regarding mitogenic potential, respectively. Insulin detemir, although it demonstrates low variability, is dose-dependent and appears to have a shorter duration of action at lower doses and may require twice daily dosage in those with higher basal insulin requirement.

Although insulins glargine and detemir are proven to be safe in pregnancy and non-inferior in their efficacy compared with human insulin, they do not meet the criterion of an ideal basal insulin that would, in theory, have a duration of action long enough to reduce intra-patient and inter-dose variations in insulin concentration in the steady state. Degludec is the new-generation long-acting insulin analogue that comes close to addressing this criterion. It is manufactured through modification of human insulin whereby the threonine at position B30 is deleted and a 16-carbon fatty diacid is added to lysine at position B29 via a glutamic acid spacer. These structural changes allow soluble multi-hexamers to form upon subcutaneous injection and for continuous slow release of degludec monomers, without variation in the concentration once a steady state has been reached. With a once daily injection, degludec provides a uniform glucose-lowering effect with the duration of action that extends beyond 24 h. This unique pharmacokinetic property lowers the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia that has been supported by many studies. Furthermore, it demonstrates low IGF-1 receptor binding affinity and low mitogenic potential.

Technical remarks
Sudden discontinuation of GLP-1RA may cause hyperglycemia and weight gain, which increases the risk for congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion. Timely transition and titration of alternative antihyperglycemic agents after discontinuing GLP-1RAs is necessary to minimize hyperglycemia.
The timing of discontinuation prior to pregnancy is individualized based on the anticipated likelihood of conception after discontinuing contraception, type of GLP-1RA used, and risks of prolonged time off GLP-1RAs prior to pregnancy.
Active management of glycemia is required after GLP-1RA discontinuation.

Question 4. Should insulin vs insulin with the addition of metformin be used in pregnant individuals with preexisting diabetes type 2?

Recommendation 4

In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin (2 | ⊕OOO).

Question 5. Should a carbohydrate-restricted (< 175 g per day) diet vs usual diet (> 175 g per day) during pregnancy be used in individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus?

Recommendation 5

In individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM), we suggest either a carbohydrate-restricted diet (< 175 g per day) or usual diet (> 175 g per day) during pregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remarks
There is no clear evidence on the optimal amount of carbohydrate intake during pregnancy; however, lower and higher extremes are harmful based on indirect evidence.

Question 6. Should a continuous glucose monitor vs no continuous glucose monitor (self-monitoring blood glucose as standard of care) be used in pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus?

### Insulin detemir in pregnancy: a small but significant step forward? [^112MCvvP]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

There is little evidence in the literature for the safety of the current insulin gold standards of human short-acting insulin preparations or protaphane, the long-acting/ basal insulin. There is limited information on the short-acting analogs lispro and aspart. A systematic review and meta-analysis of lispro versus regular insulin identified a higher rate of large-for-gestational-age infants (> 90th percentile), despite similar HbA 1c levels in the lispro group (relative risk, 1.38 [95% CI 1.14–1.16]), but no differences in the rate of small-for-gestational-age infants. No advantage of lispro was demonstrated. Insulin aspart has been studied in a randomized control trial similar to the detemir study described in this issue of Diabetes Care. It demonstrated similar outcomes for aspart compared with regular human short-acting insulin. In both the lispro and aspart studies, there was a trend toward less hypoglycemia in the analog group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Despite the lack of safety information, short-acting insulin and protaphane are the default standard comparators because of the long experience with their use. Overall, the level 1 evidence base for insulin use in pregnancy is very small.

Given the deficiencies of our knowledge about insulin use in pregnancy, the article by Mathiesen et al. is both timely and important. This multinational, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, prospective study compared detemir, a long-acting insulin analog, with protaphane in the treatment of women with preexisting diabetes who were pregnant or planning a pregnancy. The study was planned as a noninferiority study with the primary end point being the HbA 1c level at 36 weeks' gestation. There was no significant difference in the primary end point. From this outcome it was concluded that insulin detemir was not inferior to protaphane insulin. Why would a clinician responsible for the care of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes consider changing from protaphane to this newer, more expensive insulin with less established safety data? This study provides several tantalizing suggestions of benefit.

### Efficacy, safety and lack of immunogenicity of insulin aspart compared with regular human insulin for women with gestational diabetes mellitus [^115gQe3U]. Diabetic Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Jovanovic et al. have documented that women with GDM who received a rapid-acting insulin analogue (insulin lispro) in a 6-week study had significantly lower postprandial increases in plasma C-peptide (and hence in endogenous insulin secretion) than those who injected regular human insulin. In addition, better overall glycaemic control (mean decrease from baseline HbA 1c: insulin lispro 0.35%, vs. regular insulin 0.07%; P < 0.005) was achieved in insulin lispro-treated individuals than in women receiving regular human insulin as a component of a basal-bolus regimen. Based on these findings, a hypothesis was proposed that use of a rapid-acting insulin analogue, insulin aspart (IAsp), may improve postprandial glycaemia during pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes. This hypothesis sets the conceptual framework for studying IAsp in GDM. The short-term efficacy of IAsp has been demonstrated in a study of 15 women with GDM during standardized meal tests, where insulin aspart was shown to be effective in decreasing postprandial glucose concentration. The present study further assesses whether IAsp is a safe and effective alternative to regular human insulin for overall glycaemic control in subjects with GDM. Thus, the primary end-points were adequate control of plasma glucose and lack of significant immunogenicity.

### Patient-led rapid titration of basal insulin in gestational diabetes is associated with improved glycaemic control and lower birthweight [^112zRsi3]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of GDM with diet and lifestyle advice, and pharmacological therapy when required, reduces birthweight and GDM‐associated complications. In the UK, GDM treatment targets are defined by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as; a fasting capillary plasma glucose of < 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dl) and either a 1‐h post‐meal glucose of < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dl) or 2‐h post meal < 6.4 mmol/L (115 mg/dl). Similar targets are recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Metformin and insulin are the mainstay of pharmacological treatments.

Despite clear treatment guidelines, glucose remains above target in the latter part of pregnancy in a large proportion of women. As screening for GDM is usually performed between 24 and 28 weeks gestation, there is only a short window in which to instigate and optimise treatment. Given that many women with GDM are overweight, and therefore have a degree of insulin resistance, treatment with insulin is often required for GDM. However, there are no recommended approaches to insulin titration in GDM in current guidelines. In our clinic, we found that women with GDM were slow to reach glycaemic targets when using an approach of weekly physician or nurse‐led insulin dose titration, and targets were not reached by the end of pregnancy in a third of women. Data from observational studies suggest this is a widespread difficulty. We, therefore, devised a method to achieve rapid glycaemic control in GDM using a simple algorithm which enables women to adjust their own insulin doses. We present the pregnancy outcomes of women with GDM in our clinic before and after the implementation of this approach.

Other Evidence to Decision Criteria and Considerations

The most common fear in individuals using medication during pregnancy is fetal harm; therefore, the main outcomes of LGA and SGA infants, congenital malformations, spontaneous abortion, and GWG were judged to have no important uncertainty or variability in value for individuals.

The medication costs for the early switch to insulin from GLP-1RAs are variable and difficult to determine due to pricing differences in different countries. Additionally, costs will vary depending on the patient's dosing needs, whether both basal and bolus insulin are required, and type of health care coverage. The switch to insulin will require closer follow-up by a health care provider during the transition, closer glucose monitoring, and potentially more frequent injections requiring additional supplies. This transition will occur in both the intervention and comparator, but the higher treatment complexity may occur for a longer duration if GLP-1RAs are stopped before pregnancy rather than the first trimester. However, the risk of longer exposure to GLP-1RAs during pregnancy and the costs of potential adverse pregnancy outcomes need to be considered. No cost-effective studies were identified.

There is no direct evidence evaluating the impact of the intervention on health equity. The potential for higher treatment complexity for a longer duration and the need for more frequent follow-up when converting to insulin to provide adequate glycemic management may be a challenge for those with health disparities in the pre-pregnancy period, whereas they may qualify for additional resources once pregnant. Access to care and additional resources varies; therefore, the GDP judged that the impact of the intervention on health equity varies.

The GDP judged that the acceptability of the intervention varies. Discontinuation of GLP-1RAs before pregnancy is likely acceptable by individuals if evidence shows this would minimize fetal harm. However, there is a lack of supporting data, and some may be hesitant to discontinue GLP-1RAs pre-pregnancy due to rebound effects if they were able to achieve significant weight loss and glycemic targets. Additionally, acceptability and feasibility may be less if more complex regimens are needed to replace GLP-1RAs.

The GDP acknowledged challenges to the feasibility of the intervention given low rates of pregnancy planning and preconception care (PCC) uptake. In addition, GLP-1RAs are associated with improved fertility, which can lead to unplanned pregnancies. Appropriate PCC and provider/patient education can significantly improve the feasibility of the intervention.

Target Populations for AID Therapy

Selecting the people who will benefit most from AID system use is essential to optimize both efficacy and safety of treatment. Table 6 presents graded evidence-based recommendations for individuals who should be considered for AID system use (American Diabetes Association [ADA] evidence-grading system).

Table 6.
Summary of recommendations: target populations

AID should be considered for all people with T1D, especially those experiencing suboptimal glycemia, problematic hypoglycemia, and/or significant glycemic variability. AID use can be particularly useful in persons at moderate to high risk for frequent and/or severe hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness. Furthermore, small initial studies reported an improvement in hypoglycemia awareness with the use of AID systems.

Additionally, lifestyle and quality of life issues should be considered when determining treatment options. As previously mentioned, evidence from numerous RCTs and real-world studies support the safety and efficacy of use of AID systems in young, school-aged pediatric populations and in adolescent/adult populations. Although some studies included children from the age of 1 year, and adult populations older than 65 years, additional research is required to truly estimate the impact of AID in these age groups.

AID use can be beneficial in pregnant women, but the glucose targets needed during pregnancy are lower than most commercially available AID systems currently offer. The benefits of AID have also been demonstrated in insulin-naïve users with T2D in outpatient and inpatient, noncritical care settings and in people on hemodialysis or with gastroparesis. However, additional studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy for these populations.

Each candidate for AID use should be evaluated by their healthcare provider, to determine their ability to manage intensive insulin therapy. Factors to consider include proficiency in mealtime insulin dosing, motivation, willingness to participate in formal device training, manual dexterity/visual status, and financial/insurance status.

Use of CSII in clinical practice: what are possible indications?

Guidelines from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association advise a progressive intensification of insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic subjects who fail to respond to therapy with noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents. The basal/bolus regimen combining a rapid-acting and a long-acting insulin analog is recommended as the most precise and flexible regimen for the intensification of insulin therapy, while pump therapy is not even mentioned as an alternative. In the author's opinion, pump therapy may be offered in situations of severe chronic hyperglycemia despite high insulin requirements. Such patients are generally obese, exhibit high abdominal fat content, and do not respond to nutritional counseling for restricting carbohydrate or fat intake. One may hypothesize that reduction of postmeal excursions with CSII may limit the deleterious consequences of hyperglycemic peaks on diabetes complications such as cardiovascular lesions. Pump therapy may be offered to patients on at least two injections per day and may be an alternative to the thrice daily premixed NPH/rapid analog combination or the four to five daily injections regimen combining a long-acting insulin analog plus a rapid-acting analog. Decision to switch from MDI to CSII may also be based on cost-effectiveness considerations. Other indications of CSII in type 2 diabetes may include extreme insulin resistance syndromes such as lipodystrophy syndromes, pregnancy, and insulin allergy. Insulin allergy may occur in type 2 diabetic patients on insulin MDI, and local or generalized allergy manifestations were resolved by a switch to rapid analog insulin administered by CSII. The mechanism of antigenicity/immunogenicity modulation by CSII remains elusive.

### Insulin use during gestational and pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy: a systematic review of study design [^1146HjSC]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insulin is the first-line pharmacologic therapy for women with diabetes in pregnancy. However, conducting well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and achieving recommended glycemic targets remains a challenge for this unique population. This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to understand the evidence for insulin use in pregnancy and the outcome metrics most often used to characterize its effect on glycemic, maternal and fetal outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in pregnant women with diabetes.

Methods

An SLR was conducted using electronic databases in Medline, EMBASE via Ovid platform, evidence-based medicine reviews (2010–2020) and conference proceedings (2018–2019). Studies were included if they assessed the effect of insulin treatment on glycemic, maternal or fetal outcomes in women with diabetes in pregnancy. Studies on any type of diabetes other than gestational or pre-existing diabetes as well as non-human studies were excluded.

Results

In women diagnosed with GDM or pre-existing diabetes, most studies compared treatment of insulin with metformin (n = 35) followed by diet along with lifestyle intervention (n = 24) and glibenclamide (n = 12). Most studies reporting on glycemic outcomes compared insulin with metformin (n = 22) and glibenclamide (n = 4). Fasting blood glucose was the most reported clinical outcome of interest. Among the studies reporting maternal outcomes, method of delivery and delivery complications were most commonly reported. Large for gestational age, stillbirth and perinatal mortality were the most common fetal outcomes reported.

Conclusion

This SLR included a total of 108 clinical trials and observational studies with diverse populations and treatment arms. Outcomes varied across the studies, and a lack of consistent outcome measures to manage diabetes in pregnant women was observed. This elucidates a need for global consensus on study design and standardized clinical, maternal and fetal outcomes metrics.

### The use of insulin analogues in pregnancy [^111xMJuP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Excellent glycaemic control is essential in pregnancy to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes. The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in pregnancy. Insulin lispro and insulin aspart are safe in pregnancy and may improve post-prandial glycaemic control in women with type 1 diabetes. However, a lack of data indicating improved foetal outcomes would suggest that there is no imperative to switch to a short-acting analogue where the woman's diabetes is well controlled with human insulin. There are no reports of the use of insulin glulisine in pregnancy and so its use cannot be recommended. Most studies of insulin glargine in pregnancy are small, retrospective and include women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes. There appear to be no major safety concerns and so it seems reasonable to continue insulin glargine if required to achieve excellent glycaemic control. A head-to-head comparison between insulin detemir and NPH insulin in women with type 1 diabetes showed that while foetal outcomes did not differ, fasting plasma glucose improved with insulin detemir without an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. The greater evidence base supports the use of insulin detemir as the first line long-acting analogue in pregnancy but the lack of definitive foetal benefits means that there is no strong need to switch a woman who is well controlled on NPH insulin. There seems little justification in using long acting insulin analogues in women with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes where the risk of hypoglycaemia is low.

### Short-acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin for adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^115qVnSo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Short-acting insulin analogue use for people with diabetes is still controversial, as reflected in many scientific debates.

Objectives

To assess the effects of short-acting insulin analogues versus regular human insulin in adults with type 1 diabetes.

Search Methods

We carried out the electronic searches through Ovid simultaneously searching the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R) (1946 to 14 April 2015), EMBASE (1988 to 2015, week 15), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; March 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the European (EU) Clinical Trials register (both March 2015).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials with an intervention duration of at least 24 weeks that compared short-acting insulin analogues with regular human insulins in the treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes who were not pregnant.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for risk of bias, and resolved differences by consensus. We graded overall study quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) instrument. We used random-effects models for the main analyses and presented the results as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified nine trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria including 2693 participants. The duration of interventions ranged from 24 to 52 weeks with a mean of about 37 weeks. The participants showed some diversity, mainly with regard to diabetes duration and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The majority of the trials were carried out in the 1990s and participants were recruited from Europe, North America, Africa and Asia. None of the trials was carried out in a blinded manner so that the risk of performance bias, especially for subjective outcomes such as hypoglycaemia, was present in all of the trials. Furthermore, several trials showed inconsistencies in the reporting of methods and results. The mean difference (MD) in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was -0.15% (95% CI -0.2% to -0.1%; P value < 0.00001; 2608 participants; 9 trials; low quality evidence) in favour of insulin analogues. The comparison of the risk of severe hypoglycaemia between the two treatment groups showed an OR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.12; P value = 0.31; 2459 participants; 7 trials; very low quality evidence). For overall hypoglycaemia, also taking into account mild forms of hypoglycaemia, the data were generally of low quality, but also did not indicate substantial group differences. Regarding nocturnal severe hypoglycaemic episodes, two trials reported statistically significant effects in favour of the insulin analogue, insulin aspart. However, due to inconsistent reporting in publications and trial reports, the validity of the result remains questionable. We also found no clear evidence for a substantial effect of insulin analogues on health-related quality of life. However, there were few results only based on subgroups of the trial populations. None of the trials reported substantial effects regarding weight gain or any other adverse events. No trial was designed to investigate possible long-term effects (such as all-cause mortality, diabetic complications), in particular in people with diabetes related complications.

Authors' Conclusions

Our analysis suggests only a minor benefit of short-acting insulin analogues on blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes. To make conclusions about the effect of short acting insulin analogues on long-term patient-relevant outcomes, long-term efficacy and safety data are needed.

### Comparing the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir versus neutral protamine hagedorn insulin in treatment of diabetes during pregnancy: a randomized, controlled study [^116fCnTJ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

In recent years, insulin analogs have overcome the limitations of human insulin and are used widely in the management and control of diabetes. Insulin detemir (IDet) is a long-acting human insulin analog which is newly developed in recent years. In addition to its use in gestational diabetes, IDet improves glycemic control, and is associated with lower rates of hypoglycemia than human insulin. In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and China FDA approved the insulin detemir to treat hyperglycemia during pregnancy. Compared with NPH, the effect of IDet is much closer to physiologic basal insulin secretion with a longer duration and flatter mode (no peaks) of action. However, few studies of observing the safety and efficiency of IDet in Chinese pregnant women with diabetes are reported in the literature. With an increasing incidence of gestational diabetes, the safety and efficiency of IDet during pregnancy is needed to be further studied. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the efficiency and safety between IDet combined with short-acting Novoline R and NPH in combination with Novoline R in pregnant women with diabetes.

### Insulin human (humulin) [^114v2D8f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of insulin regular SC (also known as Humulin R) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. The ACOG (ACOG) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) continue to recommend human insulin as the standard of care in pregnant women with diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) requiring medical therapy. Poorly controlled diabetes in the mother is known to increase fetal risk. Careful monitoring of the patient on insulin is required throughout pregnancy. In general, insulin requirements decline during the first trimester and increase during the second and third trimesters. Optimizing glycemic control before conception and during pregnancy appears to improve fetal outcome; this should include the avoidance of episodes of hypoglycemia as the toxic effects of maternal hypoglycemia on the fetus have been well-documented. During the perinatal period, careful monitoring of neonates born to mothers with diabetes is recommended. Post-partum, maternal insulin requirements may need adjustment.

### Managing type 1 diabetes mellitus in pregnancy – from planning to breastfeeding [^113xyANd]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2012). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus in pregnant women increases the risk of adverse outcomes for mother and offspring. Careful preconception counselling and screening is important, with particular focus on glycaemic control, indications for antihypertensive therapy, screening for diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy and thyroid dysfunction, as well as review of other medications. Supplementation with folic acid should be initiated before conception in order to minimize the risk of fetal malformations. Obtaining and maintaining tight control of blood glucose and blood pressure before and during pregnancy is crucial for optimizing outcomes; however, the risk of severe hypoglycaemia during pregnancy is a major obstacle. Although pregnancy does not result in deterioration of kidney function in women with diabetic nephropathy and normal serum creatinine levels, pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery are more frequent in these women than in women with T1DM and normal kidney function. Rapid-acting insulin analogues are considered safe to use in pregnancy and studies on long-acting insulin analogues have provided reassuring results. Immediately after delivery the insulin requirement declines to approximately 60% of the prepregnancy dose, and remains 10% lower than before pregnancy during breastfeeding.

Diabetes in pregnancy — postpartum insulin and medication needs: For individuals requiring insulin after delivery, insulin sensitivity increases dramatically with the delivery of the placenta, and insulin requirements in the immediate postpartum period are roughly 34% lower than prepregnancy insulin requirements; insulin sensitivity then returns to prepregnancy levels over the following 1–2 weeks. While taking insulin, particular attention should be directed to hypoglycemia prevention in the setting of breastfeeding and erratic sleep and eating schedules, and individuals with GDM usually do not require diabetes medications in the postpartum period.

### Navigating automated insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes management during pregnancy [^115mJ8au]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Achieving pregnancy-specific glucose targets is difficult in pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and the rates of complications for mothers and their infants remain high. Currently marketed automated insulin delivery (AID) systems are hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems in which basal insulin delivery (with or without automated correction boluses) is driven by algorithms, and users are required to initiate meal boluses. For non-pregnant people with T1D, HCL therapy has established benefits for glycemic outcomes and quality of life. While none of the currently available HCL systems were designed for pregnancy-specific glucose targets and outcomes, preliminary data suggest that the use of HCL systems may result in improved glycemia during pregnancy. There is an accumulating body of literature examining HCL systems in pregnancy, although there are still limited data regarding the impact of HCL systems on perinatal outcomes. Many individuals conceive while using clinically available HCL systems and may be hesitant to discontinue use during pregnancy, and clinicians may consider HCL therapy for pregnant individuals who are struggling to meet recommended glycemic levels during pregnancy. We therefore offer guidance on how to counsel patients on the risks and benefits of HCL therapy in pregnancy, how to identify appropriate candidates for HCL therapy in pregnancy, and how to manage commercially available HCL systems off-label throughout gestation.

### Metformin plus insulin for preexisting diabetes or gestational diabetes in early pregnancy… [^114LwCNb]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Using metformin plus insulin to treat preexisting type 2 or gestational diabetes diagnosed early in pregnancy did not reduce a composite neonatal adverse outcome. The reduction in odds of a large-for-gestational-age infant observed after adding metformin to insulin warrants further investigation. Importance Insulin is recommended for pregnant persons with preexisting type 2 diabetes or diabetes diagnosed early in pregnancy. The addition of metformin to insulin may improve neonatal outcomes. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists12 and the American Diabetes Association13 both recommend insulin as first-line pharmacotherapy for preexisting type 2 diabetes in pregnancy, with metformin reserved for those who cannot use insulin or decline to do so. All enrolled participants were treated with insulin. Study sites used weight-based insulin dosing, split as 2 or 3 injections using a combination of rapid/short and intermediate or long-acting insulin.

Participants performed daily capillary blood glucose monitoring as fasting and either at 1 or 2 hours postprandial. Study sites were instructed to increasingly titrate insulin dosing to achieve glycemic goals of fasting 70 to 95 mg/dL; 1-hour postprandial level below 140 mg/dL, or 2-hour postprandial level below 120 mg/dL. After adjusting for chronic hypertension requiring medication, the adjusted OR for preeclampsia in the metformin group was 1.
24. Among pregnant adults with preexisting type 2 diabetes or diabetes diagnosed prior to 23 weeks' gestation, metformin added to insulin did not reduce the frequency of the composite adverse neonatal outcome. Further, no significant differences were observed in prespecified secondary outcomes, including maternal hypoglycemia and neonatal fat mass. Findings were similar regardless of maternal BMI, timing of diabetes diagnosis, or timing of enrollment.

However, compared with those randomized to placebo, participants randomized to metformin were less likely to deliver a large-for-gestational-age infant. To our knowledge, this is the largest trial of metformin added to insulin to treat preexisting type 2 diabetes or diabetes identified early in pregnancy. Study strengths include the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled design and enrollment of a diverse study population with a large proportion of patients of Hispanic ethnicity. These strengths contribute to generalizability of our findings to a US pregnant population.

### Early metformin in gestational diabetes… [^117RDYMM]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Does early metformin initiation improve glycemic control and reduce insulin use in pregnant individuals with gestational diabetes. Findings In this randomized clinical trial, the composite outcome of insulin initiation and a fasting glucose level of 5. 1 mmol/L or greater at gestation weeks 32 or 38 was not significantly different between groups. Secondary outcomes of maternal glycaemic control, weight gain, and infant size were lower in the metformin group. There was no difference in maternal or neonatal morbidities. Objective To test whether early initiation of metformin reduces insulin initiation or improves fasting hyperglycemia at gestation weeks 32 or 38. Design, Setting, and Participants Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 centers in Ireland. Participants were enrolled from June 2017 through September 2022 and followed up until 12 weeks' postpartum.

Participants comprised 510 individuals diagnosed with gestational diabetes based on World Health Organization 2013 criteria. Gestational diabetes mellitus, defined as carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycemia with onset during pregnancy, 1 is a global health problem estimated to annually affect 2. 93 million pregnancies worldwide. A limitation to the current approach to management, ie, only prescribing pharmacotherapy following unsuccessful lifestyle modification, is that it results in a number of weeks of hyperglycemia in a large proportion of individuals during their pregnancy. Routine earlier initiation of metformin may improve glycemic control, reduce the need for insulin therapy, and may have clinical advantages beyond glycemic control, such as reducing gestational weight gain.

Accordingly, we hypothesized that metformin at the time of diagnosis would be associated with superior clinical outcomes in pregnant individuals with gestational diabetes. The primary outcome, determined at the time of infant delivery, was a composite of insulin initiation or a fasting laboratory blood glucose value of 5. 1 mmol/L or greater at week 32 or week 38 of gestation. There were 12 prespecified secondary outcomes. At the last assessment prior to delivery, the mean amount of insulin required was 20. 4 IU in the metformin group compared with
24. 2 IU in the placebo group.

### Optimal insulin dosing regimen during pregnancy… [^114FxCgc]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 5 percent of pregnancies are complicated by diabetes. The importance of good glycemic control before conception in diabetic women and as early as possible in women with gestational diabetes has recently been emphasized. Studies in nonpregnant patients have advocated intensive insulin regimens, often involving multiple daily injections, to optimize glycemic levels. Nevertheless, the most widely used regimens for diabetes in pregnancy depend on twice-daily dosing. Nachum and colleagues compared glycemic control and perinatal outcome in pregnant diabetic patients receiving four injections of insulin per day with the same outcomes in similar patients using two daily injections. In the twice-daily regimen, the morning dosage contained two thirds of the calculated total daily insulin requirement and was composed of one third human regular insulin and two thirds human intermediate insulin. The afternoon dosage contained equal parts of regular and intermediate insulin.

In the four-times-daily insulin regimen, the first three dosages were of regular insulin given 30 minutes before a meal, and the final dosage, given at bedtime, was of intermediate insulin. The women treated by the different regimens did not differ significantly in any important variables. The twice-daily regimen was followed by 136 women with gestational diabetes and 60 women with pregestational diabetes. The four-times-daily regimen was followed by 138 gestational and 58 pregestational diabetic women. Overall glycemic control, measured by daily glucose measurements and determination of HbA. 1c and fructosamine levels, was significantly better in the four-times-daily group. Although women in the intensive group received significantly greater amounts of daily insulin, no increase in episodes of hypoglycemia was noted.

In women with gestational diabetes, the overall rate of neonatal morbidity was significantly reduced in the four-times-daily group, to almost one half of that in infants born to mothers in the twice-daily group. The most significant reductions were in hypoglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Both groups had low rates of macrosomia. In mothers with pregestational diabetes, the more intensive regimen also reduced morbidity, but this reduction did not achieve statistical significance. Hypoglycemia was significantly reduced in infants of mothers with pregestational diabetes who were treated with the four-times-daily regimen. The authors conclude that using insulin four times daily improved glycemic control and perinatal outcome in mothers with gestational or pregestational diabetes. The more intensive regimens do not appear to result in adverse effects, particularly of hypoglycemia, in the mother.
