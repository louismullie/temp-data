## Question

Can SSRI medication help tinnitus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SSRIs help tinnitus and under what circumstances they should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between treating tinnitus itself versus treating comorbid depression or anxiety that worsens tinnitus distress. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and systematic reviews say about SSRIs specifically. Next, I will examine individual RCTs for signals of benefit or harm. After that, I need to consider safety issues, including whether SSRIs can cause or worsen tinnitus. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with monitoring and alternatives, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: tinnitus is a symptom with heterogeneous mechanisms, and its functional impact is strongly modulated by psychological comorbidity. Thus, I need to separate "tinnitus loudness/perception" from "tinnitus distress/functional impact", because medications may influence the latter without changing the former, and guidelines explicitly advise against routine pharmacotherapy for tinnitus itself [^112HET3p] [^117TsmT7] [^11374mg7].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines before diving into individual studies. The AAO-HNSF guideline issues a strong recommendation against routine antidepressants for persistent, bothersome tinnitus, citing insufficient benefit and potential harms, and the VA/DoD guideline similarly suggests against antidepressants for tinnitus management, emphasizing that no medications are FDA-approved for tinnitus and that treating co-occurring depression/anxiety may improve quality of life even if tinnitus loudness persists [^112HET3p] [^1134HBVb] [^1178Wrtn] [^116E7UGs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the evidence base for SSRIs specifically. The Cochrane review found insufficient evidence that antidepressants improve tinnitus, with only one SSRI trial (paroxetine) showing no overall benefit on validated tinnitus outcomes, though a possible subgroup signal at higher doses was noted as hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing. This aligns with the guideline stance of "do not routinely use" for tinnitus itself [^1132BwLH] [^113DhYFH] [^112HET3p].

> I will now examine individual RCTs. The paroxetine RCT showed no significant improvement in tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression versus placebo, with notable adverse effects. By contrast, a sertraline RCT suggested improvements in tinnitus severity and anxiety, but confounding early benzodiazepine use complicates interpretation. A fluoxetine study (with or without alprazolam) improved THI and VAS scores at 4 weeks, yet anxiety paradoxically increased in the fluoxetine arm and dropout due to side effects occurred, reinforcing that any signal is inconsistent and context-dependent [^117W3r4U] [^113ZFVPM] [^1178Wrtn].

> Wait, let me verify something I almost misstated: I initially thought the fluoxetine trial showed a medium effect size for anxiety reduction, but on rechecking, the study reported that fluoxetine reduced THI and VAS and decreased depression scores while actually increasing anxiety compared with control, which tempers enthusiasm for routine SSRI use in tinnitus populations without a clear psychiatric indication [^113ZFVPM].

> Next, I should review safety and potential iatrogenesis. SSRIs and SNRIs can precipitate tinnitus as part of discontinuation syndromes, and tinnitus is a recognized adverse effect in FDA labeling for paroxetine, venlafaxine, citalopram, sertraline, and duloxetine. Additionally, tricyclics have been reported to induce tinnitus in some patients, though this is often reversible on discontinuation, so I need to ensure we do not inadvertently worsen symptoms [^112EQ6af] [^1171CAhP] [^113ZHw7s] [^117TsmT7] [^1117C483] [^111KZfcm].

> Let me consider indirect benefits via comorbidity treatment. Treating co-occurring depression, anxiety, PTSD, or insomnia can reduce tinnitus-related distress and improve quality of life, even if the percept of tinnitus remains unchanged. Guidelines endorse screening for these conditions and integrating mental health care, and a randomized trial of nortriptyline (a tricyclic) in patients with severe tinnitus and depressive symptoms showed improvements in depression, tinnitus-related disability, and tinnitus loudness, illustrating that psychiatric symptom improvement can translate into better tinnitus outcomes, albeit with a different antidepressant class and in a selected population [^1178Wrtn] [^113NUcGW] [^114XSqV2].

> But wait, what if a patient is already on an SSRI for depression or anxiety and reports tinnitus onset or worsening? I should confirm medication timing and dose changes, consider dose reduction or taper if clinically safe, and avoid abrupt discontinuation given discontinuation syndromes; if tinnitus remains functionally bothersome, I should pivot to evidence-based tinnitus care such as CBT, hearing rehabilitation when indicated, and sound therapy rather than escalating antidepressant therapy for tinnitus per se [^112HET3p] [^1178Wrtn] [^11374mg7].

> I need to ensure my recommendation is precise. For primary tinnitus without a psychiatric indication, SSRIs should not be started to treat tinnitus itself; for patients with co-occurring depression or anxiety, SSRIs may be appropriate to treat the psychiatric disorder, with the understanding that tinnitus loudness may not change and that functional impact may improve indirectly; if an SSRI is used, I should start low, go slow, monitor for tinnitus emergence or worsening, and reassess early for benefit and tolerability, discontinuing if there is no meaningful functional gain [^112HET3p] [^1178Wrtn] [^116E7UGs].

> Finally, I should double-check that I am aligning with the highest-quality sources. The AAO-HNSF and VA/DoD guidelines converge on avoiding routine antidepressant use for tinnitus, emphasize validated functional outcome measures like TFI/THI, and prioritize nonpharmacologic, multidisciplinary management. This consistency, together with the Cochrane assessment and mixed RCT signals, supports a cautious, indication-driven approach rather than blanket SSRI prescribing for tinnitus [^112HET3p] [^1178Wrtn] [^1132BwLH].

---

SSRIs are not recommended for routine treatment of tinnitus because there is **insufficient evidence** that they reduce tinnitus loudness or distress [^1132BwLH] [^1178Wrtn]. They may help patients with comorbid depression or anxiety by improving mood and coping, which can indirectly reduce tinnitus-related distress [^113NUcGW] [^116E7UGs]. If used, SSRIs should be reserved for patients with significant psychiatric comorbidity, with careful monitoring for side effects and limited expectations for direct tinnitus benefit [^112HET3p] [^1178Wrtn].

---

## Evidence for SSRI efficacy in tinnitus

- **Cochrane review findings**: The most comprehensive review to date found insufficient evidence to support antidepressants, including SSRIs, for tinnitus treatment [^1132BwLH]. Only one SSRI trial (paroxetine) met high-quality standards and showed no overall benefit on validated tinnitus outcomes, though a possible subgroup effect at higher doses was noted but not confirmed [^1132BwLH].

- **VA/DoD guideline**: The 2025 VA/DoD guideline concludes that antidepressants, including SSRIs, do not significantly reduce tinnitus functional impact based on RCTs and a network meta-analysis [^1178Wrtn].

- **Individual SSRI trials**: Mixed results have been reported. Sertraline showed a modest reduction in tinnitus severity in one study, but confounding factors (e.g. benzodiazepine use) limit interpretation [^117W3r4U]. Fluoxetine, alone or with alprazolam, improved some scores at 4 weeks, but anxiety increased in the fluoxetine group and benefits were not sustained [^113ZFVPM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Both the **AAO-HNSF** and **VA/DoD** guidelines recommend against routine use of antidepressants, including SSRIs, for primary tinnitus treatment due to insufficient evidence of benefit and potential harms [^112HET3p] [^1178Wrtn]. They also emphasize that no medications are FDA-approved for tinnitus and that pharmacotherapy should focus on co-occurring conditions such as depression or anxiety [^112HET3p] [^116E7UGs].

---

## Potential benefits of SSRIs in tinnitus patients

While SSRIs do not directly reduce tinnitus loudness, they may benefit patients with comorbid depression or anxiety by:

- **Improving mood and anxiety**: SSRIs can reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms, which may indirectly lessen tinnitus-related distress and improve quality of life [^1145w4W5] [^117W3r4U] [^113NUcGW].

- **Enhancing coping**: Improved mood and anxiety control may enhance coping and reduce tinnitus-related disability [^114XSqV2].

---

## Risks and side effects of SSRIs in tinnitus patients

SSRIs carry potential risks and side effects that may outweigh benefits in tinnitus patients without psychiatric comorbidity:

- **Sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, dry mouth**: Commonly reported and may reduce adherence [^1132BwLH] [^1178Wrtn].

- **Discontinuation syndrome**: Abrupt cessation can cause tinnitus, dizziness, anxiety, and other symptoms, complicating management [^112EQ6af] [^1171CAhP].

- **Rare but serious risks**: Serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, and activation of mania/hypomania may occur, particularly in vulnerable patients [^1116m7bK] [^117TsmT7].

---

## Patient populations benefiting from SSRIs

SSRIs may be considered for tinnitus patients with **significant comorbid depression or anxiety**, in whom treating psychiatric symptoms may indirectly improve tinnitus-related distress and quality of life [^113NUcGW] [^1145w4W5]. They are **not recommended for patients without psychiatric comorbidity** or for primary tinnitus treatment [^112HET3p] [^1178Wrtn].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

Other pharmacological options have been studied, but evidence remains limited:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|-|
| Anticonvulsants | Gabapentin, carbamazepine | - No consistent benefit <br/> - Not recommended routinely [^117VvjhV] [^116E7UGs] |
| Benzodiazepines | Alprazolam, clonazepam | - Short-term anxiety relief <br/> - Risk of dependence <br/> - Not recommended [^114ZMfVy] [^112HET3p] |
| Other antidepressants | Nortriptyline, trazodone | - Mixed results <br/> - Not recommended routinely [^1132BwLH] [^1178Wrtn] |

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions remain first-line for tinnitus management:

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Strong evidence for reducing tinnitus distress and improving quality of life [^1153WrAR] [^115MC4Wa].

- **Sound therapy**: Hearing aids and sound generators can reduce tinnitus perception and improve function [^1153WrAR] [^11374mg7].

- **Education and counseling**: Essential for patient coping and self-management [^1153WrAR] [^114ZWDg1].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

Key gaps include a **lack of robust, large-scale RCTs** demonstrating clear benefit of SSRIs for tinnitus, heterogeneity of outcome measures and study populations, and limited understanding of patient characteristics predicting response. Future research should prioritize **large, well-designed RCTs**, standardized outcomes, and stratification by psychiatric comorbidity and tinnitus phenotype [^113uULEe] [^1178Wrtn].

---

SSRIs are **not recommended** for routine tinnitus treatment due to insufficient evidence of direct benefit. They may be considered for patients with significant **comorbid depression or anxiety**, with careful monitoring for side effects and limited expectations for direct tinnitus improvement. Non-pharmacological interventions remain the **cornerstone of tinnitus management**.

### Avenue for future tinnitus treatments [^114V3gCA]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is a common symptom. Standard therapies aim at improving the quality of life and reducing the psychological stress associated with tinnitus. Most interventions have little or no effect on the main symptom. Those affected subjects, however, want such a change and prefer a specific solution, such as pharmacologic therapy to other modalities. Scientific efforts have not yet led to significant improvement in the range of therapies. This article outlines existing efforts and develops ideas on how research for improved tinnitus therapy might look in the future.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^112HET3p]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Medical therapy for persistent, bothersome tinnitus — clinicians should not routinely recommend antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for a primary indication of treating persistent, bothersome tinnitus, with Recommendation (against) based on systematic reviews and RCTs with methodological concerns, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B and level of confidence in the evidence is Medium regarding the lack of efficacy of medical therapy as a primary treatment for persistent bothersome tinnitus. Benefits include avoiding unproven therapy, side effects/adverse events (including tinnitus), false hope, and expense, and avoiding use of medications not approved for use in geriatric population, whereas risks, harms, costs are denying some patients benefit; the benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit. Value judgments state evidence is insufficient to justify routine use given known harms, cost of therapy, and potential for some medications (eg, antidepressants) to worsen tinnitus; intentional vagueness notes routine acknowledges individual circumstances; role of patient preferences is Limited with a trial of medication administered based on individual circumstances; exclusions are patients with depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders indicating pharmacologic therapy independent of tinnitus; and the policy level is Recommendation (against). Supporting text emphasizes avoiding routine medications because they have not been shown to alleviate tinnitus and may have adverse effects, that there are no medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of tinnitus, and that no medications have been shown to reliably eliminate or reduce tinnitus perception.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^111jFYGK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Bothersome tinnitus — classification for management and counseling: "Clinicians must distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus. Strong recommendation based on inclusion criteria for RCTs on tinnitus treatment, with a preponderance of benefit over harm". The action statement profile lists "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on inclusion criteria for RCTs on tinnitus treatment", "Level of confidence in evidence: High", "Benefit–harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit", and "Policy level: Strong recommendation". Benefits include to "Identify patients for further counseling and/ or intervention/management; determine effect of tinnitus on health-related QOL; identify patients with bothersome tinnitus who may benefit from additional assessment for anxiety and depression; encourage an explicit and systematic assessment of patients to avoid underestimating or trivializing the effect of tinnitus; avoid unnecessary interventions/management of patients with nonbothersome tinnitus". The guidance notes "Intentional vagueness: Method of distinguishing bothersome from nonbothersome is not specifically stated" and defines bothersome tinnitus as "that which distresses the patients and affects their QOL and/or functional health status".

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^113NUcGW]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Vicious circle of symptoms in tinnitus — Tinnitus severity is positively correlated with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and other psychosocial factors, which can form a "vicious circle" of symptoms, and tinnitus that has been present for six months or more is likely to persist; the treatment of chronic tinnitus is more accurately described in terms of management rather than cure. For some patients, tinnitus can exacerbate co-occurring anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and these co-occurring conditions can affect the severity of tinnitus; effective treatment of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or PTSD might decrease the severity of tinnitus and improve quality of life (QoL). Effective interventions should include management of tinnitus functional impact and associated co-occurring conditions, and when tinnitus negatively impacts patients' health-related QoL, multidisciplinary interventions are often required.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^115MC4Wa]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To evaluate the existing level of evidence for tinnitus management strategies identified in the UK Department of Health's Good Practice Guideline.

Study Design

Systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and meta-analyses.

Methods

Searches were conducted in PubMed, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, Web of Science, and EMBASE (earliest to August 2010), supplemented by hand searches in October 2010. Only randomized controlled trials that used validated questionnaire measures of symptoms (i.e., measures of tinnitus distress, anxiety, depression) were included.

Results

Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria, most of which provide moderate levels of evidence for the effects they reported. Levels of evidence were generally limited by the lack of blinding, lack of power calculations, and incomplete data reporting in these studies. Only studies examining cognitive behavioral therapy were numerous and similar enough to perform meta-analysis, from which the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (moderate effect size) appears to be reasonably established. Antidepressants were the only drug class to show any evidence of potential benefit.

Conclusions

The efficacy of most interventions for tinnitus benefit remains to be demonstrated conclusively. In particular, high-level assessment of the benefit derived from those interventions most commonly used in practice, namely hearing aids, maskers, and tinnitus retraining therapy needs to be performed.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^116SJuwL]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

By design, all RCTs reviewed here reported validated measures of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression. Although many authors reported clinically as well as statistically significant changes, some limited their reports to the statistical changes only, which may have no real meaning in the clinic. In similar terms, it is also important to note the significance of nonspecific effects. For example, Rief et al.reported a 5-point reduction in TQ score as a significant improvement compared to waiting-list controls. However, elsewhere in the literature a 5-point reduction in TQ score (from a comparable baseline) was observed between two repeated measures, suggesting that this reduction is within the expected variability or test-retest value of the measure. More thorough reporting of clinical and statistical significance, or the provision of individual scores, is recommended for transparency and to facilitate future meta-analyses.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1152yEen]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.7 Statistical analysis

We estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (95%CIs) for continuous variables (i.e. the primary outcome of tinnitus severity and the secondary outcome of quality of life). For the categorical variables, we used the rate ratio (RR) and 95%CIs (i.e. the secondary outcome of response rates and drop-out rate) and applied a 0.5-zero-cell correction during the meta-analysis procedure. However, if zeroes were present in both the intervention and control arms of one study, we did not apply such a correction procedure because of the risk of increasing the bias; instead, such studies were excluded from our analysis. We used the frequentist model of NMA to compare the effect sizes of studies with similar interventions. All comparisons were performed using a two-tailed t -test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated using the tau value, which is the estimated standard deviation of the effect across the included studies.

We used mixed comparison with generalised linear mixed models to make direct and indirect comparisons. To compare multiple treatment arms, we combined direct and indirect evidence from the included studies. STATA version 16.0 (StataCorp LLC Statistics/Data Analysis StataCorp, TX, USA) was used in our NMA with the mvmeta command. The restricted maximum likelihood method was used to evaluate the between-study variance. To provide additional information for clinical applications, we calculated the relative ranking probabilities of the treatment effects of all treatments for the target outcomes. In brief, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated the percentage of the mean rank of each treatment relative to an imaginary intervention that was the best without uncertainty. When the area under the curve was smaller, the treatment deserved a higher rank of benefit in the treatment of tinnitus.

### A randomized, controlled study comparing the effects of vestipitant or vestipitant and paroxetine combination in subjects with tinnitus [^113GTpAW]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus is a common symptom that demonstrates a significant comorbidity with anxiety and depression. The novel neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, vestipitant, has anxiolytic properties and a good safety profile. Vestipitant was investigated for potential effect against chronic tinnitus as a stand-alone treatment and in conjunction with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine.

Study Design

Randomized, double-blind, crossover study.

Setting

Tertiary neurotologic and audiologic center with additional referrals from a secondary university hospital center.

Patients

Twenty-four adult patients with tinnitus were randomized into the study.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual analogue scale (VAS) measurements of tinnitus loudness (intensity), pitch and distress, VAS measurements of arousal/anxiety, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and plasma concentrations of trial drugs.

Results

No statistically significant treatment benefit effect was detected for tinnitus (intensity, pitch, and distress) VAS scores, arousal-anxiety VAS scores, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, or tinnitus aggravation scores assessed on Days 1 and 14. However, a statistically significant worsening of tinnitus intensity and distress scores was observed after vestipitant compared with placebo for the mean data collected over the treatment period. No relevant differences in vestipitant plasma concentrations were observed between the subjects given the combination with paroxetine and those receiving vestipitant alone. No specific relationships were observed between tinnitus intensity and vestipitant plasma concentrations.

Conclusion

Although well-tolerated vestipitant, alone or in combination with paroxetine, was not effective in ameliorating tinnitus in this patient group.

### Intratympanic administration of OTO-313 reduces tinnitus in patients with moderate to severe, persistent tinnitus: a phase 1 / 2 study [^112yYiYb]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, OTO-313 treatment was well-tolerated and demonstrated a higher proportion of responders versus placebo based on a 13-point clinically meaningful reduction in TFI scores across consecutive study visits (Week 4 and Week 8). Mean improvements from baseline in TFI, tinnitus loudness, and tinnitus annoyance were numerically higher for OTO-313 compared with placebo. Reductions in TFI scores strongly correlated with improvements in tinnitus loudness, tinnitus annoyance, and PGIC. These findings demonstrate safety and exploratory efficacy of OTO-313 and support further clinical development for the treatment of tinnitus.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^112zy8qC]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD tinnitus guideline — outcomes framework defines outcome categories used across key questions, with two tiers labeled Critical Outcome(s) and Important Outcome(s). Listed measures include Tinnitus Functional Impact (e.g. Tinnitus Functional Index [TFI]; Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [THI]; Tinnitus Questionnaire [TQ]) and Tinnitus perceived loudness (e.g. Visual Numeric Scale [VNS], Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]). Important domains captured with named instruments include Anxiety (e.g. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]), Depression (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Hamilton Depression Scale), Perceived stress (e.g. Perceived Stress Scale 4 [PSS-4]), Quality of life (e.g. WHOQOL, SF-12, SF-36, Global Quality of Life Scale), Sleep (e.g. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and Adverse events (e.g., safety, tolerability, side effects such as hyperacusis or skin irritation, perceived worsening of tinnitus).

### Tinnitus [^113cYn5h]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 18% of people in industrialised societies are mildly affected by chronic tinnitus, and 0.5% report tinnitus having a severe effect on their daily life. Tinnitus can be associated with hearing loss, acoustic neuromas, drug toxicity, ear diseases, and depression. Tinnitus can last for many years, and can interfere with sleep and concentration.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for chronic tinnitus? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 29 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acamprosate, acupuncture, antidepressant drugs, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, cinnarizine, electromagnetic stimulation, ginkgo biloba, hearing aids, hypnosis, psychotherapy, tinnitus-masking devices, and tinnitus retraining therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112GG84p]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — mental health, cognition, and core clinical evaluation elements include table-directed actions and narrative guidance. For mental health symptoms, the table lists "Referral to mental health professionals for assessment and treatment of depression and/or anxiety; urgent referral for suicidal patients", and for apparent cognitive impairments, "The presence of dementia will affect the results of tinnitus and audiologic assessments". The guideline further states that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties" and that "The history should include the details of onset of tinnitus, the duration of symptoms, and the effects of the tinnitus on patient QOL" with characteristics "including laterality and pulsatile nature". It advises that "Auditory phenomena such as hallucinations should be excluded" and that "Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus", with "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications" and "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use" to be discussed or elicited. It adds that "An appropriate clinical evaluation should occur early to direct the need for and the type of additional testing and treatment" and that "the patient encounter should identify any severe coexisting mental illness, such as depression or dementia, as these patients may need expedited referral and management", while noting that "the examination should be directed to identify secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease".

### Depression and tinnitus [^111gNxWi]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with tinnitus are neither depressed nor seriously bothered by their tinnitus. Patients who complain bitterly of tinnitus, however, are often found to have a MDD. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressant drugs helps these patients, especially those who complain of insomnia. Other types of drugs and psychotherapy may also be helpful.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114oVQjb]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this NMA found that pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effects (i.e. amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) and those with anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (i.e. intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) were associated with superior improvement in tinnitus severity and response rate compared to placebo/control in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin. The main results did not change when focusing RCTs with placebo-controlled. Most treatments showed similar drop-out rate compared to placebo/control. However, because some of the intervention comparisons were based on only a few RCTs and the rating scales of tinnitus severity and other subjective symptoms had widely varied, clinicians should select specific treatments with caution. Based on the statistical result found in the current NMA, we would like to recommend future RCTs investigating brain-acting regimens/modulations targeting abnormal brain hyperactivities and overt oxidative stress in tinnitus without specific or treatable origin.

### Tinnitus… [^111r25Fu]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

What are the effects of treatments for chronic tinnitus. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Tricyclic Antidepressants One small randomized controlled trial in people with depression and chronic tinnitus found that tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo significantly improved tinnitus-related disability, audiometric tinnitus loudness matching, and symptoms of depression, but found no significant difference in tinnitus severity at six weeks. One small RCT in people with tinnitus but without depression found that a greater proportion of people rated themselves as improved with tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo at six weeks. UNKNOWN EFFECTIVENESS Psychotherapy One systematic review found insufficient evidence about effects of cognitive behavior treatment, relaxation therapy, counseling, education, hypnosis, biofeedback, or stress management compared with other or no treatment in people with chronic tinnitus.

We found insufficient evidence about the effects of these interventions. LIKELY TO BE INEFFECTIVE OR HARMFUL Ginkgo Biloba One systematic review and one subsequent RCT found no significant difference with ginkgo biloba versus placebo in tinnitus symptoms. Tocainide One RCT found no significant difference with tocainide versus placebo in improving symptoms, but found evidence that tocainide caused significantly more adverse effects after 30 days of treatment. Definition Tinnitus is defined as the perception of sound, which does not arise from the external environment, from within the body, or from auditory hallucinations related to mental illness.

This review concerns the management of chronic tinnitus, where tinnitus is the only, or the predominant, symptom in an affected person. Etiology/Risk Factors Tinnitus may occur as an isolated idiopathic symptom or in association with any type of hearing loss. Tinnitus may be a particular feature of presbycusis, noise-induced hearing loss, Ménière's disease, or the presence of an acoustic neuroma. In people with toxicity from aspirin or quinine, tinnitus can occur while hearing thresholds remain normal. Tinnitus also is associated with depression, although it may be unclear whether the tinnitus is a manifestation of the depressive illness or a factor contributing to its development. 2.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112aRYRq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — antidepressants are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 7 RCTs and 1 Cochrane review that failed to demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm, with the most recent review including 4 trials of tricyclic antidepressants, 1 trial of trazodone, and 1 trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine), in which 4 are double blind, 1 is single blind, and 1 does not clearly state blinding; commonly reported side effects include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth with more dropouts in treatment than placebo, and tinnitus is listed as a rare side effect of all available antidepressants.

### Psychopathological dimensions of tinnitus and psychopharmacologic approaches in its treatment [^113ye14h]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this review to investigate presence of psychopathological states and efficacy of psychopharmacological drugs in the treatment of tinnitus.

Materials and Methods

An extensive Internet search has been performed for this aim through PubMed by using related key words in English.

Results

Higher anxiety and depression levels and somatoform disorder clusters are defined in patients with tinnitus. Additionally, impulsivity, hostility, demanding, physical discomfort, anxiety for health, emotionality and suicidal tendency are also defined in these people. Personality characteristics in these patients are depression, hysteria and hypochondriac features. Besides these symptom clusters, more severe psychopathologies like personality disorders may be encountered in these patients. Sertraline, paroxetine and nortriptyline can be considered as the first-line antidepressants in the psychopharmacological treatment of tinnitus. There are studies which have reported the efficacy of sulpiride. Carbamazepine, valproate and gabapentin can be effective as mood stabilizers. Short-acting benzodiazepines like alprazolam and midazolam are effective in signs of anxiety. Clonazepam and diazepam can be evaluated as other options. However, some glutamate receptor antagonists also can be used in the treatment of tinnitus. Disturbed sleep is frequently associated with tinnitus. Sleep disturbance can disrupt the quality of life in the patients with tinnitus. These patients might benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy, which offers the promise of relief from tinnitus-related distress and insomnia.

Conclusion

When pathophysiologic reasons are excluded, it should be at least considered that tinnitus is exaggerated by psychopathological symptoms. Life quality of patients can be increased by treating these symptoms.

### Antidepressants and tinnitus… [^111KZfcm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

We read with interest the recent article by Sullivan et al1 describing the efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline in the treatment of depression, tinnitus-related disability, and tinnitus symptoms in patients with severe chronic tinnitus. The authors' observation of the utility of treating major depression and depressive symptoms in patients with tinnitus adds to the growing literature regarding the impact of antidepressant pharmacotherapy on the quality of life in patients with chronic medical illnesses and coexisting depression.
2. We wish to raise one caution for clinicians who treat patients with tinnitus. Paradoxically, antidepressant medications, while effective in the treatment of tinnitus, 1, 3 have also been associated with the emergence of this condition.

Tinnitus has been described as a side effect of both tertiary amine and secondary amine tricyclics, the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine, as well as the secondgeneration antidepressant trazodone. 4–9 In a retrospective chart.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^115LBPCh]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Tinnitus — patients with co-occurring conditions: Co-occurring conditions can modify the degree of risk, impact diagnosis, influence patient and provider treatment priorities and clinical decisions, and affect the overall management approach to reduce tinnitus functional impact, so managing tinnitus functional impact collaboratively with other care providers is often best. Some co-occurring conditions might require early specialist consultation to determine necessary changes in treatment or to establish a common understanding of how care will be coordinated, and this approach might entail reference to other VA/DoD CPGs (e.g., for Suicide Risk, PTSD, Insomnia/Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Major Depressive Disorder, mTBI).

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113cnmzW]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We evaluated the potential inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence within the network by using the loop-specific approach and identified local inconsistencies by using the node-splitting method. The design-by-treatment model was used to evaluate global inconsistencies across the entire NMA. We used the comparison adjusted funnel plot and Egger regression to evaluate the potentially small study effects in the order of efficacy of individual treatments. Finally, following the rationale of previous NMA study, we assessed the efficacy of the different kinds of placebo therapy or control (treatment as usual or waiting list) as additional proof of transitivity by computing the severity of tinnitus (Hedges' g) and response rate (event rate) for an oral form of placebo therapy, injection form of placebo therapy, and controls (treatment as usual or waiting list) on the platform of Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). If significant evidence of different effects of placebo therapy or control (treatment as usual or waiting list) by specific placebo therapy/control was found, we arranged sensitivity tests by removing the trial(s) of that specific placebo therapy/control and repeated the main analysis. In addition, in order to investigate the potential impact of different disease duration of the tinnitus symptom on the current NMA, we arrange further evaluation of the potential different placebo effect in the subgroups of different disease duration of the tinnitus symptom as additional proof of transitivity. In order to reduce the potential heterogeneity of the study design, we arranged subgroup analysis focusing on RCTs with placebo-controlled. Finally, in order to improve the methodology reliability of the included RCTs, we arranged subgroup analysis focusing on RCTs with multiple domain rating scales, such as tinnitus handicap inventory, tinnitus handicap questionnaire, and tinnitus severity index.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^113qdfhk]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence base for those tinnitus management interventions recommended by the Department of Health's Good Practice Guide. Where possible, we aimed to identify the conditions under which these interventions are efficacious, and consider whether these interventions are sufficiently researched or in need of further study. We also asked which patients benefit most, but report little on this question due to limited information in those studies reviewed.

In a previous review of RCTs of tinnitus interventions, Dobie did not find any that demonstrated a significant benefit of intervention over typically large placebo effects. He concluded that nowhere in the literature were there studies similar enough to attempt meta-analysis. Two recommendations from that review were that future RCTs needed consensus outcome measures and adequate sample sizes. There is a now reasonable consensus in the tinnitus research community on which validated measures to use. In this review, the most widely used tinnitus questionnaire was the TRQ. It appeared in 10 of the 28 studies and was used here in two separate meta-analyses. However, only seven of 28 studies used a power calculation to estimate their required sample size. Therefore, more than 10 years on, although we have greater RCT-level evidence and some opportunities for meta-analysis, there is still little evidence for the efficacy of most recommended treatment strategies.

It is striking that many authors ascribed null results for changes in depression and anxiety to the fact that participants have low baseline scores, often quoting floor effects. It may well be that, as authors suggest, more distressed individuals are less likely to put themselves forward for clinical trials. However, it may equally be that major depression or other comorbidities are less common than anecdotally suggested. Studies of the prevalence of comorbid depression or anxiety suggest it is no more an issues for tinnitus patients than it is for non-tinnitus ENT patients. Given that the screening and management of anxiety and depression is highlighted in the GPG, more routine clinical assessment of anxiety and depression at baseline and outcome is needed to explore this observation.

### Betahistine for tinnitus [^111QpPu2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tinnitus is a symptom defined as the perception of sound in the absence of an external source. In England alone there are an estimated ¾ million general practice consultations every year where the primary complaint is tinnitus, equating to a major burden on healthcare services. Clinical management strategies include education and advice, relaxation therapy, tinnitus retraining therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, sound enrichment using ear-level sound generators or hearing aids, and drug therapies to manage co-morbid symptoms such as sleep difficulties, anxiety or depression. As yet, no drug has been approved for tinnitus by a regulatory body. Nonetheless, over 100,000 prescriptions for betahistine are being filled every month in England, and nearly 10% of general practitioners prescribe betahistine for tinnitus.

Objectives

To assess the effects of betahistine in patients with subjective idiopathic tinnitus.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 July 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting patients of any age with acute or chronic subjective idiopathic tinnitus were included. We included studies where the intervention involved betahistine and this was compared to placebo, no intervention or education and information. We included all courses of betahistine, regardless of dose regimens or formulations and for any duration of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes included tinnitus loudness and significant adverse effects (upper gastrointestinal discomfort). Our secondary outcomes included tinnitus symptom severity as measured by the global score on a multi-item tinnitus questionnaire, depressive symptoms, symptoms of generalised anxiety, health-related quality of life, other adverse effects (e.g. headache, drowsiness, allergic skin reactions (pruritis, rashes) and exacerbation of tinnitus) and tinnitus intrusiveness. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

This review included five studies (with a total of 303 to 305 participants) comparing the effects of betahistine with placebo in adults with subjective idiopathic tinnitus. Four studies were parallel-group RCTs and one had a cross-over design. The risk of bias was unclear in all of the included studies. Due to heterogeneity in the outcomes measured and measurement methods used, very limited data pooling was possible. When we pooled the data from two studies for the primary outcome tinnitus loudness, the mean difference on a 0- to 10-point visual analogue scale at one-month follow-up was not significant between betahistine and placebo (-0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.01 to 0.70; 81 participants) (very low-quality evidence). There were no reports of upper gastrointestinal discomfort (significant adverse effect) in any study. As a secondary outcome, one study found no difference in the change in the Tinnitus Severity Index between betahistine and placebo (mean difference at 12 weeks 0.02, 95% CI -1.05 to 1.09; 50 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). None of the studies reported the other secondary outcomes of changes in depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health-related quality of life as measured by a validated instrument, nor tinnitus intrusiveness. Other adverse effects that were reported were not treatment-related.

Authors' Conclusions

There is an absence of evidence to suggest that betahistine has an effect on subjective idiopathic tinnitus when compared to placebo. The evidence suggests that betahistine is generally well tolerated with a similar risk of adverse effects to placebo treatments. The quality of evidence for the reported outcomes, using GRADE, ranged from moderate to very low. If future research into the effectiveness of betahistine in patients with tinnitus is felt to be warranted, it should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the development of validated, patient-centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus.

### Efficacy of nortriptyline-topiramate and verapamil-paroxetine in tinnitus management: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^116t4JgH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of 2 drug combinations on tinnitus severity and associated stress, depression, sleep, and anxiety.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted between 2019 and 2023 for an 8-week duration.

Setting

Single institution tertiary care center.

Methods

The study recruited adult patients with moderate to severe tinnitus for 6 months or more. In total, 81 patients were assessed for eligibility, 78 were enrolled and randomized, and 67 were included in the per-protocol analysis. Patients were randomized into 3 groups (1:1:1). Group NT received nortriptyline-topiramate, group VP received verapamil-paroxetine, and group P received placebo.

Results

A total of 19 patients in group NT, 22 in group VP, and 26 patients in group P were included in the per-protocol analysis. In group NT, the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) score decreased from 58.4 ± 13.9 (baseline) to 46.3 ± 17.5 (end-of-trial) (P < .001). Similarly, in group VP, the TFI score decreased from 54.6 ± 17.5 to 42.2 ± 16.1 (P = 0.004). However, group P did not demonstrate any significant decrease in the TFI score from 51.2 ± 18.6 to 45.2 ± 20.1 (P = 0.086). The between-arm analysis did not yield any statistical significance decrease in the TFI score (analysis of variance, P = 0.265).

Conclusion

Both combinations of drugs were promising in improving tinnitus severity. However, larger-scale trials with longer follow-up periods are warranted to validate our findings between groups.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^1153RuE8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — clinical course and spontaneous improvement: Tinnitus may improve spontaneously; in one cohort nearly 50% of patients with significant tinnitus improved after 5 years, with 43% of those improved reporting complete resolution and the remaining 57% reporting only mild symptoms; in another study, 82% of patients who reported tinnitus at baseline had persistent tinnitus after 5 years, suggesting close to a 20% rate of spontaneous improvement; subjects assigned to the "wait-list" control groups of some clinical trials show small, but significant, improvement in tinnitus distress; the largest spontaneous improvement is seen with short duration tinnitus, younger age, and longer intervals between pre- and post-assessment, for example, 28% of subjects with acute tinnitus (lasting < 6 months) improved spontaneously in a control group that received only educational information; in an observational series of 528 otolaryngology patients, tinnitus severity declined over time in 3% to 7% of patients; another large cohort found that 55% of patients with severe tinnitus reported only moderate, or mildly bothersome, symptoms 5 years later, whereas 45% progressed from mildly annoying symptoms to moderate or severely annoying symptoms after 5 years; persistence, defined as having had symptoms at baseline and at 5 years, was associated with reporting moderately or extremely bothersome symptoms compared to newly reported tinnitus.

### Perception of, and reaction to, tinnitus: the depression factor [^116XqduS]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is the perception of a self-generated sound and an individual's psychological reaction to it. This article discusses one element of the reaction: depression. Epidemiologic studies have noted high comorbidity of tinnitus and depression. Findings from recent brain imaging studies have noted shared neural networks in depression and severe tinnitus. As further evidence of this overlaps, antidepressants, counseling, and psychology-based approaches have been used to treat tinnitus. Multifaceted treatment strategies, using both sound-based therapies (not discussed in this paper) and psychology-based approaches, are a necessary part of the treatment options, with the aim of enhancing self-efficacy in patients with tinnitus.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus executive summary [^115vNCmH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the new Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 13 recommendations developed address the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including selection and timing of diagnostic testing and specialty referral to identify potential underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the evaluation and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the evaluation and measurement of the impact of tinnitus and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life for tinnitus sufferers.

### Investigating the efficacy of fluoxetine vs. fluoxetine plus alprazolam (single therapy vs. combination therapy) in treatment of chronic tinnitus: a placebo-controlled study [^113ZFVPM]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of combination therapy (fluoxetine + alprazolam) and fluoxetine alone in treatment of tinnitus.

Material and Methods

147 participants with chronic tinnitus were divided into three groups (fluoxetine, fluoxetine+ alprazolam, and placebo). Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Tinnitus Severity Index (TSI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) used to assess tinnitus. Effect size according to partial Eta square calculated and level of significance was considered as P < 0.05.

Results

Fluoxetine reduced VAS, THI, BDI, and increased BAI. The combination therapy significantly reduced VAS, THI, BAI, and BDI. None of them reduced the TSI. The effect size for BAI and BDI were 0.135 (medium) and 0.075 (small), respectively. There was no significant difference between combination and single-drug therapy.

Conclusion

Both groups improved THI and VAS. Combination therapy was not significantly different from single-drug treatment. Combination therapy can be considered only according to the psychiatric needs of patients.

### Intratympanic administration of OTO-313 reduces tinnitus in patients with moderate to severe, persistent tinnitus: a phase 1 / 2 study [^112ubYnf]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Phase 1/2 Study Part B: Safety and Exploratory Efficacy Cohort

Part B objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OTO-313 (primary), assess plasma pharmacokinetics of gacyclidine (secondary), and assess preliminary efficacy of OTO-313 measured by change from Baseline visit in tinnitus functional index (TFI) (secondary). Exploratory objectives were to evaluate efficacy of OTO-313 on tinnitus loudness and tinnitus annoyance using patient reported numeric rating scales (NRS) and on tinnitus global status with patient global impression of change.

Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years, were consistently aware of their tinnitus throughout much of the waking day, had tinnitus that was likely of cochlear origin (e.g. associated with acute hearing loss from noise trauma, barotrauma, blast trauma, middle ear surgery, age-related hearing loss, resolved otitis media, ototoxic drug exposure) and had an onset of tinnitus of 1 to 6 months before signing informed consent. Exclusion criteria included pulsatile tinnitus, tinnitus resulting from traumatic head or neck injury, active middle ear disease including Menière's disease, abnormality or perforation of the tympanic membrane, any ongoing therapy known to be potentially tinnitus-inducing, severe or untreated depression or anxiety, and systemic or intratympanic steroids within 6 weeks before screening. Stable previous treatments (≥ 1 month before screening) of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications, over-the-counter supplements or medications for tinnitus, or use of hearing aids, noise generators, sound therapy devices, and any behavioral therapy for tinnitus were allowed.

### A randomized trial of nortriptyline for severe chronic tinnitus… [^114XSqV2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Objective: To determine whether the antidepressant, nortriptyline, is effective for treatment of depression, tinnitusrelated disability, and tinnitus symptoms in patients with severe chronic tinnitus. Design: A 12-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: A university otolaryngology clinic. Patients: Ninety-two subjects with severe chronic tinnitus: 38 with current major depression and 54 with depressive symptoms and significant tinnitus-related disability. Intervention: Nortriptyline or placebo. Main Outcome Measures: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Tinnitus Disability Measures, and Audiometric Measures. Results: Nortriptyline was superior to placebo by multivariate analysis of covariance for depression, for tinnitusrelated disability, and tinnitus loudness. When major depression and depressive symptoms groups were considered separately, nortriptyline was superior to placebo on these same measures but differences did not achieve statistical significance. Conclusions: The antidepressant nortriptyline decreases depression, functional disability, and tinnitus loudness associated with severe chronic tinnitus. What appears to be irreversible disability of otologic origin may, in part, be reversible disability of psychiatric origin. Sullivan M, Katon W, Russo J, Dobie R, Sakai C.

Anxiolytics — anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines, should not be used to treat tinnitus, because clinical trials do not consistently show benefit. These medications can have adverse effects, particularly in the elderly, unless dosing is carefully monitored and tailored with drug holidays. Evidence is mixed: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of alprazolam showed decreased tinnitus loudness, whereas another triple-blind randomized crossover trial using chlorpheniramine did not find a significant difference in THI or tinnitus loudness but did find a significant improvement on a visual analogue scale for tinnitus severity. A single-blind randomized study of 66 patients treated with diazepam, flurazepam, oxazepam, clonazepam, and carbamazepine showed improvement on a tinnitus visual analogue scale with oxazepam and clonazepam, but it did not assess tinnitus loudness or use validated questionnaires and subjects received more than 1 medication.

### Duloxetine hydrochloride (duloxetine) [^1117C483]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome

Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Following abrupt or tapered discontinuation in adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following symptoms occurred at 1% or greater and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.

During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe.

Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)].

5.8 Activation of Mania/Hypomania

In adult placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, activation of mania or hypomania was reported in 0.1% (4/3779) of duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients and 0.04% (1/2536) of placebo-treated patients. No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in DPNP, GAD, fibromyalgia, or chronic musculoskeletal pain placebo-controlled trials. Activation of mania or hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with mood disorders who were treated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. As with these other agents, duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.

5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including duloxetine delayed-release capsules may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^1178Wrtn]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, trazodone, nortriptyline) for tinnitus management reports evidence from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a network meta-analysis (NMA) that failed to show a significant benefit in reducing tinnitus functional impact. The use of fluoxetine alone or in combination with alprazolam improved the tinnitus functional impact (THI) and VAS scores compared with placebo in patients with chronic subjective tinnitus at 4 weeks, whereas TSI scores decreased in both treatment groups without a significant difference between the single therapy and the combination treatment. The use of trazodone in a small study (n = 43) showed no difference in quality of life (QoL) compared with placebo in individuals at up to 8 weeks of follow-up, and there was also no difference in QoL after administration of nortriptyline versus placebo. The Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of antidepressants because of the lack of evidence to support the benefit of using these agents for tinnitus management, with the RCT showing a reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory in the treatment groups while the severity of anxiety in the fluoxetine and control group increased significantly (p = 0.003) and Seven individuals left the combination group as a result of side effects; commonly reported side effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth.

5.4 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including citalopram tablets, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with citalopram tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.1% of undiagnosed patients treated with citalopram tablets. Prior to initiating treatment with citalopram tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.6 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^113kyW4P]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Tinnitus care and research has long been and continues to be a challenge. The efficacy of most tinnitus management interventions recommended for clinical practice remains to be demonstrated conclusively as there are currently too few studies to make informed conclusions. Most studies reviewed here provide only moderate levels of evidence largely due to a lack of power and incomplete data reporting. Interventions most in need of high-level evidence studies are hearing aids/sound enrichment and TRT, whereas the efficacy of therapist-delivered CBT appears to be reasonably established. If audiologists are to deliver CBT, however, this will require new investigation. Although the overall quality of CBT studies is moderate, there is sufficient consistency within these results to be confident of its benefit for tinnitus intrusiveness. In terms of pharmacotherapy, only antidepressant use shows any evidence of potential benefit.

### Tinnitus [^113KFKGv]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 18% of people in industrialised societies have mild tinnitus, which severely affects daily life in 0.5% of people. Tinnitus can be associated with hearing loss, acoustic neuromas, drug toxicity, ear diseases, and depression. Tinnitus can last for many years, and can interfere with sleep and concentration.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for chronic tinnitus? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006. (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 37 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acamprosate, acupuncture, antidepressant drugs, baclofen, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, cinnarizine, ear-canal magnets, electromagnetic stimulation, ginkgo biloba, hearing aids, hyperbaric oxygen, hypnosis, lamotrigine, nicotinamide, psychotherapy, tinnitus-masking devices, tinnitus retraining therapy, zinc.

### Antidepressants and tinnitus-reply… [^1145bTCn]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Golden and Evans point out an important clinical fact that we failed to discuss in our article. 1 Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to produce tinnitus in patients who did not have it before. Most, but not all, of this tinnitus is reversible with discontinuation of the administration of tricyclics. While this fact is important for understanding tinnitus that emerges during the treatment of depression with tricyclics, it may be less important in the treatment of pre-existing tinnitus with antidepressants. All the patients in our trial obviously had tinnitus prior to starting nortriptyline treatment. Very few of our patients reported a worsening of tinnitus when receiving nortriptyline. In those few who reported this, it was always linked to a worsening of the concomitant depressive symptoms. What has been observed in our clinical experience is that if depressive symptoms in a patient with tinnitus can be improved, his/her tinnitus noise improves. Sullivan MD.

Betahistine (antihistamine) for primary tinnitus — An RCT (n = 62) randomized adults to betahistine or placebo for 90 days with primary outcome change in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI); the median difference in THI between betahistine and placebo was -2 points (95% CI: -8–6; p = 0.75), indicating no difference, and no differences were reported in secondary measures. One systematic review of five RCTs comparing betahistine to placebo in adults with subjective idiopathic tinnitus reported that no differences were identified between the TSI and perceived loudness (VAS) between betahistine and placebo, and no other RCTs of antihistamines for tinnitus were identified.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112SA57U]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In comparison with the previous clinical guidelines, the current NMA did not focus on the traditional management (i.e. tinnitus support and psychologic therapy) to tinnitus, which was relatively time-consuming and expensive. Rather, the current NMA focus on the pharmacologic interventions to manage the tinnitus severity. In addition, the current NMA also focus on the potential placebo effect in the tinnitus management. To be specific, the current NMA found that the oral form placebo exerted significantly beneficial effects in participants with tinnitus (p < 0.001) (Suppl. B, eFig. 3A). However, the CLES of response rates of oral form placebo (i.e. the probability of one random observation from the treated population being larger than another random observation from the control population) was only 24.5%, which was relatively low compared to that of neuropsychiatric disease, such as depression (i.e. 35%−40%). However, the unavoidable placebo effect could also be at least partly explained by the fact that most studies applied subjective rating scales and there was a relative lack of reliable objective investigating tools. Therefore, to develop up an conclusive objective measurements for the severity of tinnitus without specific/treatable origin should be warranted.

Anticonvulsants — anticonvulsants are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 8 RCTs and a Cochrane review that failed to demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm. None of the RCTs have shown a clear benefit, and a Cochrane review of 7 placebo-controlled trials found no improvement of tinnitus or health-related QOL. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of an 8-week treatment with gabapentin showed no differences between gabapentin and control groups when assessing the tinnitus severity index or loudness scores. Reported side effects during these RCTs were significant, most commonly nausea, dizziness, and headaches.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The PRISMA Statement outlines the essential components for transparent reporting of a systematic reviewand guided our reporting.

Systematic Search Strategy and Study Selection

Studies were selected and screened according to the research question and PICOS criteria. PICOS were: participants, adult humans with tinnitus; intervention, tinnitus management strategies proposed by the Department of Health (GPG); comparisons, a no-treatment group or suitable second treatment group; outcomes, validated questionnaire measure of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, depression; and study design, randomized controlled trials only. Quasi- and pseudo-randomizations were excluded from this review.

Initial database searches were conducted in August 2010. PubMed, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (including Medline, Toxbase, Biological Sciences), Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched using the search terms: 1) tinnitus AND 2) random AND/OR randomized AND/OR randomised AND 3) information AND/OR education OR hearing AND aid(s) OR counselling OR counseling AND/OR psychological (support) OR relaxation (therapy) OR cognitive AND behavioural OR behavioral AND therapy AND/OR CBT OR sleep AND management OR sound AND enrichment (therapy) OR retraining AND therapy AND/OR TRT OR antidepressant OR depression or anxiolytic OR anxiety OR night AND/OR nocturnal AND sedation. Search results were screened to remove duplicate, non-peer reviewed, and review articles. Two authors (D.J.H. V.L.K.) screened abstracts according to the research question and PICOS criteria. All titles selected by either author were retrieved to screen their full text for final agreement and inclusion. The initial search was complimented with further hand searches of key journals, Cochrane reviews, and the reference lists of all included studies. The stages and reasons for exclusions are presented in Figure 1.

Summary of the systematic literature search.

Data Extraction

Extracted data comprised participant numbers, baseline tinnitus severity, age range, the intervention and control, validated questionnaire measures used, follow-up conducted, the study design, and study findings. For all studies, data was extracted independently by two authors (D.J.H. V.L.K.). Any differences in reporting were reconciled by jointly revisiting the relevant publication.

### Tinnitus [^11374mg7]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Tinnitus is a common medical symptom that can be debilitating. Risk factors include hearing loss, ototoxic medication, head injury, and depression. At presentation, the possibilities of otological disease, anxiety, and depression should be considered. No effective drug treatments are available, although much research is underway into mechanisms and possible treatments. Surgical intervention for any otological pathology associated with tinnitus might be effective for that condition, but the tinnitus can persist. Available treatments include hearing aids when hearing loss is identified (even mild or unilateral), wide-band sound therapy, and counselling. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is indicated for some patients, but availability of tinnitus-specific CBT in the UK is poor. The evidence base is strongest for a combination of sound therapy and CBT-based counselling, although clinical trials are constrained by the heterogeneity of patients with tinnitus.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride (Paroxetine) [^112EQ6af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

During clinical trials of GAD and PTSD, gradual decreases in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals followed by 1 week at 20 mg/day was used before treatment was discontinued. The following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for paroxetine and were at least twice that reported for placebo: Abnormal dreams, paresthesia, and dizziness adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.8 Seizures

Paroxetine tablets have not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. During clinical studies, seizures occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with paroxetine. Paroxetine should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder. Discontinue paroxetine in any patient who develops seizures.

5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including paroxetine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Cases of angle-closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine have been reported. Avoid use of antidepressants, including paroxetine in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

Appendix C — medication-related considerations in managing patients with bothersome tinnitus note that no medications have been approved by the FDA to treat tinnitus and no cure exists. Providing care focuses on improving QoL with tinnitus, and encouraging patients to address with their health care provider co-occurring conditions that also reduce QoL is useful. Many of these co-occurring conditions can be successfully treated with medication (or other methods), which might contribute to overall improved QoL. Some medications are known to be ototoxic and might lead to or contribute to bothersome tinnitus; however, the risks of these medications must be balanced with the benefits of treatment when considering whether to continue treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue the medication, and if the decision is made to continue a medication believed to contribute to or worsen tinnitus, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Tinnitus — use of medications and intratympanic injections: We suggest against the use of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antiemetics, antithrombotics, betahistine, intratympanic corticosteroid injections, or n-methyl d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists for tinnitus management. The Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of NMDA receptor antagonists because of the lack of evidence to support the benefit of using these agents for tinnitus management, and the harms and burdens of using these treatments slightly outweighed the potential benefits, which were mostly lacking in the evidence reviewed; therefore, it is categorized as a Reviewed, New-added recommendation. Patient values and preferences varied somewhat due to preferences for non-invasive treatments, potential for adverse events, concerns with using medications that lack evidence of benefit, and time to travel for appointments for intratympanic injections.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112fUm1E]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — medical therapy recommendation (against): Clinicians should not routinely recommend antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for a primary indication of treating persistent, bothersome tinnitus; this is a Recommendation (against) based on systematic reviews and RCTs with methodological concerns, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with a Medium level of confidence, and identified benefits are to avoid unproven therapy, side effects/adverse events (including tinnitus), and false hope while reducing expense, although risks include denying some patients benefit; the benefit–harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit. Value judgments state the evidence is insufficient to justify routine use, with intentional vagueness acknowledging individual circumstances; patient preferences are limited, a trial of medication may be administered based on individual circumstances. Exclusions are patients with depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders that constitute an indication for pharmacologic therapy independent of tinnitus, the policy level is Recommendation (against), and differences in opinion are none. The action statement profile highlights a quality improvement opportunity to decrease use of medications that may have no benefit and have significant potential side effects in tinnitus management.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^1153WrAR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported experiencing tinnitus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potential significant effect on quality of life, there are no evidence-based, multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians with management. The focus of this guideline is on tinnitus that is both bothersome and persistent (lasting 6 months or longer), which often negatively affects the patient's quality of life. The target audience for the guideline is any clinician, including nonphysicians, involved in managing patients with tinnitus. The target patient population is limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome.

Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus. This guideline provides clinicians with a logical framework to improve patient care and mitigate the personal and social effects of persistent, bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including selection and timing of diagnostic testing and specialty referral to identify potential underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the evaluation and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the evaluation and measurement of the effect of tinnitus and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life for tinnitus sufferers.

Action Statements

The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with nonbothersome tinnitus. The development group made a strong recommendation against obtaining imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate tinnitus that does not localize to 1 ear, is nonpulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: Clinicians should (a) perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that if promptly identified and managed may relieve tinnitus; (b) obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiologic examination in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (≥ 6 months), or associated with hearing difficulties; (c) distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms (≥ 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about natural history and follow-up care; (d) educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; (e) recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and (f) recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The panel recommended against (a) antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; (b) Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for treating patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: Clinicians may (a) obtain an initial comprehensive audiologic examination in patients who present with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status); and (b) recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided no recommendation regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^113uULEe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — research priorities for trials and observational studies emphasize methodological rigor and relevant populations. Future clinical trials should be registered and adhere to reporting standards with adequate power, and future studies of tinnitus should be methodologically enhanced with uniform validated outcomes and both audiologic testing and validated questionnaires that incorporate patient-reported outcomes. Tinnitus trials should include a broader, more representative adult population and control for confounding medications and other therapies, and include global QOL measures. Additional needs include determining which validated tinnitus questionnaire is most effective and most useful for relevant treatment effects, conducting surveys or cohort studies on which clinicians patients approach first and how this differs by provider type, establishing the duration/natural history of recent onset tinnitus and time to spontaneous resolution, documenting common medical and/or psychiatric comorbidities, identifying subsets who respond especially well to specific treatments and incorporating these into subsequent RCTs, and conducting methodologically rigorous research into CAM therapies for tinnitus.

Introduction

Tinnitus, characterized by the perception of an unspecified sound, is a complex and common condition affecting over 740 million adults globally according to recent estimates. In its severe form, it can be accompanied by sleep disturbances, concentration difficulties, memory problems, anxiety and depression, leading to a considerable impairment in quality of life. Severe tinnitus is estimated to afflict more than 120 million individuals globally. In European countries, severe tinnitus imposes a profound individual burden with around 1500€ in annual out-of-pocket expenses, as well as socioeconomic burden with approximately 4800€ in annual socioeconomic costs per patient. Efforts have been made to alleviate both health-related and economic burden by the design and implementation of various treatment strategies such as psychological, auditory and pharmacological treatments. Yet, the efficacy of many treatment options remains unclear, which is often attributed to the diverse etiological and clinical manifestation of tinnitus, often referred to as tinnitus heterogeneity.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for tinnitus — trial efficacy and safety show mixed short-term Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) responses, insufficient evidence ratings, and seizure-related risks. Only 1 study showed statistically significant improvement in THI at 4 months' follow-up after low-frequency rTMS therapy, but 2 other studies of similar rTMS treatment showed no statistically significant improvement; in a systematic review that included 5 trials, 3 of which were included in the aforementioned Cochrane review and 2 were not, 2 of the studies that used THI as the primary outcome measure showed initial reduction after active rTMS with reduction lasting for 6 months, and meta-analysis was not performed because of design variations and differences in tinnitus assessment. The recently released AHRQ CER analyzed 6 studies of rTMS or electromagnetic stimulation for tinnitus, rated the evidence as insufficient, noted low strength of evidence for tinnitus-related quality of life (QOL) measures, and reported that none of the trials evaluated subjective tinnitus loudness. The principal risk of rTMS is provocation of seizures with greatest risk in patients with a history of epilepsy or brain lesions and those taking medications that lower seizure threshold (ie, antidepressants); low-frequency rTMS with stimulus intensity approximating the resting motor threshold is unlikely to produce seizures, exclusion criteria have included focal brain lesions, neurodegenerative diseases, pacemakers or other electronic implants, seizure history, or medications that lower seizure threshold, and rTMS can cause local pain and discomfort during the procedure and transient headaches afterward.

### SSRI use by tinnitus patients: interactions between depression and tinnitus severity [^1145w4W5]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Depression is often coincident with chronic tinnitus, and several studies have suggested that antidepressant medications may play a role in relieving tinnitus as well as depression. We conducted a retrospective study of the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) by patients at a large tinnitus clinic to assess the effects of these antidepressants on tinnitus severity. We focused on a subgroup of 30 patients with depression who had begun taking SSRI medication after the onset of their tinnitus; these patients had also been treated with psychotherapy by a mental health clinician. At a mean follow-up of 20.6 months, only 10 of the 30 patients reported that they were still experiencing major depression. Moreover, this group as a whole demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in tinnitus symptoms as reflected by a reduction in their Tinnitus Severity Index scores. We conclude that SSRIs represent one category of tools that can be used to help patients with severe tinnitus and depression. Like all antidepressant medications, SSRIs should be used in conjunction with psychotherapy to facilitate patient improvement.

Antidepressants

Three RCTs examining the efficacy of antidepressants were identified, providing moderate-to-high level evidence of negligible to large-effect sizes (Table I). Robinson et al.compared paroxetine (up to 50 mg daily, as tolerated) to placebo. They found no significant changes in tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression. Furthermore, they noted several significant adverse events: sexual dysfunction, excessive drowsiness, and dry mouth. Sullivan et al.compared nortriptyline (up to 100 mg at night, as tolerated) to placebo (lactose). They reported a significant reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, score for the intervention group compared to controls. Sub-analysis suggested that those reporting greatest benefit were women and individuals reporting insomnia. Zöger et al.compared sertraline to placebo. They reported significant improvements on the Tinnitus Severity Questionnaireand the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)for the group receiving sertraline compared to placebo. This study is slightly complicated, as nine participants were given oxazepam in the first 2 weeks to alleviate expected worsening of distress. But oxazepam itself is a benzodiazepine, which may have an effect on tinnitus.Zöger et al.reported 24% attrition in this study, but none of the dropouts had received oxazepam, suggesting that it may have affected their result.

In summary, three RCTS examining antidepressants report three different findings. Meta-analysis was not performed.

Anxiolytics

One RCT examined the efficacy of an anxiolytic. Jalali et al.compared alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) with chlorpheniramine (antihistamine), excluding participants scoring more than 14 points on the HAM-A anxiety questionnaire. They found no significant change in THI score between groups. Changes in anxiety and depression were not reported.

Night Sedation

Two RCTs were identified that examined the efficacy of the neurohormone sedative melatonin. Neri et al.compared melatonin (3 mg at night for 80 nights) to a no-treatment control group. There were no significant changes in THI score between groups. Rosenberg et al.compared melatonin (3 mg at night for 30 nights) to placebo (lactose) and also found no significant effect on THI score between groups. Anxiety and depression were not measured in these studies. Meta-analysis was not performed.

Treatment questionnaire

The treatment questionnaire featured a comprehensive list of commonly used medications, including, among others, antiepileptics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and pain medication. Patients were instructed to select medications that had been used at least once since symptom onset and to mark the effect of each treatment on their VS symptoms. They could mark 0 for no effect, + for improvement and − for worsening. If patients had not tried any medication since the onset of their symptoms, they were instructed to return the questionnaire blank. Patients were given the possibility of adding any medication that was not on the main list, in a row titled 'Other'. A column next to the molecule name listed are common brand names for each drug. The treatment questionnaire had a final, blank line, asking patients about previous recreational drug use and its effect on VSS symptoms.

Specific information on dosing or prescriptions was not requested. Nonetheless, when patients specified that they had only taken a medication for a short amount of time, further information was gathered on a case-by-case basis. Data on any treatment known to be used at nontherapeutic doses were not included in the final analysis.

Based on their answers to the treatment questionnaire, a variable was created to categorise each patients' response to previous medication. The response was classified as either an absence of effect, an improvement, a worsening, a mixed response (improvement and worsening with different drugs). Additionally, patients could state whether they never used medication before. Ratios representing improvement and worsening were calculated as the proportion of these two outcomes over the total times the medication was used; they, therefore, indicate the overall proportion of patients reporting an improvement or a worsening in VSSs when using the drug. Only drugs with a minimum of n = 20 reported uses are displayed.

For the analysis, drugs with a known action on the central nervous system were categorised into their different sites of action; as an example, antidepressants were subdivided into selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants and atypical antidepressants.

A binary logistic regression analysis was run to predict the effect of the independent variables such as age, gender, age at disease onset (computed as 0 for patients who had VSS for as long as they could remember), presence of tinnitus and migraine on the likelihood of developing any form of response to medication (either an improvement or a worsening).

### Current validated medical treatments: pharmacologic interventions [^113NgAvd]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The search for an effective medication that will eliminate tinnitus has a long history. Currently, no drugs exist that universally cure tinnitus. Pharmacologic interventions that have been investigated can be divided into those that attempt to eliminate the perception of tinnitus, and those that are designed to treat the negative comorbidities associated with tinnitus, thereby mitigating tinnitus' negative impact on quality of life. A third category of drugs can also be considered that addresses an identified pathologic condition that has tinnitus as an associated symptom (for example, Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, migraine-associated vertigo). This third category is not addressed.

2 Methods

2.1 General guidelines of the study

The current network meta-analysis (NMA) followed an a priori defined unpublished protocol (available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author) and was performed according to the latest preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelineand AMSTAR2 (Assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews) Guidelines. The current study had been approval by the Institutional Review Board of the Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center (TSGHIRB No. B-109–29). The current study had been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020177742) with the first submission date of April 1 st, 2020 and final approval of registration date by July 5 th, 2020.

2.2 Target of investigated medication, search strategy and selection criteria

In order to improve the reliability of the current NMA, we choose the pharmacologic treatments which were intended to include from the list of recommendations in the current review articles or clinical guidelines. A systematic review was carried out using ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to April 5th, 2021 (Suppl. B, eTable 1). No language restriction was used. In addition, manual searches were performed for potentially eligible articles selected from the reference lists of review articles, clinical guidelines, and pairwise meta-analyses. The definition of "tinnitus without specific or treatable origin" followed the definition of primary tinnitus addressed in the important guideline by Tunkel, D.E. (2014).

RESULTS

Safety and Tolerability of OTO-313 in Patients With Tinnitus (Parts A and B)

Eight patients were randomized in Part A and 35 patients in Part B (Fig. 1). Thirty-one patients in Part B were randomized and completed at least one post-baseline TFI assessment (evaluable set). Overall, treatment groups were similar with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics (Table 1). Two Part B patients assigned to OTO-313 deviated from eligibility criteria and were enrolled with bilateral rather than unilateral tinnitus (bilateral tinnitus was allowed in Part A). Based on audiometry, patients exhibited a wide range of hearing thresholds and most Part B patients had slight or mild hearing loss (based on PTA; 16–25 dB and 26–40 dB, respectively). The use of hearing aids as well as psychoactive medications including those for symptoms related to tinnitus (e.g. antidepressants, medications for anxiety and insomnia) was comparable for OTO-313 and placebo groups and therefore unlikely to have an impact on OTO-313 results in this study (Table 1). Of the OTO-313 treated patients, three of six responders were on stable doses of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications compared with three of eight non-responders, hence the use rate of these medications was similar between responders and non-responders.

TABLE 1
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics

A single intratympanic injection of OTO-313 was well-tolerated and patients who received OTO-313 had a lower incidence of adverse events than placebo (Table 2). There were no adverse events that led to withdrawal, and a very low incidence of tympanic membrane perforation (one OTO-313 patient each in Parts A and B) which resolved by the end of the study. There was one serious adverse event (stress cardiomyopathy), but it was not considered related to study drug. Most adverse events were ear- or injection site-related, were mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved by the end of the study. There were no meaningful changes from baseline in tympanometry, otoscopy, or audiometry. There were no notable changes in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, or assessment of suicidality. Plasma concentrations of gacyclidine were below the limit of assay quantitation (≤ 0.1 ng/mL) for both dose levels at all timepoints confirming limited systemic exposure.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115QeaAz]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Several potential limitations should be considered. First, this NMA may have been underpowered due to the heterogeneity of the participants (e.g. comorbidities, mood disorder, baseline severity of tinnitus, duration of tinnitus onset, wearing hearing-aids, treatment duration in each study and follow-up duration), variety in the definition of response, variety in tinnitus severity or quality-of-life rating scales, and high risk of bias in 'Random sequence generation' and 'Blinding of participants' in some of the included RCTs. In order to overcome the potential bias on the primary outcome, we arranged subgroup to exclude RCTs without placebo-control, in which the main results would not change. Further, in the subgroup of different duration of tinnitus symptoms, there was no significant difference of placebo effect between the subgroups with different disease duration of tinnitus symptom (p = 0.80), which suggest potentially less impact by the different duration of tinnitus symptom on the primary outcome. As for the heterogeneity of the outcome reporting (i.e. variety in tinnitus severity or quality-of-life rating scales), this was an unavoidable limitation of any NMA investigating subjective outcomes. The tinnitus, just like the depressive symptoms, quality of life, or pain symptoms, was a subjective symptom and lack of objective measurement to measure its severity or to define its treatment response. Currently, there had not been any conclusive golden rating scales to measure its severity. Also, there had been no conclusive evidence to approve the superiority of one rating scales to the others. The choice or selection of one specific rating scales would become an potential source of bias in the network meta-analysis of subjective symptoms. Based on this limitation, we highly recommend future studies to address the need for a gold standard measurement of tinnitus severity, which would appear to be a significant limitation in the tinnitus research field. Further, the results of the future study would be recommended to be rated according to a standardized multi-measure scale. Therefore, the clinicians may pay attention when applied the results of current study in their clinical practice because of the potential difference between the rating scales and the variety of definition of response rate. Second, although the most of the RCTs included a placebo control in their study design, some of the included trials applied waiting list as their control groups. However, the main findings were unchanged after excluding those trials (Suppl. B, eFig. 1D-1E and 2D-2E). Third, given the relatively small number of patients and RCTs, the main results of this NMA should perhaps be conservatively applied in clinical practice. Fourth, despite some heterogeneity among RCTs regarding the control group, when trials were restricted to an oral form of placebo therapy, results were similar. Further, the potential placebo effect was an unavoidable issue in any clinical studies investigating disease of subjective symptoms, such as tinnitus. The overall placebo of the injection form placebo and oral form placebo were 26.4% and 24.5%, which was relatively low compared to that of neuropsychiatric disease, such as depression (i.e. 35%−40%). Fifth, because of small numbers of included RCTs and insufficient direct/indirect comparison between treatment arms, there would be different findings between the primary outcome (i.e. changes of tinnitus severity) and secondary outcome (i.e. response rate). Sixth, although the De Ridder et al. (2021)had provided the clear concept of "tinnitus disorder", the most included RCTs (published from 1993 to 2020) in the current NMA did not apply the concept of "tinnitus disorder". Therefore, we could not make distinguish between the target of "tinnitus vs tinnitus disorder" in the current study. Finally, we only investigated the drop-out rate but not by an adverse events profile because too few studies provided data about adverse events to form a network. Also, there were some other important factors associated with the baseline tinnitus severity, such as quality of life, anxiety mood, depressive mood, and so on. However, we could only perform network meta-analysis of quality of life but not the others because there were too few RCTs providing such data to form a network structure.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114uopt1]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first NMA addressing the efficacy of different pharmacologic management in tinnitus without specific/treatable origin (i.e. primary tinnitus). The main findings of the current NMA were that regimens of pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effect, such as amitriptyline, acamprosate, gabapentin, and melatonin, were associated with significantly better improvement in tinnitus severity or response rate than the placebo/waiting-list groups. Several mechanisms support the effects found in this NMA. Another important finding of the current NMA was the significantly higher response rate of intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin than the placebo/waiting-list group. Most treatments showed similar drop-out rate compared to placebo/control.

The severe tinnitus perception exerted similar abnormal neurotransmitter secretion found in the pain perception in the somatosensory system, which was associated with decreased GABAergic inhibition. Therefore, the prescription of gabapentin, which bound at calcium channel proteins and exerted widely suppressing effect, could imitate the GABAergic effect. Similarly, the amitriptyline, one of the tri-cyclic antidepressant family, had been found to exert its role on nociceptive perception in the central somatosensory system through multiple neurotransmitter system, such as GABA and alpha1-adrenergic receptors. In addition to the theory of abnormal nociceptive perception, the previous systematic review and network meta-analysis had demonstrated that tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin had been found to have significant hyperactivity in brain multiple regions. Therefore, the strategy to reduce the abnormal hyperactivity would exert potential beneficial effects to reduce tinnitus severity. For example, the acamprosate is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain through blocking glutaminergic N-methyl — aspartate receptors and GABA receptors, which efficacy in improving tinnitus would reflect the potential new direction for guiding future research of tinnitus management.

### Efficacy of pharmacologic treatment in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1178WiR2]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although tinnitus has a prevalence between 20 and 42.8%, the currently recommended management for tinnitus, such as tinnitus support and psychologic therapies, are relatively time-consuming and expensive. Several new pharmacologic treatments designed for tinnitus patients without specific origin had been developed but their efficacy remains unclear.

Methods

The current Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacologic treatments for tinnitus management in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin (i.e. primary tinnitus). Databases were searched from inception to April 5 th, 2021. All network meta-analytic procedures were conducted under the frequentist model. We calculated the effect size of outcomes with different rating scales with standardized mean difference. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020177742.

Findings

Overall, 36 RCTs were included with 2,761 participants. The main results revealed that pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effect (for example, amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) and those with anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (for example, intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) were associated with superior improvement in tinnitus severity and response rate compared to placebo/control. Oral amitriptyline were associated with the highest improvement in tinnitus severity and the fourth highest response rate. None of the investigated interventions was associated with different changes in quality of life compared to placebo/control. All the investigated treatments were associated with similar drop-out rate to placebo/control.

Interpretation

The current NMA suggests a potential role for treatments with brain-acting effect (for example, amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) or anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (for example, intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) as the preferable effective treatments for tinnitus without specific or treatable origin.

Antidepressants — antidepressants are not recommended for treating tinnitus based on results from 7 RCTs and 1 Cochrane review that failed to demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm. Although 4 of 7 trials showed improvement, these trials had significant methodological limitations, and the Cochrane review included 4 trials of tricyclic antidepressants, 1 trial of trazodone, and 1 trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine); of these trials, 4 are double blind, 1 is single blind, and 1 does not clearly state blinding. Three tricyclic trials showed modest improvement possibly related to depression/anxiety modulation rather than tinnitus change, and commonly reported side effects include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth with more subjects dropping out of treatment groups than placebo; tinnitus is listed as a rare side effect of all available antidepressants.

RESULTS

All studies included in this review were RCTs of tinnitus management interventions mentioned in the GPG. All participant groups were representative of a clinically relevant population, and without exception all studies reported one or more outcomes based on validated questionnaire measures of tinnitus, anxiety, or depression. Unless otherwise stated, studies included adults of all ages, and baseline scores for outcome measures did not differ significantly between groups. Throughout, statistical significance refers to a reliable numerical difference between group means. Clinical significance refers to the specific questionnaire score change that implies a functional improvement or worsening of the condition in an individual patient.

### Optimal dosing of nortriptyline-topiramate and verapamil-paroxetine combinations in tinnitus treatment [^117TLFf8]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine effective dose strategies for nortriptyline-topiramate (NT) and verapamil-paroxetine (VP) combinations for tinnitus treatment.

Methods

This secondary analysis examined data from an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) evaluating treatment outcomes in 41 patients. Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) scores were used as the primary outcome measure, administered at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 to assess achievement of minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of 13-point reduction. Descriptive statistics were employed to characterize treatment responses and assess dose-response relationships.

Results

In the NT group (n = 19), 42% of the participants achieved a reduction in TFI scores meeting MCID with a mean dose of 44 ± 12mg nortriptyline plus 59 ± 16mg topiramate, all showing greater than 15% improvement. In the VP group (n = 22), 41% reached MCID with a mean of 207 ± 36mg verapamil plus 28 ± 5mg paroxetine. Of these, 88.9% showed at least a 15% improvement in TFI. Early responders who achieved MCID by the midpoint of the trial required continued dose escalations due to limited improvement in weekly VAS scores afterward. However, subsequent TFI changes were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Both NT and VP regimens effectively reduce tinnitus severity in approximately half of the patients at moderate doses within 8weeks. However, long-term effects may not have been fully captured, particularly among late improvers.

### Antidepressants for patients with tinnitus [^1132BwLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006 and previously updated in 2009. Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. It has been compared with chronic pain, and may be associated with depression or depressive symptoms which can affect quality of life and the ability to work. Antidepressant drugs have been used to treat tinnitus in patients with and without depressive symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of tinnitus and to ascertain whether any benefit is due to a direct tinnitus effect or a secondary effect due to treatment of concomitant depressive states.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; PsycINFO; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 January 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical studies of antidepressant drugs versus placebo in patients with tinnitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors critically appraised the retrieved studies and extracted data independently. Where necessary we contacted study authors for further information.

Main Results

Six trials involving 610 patients were included. Trial quality was generally low. Four of the trials looked at the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on tinnitus, investigating 405 patients. One trial investigated the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a group of 120 patients. One study investigated trazodone, an atypical antidepressant, versus placebo. Only the trial using the SSRI drug reached the highest quality standard. None of the other included trials met the highest quality standard, due to use of inadequate outcome measures, large drop-out rates or failure to separate the effects on tinnitus from the effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression. All the trials assessing tricyclic antidepressants suggested that there was a slight improvement in tinnitus but these effects may have been attributable to methodological bias. The trial that investigated the SSRI drug found no overall improvement in any of the validated outcome measures that were used in the study although there was possible benefit for a subgroup that received higher doses of the drug. This observation merits further investigation. In the trial investigating trazodone, the results showed an improvement in tinnitus intensity and in quality of life after treatment, but in neither case reached statistical significance. Reports of side effects including sedation, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth were common.

Authors' Conclusions

There is as yet insufficient evidence to say that antidepressant drug therapy improves tinnitus.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining tinnitus management [^114ZWDg1]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The "phantom" auditory experience of tinnitus affects 10% to 15% of people in the United Kingdom. It is most clearly associated with noise exposure and ageing and can present with comorbid sleep disturbance, hearing difficulty, social withdrawal, and negative emotional reactions such as anxiety and depression. Although a majority of tinnitus patients are male and present with some form of hearing loss and higher-frequency steeply sloping hearing loss in particular, there is no typical characteristic history or level of distress of the help-seeking tinnitus patient.

In the United Kingdom, the Department of Health issued a Good Practice Guide (GPG) for the commissioning of tinnitus services and for the clinical assessment and management of tinnitus patients. It recommends that tinnitus severity is assessed using either the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)or the Tinnitus Questionnaire. It also recommends that psychological comorbidity is assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventoryor the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). However, questionnaire use in clinical practice is limited.

In terms of management, therapeutic targets include the sound itself (i.e. interrupt the neural signal generating the sound) or the associated symptoms of distress, anxiety, or depression that can accompany tinnitus. The GPG states that tinnitus patients will be given, as appropriate, information/education, hearing aids, counseling and psychological support, relaxation therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with the requisite professional supervision, sleep management (including supervised CBT), sound enrichment therapy, and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT). The use of antidepressants, anxiolytics, and night sedation is also advocated. However, the GPG lacks an evidence base to support these recommendations and is in part based on anecdotal evidence and expert opinion.

This review asked the question, how much high-level evidence exists for the efficacy of the GPG-suggested tinnitus management strategies, and was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for evaluating therapeutic interventions. A systematic search was used to identify RCTs that examined tinnitus management strategies and reported validated measures of tinnitus intrusiveness, anxiety, or depression, therefore providing comparable measures of change in patient symptoms. Where possible, meta-analyses were conducted. The outcome of this review provides high-level evidence that supports some, but not all, GPG recommended strategies for tinnitus management in the United Kingdom, and also highlights where further RCTs would be of immediate benefit.

Tinnitus is a significant medical problem affecting approximately 50 million Americans, 12 million of them severely. Once a thorough evaluation has been performed by a qualified otolaryngologist, and no life-threatening pathology has been identified, the opportunity for treatment exists. Treatment options are extensive and range from approved protocols to anecdotal remedies. Although tinnitus may not miraculously disappear, many therapeutic options exist that may help to make the tinnitus more manageable.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine) [^1171CAhP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation of Treatment with Venlafaxine Hydrochloride

Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking venlafaxine, to include prospective analyses of clinical trials in Generalized Anxiety Disorder and retrospective surveys of trials in major depressive disorder. Abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction of venlafaxine at various doses has been found to be associated with the appearance of new symptoms, the frequency of which increased with increased dose level and with longer duration of treatment. Reported symptoms include agitation, anorexia, anxiety, confusion, impaired coordination and balance, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, dysphoric mood, fasciculation, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, headaches, hypomania, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, nightmares, sensory disturbances (including shock-like electrical sensations), somnolence, sweating, tremor, vertigo, and vomiting.

During marketing of venlafaxine hydrochloride, other SNRIs (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), and SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.

Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with venlafaxine hydrochloride. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Anxiety and Insomnia

Treatment-emergent anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia were more commonly reported for venlafaxine-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients in a pooled analysis of short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled depression studies:

Anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia led to drug discontinuation in 2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively, of the patients treated with venlafaxine in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 depression studies.

5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including sertraline hydrochloride, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.

5.4 Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with sertraline hydrochloride tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride tablets. Prior to initiating treatment with sertraline hydrochloride tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

5.5 Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [See Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

5.6 Seizures

Sertraline hydrochloride has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Sertraline hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.

### Antidepressants for patients with tinnitus [^113DhYFH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. It has been compared with chronic pain, and may be associated with depression or depressive symptoms which can affect quality of life and the ability to work. Antidepressant drugs have been used to treat tinnitus in patients with and without depressive symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatment of tinnitus and to ascertain whether any benefit was due to a direct tinnitus effect or a secondary effect due to treatment of concomitant depressive states.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1951 to 2006); EMBASE (1974 to 2006), CINAHL (to 2006), PSYCINFO (to 2006), LILACS (to 2006), and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. The date of the most recent search was March 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled clinical studies of antidepressant drugs versus placebo in patients with tinnitus.

Data Collection and Analysis

The studies retrieved were critically appraised and data extracted independently by two authors. Where necessary study authors were contacted for further information.

Main Results

Five trials involving 525 patients were included. Four of these trials looked at the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on tinnitus, investigating 405 patients. One trial investigated the effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a group of 120 patients. No trials involving other antidepressant agents met the inclusion criteria. Only the trial using the SSRI drug met the highest quality standard. None of the other included trials met the highest quality standard, due to use of inadequate outcome measures, large drop out rates or failure to separate the effects on tinnitus from the effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression. All the trials assessing tricyclic antidepressants suggested that there was a slight improvement in tinnitus but these effects may have been attributable to methodological bias. The trial that investigated the SSRI drug found no overall improvement in any of the validated outcome measures that were used in the study although there was possible benefit for a subgroup that received higher doses of the drug. This observation merits further investigation. Reports of side effects including sedation, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth were common.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to say that antidepressant drug therapy improves tinnitus.

### The effect of fibromyalgia treatment on tinnitus [^113skyfF]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We investigated the frequency of tinnitus in fibromyalgia patients and the effect of drugs used for routine fibromyalgia on tinnitus.

Methods

We included 101 diagnosed fibromyalgia patients. After detailed ear nose throat examination, audiometric tests and tinnitus handicap index (THI) were performed. After the tests, routine treatment for fibromyalgia was started by the physical therapy and rehabilitation department. Two months after the beginning of the treatment, THI were repeated again and the results were statistically evaluated.

Results

All patients included in the study were women. 74.3% of the patients had tinnitus. Pregabalin and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant-treated patients were evaluated; In both groups, there was a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatment tinnitus levels (p < .001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between pregabalin group and diloxetine group according to treatment results.

Conclusions

The incidence of tinnitus is high in fibromyalgia patients. That pregabalin and duloxetine agents routinely used in fibromyalgia require further experimental and human studies in order to be able to use in tinnitus.
