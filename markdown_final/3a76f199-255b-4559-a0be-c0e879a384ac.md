## Question

diagnostic labs for IBD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnostic laboratory testing in inflammatory bowel disease, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching diagnostic framework and where labs fit. Then, I should verify the core blood tests and their limitations. Next, I will examine stool biomarkers, especially fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin, including thresholds and performance. After that, I need to check infectious etiologies and drug-level/immunogenicity testing. I will then review serologic antibodies and their limited role. I should also consider special populations and emergency settings. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight key limitations and future directions, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence where possible.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump to conclusions: IBD diagnosis remains multimodal, integrating clinical features, endoscopy with histology, radiology, and biochemical tests; no single laboratory test establishes the diagnosis, and endoscopic assessment with biopsies remains the gold standard for confirmation and phenotyping, so labs are adjuncts rather than replacements [^115RZteF] [^1134Ymxr] [^111XSWdG].

> I will now examine the core blood tests used at presentation and for monitoring; wait, let me verify the most informative elements: a complete blood count to screen for anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis; CRP as an acute-phase reactant with a short half-life that tracks inflammation in many but not all patients; ESR as a less specific adjunct; and a comprehensive metabolic panel including albumin, liver enzymes, and renal function to assess nutrition, hepatic involvement, and comorbidities, with the caveat that up to 30–40% of patients with active IBD can have normal CRP/ESR, limiting sensitivity [^114khZJE] [^116Kmomw] [^114As69P].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of fecal biomarkers because they often change pretest probabilities meaningfully; fecal calprotectin is the most validated stool marker, with pooled sensitivity/specificity around 0.88/0.80 for discriminating IBD from non-IBD in symptomatic adults, and it performs particularly well in ulcerative colitis compared with Crohn's disease, while fecal lactoferrin offers comparable utility in some studies but with a smaller, lower-quality evidence base; importantly, calprotectin can reduce unnecessary colonoscopies substantially when used strategically in low-to-intermediate risk patients [^1142bLzg] [^112bNtqB] [^114JEFMi].

> Let me consider practical thresholds and how to apply them; I initially thought a single universal cutoff would suffice, but wait, I should double-check because performance varies by clinical question: for screening/rule-out, a lower threshold such as 50–100 μg/g maximizes sensitivity, whereas for confirming active inflammation in established IBD, a higher threshold around 250 μg/g improves specificity; in pediatric meta-analyses, adding calprotectin to symptoms markedly improves discrimination and risk reclassification, supporting its frontline role in children with suspected IBD [^114JEFMi] [^112KpBjh] [^111apTMc].

> Next, I should review infectious testing because missing an infection can derail both diagnosis and therapy; stool cultures, ova and parasites as indicated, and especially C. difficile testing with NAAT (with or without toxin EIA) are recommended in new presentations or flares, and I need to ensure I note that NAAT positivity with toxin negativity creates management uncertainty in IBD, where observational data suggest no clear benefit from antibiotics in all such cases, so clinical judgment is essential [^112Yf3KY] [^115hSC8B] [^114daduY].

> I will now examine therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenomics; let me verify guideline positions: for thiopurines, TPMT testing is suggested to guide dosing and mitigate myelotoxicity, with routine CBC monitoring regardless of TPMT status; for anti-TNF agents, reactive therapeutic drug monitoring can inform loss of response and guide switching or dose optimization; for very early-onset IBD, targeted genetic panels and, if negative, WES/WGS can be considered in specialized settings, but these are not first-line for typical adult-onset disease [^115dd633] [^111iQxT8] [^113kmo4P].

> But wait, what about serologic antibodies like ASCA and pANCA; I should confirm their current role: routine serologic panels are not recommended to establish IBD or to differentiate CD from UC in typical cases due to limited sensitivity/specificity and lack of actionable thresholds, though they may have a niche in indeterminate colitis or research contexts, so I should avoid over-ordering them in standard practice [^111iEgom] [^111CkpBQ].

> Let me think about special populations and settings; in pediatrics, fecal calprotectin adds substantial diagnostic value beyond symptoms and should be prioritized, while in the elderly, I need to ensure I broaden the differential to ischemia, microscopic colitis, NSAID injury, and malignancy, using calprotectin to triage endoscopy and maintaining a low threshold for cross-sectional imaging when red flags are present; in emergency settings, a standardized panel including CBC, CMP, CRP/ESR, albumin, and fecal calprotectin when feasible is recommended alongside infection exclusion [^112KpBjh] [^112R8rog] [^116DbDjv] [^114As69P].

> I should double-check the practical diagnostic algorithm so it is clinically usable: start with symptoms and pretest probability, obtain CBC, CRP, and albumin as a baseline, add stool testing for pathogens and C. difficile, and measure fecal calprotectin; if calprotectin is normal and suspicion is low, consider functional disorders and defer endoscopy, whereas if calprotectin is elevated or suspicion is high, proceed to ileocolonoscopy with biopsies and disease mapping, with small-bowel imaging as indicated for suspected Crohn's disease; this approach aligns with treat-to-target principles emphasizing objective inflammation and mucosal healing endpoints [^115RZteF] [^111XSWdG] [^111JSZRp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing endoscopy; I need to emphasize limitations: fecal calprotectin can be falsely elevated in infections, NSAID enteropathy, celiac disease, and malignancy, and it may be normal in strictly fibrostenosing Crohn's disease or isolated proximal small-bowel disease, so discordance between symptoms and biomarkers warrants careful reassessment and, when appropriate, endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging rather than anchoring on a single result [^1153AAfx] [^112bAjxJ].

> Let me reconsider the future landscape briefly; emerging fecal markers, proteomic/metabolomic signatures, and machine learning models are promising but not yet ready for routine care, so current practice should continue to integrate validated biomarkers within a multimodal framework while we await robust, prospectively validated tools for precision medicine in IBD [^112NpkGB] [^116QhDmQ] [^1128YqS4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit: use a core blood panel to screen for systemic inflammation and complications, leverage fecal calprotectin as the most informative noninvasive marker with context-specific cutoffs, exclude infections rigorously, apply drug-level and pharmacogenomic testing selectively, avoid routine serologic antibody panels, and escalate to endoscopy with histology when biomarkers are positive or clinical suspicion remains high, recognizing that no single laboratory test can establish or exclude IBD in isolation [^115RZteF] [^1134Ymxr] [^111XSWdG].

Diagnostic labs for IBD include **CBC, CRP, and ESR** to screen for inflammation, anemia, and infection; **fecal calprotectin/lactoferrin** to noninvasively detect intestinal inflammation and distinguish IBD from IBS [^1148KZyQ]; and **stool cultures and C. difficile testing** to exclude infections that mimic IBD flares [^1115pEvW]. Serologic markers (ASCA, pANCA) are not routinely used for diagnosis but may aid differentiation in indeterminate cases [^111iEgom] [^111CkpBQ]. Endoscopy with biopsy remains the **gold standard** for definitive diagnosis and classification [^1151MoF3] [^1134Ymxr].

---

## Blood tests

Blood tests are **commonly used** to screen for inflammation, anemia, and infection in patients with suspected or confirmed IBD [^116Kmomw].

---

### Complete blood count (CBC)

- **Purpose**: Screens for anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis, which are common in IBD [^117NmNr4].
- **Clinical utility**: Anemia and elevated platelet counts are common in IBD; leukocytosis may indicate active inflammation or infection [^117NmNr4].

---

### C-reactive protein (CRP)

- **Purpose**: An acute-phase reactant indicating systemic inflammation [^117K3ajh].
- **Clinical utility**: Elevated in active IBD, particularly Crohn's disease; normal CRP does not exclude IBD, especially in ulcerative colitis [^114khZJE] [^115oZRct].

---

### Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

ESR is a nonspecific marker of inflammation that is often elevated in active IBD; however, it is less specific than CRP and can be elevated in many conditions [^notfound].

---

### Liver function tests (LFTs)

LFTs assess liver function and screen for hepatobiliary complications, which are common in IBD; abnormalities may indicate primary sclerosing cholangitis or other liver diseases [^117NmNr4].

---

## Stool tests

Stool tests are **essential** to exclude infections and assess intestinal inflammation noninvasively [^112g1wMy].

---

### Fecal calprotectin

- **Purpose**: A neutrophil-derived protein indicating intestinal inflammation [^1148KZyQ].
- **Clinical utility**: Highly sensitive and specific for distinguishing IBD from IBS; levels correlate with endoscopic disease activity [^1144UeKW] [^114JEFMi].
- **Limitations**: Elevated in infectious colitis and other inflammatory conditions; not specific to IBD [^1153AAfx].

---

### Fecal lactoferrin

Fecal lactoferrin is a neutrophil-derived protein indicating intestinal inflammation. It is useful for detecting active inflammation and distinguishing IBD from IBS, though less specific than calprotectin [^114Zj6M4].

---

### Stool cultures and Clostridioides difficile testing

These tests exclude infectious etiologies that mimic IBD flares. Testing for C. difficile is recommended in all patients with IBD flares or new-onset diarrhea [^112Yf3KY] [^115hSC8B].

---

## Serologic markers

Serologic markers are **not routinely used** for initial diagnosis but may aid differentiation between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in indeterminate cases [^111iEgom].

| **Marker** | **Association** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| ASCA (Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies) | Crohn's disease | May aid differentiation in indeterminate cases |
| pANCA (Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) | Ulcerative colitis | May aid differentiation in indeterminate cases |

---

## Endoscopy and biopsy

Endoscopy with biopsy remains the **gold standard** for definitive diagnosis and classification of IBD [^1151MoF3].

- **Colonoscopy with biopsies**: Essential for distinguishing Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis and assessing disease extent and severity [^1151MoF3].
- **Upper endoscopy**: Recommended in pediatric patients or when upper gastrointestinal involvement is suspected [^116zR2dL].
- **Capsule endoscopy**: Useful for detecting small bowel involvement in Crohn's disease, particularly when traditional endoscopy is inconclusive [^111EzfYb].

### Effective use of the laboratory in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [^116Kmomw]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic, intestinal inflammatory disorders, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. IBD is characterized by periods of relapse and remission. Long-term progressive intestinal inflammation can result in severe and devastating complications, such as intestinal strictures and/or fistulae. Immune suppressive medications with potent side effects are often used to control inflammation and limit disease activity. Laboratory tests guide various decisions in clinical management of IBD. We discuss tests used to diagnose IBD, assess for relapse or remission, monitor the effectiveness of therapeutic regimen, screen for the maintenance of health, and diagnose or prevent complications.

### Biomarkers of inflammatory bowel disease: from classical laboratory tools to personalized medicine [^113ieq6u]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnostics of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) currently relies on a combination of biological and morphological tests. The current method of diagnostic remains a critical challenge for physicians in part due to their invasiveness and also for their limitations in term of diagnosis, prognosis, disease activity and severity assessment, and therapeutic outcomes. Laboratory biomarkers can be used in the diagnosis and management of IBD, but none of them has been proven to be ideal. Increasing efforts are being made to discover new biomarkers that can discriminate between the types of IBD, predict future responses to treatment, and aid in differential diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction. This review addresses the potential for current biomarkers and the emergence of the concept of biomarker signatures in IBD diagnostic and personalized medicine.

### Noninvasive testing for mucosal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^1123qNn6]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have gained increasing attention for the diagnosis and follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Endoscopy remains the gold standard for assessing disease activity. Biomarkers are rapid, inexpensive, and noninvasive, and can be used in different stages of the disease with high sensitivity and specificity. Calprotectin and tests for C-reactive protein are used to assess the disease activity, predict relapse, and monitor treatment response. New noninvasive tests are being studied. This review discusses current evidence for these surrogate markers, their potential clinical applications, and limitations in disease management. We highlight recent advances in IBD biomarkers and future uses.

Recent efforts led by the United Kingdom IBD Genetics Consortium have successfully conducted prospective and retrospective studies about genetic pre-treatment tests in the context of IBD management. However, additional large international consortia are needed to facilitate the collection of rigorous cohorts of patients who develop (rare) adverse events and future studies should focus on the cost-effectiveness of these tests in the different ethnic populations.

### Diagnostics of inflammatory bowel disease [^115UB5Rb]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with its 2 main subforms, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is based on clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, and histologic criteria. This paradigm remains unchanged despite the advent of new molecular technologies for the examination of serum proteins and genetic sequences, respectively. The main innovations in diagnostic technologies include the development of more sophisticated endoscopic and noninvasive imaging techniques with the aim of improving the identification of complications, in particular malignant diseases associated with IBD. The future will see further progress in the identification of genetic susceptibility factors and of protein biomarkers and their use to describe the molecular epidemiology of IBD. It can be expected that future diagnostic algorithms will include molecular parameters to detect early disease or guide therapies by predicting the individual course of disease.

### Defining the path forward for biomarkers to address unmet needs in inflammatory bowel diseases [^112NpkGB]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite major advances in the inflammatory bowel diseases field, biomarkers to enable personalized and effective management are inadequate. Disease course and treatment response are highly variable, with some patients experiencing mild disease progression, whereas other patients experience severe or complicated disease. Periodic endoscopy is performed to assess disease activity; as a result, it takes months to ascertain whether a treatment is having a positive impact on disease progression. Minimally invasive biomarkers for prognosis of disease course, prediction of treatment response, monitoring of disease activity, and accurate diagnosis based on improved disease phenotyping and classification could improve outcomes and accelerate the development of novel therapeutics. Rapidly developing technologies have great potential in this regard; however, the discovery, validation, and qualification of biomarkers will require partnerships including academia, industry, funders, and regulators. The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation launched the IBD Biomarker Summit to bring together key stakeholders to identify and prioritize critical unmet needs; prioritize promising technologies and consortium approaches to address these needs; and propose harmonization approaches to improve comparability of data across studies. Here, we summarize the outcomes of the 2018 and 2019 meetings, including consensus-based unmet needs in the clinical and drug development context. We highlight ongoing consortium efforts and promising technologies with the potential to address these needs in the near term. Finally, we summarize actionable recommendations for harmonization, including data collection tools for improved consistency in disease phenotyping; standardization of informed consenting; and development of guidelines for sample management and assay validation. Taken together, these outcomes demonstrate that there is an exceptional alignment of priorities across stakeholders for a coordinated effort to address unmet needs of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases through biomarker science.

### Inflammatory bowel disease patient perceptions of diagnostic and monitoring tests and procedures [^116EcSeP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

IBD diagnosis and monitoring are mainly based on an in-depth physical examination coupled with the patient's medical history and various tests and procedures that include blood tests, stool tests, endoscopy with or without biopsy and medical imaging. The clinical signs of UC include urgency, tenesmus, bloody diarrhea or abdominal pain. Signs of CD are more variable and dependent on the extent and the location of the gastrointestinal disease and on whether or not there are complications such as intestinal strictures, intestinal or perianal fistulas or abscesess. Periodic measures including office visits, laboratory tests and procedures are part of the monitoring process that helps manage chronic illnesses. Assessment of IBD activity is mainly carried out through symptom reporting, laboratory testing and endoscopy. As example, a fecal calprotectin test can be used to monitor disease activity. In addition, for CD radiologic imaging plays an important role in assessment of disease activity. The ideal test must be safe, simple, inexpensive, acceptable to the public and must also be reproducible, sensitive and specific. IBD patients are subject to a large quantity of medical care, tests and procedures.

The various tests and procedures to diagnose and monitor IBD all have specific goals. Blood tests are used to screen for IBD and assess a patient's state of health. Repeated measures of certain biomarkers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin in the stool are part of the clinical IBD management procedures. These biomarkers allow for quick and non-invasive monitoring of inflammation. Endoscopy plays an integral role in the diagnosis and management of IBD patients. An endoscopic examination allows physicians to distinguish CD from UC and also provides information on disease extent and severity. Patients with IBD, are at higher risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), which is monitored through endoscopy with biopsies. Medical imaging including ultrasound, CT Scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are performed in IBD patients as a diagnostic tool and to determine the extent of the damage to the intestines, monitor the illness' activity and assess for complications. Certain tests, such as a colonoscopy or blood tests, are not appreciated by patients and generate anxiety. It is therefore important that patients receive and understand the information about the risks and benefits of the various tests and procedures.

### What is the role of serological markers in the diagnosis of IBD? [^117M4Heu]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Research and technological advancements have fostered a novel approach to understanding the intricate relationship between genetic and clinical expression of disease. Both genetic and serum antibody markers hold the most promise in helping researchers better comprehend disease heterogeneity and natural history. Although our current gold standard diagnostic tests do not possess this capability, exciting preliminary research suggests IBD-specific antibody markers may serve as predictors of an individual's disease course. Thus, the foundation has been laid upon which the discovery of novel IBD-specific and IBD-sensitive markers will enable researchers to identify at-risk individuals, as well as diagnose IBD and stratify patients into homogeneous subtypes with certainty. Clinicians can then create and implement individual treatment plans designed to improve the long-term prognosis of these chronic diseases.

### Laboratory markers in IBD: useful, magic, or unnecessary toys? [^115oZRct]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory markers have been investigated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for diagnostic and differential diagnostic purposes, for assessment of disease activity and risk of complications, for prediction of relapse, and for monitoring the effect of therapy. The introduction of biological therapies in IBD has renewed interest in inflammatory markers (especially C reactive protein (CRP)), given their potential to select responders to these treatments. Of all the laboratory markers, CRP is the most studied and has been shown to have the best overall performance. CRP is an objective marker of inflammation and correlates well with disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD). Increased CRP levels are associated with better response rates and normal CRP levels predict high placebo response rates in clinical trials with biologicals. However, despite the advantages of CRP over other markers, it is still far from ideal. Furthermore, CRP correlates less well with disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared with CD. Other laboratory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leucocyte and platelet count, albumin, and 1 acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid), have been studied either less extensively in IBD or have proven to be less useful than CRP. Faecal markers seem promising and may be more specific in detecting gut inflammation in patients with established IBD. Promising results have been reported with the use of faecal calprotectin in CD as well as in UC. Recent data however suggest that the performance of the faecal calprotectin test is superior for UC than for CD. Taken together, laboratory markers are useful and should be part of the global management of our IBD patients. They are however not magic and until more data become available, the use of CRP and other laboratory markers should be seen as an additive tool to clinical observation and physical examination rather than a replacement.

### New biomarkers for diagnosing inflammatory bowel disease and assessing treatment outcomes [^112Dw223]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying inflammatory bowel disease, there remains a significant need for biomarkers that can differentiate between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with high sensitivity and specificity, in a cost-efficient manner. As the focus on personalized approaches to the delivery of medical treatment increases, new biomarkers are being developed to predict an individual's response to therapy and their overall disease course. In this review, we will outline many of the existing and recently developed biomarkers, detailing their role in the assessment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We will identify opportunities for improvement in our biomarkers, including better differentiation between the subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease. We will also discuss new targets and strategies in biomarker development, including combining modalities to create biomarker signatures to improve the ability to predict disease courses and response to therapy among individual patients.

### World gastroenterology organization practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of IBD in 2010 [^1153k91A]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a group of idiopathic, chronic, inflammatory intestinal conditions. Its two main disease categories are: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which feature both overlapping and distinct clinical and pathological features. While these diseases have, in the past, been most evident in the developed world, their prevalence in the developing world has been gradually increasing in recent decades. This poses unique issues in diagnosis and management which have been scarcely addressed in the literature or in extant guidelines. Depending on the nature of the complaints, investigations to diagnose either form of IBD or to assess disease activity will vary and will also be influenced by geographic variations in other conditions that might mimic IBD. Similarly, therapy varies depending on the phenotype of the disease being treated and available resources. The World Gastroenterology Organization has, accordingly, developed guidelines for diagnosing and treating IBD using a cascade approach to account for variability in resources in countries around the world.

### Inflammatory bowel disease patient perceptions of diagnostic and monitoring tests and procedures [^114zsoCN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). These are chronic inflammatory illnesses of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown etiology. There is no cure, and the purpose of treatment is to control the symptoms and maintain remission. Canada ranks among the countries with the highest prevalence and incidence rates of IBD in the world. Furthermore, Canada has one of the highest IBD incidence rates among the under 16 age group and this rate increasing, especially among children under 5 years of age. One out of every 150 Canadians is afflicted with IBD. This burden generates a significant economic weight. In 2012, IBD-related costs were estimated at $2.8 billion, of which $1.2 were direct costs (hospitalization, medication and medical visits).

Diseases for which diagnosis, monitoring, and surveillance are appropriate are those that significantly impact a person's quality of life, are fatal, and are sufficiently widespread to justify investments in conditions for which early detection is beneficial and for which treatment exists. IBD meets all of these criteria. The management of IBD patients requires assessment both at the time of diagnosis and throughout the illness to determine the activity and severity of the inflammatory lesions, disease location, progression and complications. In chronic illness it has been reported that, due to time constraints on the part of the physician, patients do not receive the care they require and, as a result, their illness remains unmonitored. On the other hand, it has also been reported that patients undergo too many tests and procedures. Some authors have put forward the suggestion that this overuse of tests and procedures can be explained by the fact that physicians receive a bonus for each test requested or that they do more than less out of fear of lawsuits, which can lead to false positives or overdiagnoses.

### Biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease: a practical guide [^112bAjxJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a costly condition in terms of morbidity and healthcare utilization, with an increasing prevalence now approaching 1% in the Western world. Endoscopic assessment of IBD remains the gold standard for diagnosis, evaluation of treatment response and determination of post-operative recurrence, but is expensive and invasive. Biomarkers can facilitate non-invasive disease assessment, with C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin as the most widely available biomarkers in current clinical practice. This narrative review summarizes the evidence for their use in both UC and CD and offers practical guidance for healthcare providers taking into account the limitations of biomarker interpretation. We present evidence for the future use of novel biomarkers in IBD and discuss how biomarker discovery could deliver the goal of precision medicine in IBD.

### Tests that now deserve to be more widely adopted in IBD clinical practice [^111EzfYb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic relapsing–remitting diseases of the gastrointestinal tract whose management is changing with close monitoring of disease control, but there is less adoption of prediction of adverse events due to drugs or tests to explore symptoms not directly related to inflammation. The aetiology is complex, involving the interaction of genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, microbial dysbiosis and immunological disorders. Immune dysregulation in IBD depends on the overproduction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are responsible for intestinal inflammation and constitute targets for current and future therapeutic development. Investigations that are now widely used include therapeutic drug levels and anti-drug antibodies for biologics, faecal calprotectin for monitoring tight control of disease, endoscopic investigations, transabdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance enterography for assessment of intestinal healing, small intestinal and pan-enteric video capsule endoscopy as well as other blood tests such as C-reactive protein, genotypes and metabolites for thiopurine monitoring – these are now part of comprehensive investigation and staging of IBD.

Over the years, a number of new investigations have been proposed but these have not been adopted widely at all, despite strong supporting evidence. On the other hand, tests such as faecal calprotectin have been well known since the nineties but required changing disease management strategies and strong commercial support from diagnostic assay industries and pharmaceutical companies to become widely available. While the identification of stratification markers for disease progress and drug response could improve medical decision-making, patient outcomes and costs, robust validation of these biomarkers is still necessary and some, such as anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), other microbial antibodies and mucosal healing panels, have not proved to be highly valuable despite commercial availability and therefore are infrequently used in clinical practice.

We have reviewed a small number of investigations that can stake a strong claim to be adopted in routine IBD clinical practice, but currently their usage is limited. In particular, the four tests highlighted below deserve serious consideration in most routine clinical practice involving IBD patients. We have reviewed the rationale for advocating these tests to be adopted in management of IBD patients.

### What is the role and significance of serum and stool biomarkers in the diagnosis of IBD? [^112gJepa]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Biomarkers hold promise for identifying high-risk individuals who may go on to develop IBD as well as prognosticate disease behavior. Stool markers have not been readily accepted but may be more sensitive and specific than our serum biomarkers for evaluating disease activity. Ultimately, genomic and proteomic approaches will be used to identify novel biomarkers in IBD.

### Use of laboratory markers in addition to symptoms for diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^112KpBjh]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Blood markers and fecal calprotectin are used in the diagnostic workup for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in pediatric patients. Any added diagnostic value of these laboratory markers remains unclear.

Objective

To determine whether adding laboratory markers to evaluation of signs and symptoms improves accuracy when diagnosing pediatric IBD.

Data Sources

A literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception through September 26, 2016. Studies were identified using indexing terms and free-text words related to child, target condition IBD, and diagnostic accuracy.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently selected studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of more than 1 blood marker or fecal calprotectin for IBD, confirmed by endoscopy and histopathology or clinical follow-up, in pediatric patients with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Studies that included healthy controls and/or patients with known IBD were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Individual patient data from each eligible study were requested from the authors. In addition, 2 reviewers independently assessed quality with Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2.

Mean Outcomes and Measures

Laboratory markers were added as a single test to a basic prediction model based on symptoms. Outcome measures were improvement of discrimination by adding markers as a single test and improvement of risk classification of pediatric patients by adding the best marker.

Results

Of the 16 eligible studies, authors of 8 studies (n = 1120 patients) provided their data sets. All blood markers and fecal calprotectin individually significantly improved the discrimination between pediatric patients with and those without IBD, when added to evaluation of symptoms. The best marker-fecal calprotectin-improved the area under the curve of symptoms by 0.26 (95% CI, 0.21–0.31). The second best marker-erythrocyte sedimentation rate-improved the area under the curve of symptoms by 0.16 (95% CI, 0.11–0.21). When fecal calprotectin was added to the model, the proportion of patients without IBD correctly classified as low risk of IBD increased from 33% to 91%. The proportion of patients with IBD incorrectly classified as low risk of IBD decreased from 16% to 9%. The proportion of the total number of patients assigned to the intermediate-risk category decreased from 55% to 6%.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a hospital setting, fecal calprotectin added the most diagnostic value to symptoms compared with blood markers. Adding fecal calprotectin to the diagnostic workup of pediatric patients with symptoms suggestive of IBD considerably decreased the number of patients in the group in whom challenges in clinical decision making are most prevalent.

### Biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease: a practical guide [^1174MZdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune-mediated disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract and comprises two main subtypes: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The exact cause of IBD remains unknown, but it is believed that in genetically predisposed individuals, an environmental trigger initiates an inappropriate intestinal immune response. The overall global prevalence is expected to rise to approximately 1% in the coming decades.

Currently available therapeutic agents attenuate an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevent leucocyte trafficking to the site of inflammation by inhibiting sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors and integrins. The goal of these therapies is to induce clinical and endoscopic remission, reduce the risks of complications and the need for surgical intervention, and improve the quality of life for patients. The gold standard in the assessment of IBD activity is endoscopy, usually through colonoscopy. However, this procedure is costly and invasive with associated risks to the patient. Therefore, the use of biomarkers to non-invasively assess disease activity, response to therapy and recurrence of disease has become commonplace. Biomarkers are defined by the National Institute of Health as 'a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indication of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention'.

### Disease monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease: evolving principles and possibilities [^111XSWdG]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease is a progressive and debilitating condition. Early and effective treatment using a treat-to-target approach is key to improving patient outcomes. Therefore, proactive monitoring is essential to ensure that treatment strategies are working and targets are being met. In this review we discuss the current monitoring tools available to us and how they can be used. We also discuss the importance of monitoring during key phases of the disease and propose an optimum treat-to-target monitoring strategy for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Regarding the advent of new technology, we discuss how this may improve our monitoring capabilities and how we envisage future monitoring strategies of inflammatory bowel diseases.

Worldwide incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is stable in developed countries, but rising in developing countries. Presenting symptoms of IBD can be highly variable. New imaging modalities, a greater armamentarium of therapeutic options, and a greater understanding of complication risks have changed the diagnosis and management of pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases. Effective teamwork among those who care for pediatric patients with IBD minimizes complications and maximizes desired outcomes.

### Practical guidance on the use of faecal calprotectin [^111RRtnL]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Differentiation between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional gut disorders, and the determination of mucosal disease activity in established cases of IBD remain the cornerstones of disease diagnosis and management. Non-invasive, accurate biomarkers of gut inflammation are needed due to the variability of symptoms, the inaccuracies of currently available blood markers and the cost and invasive nature of endoscopy. Numerous biomarkers have been used and/or considered with some in current use. This article reviews the current evidence base around the indications for using biomarkers and their limitations, with a particular focus on faecal calprotectin.

### Diagnosis and natural history of preclinical and early inflammatory bowel disease [^114gfjzH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Natural history of the disease

The diagnosis of IBD can be difficult because of its unspecific clinical manifestations and the absence of noninvasive diagnostic methods. As an example, iron deficiency anemia can be the only manifestation of the disease, and this might be more pronounced in CD cases limited to the small bowel, where the diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, the establishment of the final diagnosis of IBD can be delayed for months, as has been described in European reports, or up to 1–2 years in some Asian cohorts, with even longer intervals, especially in CD. We should differentiate between 2 different intervals: in the first place, there is a period between the onset of symptoms and the physician consultation, followed by the time period required for the clinical suspicion and the critical evaluation of all the results obtained from laboratory, endoscopic or radiological examinations. But, most importantly, the relevance of this observation depends on the increased risk of developing complications or requiring surgery as the time from the first symptoms of the disease to the final diagnosis elapses, which has been described across diverse geographical areas. Expert consensus has identified key aspects that may prompt an early evaluation in selected subjects with gastrointestinal symptoms in order to reduce this period of time. Unfortunately, these strategies have not been universally implemented in clinical practice.

### The utility of biomarkers in the diagnosis and therapy of inflammatory bowel disease [^111BCzpz]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Fecal and serologic biomarkers can be used in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal markers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin have been studied for their ability to identify patients with IBD, assess disease activity, and predict relapse. Antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic proteins have been used in diagnosis of IBD, to distinguish Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis, and to predict the risk of complications of CD. Tests for C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate have been used to assess inflammatory processes and predict the course of IBD progression. Levels of drug metabolites and antibodies against therapeutic agents might be measured to determine why patients do not respond to therapy and to select alternative treatments. This review addresses the potential for biomarker assays to improve treatment strategies and challenges to their use and development.

### Pathogenesis and precision medicine for predicting response in inflammatory bowel disease: advances and future directions [^116QhDmQ]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current selection and positioning of IBD therapeutics are based on broad, clinical, biochemical, radiological and endoscopic profiling. Understanding the underlying molecular drivers of IBD may inform selection of more effective therapy in the pursuit of precision medicine (figure 2). Despite recent progress, the vast majority of existing biomarkers to predict IBD treatment response have not been incorporated into clinical practice. Future technological advances in both experimental techniques, machine learning and collaborative research will help to address these deficiencies. Once accurate biomarker predictors are identified, measuring biomarkers for treatment response must be affordable and widely available to ensure equitable access to precision medicine to improve the quality of life of patients with IBD.

Diagnostic and referral strategies

Making a prompt diagnosis is key to good management of IBD, preventing malnutrition at diagnosis and allowing early therapeutic intervention. Unfortunately, there is frequently a delay of months or years in referral to specialist care, preventing the diagnostic process of endoscopy and histological confirmation. Drivers of this are varied including varied presentations, alongside inflammatory markers not always being raised and fluctuating symptoms. Family history is common and should lower the threshold for investigation.

The clinician is presented with numerous imaging options, and it can be challenging to decide which test is the best option. In this article we review the present imaging techniques available in the evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease, with emphasis on the advantages, disadvantages, and radiation burden of each test. Finally, we highlight a few common clinical scenarios and propose an imaging algorithm to approach these diagnostic challenges.

### Clinical procedures used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease: real-world evidence from a Danish nationwide population-based study [^116tH1De]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), with the two main subtypes, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterised by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation. Even though the IBDs differ in clinical profile, it is impossible to differentiate between CD and UC at the time of diagnosis for 5%–15% of the patients, and patients may then be classified as having IBD unclassified. Other gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome and infectious diarrhoea, can have presentations similar to IBDs and symptoms might be unspecific. Consequently, it could take weeks or months to establish the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment choice. Meanwhile, the disease may progress and lead to irreversible organ damage, risk of misclassification, and ineffective therapy.

According to international guidelines, recommended diagnostic tools for IBD include a clinical evaluation of the patient's medical history and a combination of endoscopic, radiological, histological and/or biochemical investigations. The diagnostic work-up is complex without a commonly accepted 'gold standard' and may vary in clinical practice. Only a few studies have investigated procedures involved in establishing an IBD diagnosis, which, however, is important to identify shortcomings and areas for potential improvement. The Danish nationwide health registers provide a unique opportunity for such a study.

This study aimed to use nationwide real-life data between 2014 and 2018 to describe how current diagnostic procedures are used in men and women of different ages to establish the diagnoses of CD and UC, respectively.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^1148KZyQ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic relapsing gastrointestinal conditions characterised by an influx of inflammatory cells to the affected gut mucosa. The mainstay of diagnosing and re-evaluating these conditions in clinical practice and research is by invasive serological, radiological, endoscopic and histological assessment. In clinical trials, disease activity is often evaluated using a combination of the above tests plus clinical indices such as the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index. These tools rely on subjective assessment of symptoms and so, often, do not correlate with mucosal inflammation or mucosal healing, which may be the preferred therapeutic end point for long-term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management. The faecal biomarkers calprotectin and lactoferrin are neutrophil derived proteins that are stable in faeces and can be detected by quantitative ELISA in small stool samples. Concentrations of both are raised in patients with gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation. They provide a unique, inexpensive, non-invasive method of testing for active inflammatory disease. They can be used to screen for IBD and as a surrogate marker of mucosal healing they are useful in monitoring the response to therapeutic intervention or surgery. They may also predict the clinical course of the disease. This clinical review aims to discuss the current evidence, limitations and potential future uses of these biomarkers in IBD.

### Diagnostic and prognostic microbial biomarkers in inflammatory bowel diseases [^111AoZg2]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The microbiome plays multifaceted roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Accordingly, the clinical challenge of patient heterogeneity in disease phenotype and response to treatment should in part be addressed by biomarkers that detect the host response to microbiota, and the levels of microbial taxa and products eliciting the host response in susceptible individuals. Molecular analysis has revealed much evidence for microbial taxonomic membership and microbial products in association with IBD, but their utility as clinical biomarkers is still in its infancy. A rich area of progress has been the development and validation of host serologic microbial biomarkers, which have achieved a distinctive position in the diagnosis and prognosis in IBD, and as a template for defining other categories of microbial biomarkers in disease state and phenotype.

Table 3
Consensus indicators about the diagnosis and evaluation of IBD.

Routine stool examination and fecal pathogen culture

IBD shares clinical symptoms with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and infectious enteritis, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and altered bowel habits. For accurate and prompt diagnosis of IBD, routine examination of stool and stool cultures is essential, especially in cases with initial UC. Several studies have shown that fecal calprotein (FC) and lactoferrin are highly sensitive for distinguishing IBD and IBS, and that the levels of FC and lactoferrin were significantly higher in patients with IBD than in those with IBS or healthy people. However, as indicators of inflammation, the levels of these markers may also be increased in infectious enteritis and colitis. The most common pathogen in enteric infections is Clostridium difficile followed by Escherichia. coli. To exclude infections, fecal pathogen culture should be obtained at the first visit. In some potential high-risk areas, it is a routine test to screen certain parasites such as schistosomes and endemic amebiasis. To improve the accuracy of diagnosis, routine examination of stool and stool culture is essential before the diagnosis of initial UC.

### Faecal calprotectin for screening of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease: diagnostic meta-analysis [^112AKemg]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Eligible studies were those that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of faecal calprotectin testing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease suspected on clinical grounds. Data collection had to be done prospectively with stool sampling (index test) before endoscopic evaluation including histopathological verification of segmental biopsies (reference standard).

Identification of studies

We searched for diagnostic studies published in Medline and Embase up to October 2009. The search strategy for Medline was ("Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex"[Mesh] OR "calprotectin"[tw]) AND ("Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"[Mesh] OR "inflammatory bowel disease"[tw] OR "inflammatory bowel diseases"[tw] OR "IBD"[tw] OR "Crohn"[tw] OR "Colitis"[tw]). For Embase we used ("calgranulin"/exp OR "calprotectin"/exp) AND ("enteritis"/exp OR "inflammatory bowel disease"/exp OR "inflammatory bowel diseases"/exp OR "ibd" OR "crohn" OR "colitis"/exp) AND [embase]/lim.

We restricted our search to studies published in English only. Duplicate articles identified in both Medline and Embase were manually deleted using Reference Manager, version 11 (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA). For further relevant studies we checked the reference lists of identified trials.

Study selection and data extraction

The first selection was carried out by one reviewer (PFvR), on the basis of the title and abstract. The full paper of each potentially eligible study was then obtained. Two reviewers (PFvR, EVdV) independently assessed eligible studies for inclusion. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The following characteristics were extracted from each selected study: age range, prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the study population (pretest probability); percentage of patients with Crohn's disease and percentage with ulcerative colitis in the group of confirmed cases with inflammatory bowel disease; reference standard; faecal calprotectin assay; cut-off value for faecal calprotectin; and data for construction of a two by two table. Authors were contacted in cases where information was missing to construct a two by two table.

### Core indicators of an evaluation and guidance system for quality of care in inflammatory bowel disease centers: a critical review [^1165yNEv]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory disorder that includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). It predominantly affects young adults and is characterized by diverse clinical manifestations, a protracted clinical course and a high incidence of complications. The common diagnostic methods for IBD include assessments of clinical history and symptoms, physical examination, laboratory assessments, imaging and endoscopy. Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and biologics have been used to treat IBD. However, due to the lack of standardized management and precision medicine, IBD impairs patients' quality of life, and imposes a great economic burden on the patient's family and society. The incidence of IBD has significantly increased in developing areas and has become a noticeable problem in clinical practice.

Europe and America have released guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD patients in recent years. In China, national guidelines for quality indicators for IBD were promulgated in 2016 and 2017, which established the foundation for an evaluation and guidance system for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD. It is acknowledged that a high quality of care promotes the remission of patients with IBD, and Calvet et al. set the first consensus on quality standards for IBD care units. In 2021, a certification program of evaluating the IBD integral care units was established in Spain, this study assessed 53 IBD care units through 53 quality indicators related to structure, process and results, and audited the certifications of these units as "advanced" or "excellence". The results showed that more than 90% of IBD units in Spain received the certification. To establish a practical evaluation system for IBD centers, in accordance with China's present situation, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality of Care Center (IBDQCC) committee, Chinese Society of IBD, and Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Chinese Medical Association assigned IBD experts and identified indicators for an evaluation and guidance system for diagnostic and therapeutic quality at IBD centers.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^115RZteF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Crohn's disease — diagnostic evaluation recommendations specify laboratory, stool, endoscopic, genetic, and serologic guidance: Initial laboratory investigation should include evaluation for inflammation, anemia, dehydration, and malnutrition. In symptomatic active CD, stool testing should be performed to include fecal pathogens, Clostridioides difficile testing, and studies identifying gut inflammation such as a fecal calprotectin. Genetic testing is not indicated to establish the diagnosis of CD, but gene variants including HLA DQA1*05, HLA-DRB1*03, nudix hydrolase 15 and thiopurine methyltransferase are clinically useful and should be measured in select patients. Routine use of serologic markers of inflammatory bowel disease to establish CD is not indicated. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsies should be performed in suspected CD, and disease distribution and severity should be documented with biopsies of uninvolved mucosa recommended to identify extent of histologic disease; photography documentation of the ileum should be included.

### Utility of faecal calprotectin in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): what cut-offs should we apply? [^115nzM2s]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are laboratory investigations which are often employed by clinicians in their determination of probability of patients having an underlying organic bowel disease as opposed to a functional disorder. Using a low CRP cut-off is reported to have improved sensitivity, but poorer specificity, which would lead clinicians to unnecessarily investigate, if used in isolation.ESR has been shown, in other studies, to offer little benefit to the evaluation process for those subjects fulfilling clinical criteria suggestive of IBS. Tibble et al reported that abnormal FC had a significantly greater OR using FC to identify IBD (p < 0.0001) compared with an elevation in CRP and ESR. Our findings support this earlier result by showing greater sensitivity and predictive ability with FC than with ESR and/or CRP to distinguish between functional and organic disorders. This in turn, aids in monitoring of active exacerbations and remission of IBD.

FC is more cost-effective than non-FC strategies in a diagnostic pathway based on a recent systematic evaluation by the Centre for Economic Based Practice 2010 data. Although any quality-adjusted life-year gains were likely to be small due to of the low prevalence of IBD and the high sensitivities of all of the tests, considerable savings could still accrue. Additionally, a recent study of 3639 patients has suggested that the estimated demand for colonoscopies is reduced by 50% with the 50 μg/g cut-off and by 67% with the 100 μg/g cut-off, equating to €1.57 million and €2.13 million, respectively.

Overall our data affirms that the use of FC is beneficial in distinguishing between functional GI conditions (IBS) and organic disease (IBD). In those with IBD, a 250 μg/g cut-off aids in determining clinical disease activity. FC testing like β natriuretic polypeptide used in the diagnosis of cardiac failure, is a useful, relatively economical test benefiting primary and secondary care. It helps to sift out those with organic pathology requiring further investigations, and in those with IBD, aids in disease monitoring, avoidance of invasive procedures and reduction of time off work. The study population was carefully chosen to allow us to validate symptoms and assess all subjects with endoscopy. Further studies are now needed to assess the use in a primary care population.

### Diagnosis and natural history of preclinical and early inflammatory bowel disease [^116TuReQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

IBD is a chronic and progressive disease with disabling complications in the long term. Early intervention with medical therapies or environmental factors, or by influencing the gut microbiota, are promising targets for disease modification trials in IBD, and especially in CD. Studies evaluating the identification of high-risk subjects and the potential biomarkers that could detect subclinical disease are already ongoing. The findings concerning the preclinical phase of IBD should be followed by prevention trials, where reducing the incidence of the disease will be the ultimate goal.

### Endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease: indications, surveillance, and use in clinical practice [^1151MoF3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Endoscopy plays an integral role in the diagnosis, management, and surveillance of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because there is no single pathognomonic test that establishes the diagnosis of IBD, endoscopy is useful in establishing the diagnosis, excluding other etiologies, distinguishing Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis, defining the patterns, extent, and activity of mucosal inflammation, and obtaining mucosal tissue for histologic evaluation. In established IBD, endoscopy helps define the extent and severity of involvement, which in turn influences medical and surgical decisions, aids in targeting medical therapies, and allows for the management of IBD-related complications. Furthermore, endoscopy plays a key role in the surveillance of patients with long-standing colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia and the development of colorectal cancer.

### Molecular discoveries alter our view of inflammatory bowel disease. A review from scientific, clinical, and laboratory perspectives [^116axd6h]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Within the past decade, knowledge of the molecular basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, has advanced owing to the explosive growth of research involving the human genome. Furthermore, a shared interest between molecular biologists and clinical researchers has contributed to an emerging understanding of IBD. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) belongs to an apoptotic regulatory family of genes and has been linked to CD. In addition, research into nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), the proteasome, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor alpha has improved our understanding of IBD. Our understanding of these molecules and other scientific discoveries offers hope for new diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents. In the future, genetic markers will predict disease susceptibility, therapeutic responsiveness, and long-term sequelae of modern therapeutics. Also on the horizon, molecular markers promise to define disease heterogeneity, thereby providing a rational basis for patient-specific therapies. The molecular discoveries that are changing our views of IBD will affect the clinician, the laboratory professional, and the patient.

### Performance of blood tests in diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in a specialist clinic [^112PnvZ3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the reliability of a panel of blood tests in screening for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Methods

The subjects were 153 children referred to a paediatric gastroenterology department with possible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Of these, 103 were found to have IBD (Crohn's disease 60, ulcerative colitis 37, indeterminate colitis 6). The 50 without IBD formed the controls. Blood tests evaluated included haemoglobin, platelet count, ESR, CRP, and albumin. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used where possible to determine optimal threshold values. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the five screening tests in combination, and a stepwise method was used to find the best test combination.

Results

The optimal screening strategy used a combination of haemoglobin and platelet count and "1 of 2 abnormal" as the criterion for positivity. This was associated with a sensitivity of 90.8% (95% CI 83.3 to 95.7%), a specificity of 80.0% (95% CI 65.7 to 89.8%), and positive and negative predictive values of 94.4% and 75.9% respectively.

Conclusions

Haemoglobin and platelet count provide a useful screening test combination for patients with suspected IBD. These tests are not completely reliable however. If clinical suspicion is high further investigations are required.

### The role and utility of faecal markers in inflammatory bowel disease [^117VUqSw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are characterized by periods of symptomatic relapse and remission. Diagnosis and assessment of inflammatory bowel disease has so far been based on clinical evaluation, serum parameters, radiology and endoscopy. Faecal markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin have emerged as new diagnostic tools to detect and monitor intestinal inflammation. This review focuses on their potential clinical applications and limitations in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

---

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^115LxpMm]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

What are the uses of faecal biomarkers in IBD?

There are three broad areas within which faecal biomarkers in IBD have been studied: diagnostic exclusion of active IBD, longitudinal monitoring of IBD and predicting the clinical course of IBD.

Diagnostic exclusion of active IBD

Abdominal pain and diarrhoea are common presenting symptoms to gastroenterology clinics. Without 'red flag' or specific localising symptoms the diagnostic spectrum is wide, from IBD and colonic cancer to functional diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients are often subjected to colonoscopy or radiological imaging. Consequently, faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin have been studied with an aim of separating those patients with inflammatory organic pathology from those with non-inflammatory functional pathology, thereby potentially avoiding the need for more invasive tests.

Faecal biomarkers are a measure of local gut inflammation rather than systemic inflammation which is not always apparent in IBD. It is not surprising therefore, that calprotectin and lactoferrin have been demonstrated as more effective in identifying disease activity than serum measurements of C-reactive peptide, leucocyte count or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

It has been demonstrated that both calprotectin and lactoferrin levels are significantly higher in patients with active IBD than in healthy controls and those with IBS. In this setting the overall sensitivity and specificity for calprotectin may be as high as 78–100% and 76–100%, respectively, with a similar sensitivity and specificity for lactoferrin of 67–91% and 90–100%, respectively. A meta-analysis of facecal calprotectin studies revealed that at a cut off point of 50 μg/g (ie, above the normal range) calprotectin has a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 81% in discriminating IBD from non-IBD diagnoses. The same paper shows that at a threshold of 100 μg/g (twice upper limit of normal) the sensitivity and specificity improve to 98% and 91%, respectively. A normal biomarker result in a patient with active symptoms is therefore very reassuring and may be enough, in the correct context where the clinical risk of malignancy is low, to avoid further colonic investigation such as radiology or colonoscopy and allow a positive diagnosis of functional diarrhoea or IBS at first clinic visit.

### Endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease: from guidelines to real life [^116GaLd4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Endoscopy has a central role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), providing crucial data for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions, treating disease-related complications, and assisting in the early detection of dysplasia and prevention of colorectal cancer in the setting of IBD. Treatment targets have significantly shifted in IBD, focusing on achieving mucosal healing, a more meaningful endpoint than clinical remission. With the emergence of novel therapies, we aim to alter the course of the disease and prevent irreversible damage to the bowel. To that end, obtaining reliable and reproducible assessments of endoscopic disease activity has become an issue of great importance. Although several guidelines include recommendations regarding endoscopic surveillance in patients with long-standing IBD, there is an open debate regarding the best examination method and the appropriate follow-up intervals. Another important issue is whether surveillance guidelines are actually implemented in real-life practice and what is the preferred surveillance method among endoscopists. Significant changes have occurred in the endoscopic world with the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and their incorporation in everyday practice. We aimed to assess the real-life application of guideline recommendations regarding endoscopy in IBD patients and to review newly emerged data which might impact these recommendations in the near future.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^117NmNr4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Q.1: In patients with suspected complicated IBD, which are the appropriate biochemical investigations that should be performed?

Statement 1.1

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD and UC is based on a set of modalities including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

Statement 1.2

In assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests including full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation) are mandatory (QoE moderate B).

Statement 1.3

In case of a suspected IBD flare, infectious causes should be ruled out, especially Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus (QoE low C).

Recommendation

We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis disease activity in the urgent clinical situation by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzymes level; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level, when it is possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by performing blood-, stool cultures, and toxin test for Clostridium difficile (strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence 1B).

Summary of evidence and discussion

In assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain in the emergency room, the main laboratory tests requested are full blood count (20.1%), electrolytes (19.1%), cardiac enzymes (19.0%), and liver function tests (11.5%).

In differentiating the cause underlying acute abdominal pain, the diagnostic accuracy values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC) can be elevated.

IBD disease activity will usually impact laboratory tests results with anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and increased inflammatory markers. In addition, therapies may cause abnormalities in liver enzymes, leukocytes, and kidney function. Consequently, for patients with IBD admitted to the emergency room for evaluation, laboratory tests should always include full blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and lipase.

### Faecal calprotectin as a diagnostic marker of inflammatory bowel disease in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms: meta-analysis [^1142bLzg]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy is the standard medical procedure to identify inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Noninvasive measurement of faecal calprotectin concentration may replace colonoscopy in this indication. The study aimed to assess efficacy of faecal calprotectin as a diagnostic marker of IBD in patients with symptoms suggestive of such diagnosis. Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies was performed. Cochrane, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched until December 2018. Inclusion criteria comprised experimental and observational studies, adults with gastrointestinal symptoms, calprotectin as index and colonoscopy as reference test, presence of data on/enabling the calculation of diagnostic accuracy parameters. For each study, sensitivity and specificity of faecal calprotectin were analysed as bivariate data. Nineteen studies were identified. The total number of patients was 5032. Calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.882 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.827–0.921] and 0.799 (95% CI, 0.693–0.875), respectively. Following faecal calprotectin incorporation in the diagnostic work-up of 100 people with suspected IBD, 18 non-IBD patients will have a colonoscopy performed and one patient with the disease will not be referred for this examination. Faecal calprotectin concentration measurement is a useful screening test to rule out IBD, at the same time reducing the need for colonoscopy by 66.7%.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^114tQKFG]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) are debilitating chronic relapsing inflammatory conditions for which there is no ideal treatment. There are a growing number of immunological treatments for both diseases, but these carry a risk of side effects and are costly. Consequently, patients must be carefully assessed and counselled about safe and appropriate use of these drugs.

Crohn's disease is often the more clinically challenging of the two conditions to manage. The changing phenotype of the condition often necessitates repeated radiological or endoscopic investigation to evaluate disease activity. These tests are invasive, often uncomfortable, pose risk of short term complications and long-term side effects to the patient, are time consuming and costly.

Historically clinical practice and research trials have relied upon interpretation of symptom activity to determine treatment success in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, over the past 10 years the concept of endoscopic 'mucosal healing' has emerged as a desirable end point of treatment. This suggests that the traditional methods of quantifying clinical activity such as the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (UCAI), which predominantly rely on a subjective assessment of symptom severity, may need to be revised or replaced by more objective measurements of mucosal disease activity.

### Faecal calprotectin for screening of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease: diagnostic meta-analysis [^111apTMc]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is on the increase in both adults and children. The disorder includes two major forms of chronic intestinal inflammation: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Suspicion is raised in patients with persistent (≥ 4 weeks) or recurrent (≥ 2 episodes in six months) abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Additionally, rectal bleeding, weight loss, or anaemia increase the probability of the condition. Pathognomonic signs or symptoms do not exist. Endoscopic evaluation with histopathological sampling are generally considered indispensable in the investigation of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease. Many patients consider endoscopy and the required bowel preparation to be uncomfortable. In a relatively large proportion of people with suspected inflammatory bowel disease the results of endoscopy will be negative. A third of adults with bleeding related symptoms have no abnormalities on endoscopy, and this proportion increases to half with non-bleeding symptoms such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Identification of low risk patients would reduce the number of unnecessary invasive endoscopic procedures. Conversely, doctors would like to be able to identify those with a sufficiently high likelihood of inflammatory bowel disease to justify urgency for endoscopy.

Use of a simple, non-invasive, and cheap screening test to make a presumptive diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease would help to reach these goals. Determination of calprotectin levels in stools could be a good screening method. Calprotectin is a major protein found in the cytosol of inflammatory cells. The protein is stable in stool samples for up to seven days at room temperature and one sample of less than 5 g is sufficient for a reliable measurement. These qualities allow for stool sample collection at home and potential delays in transport to the laboratory.

Since 2000, faecal calprotectin has been evaluated in numerous diagnostic studies in both adult and paediatric populations. Many of these studies included healthy people on one side of the patient spectrum and patients with known inflammatory bowel disease on the other. Both extremes give cause to overestimation of diagnostic accuracy relative to the practical situation, where screening is necessary because it is difficult to clinically distinguish between those who do and those who do not need urgent endoscopy. The doctor is then left with little guidance about the usefulness of faecal calprotectin as a screening test. We carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate whether adding faecal calprotectin testing to the investigation of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease reduced the number of unnecessary endoscopies.

### Diagnostic accuracy of bowel ultrasonography in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116w9zyw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD), is known to cause recurring episodes of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, significantly impacting the quality of life of affected individuals. Along with endoscopic and histological healing, achieving and maintaining clinical remission is critical for the effective management of IBD.

Regular monitoring of IBD patients is necessary to maintain symptom stability and proactively prevent disease flares. This involves a combination of clinical symptom assessment, measurement of fecal calprotectin and/or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, and periodic colonoscopy exams. In recent years, we have seen emerging data on the use of bedside bowel ultrasound (BUS) in assessing disease activity in patients with IBD. Office-based BUS seems to hold promise as a noninvasive, convenient, and cost-effective method of monitoring disease activity.

Changes in bowel wall thickness are used as a marker of inflammation in BUS, and complications such as abscesses or strictures can also be identified. Furthermore, BUS allows for real-time evaluation, making it a useful tool for guiding treatment decisions and monitoring responses to therapy. However, despite its potential as a noninvasive tool for evaluating inflammation in patients with IBD, the diagnostic accuracy of BUS has not been extensively validated by meta-analysis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the pooled diagnostic accuracy of BUS in patients with IBD.

### Novel imaging approaches in inflammatory bowel diseases [^11127Etb]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic autoimmune conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, mainly grouped into ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Traditionally, symptoms have been used to guide IBD management, but this approach is fatally flawed, as symptoms don't correlate with disease activity and often fail to predict disease complications, especially with Crohn's disease. Hence, there is increasing recognition of the need for treatment algorithms based on objective measures of bowel inflammation. In this review, we will focus on advancements in the endoscopic and radiological imaging armamentarium that allow detailed assessments from intestinal mucosa to mesentery.

5.5.1.1 Faecal calprotectin in the assessment of disease activity in known IBD

Statement 112. We suggest that, in IBD patients where it is unclear if symptoms are due to ongoing inflammation or other non-inflammatory causes (such as bile acid malabsorption, functional bowel disorder or short bowel), faecal calprotectin measurement may be used to provide evidence of mucosal inflammation (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Faecal calprotectin is a useful surrogate marker of inflammatory activity in IBD. It correlates well with endoscopic inflammation in UCand in Crohn's disease. If it is unclear whether new symptoms represent a relapse or other causes, particularly in Crohn's disease, then calprotectin is useful to confirm active inflammation and can be a non-invasive alternative to flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. If relapsing disease is clinically obvious, then measurement is not necessary.

A recent meta-analysis including data for 2822 IBD patients and 298 controls found that a calprotectin cut-off of 50 µg/g had the best sensitivity (90.6%) to detect endoscopically active disease, with specificity performing best (78.2%) at levels > 100 µg/g. A separate meta-analysis has shown that a threshold of 250 µg/g provides better specificity of 82% than thresholds of 100 µg/g and 50 µg/g (specificity of 66% and 60%, respectively) in differentiating active IBD from remission. However, a faecal calprotectin of 250 µg/g had a relatively lower sensitivity of 80% compared with a sensitivity of 84% and 92% at cut-offs of 100 µg/g and 50 µg/g, respectively.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^112R8rog]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients — initial evaluation and differential: When elderly persons present with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and weight loss, providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for IBD, but compared with persons younger than 40 years those older than 60 years are more likely to have mimics including colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced pathology, radiation enteritis or colitis, or microscopic colitis. The first diagnostic steps should include laboratory investigations that include a complete blood count and serum albumin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels; liver enzymes and urea and creatinine levels serve to assess comorbidities and provide a baseline for toxicity monitoring. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile in all new presentations of diarrhea, regardless of antibiotic use history, and selective testing of stool for culture and ova and parasites may be appropriate. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography is appropriate in elderly persons with acute symptoms, especially when abdominal pain is prominent, and colonoscopy with histologic confirmation remains a cornerstone of diagnosis.

### Clinical utility of fecal biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease [^114x5dAG]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel diseases rely on clinical, endoscopic, and radiologic parameters. Inflammatory biomarkers have been investigated as a surrogate marker for endoscopic diagnosis of inflammatory activity. Fecal inflammatory biomarkers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin are direct products of bowel inflammation and provide an accurate and noninvasive diagnostic and monitoring modality for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This report contains an overview of the currently existing literature pertaining to clinical implications of fecal biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Pathology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): variability with time and treatment [^112SKNza]. Colorectal Disease (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of chronic idiopathic IBD and the differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be made in most cases on cumulative clinical, radiological, endoscopical, biochemical and pathological evidence. Diagnostic difficulties can however, occur in fulminant colitis, in early onset disease and in long-standing disease. The microscopic evaluation of disease activity is based on the presence of active inflammation. Effective medical treatment has however, an influence upon the morphology and the evolution of the lesions and hence can affect the diagnostic features and the microscopic features used for the assessment of disease activity. A literature review was performed on clinical drug trials in IBD and the effect of the drugs upon the microscopic features. Several studies have shown that the diagnostic microscopic features and the features characteristic for disease activity vary with time and treatment. For an adequate analysis of biopsy samples of patients with IBD the pathologist should be aware of the duration of the symptoms and the type of treatment given to the patient.

### Update on current applications of proteomic in the study of inflammatory bowel disease [^1128YqS4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are relapsing and remitting chronic disorders. So far, endoscopy is the gold standard for their diagnosis, but less invasive diagnostic biomarkers are needed. Many authors have developed techniques to individuate biomarkers such as genetic testing factor or proteins in biological samples such as serum, plasma, and cellular subpopulations. A protein fingerprint pattern, patient-unique, specific for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and potentially able to predict the future patterns of disease and to help in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis is of increasing interest among researchers. Nowadays, a proteomic approach may be used in the identification of major alterations of proteins in IBD, but there is still a lack in the identification of a panel of biomarkers among a significant number of patients in large clinical trials. In this review, we analyze and report the current knowledge in proteomic application and strategies in the study of IBD.

### Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: how to limit risk and maximize benefit [^115a7fm7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) requires repeat diagnostic imaging for monitoring of disease activity. Recent evidence has suggested that patients with IBD are at increased risk of radiation exposure from repeat imaging. The aim of this article was to highlight risks associated with increasing radiation exposure and identify alternatives to minimize exposure. The increasing use of computed tomography (CT) in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has brought additional benefits to guiding management through non-invasive measures. However, the massive increase in use of CT scans poses a risk of exposing patients with IBD to high levels of diagnostic medical radiation. High levels of diagnostic medical radiation are associated with an increased risk of malignancy in several studies. Numerous studies have identified particular risk factors in IBD associated with high levels of diagnostic medical radiation which are also associated with a more severe disease course. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance enterography, ultrasound, small bowel follow through, and capsule endoscopy are alternatives to CT scans as they do not utilize radiation. Gastroenterologists managing patients with IBD, particularly Crohn's disease, should be aware of the increased risk of high cumulative doses of radiation exposure, particularly from CT scanning. Alternative forms of imaging should be carefully considered when evaluating patients, in particularly those with identifiable risk factors for an aggressive disease course.

Conclusion

Histological assessment is an important component in the management of IBD. This consensus will help gastroenterologists and pathologists unify practices related to tissue acquisition, processing, histological descriptions and the use of histological indices, thereby standardising IBD care across the Asia Pacific region. This harmonisation may foster interdisciplinary research and enable cross-national collaborations. Incorporating AI into histological evaluation is potentially beneficial in streamlining diagnostic workflows by quickly identifying key histological features and enhancing precision care for patients with IBD.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^1153AAfx]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

What cautions and limitations are there of using faecal biomarkers?

It is important to remember that despite all of this promising data, faecal biomarker quantification as a screening test for IBD cannot fully replace conventional endoscopy and radiology. IBD remains a histological diagnosis requiring intestinal biopsies, so a positive calprotectin or lactoferrin will require further tests not only to confirm or refute a diagnosis of IBD, but also to exclude other causes of raised biomarkers including malignancy, polyps, viral or bacterial gastroenteritis, NSAID enteropathy, untreated coeliac disease or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Therefore the use of faecal biomarkers should be restricted to situations where the result along with clinical judgement informs a decision about treatment, allows avoidance of invasive tests, or where invasive tests have not provided a satisfactory conclusion — for example, a normal colonoscopy but clinical suspicion of small bowel inflammation.

It is also necessary to appreciate that inflammation is only one component of IBD and it is only with regard to this that faecal biomarkers are of clinical use. Symptomatic patients with IBD who have normal biomarkers should not simply be labelled as having IBS without further consideration. Patients may have symptoms due to non-inflammatory mechanical disease such as bile salt malabsorption, fibrotic strictures or adhesions and these are likely to be best treated by identifying the correct problem and giving specific treatment.

Furthermore, symptoms remain the most powerful mediators of patient behaviour and decision making. As such the greatest challenge to incorporating faecal biomarkers into management pathways may be when there is disparity between how a patient feels and what faecal biomarkers inform us regarding their current inflammatory activity. For instance, it may be very difficult trying to encourage a patient with no symptoms and a positive faecal biomarker that they should begin powerful immunosuppressant treatment that poses risk of side effect.

4 Crohn's disease

4.1 Diagnosis, classification and assessment

Crohn's disease is a complex chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal condition with variable age of onset, disease location and behaviour. There is no single unifying definition of Crohn's disease and a combination of investigative modalities is often needed to confirm the diagnosis. The most widely accepted framework for making a diagnosis dates back nearly 30 years. Factors include an appropriate clinical history and examination, ileocolonoscopy, small bowel imaging, blood tests and histology. Mucosal biopsies from endoscopic procedures or surgical resection specimens show focal or patchy (rather than diffuse) inflammation and/or crypt distortion. Discontinuous segments of disease ('skip lesions'), ileal involvement and granulomatous inflammation are more suggestive of Crohn's disease, as is a tendency for inflammation to be worse in the proximal colon.

Distinguishing between Crohn's disease and UC can sometimes be complicated; partially-treated UC can demonstrate patches of inflammation, backwash ileitis occurs in UC, and granulomas only occur in about half of Crohn's disease patients. Cryptolytic granulomas can occur in UC, diverticular inflammation and all forms of colitis and are very non-specific. Pathologists find it easier to distinguish between IBD and non-IBD than they do to separate Crohn's from UC, and the diagnosis is helped greatly by discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting with clinicians and pathologist present. Studies have shown about 3% of UC patients will be reclassified as Crohn's colitis, and conversely a small number (0.6–3%) will be reclassified to UC after an initial diagnosis of Crohn's disease. There is a separate cohort who can be neither assigned as Crohn's disease or UC, so are labelled as IBD unclassified.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^115g7h4E]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions and the future for faecal biomarkers in IBD

The outlook for faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in clinical practice appears promising.

Potentially in the future faecal biomarker measurement will be standard prior to first gastrointestinal outpatient clinic visit for those with abdominal pain or diarrhoea. This may allow faster triage and assessment of patients and perhaps the avoidance of unnecessary investigation in those with functional diarrhoea or IBS.

As surrogate markers of mucosal healing in IBD, calprotectin and lactoferrin may allow objective mapping of an individual patient response to treatment and quantify the likelihood of future relapse. If these tests can be used to demonstrate an adequate response to biological therapy, they may aid decisions regarding dose escalation, shortening of dosage interval, switching to an alternative agent or ultimately withdrawal of unnecessary immunosuppression for those in sustained deep remission. Equally future trials may tell us whether consistent suppression or elevation of calprotectin and lactoferrin convey prognostic significance in terms of hospitalisation, the need for surgery and an effect on quality of life.

In summary, faecal biomarkers will never fully replace colonoscopy and radiology which are necessary to obtain tissue samples and investigate the complications of IBD. However, in a society where patient satisfaction, risk minimisation, cost reduction and hospitalisation avoidance are a priority, these non-invasive, inexpensive, reproducible and clinically significant measurements are likely to have a greater role in our future diagnostic and therapeutic pathways.

Key points

▶ Quantification of the faecal biomarkers calprotectin and lactoferrin can provide a non-invasive measure of intestinal inflammation.
▶ The clinical use of faecal biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease includes screening for active mucosal inflammation, longitudinal disease monitoring and predicting the risk of relapse.
▶ In the correct clinical context, faecal biomarkers may avoid the need for invasive radiological or endoscopic investigation and inform treatment decisions.

### Emerging concepts in non-invasive monitoring of Crohn's disease [^1148YJzX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

A number of different tests may be required to diagnose Crohn's disease (CD). Currently endoscopy-based evaluation is the most important diagnostic tool. With an increasing number of patients with clinical symptoms mimicking CD, the detailed diagnostic evaluation is critical to proper management and prognosis in patient follow up. The diagnosis of CD still relies on clinical experience and diagnostic tools such as microbiological and biochemical testing. Advanced gastrointestinal imaging, that is, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI) are also invaluable diagnostic tools. In the years to come, we envisage a single surrogate biomarker as impossible to replace endoscopic mucosal assessment in the diagnosis of CD.

In contrast, the new biomarkers could be utilized in CD monitoring and could guide physicians in differential diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this review, we focus on emerging biomarkers that may become useful in the differential diagnosis of IBD and disease monitoring. The genetic and serologic immune markers currently lack clinical accuracy, and their detailed description is beyond the scope of this review, as has been discussed elsewhere. Novel diagnostic research tools, for example, metabolomics, are also briefly discussed.

Traditional management of CD has been closely related to monitoring of clinical symptoms [e.g. using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) or the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ)], supplemented by endoscopic assessment tools [e.g. the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS), the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) or the Rutgeerts Score (RS)] for postoperative recurrence to assess deep mucosal healing, and the recently developed Lehman's score. However, these disease-activity-monitoring tools have several drawbacks and limitations. For instance, clinical scores are mostly subjective, and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may confound the report of IBD patients without active bowel inflammation. Furthermore, endoscopic scores are poorly reproducible, highly dependent on the endoscopist's experience and are of course based on invasive procedures. Therefore, all of the visual scoring systems available in clinical practice so far have limitations.

### Chronic inflammatory diseases of the bowel: diagnosis and follow-up [^117HX5T3]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Approximately one fourth of cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) occur during childhood and children are more prone than their adult counterparts to have severe disease at presentation. To investigate these diseases MR imaging is no longer an emerging tool. Numerous reviews and articles have been published on this topic underlying the advances of imaging but also the complexity and the financial impact on management of such diseases. In children it seems reasonable to consider US as the first imaging examination to perform, especially when the diagnosis of IBD is unknown. However, we believe that recent and future technical progress, especially the ability of MR to display reproducible data, and the need for gold standard evaluation of new medical therapies will increase the role of MR enterography.

### The role of new inflammatory indices in the prediction of endoscopic and histological activity in inflammatory bowel disease patients [^117K3ajh]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The identification of numerous potential biomarkers has improved the management of IBDs. Biomarkers are useful for diagnosis, assessment of disease activity, and prediction of response to therapy.

European Crohn´s and Colitis Organisation-European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology guidelines indicate fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as useful biomarkers in the management of IBD.

The utility of FC monitoring in patients with quiescent disease was evaluated in a recently published systematic review, in particular, two elevated values consecutively of FC are associated with disease relapse (53–83%) in the subsequent 2–3 months. In a recent meta-analysis, FC in diagnosing active disease, both in CD and UC, showed a pooled sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 75%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. The subgroup analysis revealed that FC performed better in UC than in CD in assessing endoscopic activity (pooled sensitivity 87.3% vs. 82.4%, specificity 77.1% vs. 72.1%, and AUC 0.91 vs. 0.84). Currently, there is no agreement on the ideal cutoff point for FC for disease monitoring. In clinical trials where the response to a new treatment is monitored, a low cutoff point (e.g. 100 μg/g) is frequently used, while in real-life studies, a higher cutoff point is utilized (e.g. 250 μg/g).

Serum CRP is an acute-phase reactant that has been considered for many years as a general indicator of inflammation. The CRP is a noninvasive biomarker nonspecific for gut inflammation. It can be normal in up to 30% of patients despite an active disease with a suboptimal correlation between activity index and CRP levels in both CD and UC. In a meta-analysis that compared its diagnostic accuracy, CRP correlated with endoscopy in patients with symptomatic IBD; a CRP concentration of ≥ 5 mg/L appeared to have a high specificity for detecting endoscopic disease activity with an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68–0.76). However, the sensitivity was very poor, and a negative CRP value does not exclude the presence of a relapsing disease. Repeated CRP measurements in early postoperative recurrence of CD or in follow-up of small bowel CD are less useful against repeated FC measurements.

### Outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and acute gastrointestinal symptoms who test indeterminate for… [^114daduY]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

For IBD patients who test NAAT(+)/EIA(-) for C. difficile, clinicians face the issue of whether to prescribe immunosuppressive therapy alone, or start antimicrobial therapy for CDI in conjunction with immunosuppressants. This latter strategy may seem reasonable, especially since delaying therapy of CDI can have catastrophic consequences for patients. However, the unnecessary use of antibiotic treatment can be detrimental, disrupting the structure and function of the gut microbiome and potentially increasing the risk of acquiring other pathogens, creating antibiotic resistance, or even worsening their IBD.

Further randomized trials comparing outcomes based on treatment of patients who test NAAT(+)/EIA(-) are warranted. However, until more evidence is available, clinicians need to evaluate patients on a case-by-case basis in order to decide who is more likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy.

In conclusion, in our cohort, treatment for CDI in IBD patients with NAAT(+)/EIA(-) testing did not improve outcomes, or at least was underpowered to detect such a conclusion. There may be a role for administration of antibiotics for IBD patients who test indeterminate on C. difficile testing. However, further study will be needed.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) have similar presentations
Patients with IBD are not only more susceptible to CDI compared to the general population, but may also have worse outcomes
The current preferred laboratory test for CDI is the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for polymerase chain reaction, followed by reflex toxin enzyme immunoassay (EIA) if NAAT is positive
EIA testing has relatively low sensitivity, making it difficult to decide whether to treat for CDI in special cases such as IBD

What the new findings are:

At our institution, patients with IBD were likely to receive antibiotic treatment for CDI if NAAT was positive, even when EIA was negative
IBD patients with positive NAAT as well as positive EIA were more likely to have elevated white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels compared to those for whom the EIA was negative
Antibiotic treatment for IBD patients who had positive NAAT but negative EIA did not appear to improve outcomes

For thiopurines, "In adult patients with IBD being started on thiopurines, the AGA suggests routine TPMT testing (enzymatic activity or genotype) to guide thiopurine dosing", and "Routine laboratory monitoring, including CBC, should be performed, regardless of TPMT testing results". In adults treated with thiopurines who have active IBD or suspected thiopurine toxicity, "the AGA suggests reactive thiopurine metabolite monitoring to guide treatment changes"; when metabolites are measured in active IBD-related symptoms, "we suggest a target 6-thioguanine (6-TGN) cutoff between 230–450 pmol/8 × 10^8 RBCs when used as monotherapy; optimal 6-TGN cutoff when thiopurines are used in combination with anti-TNF agents is uncertain". In adult patients with quiescent IBD treated with thiopurines, "the AGA suggests against routine thiopurine metabolite monitoring".

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^113bSGbB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Anemia represents one of the most frequent complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The etiology of anemia in IBD patients can be multifactorial, often involving a combination of iron deficiency (ID) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Although current guidelines recommend screening for and treatment of anemia in IBD patients, current observational data suggest that it still remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Besides basic laboratory parameters (e.g. mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, etc.), the concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and novel parameters such as the sTfR/log ferritin index can guide the challenging task of differentiating between ID and ACD. Once identified, causes of anemia should be treated accordingly. This review summarizes our current understanding of anemia in IBD patients, including the underlying pathology, diagnostic approaches and appropriate anemia treatment regimens.

### Serological antibodies in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review [^111CkpBQ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is traditionally based on a combination of clinical, endoscopic, histological, and radiological criteria. However, further testing is needed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty and in predicting disease course. This systematic review focuses on the potential for 10 serological antibodies to fill these roles: pANCA, ASCA, anti-OmpC, anti-CBir1, anti-I2, ALCA, ACCA, AMCA, anti-L, and anti-C. We discuss their prevalence in IBD and health; their role in disease diagnosis and risk stratification; their stability over time; their presence in unaffected relatives; their association with genetic variants; and differences across ethnic groups. Serological antibodies have some role in primary diagnosis and in differentiating between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In indeterminate colitis, preoperative measurement of serological antibodies can help to predict the likelihood of complications among patients undergoing pouch surgery. The combined presence and magnitude of a large panel of antibodies appear to be of value in predicting disease progression. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antibody testing to predict responses to treatment or surgery in patients with IBD.

### C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, and stool lactoferrin for detection of endoscopic activity in symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112bNtqB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Persistent disease activity is associated with a poor prognosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, monitoring of patients with intent to suppress subclinical inflammation has emerged as a treatment concept. As endoscopic monitoring is invasive and resource intensive, identification of valid markers of disease activity is a priority. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin (FC), and stool lactoferrin (SL) for assessment of endoscopically defined disease activity in IBD.

Methods

Databases were searched from inception to November 6, 2014 for relevant cohort and case-control studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, FC, or SL and used endoscopy as a gold standard in patients with symptoms consistent with active IBD. Sensitivities and specificities were pooled to generate operating property estimates for each test using a bivariate diagnostic meta-analysis.

Results

Nineteen studies (n = 2499 patients) were eligible. The pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates for CRP, FC, and SL were 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34–0.64) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.72–0.96), 0.88 (95% CI 0.84–0.90) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.66–0.79), and 0.82 (95% CI 0.73–0.88) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.62–0.89), respectively. FC was more sensitive than CRP in both diseases and was more sensitive in ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease.

Conclusions

Although CRP, FC, and SL are useful biomarkers, their value in managing individual patients must be considered in specific clinical contexts.

### Diagnosis of colitis: making the initial diagnosis [^115Bca9e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with colitis of recent onset is a relatively common clinical challenge. The main considerations are infectious colitides, idiopathic IBD, ie, ulcerative and Crohn's colitis, and colonic ischemia. An initial risk assessment on the basis of such factors as concurrent symptoms in contacts, travel history, medications, and human immunodeficiency virus risk factors should be followed by a thorough clinical history, physical examination, stool studies, blood tests, and, in selected cases, endoscopic examination and serologic tests. Biopsies can be decisive in distinguishing among the different types of acute colitis and might help identify specific etiologies. The diagnostic yield of biopsies is maximized by appropriate sampling of the colonic mucosa and by sharing the clinical and endoscopic findings with the pathologist, eg, via a copy of the endoscopy report.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114khZJE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — laboratory markers in suspected disease: Anemia and an elevated platelet count are the most common changes seen in the complete blood count; C-reactive protein is elevated in a subset of patients with a short half-life of 19 hours, making CRP a useful marker to detect and monitor inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be useful in an individual patient, but it is not predictive of IBD and does not discriminate patients with IBD from those with IBS in healthy controls; up to 40% of patients with IBD with mild inflammation may have a normal CRP and ESR, limiting the usefulness of these markers in monitoring some patients.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the evaluation and management for patients with very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease [^113kmo4P]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) — genetic sequencing workflow emphasizes targeted testing first, use of whole exome sequencing (WES) when panels are negative or phenotypes are atypical, careful research-to-clinical validation, and reserving whole genome sequencing (WGS) for persistent high-suspicion cases; variant interpretation should incorporate trio analysis and population frequency. Targeted evaluation "should be performed first in cases of infantile onset IBD, when the phenotype is consistent with a known defect, history of consanguinity, and abnormal immunology studies", and "The current commercially available VEO-IBD-targeted panels have some differences in their analytical pipeline and in the number of genes that are sequenced". "Currently, WES is most often performed in the setting of a negative targeted panel; however, there are select cases in which WES may be indicated instead of a targeted panel", and when used under research protocols "any finding made in the research setting must then be validated in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory". Regarding WGS, "At this time, WGS should be reserved for cases in which WES is negative, yet there remains a high suspicion of a monogenic defect", and for VUS findings "a variant that has not been previously validated as causal for VEO-IBD… may be detected on WES or WGS and further investigation is necessary", where "trio analysis, including both parents whenever possible, will provide the most valuable information", and "the potential pathogenicity and frequency of the variant in the healthy population… must be considered".

### Metabolomics facilitate the personalized management in inflammatory bowel disease [^1124SLMw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic recurrent inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, is composed of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). These two disorders differ in many respects. CD is characterized by dispersed lesions and transmural inflammation that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, with the most frequent symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, fistulae, obstruction, and/or perianal lesions. In UC, the lesions are continuous and limited to the mucosal layer of the colon and rectum, which can most commonly lead to bloody diarrhea and rectal bleeding.

The prevalence of IBD is higher in developed countries than developing countries. Nevertheless, the prevalence and incidence of IBD are increasing globally, especially in newly industrialized countries. Therefore, the disease burden will become ever higher in both developed and developing countries. To reduce the disease burden, personalized management, including regular monitoring of disease activity, matching the patients with the proper treatment, and predicting prognosis, is important. Previous studies have referred to a variety of serological and fecal biomarkers, such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6, fecal calprotectin, and lactoferrin, which serve as surrogate markers for the diagnosis and management of IBD. However, these available biomarkers could only assist with the activity monitoring and prognosis of IBD to some extent, instead of being considered as a gold standard in the personalized management of IBD. Additional studies or techniques are necessary to discover potential and effective biomarkers to guide the management of IBD.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the laboratory evaluation of functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in adults (IBS-D) [^112URHZp]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA guideline — screening for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C‑reactive protein (CRP): "Recommendation 2: In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the AGA suggests against the use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C‑reactive protein to screen for IBD. Conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence". Evidence summary shows that for CRP, "using a value of 5–6 mg/L as a threshold", pooled sensitivity was "0.73 (95% CI, 0.64–0.80)" and pooled specificity was "0.78 (95% CI, 0.58–0.91)", whereas ESR thresholds "10–15 mm/h… resulted in lower estimates of diagnostic accuracy for IBD". A pragmatic note states that "if testing for fecal lactoferrin or calprotectin are either not available or not covered by insurance, the use of CRP might be considered to be a reasonable option to screen for IBD".

Fecal inflammatory markers — diagnostic thresholds and accuracy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Use of a higher fecal calprotectin threshold value "(100–164 μg/g) is associated with a markedly decreased sensitivity without a marked increase in specificity". For fecal lactoferrin, "using a threshold value from 7.25 μg/g, the pooled sensitivity for IBD was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73–0.84) and the pooled specificity was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63–0.99)". The evidence base for lactoferrin was judged low quality due to "risk of bias, significant heterogeneity, and statistical imprecision", and concerns are "compounded by the small likelihood that a positive test would initiate further confirmatory evaluation… compared to the 10% likelihood that persons without IBD might be needlessly exposed to further confirmatory testing".

### The role of biomarkers in clinical trials of inflammatory bowel disease [^116UTMWX]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical trials require valid outcome measures to assess the therapeutic benefit of investigational agents. Recently, regulatory authorities have mandated the use of patient-reported outcomes in combination with an objective measure of disease activity as primary outcome measures in inflammatory bowel disease trials. Endoscopy has commonly fulfilled the latter role; however, due to the costs and complexity of these assessments, interest has emerged in the use of noninvasive biomarkers. The role of C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin in clinical research is discussed.

### Inflammatory bowel disease: recent developments [^112dFNA6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been a significant increase in the incidence and prevalence of paediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) over the last 25 years, alongside significant progress in the tools for investigation and management. Paediatric-onset IBD constitutes most chronic patients under the care of paediatric gastroenterologists. In the UK, many patients requiring close monitoring and shared care with colleagues in district hospitals. IBD, traditionally separated into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is increasingly recognised and a complex 'continuum' disorder with a similarly complex aetiology including genetic, environmental and microbial factors. Despite this, the treatment remains largely empirical. The complexity of disease, coupled with an evolving range of investigations, more therapeutic options and improving disease prediction tools, requires contemporary input to ensure the best long-term outcomes for patients. In this review, we highlight recent clinical developments in paediatric IBD, relevant to all paediatricians, and focus on current investigative and therapeutic advances in practice.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects multiple organ systems outside of the gastrointestinal tract. The clinician treating patients with IBD should be acutely aware of the diagnosis and treatment of extraintestinal manifestations in order to decrease morbidity. The management can be difficult and often times requires a multidisciplinary approach. Future research investigating the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment is needed to further the care of these patients.

### Asia pacific association of gastroenterology consensus statements on histopathological evaluation of inflammatory bowel diseases [^114uuQV4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Following a literature review, 37 statements were developed covering the domains of histology of UC and CD, pathology reporting, histological indices for measuring disease activity, endoscopic biopsy methods and tissue processing, biopsy indications, defining mucosal healing, pathologist team membership and role of AI (Table 1 and Table S3). There was uncertainty on escalating treatment when histological remission is not achieved, preventing consensus on this statement. Overall, there was strong support for adopting histology in IBD evaluation in the Asia Pacific region and agreement on using AI to improve throughput and accuracy.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^112g1wMy]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA guideline — scope, biomarkers evaluated, and knowledge gaps in UC management: The guideline panel made 7 conditional recommendations and focused on serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin as biomarkers of disease activity in established UC with symptomatic remission or active symptoms. The panel identified the use of a biomarker-based monitoring strategy over an endoscopy-based monitoring strategy as a knowledge gap. In conclusions, the guideline states that in patients with UC, noninvasive biomarkers, including fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and serum CRP can inform disease monitoring and management.

### Surrogate fecal biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease: rivals or complementary tools of fecal calprotectin? [^114ZxoNe]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current noninvasive methods for assessing intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain unsatisfactory. Along with C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin (FC) is the standard test for assessing IBD activity, even though its specificity and accuracy are not optimal and it lacks a validated cutoff. Over the past few decades, several fecal markers released from intestinal inflammatory cells have been investigated in IBD; they are the subject of this systematic review.

Methods

A systematic electronic search of the English literature up to April 2017 was performed using Medline and the Cochrane Library. Only papers written in English that analyzed fecal biomarkers in IBD were included. In vitro studies, animal studies, studies on blood/serum samples, and studies analyzing FC or fecal lactoferrin alone were excluded.

Results

Out of 1023 citations, 125 eligible studies were identified. Data were grouped according to each fecal marker including S100A12, high-mobility group box 1, neopterin, polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase, fecal hemoglobin, alpha1-antitrypsin, human neutrophil peptides, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, chitinase 3-like-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, lysozyme, M2-pyruvate kinase, myeloperoxidase, fecal eosinophil proteins, human beta-defensin-2, and beta-glucuronidase. Some of these markers showed a high sensitivity and specificity and correlated with disease activity, response to therapy, and mucosal healing. Furthermore, they showed a potential utility in the prediction of clinical relapse.

Conclusions

Several fecal biomarkers have the potential to become useful tools complementing FC in IBD diagnosis and monitoring. However, wide variability in their accuracy in assessment of intestinal inflammation suggests the need for further studies.

Pediatric gastroenterology training — IBD core competencies should include that trainees understand the epidemiology, natural history, and complications of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), recognize typical and atypical gastrointestinal symptoms including extraintestinal presentations, and have a complete understanding of diagnostic criteria that distinguish the various types of IBD. Trainees must be familiar with the comprehensive evaluation of suspected or known IBD and the indications and potential complications of required tests, with components including laboratory studies (complete blood count, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and albumin, and stool studies for pathogens, white blood cells, and calprotectin or lactoferrin), endoscopic evaluation including EGD and colonoscopy, bowel imaging, small bowel series, CT scan, MRI, tagged white blood cell scans, and capsule endoscopy. Trainees should understand the treatment of both newly diagnosed and existing patients with IBD, including the use of nutritional therapy, mesalamine, antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic agents; they must be familiar with efficacy, dosing, adverse effects, and necessary monitoring, recognize indications for surgical intervention and possible surgical complications including pouchitis, and be familiar with guidelines for cancer surveillance in chronic intestinal inflammation.
