## Question

how do you measure blood pressure accurately in patient with both hypertension and afib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to measure blood pressure accurately in a patient with both hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core challenge posed by AF and why standard methods may fail. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines recommend for office, home, and ambulatory settings. Next, I will examine device validation and which monitors are acceptable in AF. After that, I need to check practical measurement protocols, including cuff size, posture, and how many readings to average. Finally, I will integrate AF-specific considerations like ventricular rate control and AF detection features, and close with a concise, clinically actionable algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the core challenge: AF causes beat-to-beat variability in stroke volume and ventricular filling, which increases intra-individual BP variability and degrades the accuracy of both auscultatory and oscillometric methods. This is why many validation protocols historically excluded AF, and why multiple measurements are essential in this population [^dd61acd6] [^4d9ca197] [^3dd6a227].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — older statements emphasized manual auscultation only, but more recent high-credibility guidance allows oscillometric devices with caveats. The 2023 ESH and 2024 ESC recommend manual auscultation when feasible, but also state that validated oscillometric devices can be used, accepting that systolic BP is reasonably accurate while diastolic BP tends to be modestly overestimated in AF. KDIGO similarly permits oscillometric devices in AF, again noting better performance for SBP than DBP [^c5f7b816] [^a3143fab] [^e32edb95] [^e77912a6].

> I will now examine device validation, because not all monitors perform acceptably in AF. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: a 2019 meta-analysis found substantial heterogeneity across devices, with SBP differences from mercury ranging roughly −3 to +6 mmHg and DBP differences −5 to +9 mmHg; importantly, AF-detection algorithms did not improve BP accuracy. Thus, device-specific validation in AF is critical, and only a few models have supportive data, such as the Microlife WatchBP Office with an AF-adapted algorithm and certain professional devices like the Philips SureSigns VSi and Welch Allyn Vital Signs 300 for SBP, while many consumer devices remain untested in AF [^7374fa94] [^39dc1d09] [^ed035082].

> Let me think about office measurement protocol. I should confirm that guidelines advise at least three measurements with auscultation when possible, given variability. ESH 2023 explicitly recommends obtaining at least three office BP measurements by auscultation in AF and averaging them. Standardized office BP technique still applies: 5 minutes rest, appropriate cuff size, arm at heart level, no talking, and deflation at 2–3 mmHg per second. If oscillometric devices are used, I need to ensure they are validated in AF and that multiple readings are averaged to mitigate variability [^c5f7b816] [^ed035082] [^2cf3df25].

> For home monitoring, I should double-check feasibility and accuracy. Home BP is acceptable in AF if the device is validated and the patient is coached to take triplicate measurements at consistent times, discard the first reading, and average the remaining two. Positioning and cuff selection remain crucial, and patients should avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for 30 minutes prior. Given the limited validation of home devices in AF, I should align home readings with clinic auscultatory values when possible and prefer devices with AF-specific validation or professional-grade models when available [^4d9ca197] [^9e13a151] [^ed035082].

> Ambulatory BP monitoring deserves separate consideration. Let me verify feasibility and accuracy claims: ABPM is feasible in AF with error rates comparable to sinus rhythm in some studies, and averaged values over 24 hours smooth variability. However, device validation in AF is sparse, so I should confirm that the ABPM device has been tested in arrhythmia populations or correlate with clinic auscultatory measurements. Importantly, AF detection algorithms embedded in ABPM can flag possible AF, but any positive screen requires ECG confirmation before acting on anticoagulation decisions [^dd61acd6] [^5a0ba97c] [^dff9a1da].

> I need to ensure AF-specific modifiers are addressed. Ventricular rate markedly affects oscillometric accuracy; accuracy is best when the ventricular rate is 60–100 bpm, with larger errors below 60 and above 100 bpm, and especially above 120 bpm. Therefore, rate control with beta-blockers or other agents to bring the resting heart rate into this range improves BP measurement reliability. Additionally, I should confirm that any AF detection by a BP device is verified with a 12-lead ECG, given the high sensitivity but imperfect specificity of these algorithms [^ef70fc21] [^7169793b] [^93777eeb].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, in the clinic, prioritize manual auscultation with standardized technique and take at least three measurements, averaging the last two. If oscillometric devices are used, choose models validated in AF and still average multiple readings. Second, for home monitoring, select AF-validated devices, train patients in triplicate measurement technique, and reconcile home averages with clinic auscultatory values. Third, consider ABPM when feasible to characterize 24-hour control, recognizing device limitations and the need for ECG confirmation of any AF alerts. Fourth, optimize ventricular rate control to 60–100 bpm before relying on automated readings for titration. Finally, document rhythm status and measurement conditions to contextualize decisions, especially if readings fluctuate widely [^c5f7b816] [^4d9ca197] [^dd61acd6] [^ef70fc21].

> But wait, what if the patient has very rapid AF and all readings seem unreliable? In that scenario, I should confirm that invasive or intra-arterial calibration is not routinely available outside specialized settings, so the safest course is to intensify rate control, reassess once the heart rate is slower, and then apply the above protocols. If decisions cannot wait, I should rely on averaged auscultatory measurements and clinical judgment, acknowledging uncertainty and planning reassessment as soon as feasible [^ef70fc21] [^c5f7b816].

> In summary, I should confirm that accurate BP measurement in AF requires acknowledging higher variability, using validated methods, repeating measurements, and integrating rate control. Manual auscultation remains the reference when possible, but validated oscillometric devices can be used for SBP with caution, while DBP should be interpreted conservatively. Across settings, multiple measurements and careful technique are non-negotiable, and any AF detection by a BP device must be confirmed with ECG before therapeutic decisions are made [^c5f7b816] [^a3143fab] [^e32edb95] [^7374fa94].

Accurate BP measurement in patients with hypertension and atrial fibrillation requires **manual auscultation** with a calibrated mercury or aneroid device [^a3143fab], taking **three measurements at 1-minute intervals** [^c5f7b816] and averaging the results to account for beat-to-beat variability [^ed035082]. Oscillometric devices are **less reliable for diastolic BP** in AF [^7374fa94] but can be used for systolic BP if validated for AF [^e32edb95]; always confirm with manual measurements when possible [^1c1e2e5e]. Ensure proper cuff size, arm position at heart level, and 5 minutes of rest before measurement [^0d3e3f7c]. Out-of-office monitoring (HBPM or ABPM) is recommended to improve accuracy and detect white-coat or masked hypertension [^dd61acd6] [^17657a75].

---

## Challenges in BP measurement in AF

AF causes **beat-to-beat variability** in stroke volume and heart rate, which reduces the accuracy of both manual and automated BP measurements [^4d9ca197]. This variability leads to:

- **Increased intra-individual variability**: Greater fluctuation in BP readings, requiring multiple measurements [^c5f7b816].
- **Reduced accuracy of oscillometric devices**: Particularly for diastolic BP, due to irregular pulse waveforms [^7374fa94].
- **Difficulty in manual auscultation**: Irregular Korotkoff sounds complicate manual measurement [^ed035082].

---

## Recommended measurement methods

### Office blood pressure measurement

Manual auscultation is the **preferred method** [^a3143fab] in AF, using a calibrated mercury or aneroid sphygmomanometer [^ed035082]. Take **three measurements at 1-minute intervals** [^c5f7b816] and average the results to account for variability [^ed035082]. Ensure **proper technique**: cuff size matched to arm circumference, arm at heart level, and 5 minutes of rest before measurement [^0d3e3f7c].

---

### Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)

Use **validated oscillometric devices** for AF when available [^e32edb95]; confirm accuracy with manual measurements when possible [^1c1e2e5e]. Take **multiple readings** (typically three) at each session, discard the first, and average the remaining readings [^4d9ca197]. Ensure **patient training** on proper technique and device use [^b3e475a5].

---

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)

ABPM provides a **more accurate assessment** of BP in AF by averaging multiple measurements over 24 hours [^dd61acd6]. It also detects white-coat and masked hypertension, which are common in AF [^notfound]. Use **validated devices** for AF when available [^notfound].

---

## Devices and validation

Few oscillometric devices have been **validated for AF** [^7374fa94]; accuracy varies by device, especially for diastolic BP [^7374fa94]. Devices with AF detection algorithms do not necessarily improve BP accuracy [^7374fa94]. Prefer devices **validated for AF** or confirm with manual measurements [^1c1e2e5e].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize:

- **Manual auscultation**: Preferred in AF when feasible [^a3143fab] [^c5f7b816].
- **Multiple measurements**: At least three, averaged to account for variability [^c5f7b816] [^ed035082].
- **Out-of-office monitoring**: Recommended to improve accuracy and detect white-coat or masked hypertension [^dd61acd6] [^17657a75].

---

## Practical recommendations

| **Setting** | **Recommended method** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Office | Manual auscultation | - Three measurements<br/> - Proper cuff size<br/> - Arm at heart level<br/> - 5 minutes rest [^c5f7b816] [^0d3e3f7c] |
| Home | Validated oscillometric device | - Multiple readings<br/> - Patient training<br/> - Confirm with manual when possible [^4d9ca197] [^1c1e2e5e] |
| Ambulatory | Validated ABPM device | - 24-hour monitoring<br/> - Detects white-coat/masked hypertension [^dd61acd6] [^17657a75] |

---

## Conclusion

Accurate BP measurement in patients with hypertension and AF requires **manual auscultation** when possible, with multiple measurements and proper technique [^a3143fab] [^c5f7b816]. Oscillometric devices can be used for systolic BP if validated, but diastolic BP is less reliable and should be interpreted cautiously [^e32edb95] [^7374fa94]. Out-of-office monitoring improves accuracy and should be used when feasible [^dd61acd6] [^17657a75].

Executive summary

Current validation protocols for assessing the accuracy of blood pressure monitors exclude people with atrial fibrillation, except in special circumstances. Hypertension guidelines advise manual blood pressure measurement in the presence of arrhythmia. They also promote home and ambulatory monitoring for diagnosis of hypertension, which necessarily requires automated devices. Few studies of automated blood pressure measurement with atrial fibrillation have been undertaken, and none in full accordance with internationally recognised protocols. We recently reported a systematic review and meta-analysis of accuracy of oscillometric devices for blood pressure measurement in atrial fibrillation. The recommendations presented here are based on that review, supplemented by consensus expert opinion of the Blood Pressure Measurement Working Party of the British and Irish Hypertension Society (BIHS).

### Blood pressure measurement in atrial fibrillation: review and meta-analysis of evidence on accuracy and clinical relevance [^dd61acd6]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

: Atrial fibrillation (AF) often coexists with hypertension in the elderly and multiplies the risk of stroke and death. Blood pressure (BP) measurement in patients with AF is difficult and uncertain and has been a classic exclusion criterion in hypertension clinical trials leading to limited research data. This article reviews the evidence on the accuracy of BP measurement in AF performed using different methods (office, ambulatory, home) and devices (auscultatory, oscillometric) and its clinical relevance in predicting cardiovascular damage. The current evidence suggests the following: (i) Interobserver and intra-observer variation in auscultatory BP measurement is increased in AF because of increased beat-to-beat BP variability and triplicate measurement is required; (ii) Data from validation studies of automated electronic BP monitors in AF are limited and methodologically heterogeneous and suggest reasonable accuracy in measuring SBP and a small yet consistent overestimation of DBP; (iii) 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring is feasible in AF, with similar proportion of errors as in individuals without AF; (iv) both auscultatory and automated oscillometric BP measurements appear to be clinically relevant in AF, providing similar associations with intra-arterial BP measurements and with indices of preclinical cardiac damage as in patients without AF, and predict cardiovascular events and death; (v) Screening for AF in the elderly using an AF-specific algorithm during routine automated office, home or ambulatory BP measurement has high diagnostic accuracy. In conclusion, in AF patients, BP measurement is important, reliable, and clinically relevant and should not be neglected in clinical research and in practice.

### Exploring the link between blood pressure variability and atrial fibrillation: current insights and future directions [^4ec49cce]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, especially in people over the age of 50, which affects more than 40 million people worldwide. Many studies have highlighted the association between hypertension with the development of AF. Blood pressure variability (BPV) is a dynamic size obtained by recording blood pressure oscillations using specific readings and at specific time intervals. A multitude of internal and external factors shape BPV while at the same time constituting a common pathogenetic pathway with the development of AF. Until recently, BPV has been applied exclusively in preclinical and clinical studies, without significant implications in clinical practice. Indeed, even from the research side, the determination of BPV is limited to patients without AF due to doubts about the accuracy of its measurement methods in patients with AF. In this review, we present the current evidence on common pathogenic pathways between BPV and AF, the reliability of quantification of BPV in patients with AF, the prognostic role of BPV in these patients, and discuss the future clinical implications of BPV in patients with AF.

Conclusion

Manual measurement should be used where possible for measuring blood pressure with atrial fibrillation. Limited data exist to suggest that some automated devices can accurately measure systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure in the presence of atrial fibrillation. Further work is needed to evaluate the many commonly used devices lacking such data. Future comparisons should follow internationally recognised protocols to ensure validity and facilitate comparisons.

### Accuracy of automated blood pressure measurements in the presence of atrial fibrillation: systematic review and meta-analysis [^7374fa94]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects ~3% of the general population and is twice as common with hypertension. Validation protocols for automated sphygmomanometers exclude people with AF, raising concerns over accuracy of hypertension diagnosis or management, using out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring, in the presence of AF. Some devices include algorithms to detect AF; a feature open to misinterpretation as offering accurate BP measurement with AF. We undertook this review to explore accuracy of automated devices, with or without AF detection, for measuring BP. We searched Medline and Embase to October 2018 for studies comparing automated BP measurement devices to a standard mercury sphygmomanometer contemporaneously. Data were extracted by two reviewers. Mean BP differences between devices and mercury were calculated, where not reported and compared; meta-analyses were undertaken where possible. We included 13 studies reporting 14 devices. Mean systolic and diastolic BP differences from mercury ranged from -3.1 to +6.1/-4.6 to +9.0mmHg. Considerable heterogeneity existed between devices (I 2 : 80 to 90%). Devices with AF detection algorithms appeared no more accurate for BP measurement with AF than other devices. A previous review concluded that oscillometric devices are accurate for systolic but not diastolic BP measurement in AF. The present findings do not support that conclusion. Due to heterogeneity between devices, they should be evaluated on individual performance. We found no evidence that devices with AF detection measure BP more accurately in AF than other devices. More home or ambulatory automated BP monitors require validation in populations with AF.

### Hypertension and atrial fibrillation: a frontier review from the AF-SCREEN international collaboration [^3549d0b1]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and is estimated to be present in >70% of AF patients. This Frontiers Review was prepared by 29 expert members of the AF-SCREEN International Collaboration to summarize existing evidence and knowledge gaps on links between hypertension, AF, and their cardiovascular sequelae; simultaneous screening for hypertension and AF; and the prevention of AF through antihypertensive therapy. Hypertension and AF are inextricably connected. Both are easily diagnosed, often silent, and frequently treated inadequately. Together, they additively increase the risk of ischemic stroke, heart failure, and many types of dementia, resulting in greater all-cause mortality, considerable disease burden, and increased health care expenditures. Automated upper arm cuff blood pressure devices with implemented technology can be used to simultaneously detect both hypertension and AF. However, positive screening for AF with an oscillometric blood pressure monitor still requires ECG confirmation. The current evidence suggests that high-risk individuals aged ≥65 years or with treatment-resistant hypertension could benefit from AF screening. Since antihypertensive therapy effectively lowers AF risk, particularly in individuals with left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension should be the key target for AF prediction and prevention rather than merely a comorbidity of AF. Nevertheless, several important gaps in knowledge need to be filled over the next years, including the ideal method and selection of patients for simultaneous screening of hypertension and AF and the optimal antihypertensive drug class and blood pressure targets for AF prevention.

### Automated blood pressure measurement in atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^be3edb81]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The measurement of blood pressure in atrial fibrillation is considered as difficult and uncertain, and current guidelines recommend the use of the auscultatory method. The accuracy of automated blood pressure monitors in atrial fibrillation remains controversial.

Method

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of studies comparing automated (oscillometric or automated Korotkov) versus manual auscultatory blood pressure measurements (mercury or aneroid sphygmomanometer) in patients with sustained atrial fibrillation.

Results

Twelve validations were analyzed (566 patients; five home, three ambulatory and three office devices). Pooled correlation coefficients between automated and manual blood pressure measurements were stronger for SBP than DBP (r = 0.89 versus 0.76, P < 0.001). Automated measurements were higher than manual measurements [pooled average SBP difference 0.5 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.9, 1.9; DBP 2.5 mmHg, 95%CI -0.6, 5.7). The mean difference was within 5 mmHg in six and four (SBP and DBP, respectively) of six validations. The SD of mean difference was within 8 mmHg in two and three (SBP and DBP, respectively) of four validations. The proportion of absolute automated-manual differences within 5 mmHg was at least 65% in four and two (SBP and DBP, respectively) of eight validations. Three studies showed no impact of heart rate on the automated-manual blood pressure differences.

Conclusion

There is limited evidence and significant heterogeneity in the studies that validated automated blood pressure monitors in atrial fibrillation. These monitors appear to be accurate in measuring SBP but not DBP. Given that atrial fibrillation is common in the elderly, in whom systolic hypertension is more common and important than diastolic hypertension, automated monitors appear to be appropriate for self-home but not for office measurement.

9.5 HBPM in patients with arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) (Box 25)

HBPM in patients with arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, raises special concerns. Particularly in the elderly, hypertension and atrial fibrillation often coexist as their prevalence is rising considerably with increasing age, as clearly demonstrated in recent outcome trials of novel oral anticoagulants where 50–90% of the atrial fibrillation participants were hypertensive patients. In the presence of atrial fibrillation, both the manual auscultatory and the automated oscillometric measurement of BP are difficult and uncertain because of variations in ventricular filling time, stroke volume and contractility, all of which increase beat-to-beat BPV. Thus, issues with the accuracy of automated BP measurement and its clinical relevance in atrial fibrillation are of high importance. To account for the increased BPV in atrial fibrillation, it is recommended that several measurements should be averaged using the auscultatory method, and that the automated oscillometric devices should be avoided as most of them have not been validated for accuracy in such patients. However, self-measurement using the auscultatory method at home is not feasible in the elderly hypertensive patients with atrial fibrillation. The current evidence from published validation studies of automated oscillometric BP monitors in atrial fibrillation is rather limited and methodologically heterogeneous. However, it appears that there is reasonable accuracy of these devices in measuring SBP in the presence of atrial fibrillation but with a small yet consistent overestimation of DBP (pooled automated minus auscultatory SBP difference 1 mmHg, 95% CI −0.1 to 2.1, and DBP 2.1 mmHg, 95% CI 0.1--4.0). In such a context, triplicate rather than duplicate measurements should be considered, because of increased beat-to-beat variability. An invasive study in atrial fibrillation patients with high ventricular rate showed that there is larger underestimation of oscillometric SBP compared with intra-aortic measurement. The clinical relevance of BP measurement in atrial fibrillation has been demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis, which showed that both manual auscultatory and automated oscillometric OBP measurements predict stroke or systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation patients, and follow-up BP control has superior predictive ability than baseline BP. Thus, despite their inherent instability, BP measurements in atrial fibrillation are clinically relevant as in individuals with sinus rhythm. These findings, together with the fact that in the elderly, systolic hypertension is far more common and important for prognosis, suggest that automated devices should be used for HBPM even in the presence of atrial fibrillation, in particular when ventricular rate is controlled by treatment. HBPM with specific devices has also been suggested as a means to screen for presence of atrial fibrillation. In fact, novel oscillometric HBPM devices have been developed, which are equipped with an algorithm specific for atrial fibrillation detection during routine automated BP measurement. Accumulating evidence suggests that screening for atrial fibrillation in the elderly using an atrial fibrillation-specific algorithm during routine automated office, home or ambulatory BP measurement has high diagnostic accuracy. Two studies have shown that HBPM with automated atrial fibrillation detector might be useful for early detection of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation in elderly individuals with hypertension.

Devices with atrial fibrillation detection

Some devices detect pulse irregularity to indicate potentially undiagnosed atrial fibrillation. Such devices are not inherently more accurate in measuring blood pressure with atrial fibrillation, nor can they be assumed to be, in comparison with monitors lacking such technology.

Automated devices shown to be inaccurate in atrial fibrillation

Based on published evidence, a number of devices have been shown to be inaccurate for blood pressure measurement with atrial fibrillation, and cannot be recommended (Table 1).

### The case for home monitoring in hypertension [^76ae1a42]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cautions

Not every patient will benefit from the use of self-monitors. Whilst newer monitors can detect abnormal rhythms and indicate that there is such a clinical situation, their accuracy is questionable in this context. It should be noted, however, that it is difficult to measure blood pressure accurately by any methodology in someone with atrial fibrillation, particularly if there is a fast ventricular response, but it is probably not suitable to use electronic, oscillometric devices in the presence of significant cardiac arrhythmias.

It is often cited that patients may be disturbed by measuring their own blood pressure and may become introverted and obsessed by the readings. We have little idea as to what proportion of the patient population might suffer in this way, but any guideline to patients would need to take this into account and consider the impact it would have on them as individuals.

There is a natural temptation for patients to measure their blood pressure at times of stress or during any unexpected event, and it is important to emphasise to them that blood pressure will rise under such circumstances but that that should not be considered a problem and should not normally require a change in therapy. It is the average of many measurements rather than the single odd reading that should govern the introduction or a change in drug therapy.

### The unappreciated importance of blood pressure in recent and older atrial fibrillation trials [^4757e180]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension represent two common clinical conditions that frequently coexist, especially in older individuals, and are associated with increased risk of stroke. Antihypertensive therapy reduces the risk of stroke by approximately 40%. It has been observed that stroke rates were reduced by 10% for every 2-mmHg reduction of blood pressure. Antithrombotic therapy reduces significantly the risk for ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation at the expense of increased risk of intracranial bleeding. The importance of hypertension in patients with atrial fibrillation is recognized by its inclusion both in the CHA2DS2-VASc (risk for stroke) and the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly, Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) scores (risk for bleeding) and the presence of hypertension alone is an indication to initiate antithrombotic treatment. However, blood pressure remains remarkably unappreciated in previous and recent atrial fibrillation trials. Very limited, if any, data are provided regarding blood pressure, including in-study and final blood pressure levels, blood pressure control, and concomitant antihypertensive medication. In contrast, several lines of evidence point toward a significant role of pre and in-treatment blood pressure for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation as well as for the incidence of intracranial bleeding during antithrombotic treatment. We propose that regular blood pressure recording should be mandatory in all future studies with antithrombotic therapy, analyses based on final and in-study blood pressure values, hypertension control, and antihypertensive medication should be performed, and the outcome be adjusted for blood pressure-related variables.

### Factors influencing blood pressure control in patients with atrial fibrillation and hypertension in Australian primary care [^ea85ec51]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Older patients (≥75 years) had higher rates of uncontrolled BP, a finding that is well supported by previous research in primary care.Uncontrolled BP rates are known to increase with age, and despite evidence for the safety and efficacy of BP lowering in older people, the risk–benefit of stroke prevention and the adverse effect of falls are still major concerns for GPs,along with poor adherence due to remembering multiple medications and comorbidities.Age-related risk of poor BP control suggests a greater need to address inequities and requires greater attention to these higher-risk and more vulnerable populations.

This study has various strengths and limitations that need to be considered. Previous literature has focused primarily on the risk of developing incident AF in patients with pre-existing hypertension, however, has failed to explore BP control in patients with AF and known hypertension. Limitations to this cross-sectional analysis include the use of BP measurements across the past 3 years to characterise recent BP control; it is possible that some individuals had a singular measurement that may not have been indicative of their overall BP control overtime. Given how variable individual BP control is, our aim was to get the best measure of overall BP control by using the maximum number of measurements available over 3 years, rather than focus on a single time point at which control may have been achieved but not sustained, as one would do in a longitudinal analysis. We also did not look at other BP characteristics (eg, single high measurement) to define BP control due to the limitations in the dataset (eg, inability to assess the accuracy of the measurements) and cross-sectional nature of the study. We categorised all patients based on the BP target of 140/90 mm Hg, regardless of their age and comorbidities, and this may have influenced the results. However, in the case of patients with AF, there are no specific BP targets for this patient population,and hence we defined the target for the purposes of analysis as control if BP <140/90 basing this on what is a common cut-off for BP control in several guidelines. We were also unable to ascertain whether patients were not on medicine because they did not tolerate them due to limitations in the dataset. Other limitations include the calculation of care level factors (encounters, regularity, CoC); these variables were based on data available from only NPS-participating GP practices and it is possible that we may have missing data from patient visits to non-NPS-participating medical practices. As CoC was calculated based on a 2-year observational period, it is possible that some patients with a lower number of visits in that period to have a CoC of 1 indicating that all their visits were to the same doctor, and this may have not been reflective of their CoC outside of the study period.

Blood pressure measurement in adults—We recommend standardized office blood pressure (BP) measurement in preference to routine office BP measurement for the management of high BP in adults (1B). An oscillometric BP device may be preferable to a manual BP device for standardized office BP measurement; however, standardization emphasizes adequate preparations for BP measurement, not the type of equipment. Automated office BP (AOBP), either attended or unattended, may be the preferred method of standardized office BP measurement, and oscillometric devices can be used to measure BP among patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Atrial fibrillation screening during routine automated office, home, and ambulatory blood pressure measurement: a diagnostic test accuracy systematic review and meta-analysis [^dff9a1da]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often asymptomatic and undiagnosed. As AF and hypertension often coexist, opportunistic AF detection during routine automated blood pressure (BP) measurement appears to be an attractive screening method.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy of office, home, or 24-hour ambulatory BP measuring devices with AF detection algorithms versus reference electrocardiography. Analyses were performed per participant (AF status based on several BP readings; most office/home devices) or per reading (AF status based on individual readings; all ambulatory devices). A meta-analysis stratified by device type (office/home/ambulatory) was conducted to calculate pooled measures of diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity/meta-regression analyses were also performed.

Results

Among 3096 records initially retrieved, 23 diagnostic test accuracy studies were included. Data derived from 11093 individuals (weighted age 69 years, males 56%, hypertensives 79%, diabetics 24%, and AF prevalence 17%) indicated a pooled sensitivity 0.97 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99), specificity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.95), and accuracy 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95), with generally consistent results using office, home, or ambulatory BP devices (slightly lower specificity with the latter). The positive and negative predictive values were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.80) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00), respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated lower specificity in studies implementing reading versus participant analyses. Most studies presented a low risk of bias and minor applicability concerns.

Conclusions

There is considerable and consistent evidence suggesting high diagnostic accuracy of AF detection algorithms implemented in automated BP monitors during routine BP measurements in and out of the office. AF diagnosis requires verification (electrocardiography) before treatment is administered.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: updated evidence report and... [^17657a75]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Repeat OBPM: low for adequate sensitivity and low specificity HBPM: low for adequate sensitivity and low specificity Self-OPBM: insufficient Truncated ABPM: insufficient Population: adults referred for ABPM because of elevated office blood pressures or suspicious for white coat hypertension Intervention: repeat OBPM: Most index test protocols had 5 min rest and used mercury sphygmomanometer. Confirmatory methods examined in KQ3 included repeated OBPM, self-OBPM, home blood pressure measurement, or kiosk. For KQ2a and KQ3a, included studies reported accuracy of protocol variations compared with an ABPM reference standard. Studies needed to report sensitivity and specificity or provide enough data to calculate these values.

One study reported accuracy for an OPBM threshold of 130/80 mm Hg or greater in addition to 140/90 mm Hg or greater but also lowered the reference standard threshold; therefore, accuracy between the 2 OBPM thresholds cannot be directly compared. 70 The resulting sensitivity for the OPBM threshold of 130/80 mm Hg or greater compared with the 130/80 mm Hg or greater daytime ABPM reference standard was 0. 56, with specificity of 0.
89. Four confirmatory blood pressure measurement modalities were examined for this KQ: repeated office blood pressure measurement, twice-daily home blood pressure measurement for 3 to 7 days, measurement performed by a patient in the office setting, and a truncated 6-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement. One study reported the accuracy of a truncated ABPM compared with a full 24-hour ABPM test.

30 Sensitivity and specificity were 0. 94 and
0. 76, respectively, for the subgroup for whom the ABPM indication was borderline hypertension. Sensitivity and specificity were 0. 89 and
0. 70, respectively, for the subgroup with suspected white coat hypertension.

### Concordance between automatic and manual recording of blood pressure depending on the absence or presence of atrial fibrillation [^4f6626c2]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to determine the concordance between two instruments for measuring blood pressure (BP) and its modification due to the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

In 107 patients with AF and a sinus rhythm (SR) of 100, BP was recorded using two sphygmomanometers: one automatic and the other manual. Four readings were made with each at 5-min intervals, and the mean was calculated for the statistical calculations. The correlation was determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient, and the concordance using the Bland-Altman plot and the κ index.

Results

The correlation coefficients (r) for the systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were 0.92 and 0.76. If the patient had AF, these were 0.91 and 0.75, respectively. The difference between the automatic and manual SBP measurements depending on whether the patient presented AF was -0.21 and -1.03 mm Hg. In DBP, this was -4.61 and 0.44 mm Hg. This discordance is not modified for low or high BP values, both in patients with AF and those without it. If we classify the patients as hypertensive or not (≥140/90 mm Hg), the concordance between both methods has high κ indices (0.72 and 0.89) both in AF and SR.

Conclusion

There is a high correlation between both measurements, which decreased slightly in patients with AF. The difference when comparing the means is clinically irrelevant, and there is a substantial level of concordance between the two measurements for classifying patients as hypertensive or not.

### Atrial fibrillation detection and management in hypertension [^93777eeb]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is prevalent in >70% of atrial fibrillation patients. In turn, hypertensive patients have up to 73% greater likelihood of atrial fibrillation. Current guidelines recommend that a systematic atrial fibrillation screening may be justified in all patients aged ≥65 years with at least 1 cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. Although most blood pressure monitors include algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation with a high sensitivity of 96 [92-98]% and specificity of 94 [91-96]%, an electrocardiography confirmation is necessary to establish a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Early detection and diagnosis of atrial fibrillation is important to allow initiation of atrial fibrillation management. In the Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4), hypertension was present in 88% of participants, and early rhythm control therapy lowered the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with early atrial fibrillation aged >75 or with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 (doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (doubled), Vascular disease, Age 65-74, Sex category [female]) and cardiovascular condition. Strategies for early atrial fibrillation detection should always be linked to a comprehensive atrial fibrillation work-up infrastructure organized within an integrated ABC pathway (Anticoagulation/Avoid stroke; Better symptom control; Cardiovascular and Comorbidity optimization). For secondary prophylaxis, blood pressure control should be embedded in a combined risk factor management program. In hypertensive patients where no atrial fibrillation is detected, intensive blood pressure lowering therapy for primary prophylaxis should be initiated to reduce the risk of developing atrial fibrillation and other cardiovascular complications in the future. The aim of the article is to review the current literature on atrial fibrillation detection and management in hypertensive patients.

### Measurement of blood pressure in people with atrial fibrillation [^ed035082]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Full statement

Office or clinic blood pressure measurement in atrial fibrillation

Office blood pressure measurements should be carried out using an auscultatory method with a calibrated analogue sphygmomanometer. Current and forthcoming BIHS/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance regarding cuff size, seating and avoidance of other causes of error in blood pressure measurement should be followed. Cuff deflation should be no faster than 2–3 mmHg per second.

Auscultatory methods are recommended due to the lack of evidence for accuracy of most oscillometric devices in the presence of atrial fibrillation.

Measurements should be repeated at least three times, regardless of absolute blood pressure, since there is increased intra-person variation in blood pressure with atrial fibrillation. Using an average of these multiple measurements is advised on the basis of expert opinion.

Home or clinic based automated blood pressure measurement

Due to the absence of evidence for accuracy for most automated monitors designed for home or clinic use, and the increased individual variation in blood pressure with atrial fibrillation, we recommend comparison with multiple auscultatory clinic blood pressure readings for all individuals, when automated devices are used. This may be achieved by taking a sequence of at least three device readings alternating with three auscultatory readings made on the same arm, using a professional analogue device (such as the Accoson Green Light 300).

Limited data do exist to suggest that two monitors, designed for professional use, are accurate in measuring systolic, but not diastolic blood pressure: Philips SureSigns VSi and Welch Allyn Vital Signs 300 devices.

For home use, data from one other study suggest that the Tensoval duo control device is accurate in measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

The Microlife Watch BPA 100 Plus device may be accurate for systolic but not diastolic blood pressure.

Ambulatory blood pressure measurement

Given the absence of evidence for accuracy of most ambulatory monitors, and the increased individual variation in blood pressure with atrial fibrillation, we recommend comparison of such devices with multiple auscultatory clinic blood pressure readings for all individuals. This may be achieved by taking a sequence of at least three device readings alternating with three auscultatory readings made on the same arm, using a professional analogue device (such as the Accoson Green Light 300).

Limited data obtained by static comparison of oscillometric ambulatory blood pressure monitors with mercury readings suggest accuracy for systolic but not diastolic blood pressures measured by the SpaceLabs 90207 and the A&D TM-2430 devices.

### Opportunistic detection of atrial fibrillation using blood pressure monitors: a systematic review [^c50b5c87]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia that affects around 2% of the population and around 8% of those aged over 75 years.The presence of AF can increase a patient's risk of stroke by up to a factor of five;however, this risk can be significantly reduced through anticoagulation therapy for those considered at medium or high risk according to the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scoring system,making the early detection of AF beneficial. In the UK, opportunistic screening for AF has been shown to be cost-effective.

Routine measurement of blood pressure (BP) is one opportunity for detecting AF. In the UK, the evidence-based National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published guidance on the clinical management of hypertension.This guidance recommends pulse palpation before taking a BP measurement as some automated sphygmomanometers are known to be inaccurate for patients with an irregular pulse. Some manufacturers have turned this problem into an advantage and have introduced automated sphygmomanometers that incorporate algorithms for detecting AF. In 2013 NICE published a medical technology guidance which concluded that the use of these devices could be beneficial in primary care.

In this paper, we aim to identify all primary studies that have evaluated the use of automated sphygmomanometers for the detection of AF against a reference standard, to appraise these studies based on their relevance to opportunistic AF detection and to compare their results for the sensitivity and specificity of AF detection.

Verify accurate blood pressure measurement

In people with suspected RH it is important to ensure that BP is measured correctly and elevated clinic readings are confirmed with out-of-office measurements (HBPM or ABPM) to exclude a white coat effect (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 
Procedure for accurate office blood pressure measurement.

AF atrial fibrillation, BP blood pressure.

Use of Validated Equipment

It is essential that clinically validated BP devices are used, noting that monitors over 4 years old may be inaccurate. Please refer to the British and Irish Hypertension Society’s website,, for the current list of validated blood pressure monitoring devices.

Cuff size

It is important to use a cuff that is specifically made for the BP monitor and is appropriately sized for the individual. The bladder length should be 75–100% of the arm circumference and the width 35–50% of the arm circumference. Poor cuff choice may lead to inaccurate diagnosis. For example, an under-sized cuff may require higher pressure to occlude blood flow in the underlying artery, leading to a false diagnosis of RH. If there is doubt over which size cuff to use, err on the side of a larger cuff as the measurement error will be significantly less than if the cuff is too small.

Cuff placement

The centre of the cuff bladder should be placed directly on the skin over the brachial artery at the level of the heart with the lower cuff-edge 2 cm above the antecubital fossa. Cuffs placed over clothing may overestimate BP, leading to a false diagnosis of RH.

Individual factors

BP can be affected by many factors including ambient noise, low temperature, stress, full bladder, recent exercise and recent (within 30 min) ingestion of caffeine or tobacco. We recommend clinic BP is measured after 3–5 min rest, with the subject seated silently with the legs unfolded, back supported and arm resting at heart height. Clothing over the upper arm should be removed and not rolled up to avoid a tourniquet effect. Talking should be avoided during and between measurements. BP should be measured at least 3 times at one-minute intervals. The average of the last 2 measurements should be recorded. In people where there is a significant difference in BP between arms, the arm with the higher measurements should be used.

Abnormal heart rhythms

Semi-automatic BP measurement devices are unreliable among people with abnormal heart rhythms including bradycardia, frequent extrasystoles and atrial fibrillation. In such individuals, manual BP measurement using auscultatory techniques should be used.

### Ideal blood pressure in patients with atrial fibrillation [^ab197ad0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults redefined hypertension as systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥80 mm Hg. The optimal BP for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to investigate the impacts of the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and to determine the ideal BP threshold for the management of high BP in patients with AF.

Methods

This study analyzed data for 298,374 Korean adults with oral anticoagulant-naive, nonvalvular AF obtained from the National Health Insurance Service database from 2005 to 2015.

Results

According to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guideline, 62.2% of the individuals in our sample had hypertension. After applying the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, 79.4% had hypertension, including 17.2% with newly redefined hypertension (130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg). Those with newly redefined hypertension had greater risks of major cardiovascular events (hazard ratio: 1.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.10; p < 0.001), ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and heart failure admission, compared with nonhypertensive patients (<130/80 mm Hg). Among patients with AF undergoing hypertension treatment, patients with BP ≥130/80 mm Hg or <120/80 mm Hg were at significantly higher risks of major cardiovascular events than patients with BP of 120 to 129/<80 mm Hg.

Conclusions

Patients with AF and newly redefined hypertension according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline were at higher risk of major cardiovascular events, suggesting that the new BP threshold is beneficial for timely diagnosis and intervention. BP of 120 to 129/<80 mm Hg was the optimal BP treatment target for patients with AF undergoing hypertension treatment.

### Hypertension and atrial fibrillation: doubts and certainties from basic and clinical studies [^608daea5]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF) are 2 important public health priorities. Their prevalence is increasing worldwide, and the 2 conditions often coexist in the same patient. Hypertension and AF are strikingly related to an excess risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Hypertension ultimately increases the risk of AF, and because of its high prevalence in the population, it accounts for more cases of AF than other risk factors. Among patients with established AF, hypertension is present in about 60% to 80% of individuals. Despite the well-known association between hypertension and AF, several pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the higher risk of AF in hypertensive patients are still incompletely known. From an epidemiological standpoint, it is unclear whether the increasing risk of AF with blood pressure (BP) is linear or threshold. It is uncertain whether an intensive control of BP or the use of specific antihypertensive drugs, such as those inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reduces the risk of subsequent AF in hypertensive patients in sinus rhythm. Finally, in spite of the observational evidence suggesting a progressive relation between BP levels and the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding in patients with hypertension and AF, the extent to which BP should be lowered in these patients, including those who undergo catheter ablation, remains uncertain. This article summarizes the main basic mechanisms through which hypertension is believed to promote AF. It also explores epidemiological data supporting an evolutionary pathway from hypertension to AF, including the emerging evidence favoring an intensive BP control or the use of drugs, which inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to reduce the risk of AF. Finally, it examines the impact of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in relation to hypertension.

### Blood pressure control and risk of incident atrial fibrillation [^0b33151b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that affects more than 2 million people in the United States. We sought to determine whether the risk of incident AF among patients treated for hypertension differs by the degree of blood pressure control.

Methods

A population-based, case-control study of 433 patients with verified incident AF and 899 controls was conducted to investigate the relationship between average achieved systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and risk of AF. All patients were members of an integrated health-care delivery system and were pharmacologically treated for hypertension. Medical records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of new onset AF and to collect information on medical conditions, health behaviors, and measured blood pressures. Average achieved SBP and DBP were calculated from the three most recent outpatient blood pressure measurements.

Results

Compared with the reference level of 120-129 mm Hg, for categories of average achieved SBP of <120, 130-139, 140-149, 150-159, 160-169, and > or =170 mm Hg, the odds ratios (ORs; 95% confidence interval (CI)) for incident AF were 1.99 (1.10, 3.62), 1.19 (0.78, 1.81), 1.40 (0.93, 2.09), 2.02 (1.30, 3.15), 2.27 (1.31, 3.93), and 1.84 (0.89, 3.80), respectively. Based on the population attributable fraction, we estimated that, among patients with treated hypertension, 17.2% (95% CI 4.3%, 28.3%) of incident AF was attributable to an average achieved SBP > or =140 mm Hg.

Conclusion

Among patients treated for hypertension, uncontrolled elevated SBP and SBP <120 mm Hg were associated with an increased risk of incident AF.

### Effect of lower on-treatment systolic blood pressure on the risk of atrial fibrillation in hypertensive patients [^b8e067cc]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There is a well-established association between hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF); indeed, even upper normal systolic blood pressures (SBP) are long-term predictors of incident AF. These findings suggest that more aggressive BP control may reduce the risk of new AF. However, whether lower achieved SBP is associated with a lower incidence of AF remains unclear. The risk of new-onset AF was examined in relation to last in-treatment SBP before AF diagnosis or last in-study measurement in the absence of new AF in 8831 hypertensive patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy with no history of AF, in sinus rhythm on their baseline ECG, randomly assigned to losartan- or atenolol-based treatment. Patients with in-treatment SBP ≤130 mm Hg (lowest quintile at last measurement) and SBP between 131 and 141 mm Hg were compared with patients with in-treatment SBP ≥142 mm Hg (median SBP at last measurement). During follow-up of 4.6±1.1 years, new-onset AF was diagnosed in 701 patients (7.9%). In multivariate Cox analyses, compared with in-treatment SBP ≥142 mm Hg, in-treatment SBP ≤130 mm Hg entered as a time-varying covariate was associated with a 40% lower risk (95% confidence interval, 18%-55%) and in-treatment SBP of 131 to 141 mm Hg with a 24% lower risk (95% confidence interval, 7%-38%) of new AF. Thus, achieved SBP ≤130 mm Hg is associated with a lower risk of new-onset AF in hypertensive patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy. Further study is needed to determine whether targeting hypertensive patients without AF to lower SBP goals can reduce the burden of new AF in this high-risk population.

### ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines and CHA₂DS₂-VASc up-scoring in patients with atrial fibrillation [^7f4c538d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

While the definition of hypertension has changed in response to landmark clinical trials,CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc was validated using an older hypertension definitionwith limited ambulatory BP monitoring and higher BP goals for treatment. Now, patients with AF will meet the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc threshold for OAC earlier in their disease course. However, it is not known if patients with scores of 1 or 2 using the new hypertension definition have sufficient stroke risk to offset the bleeding risk of OAC and will receive net clinical benefit.

Our study has limitations. PINNACLE cannot incorporate home BP measurements or those from unlinked health care systems. PINNACLE is also an outpatient quality improvement registry not suited to evaluate clinical end points. Our findings support the need to recalibrate AF stroke risk prediction to provide a stronger, contemporary evidence base and incorporate other comorbidities, AF severity and characteristics, and imaging featuresto facilitate nuanced patient counseling and shared decision-making.

### Changes in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure following restoration of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation [^4fc42a5d]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The interplay between atrial fibrillation and blood pressure (BP) is insufficiently studied. In symptomatic patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, electrical cardioversion (ECV) is often used to restore sinus rhythm. In this prospective study, we investigated how restoration of sinus rhythm affected 24-h ambulatory BP.

Methods

Ninety-eight patients with persistent atrial fibrillation were examined with 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring before and approximately a week after ECV.

Results

Sixty-two patients remained in sinus rhythm at the time of the second ambulatory BP monitoring (AF-SR group), whereas 36 patients had relapsed into atrial fibrillation (AF-AF group). In the AF-SR group, there was a significant increase in mean systolic 24-h BP (5.6mmHg), a significant decrease in mean diastolic 24-h BP (-4.7mmHg) and accordingly, a significant 25% (10.4mmHg) increase in mean 24-h pulse pressure.

Conclusion

These findings may reflect the haemodynamic conditions that are prevalent in atrial fibrillation, ambulatory BP measurement bias in atrial fibrillation or a combination of both factors. From a clinical standpoint, our results suggest that an increased attention to BP is needed when sinus rhythm is restored, as underlying hypertension may be masked by BP changes during atrial fibrillation. From a general standpoint, it may be speculated that BP, as indicated by the relatively large difference in pulse pressure, may be inherently different in atrial fibrillation and may therefore not be interpretable in the equivalent manner as BP in sinus rhythm.

### Impact of atrial fibrillation on the accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure monitoring [^03ab5f33]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

The introduction of automated oscillometric blood pressure monitors was the basis for today's widespread use of blood pressure self-measurement. However, in atrial fibrillation, there is a controversial debate on the use of oscillometry because there is a high variability of heart rate and stroke volume. To date, the accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure monitoring in atrial fibrillation has only been investigated using auscultatory sphygmomanometry as reference method, which may be biased by arrhythmia as well. We performed a cross-sectional study in 102 patients (52 sinus rhythm, 50 atrial fibrillation) assessing the accuracy of an automated and validated oscillometric upper arm (M5 Professional, Omron) and wrist device (R5 Professional, Omron) to invasively assessed arterial pressure. Blood pressure values were calculated as the mean of 3 consecutive measurements. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not significantly differ in patients with sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation, independent of the method of measurement (P>0.05 each). The within-subject variability of the oscillometric measurements was higher in patients with atrial fibrillation compared with sinus rhythm (P<0.01 each). The biases of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, however, did not significantly differ in presence or absence of atrial fibrillation in Bland-Altmann analysis (P>0.05 each). In conclusion, atrial fibrillation did not significantly affect the accuracy of oscillometric measurements, if 3 repeated measurements were performed.

### Exploring the impact of blood pressure variability on incident atrial fibrillation in type 2 diabetes [^664cd558]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects an estimated 33 million individuals worldwideand significantly impairs quality of life. It is an independent risk factor for stroke, cardiovascular hospitalization, sudden death, and development of heart failure and dementia.,Therefore, elucidating risk factors associated with the development of AF provides an avenue for preventative health interventions.

Hypertension is a well-described risk factor for AF, and blood pressure screening is one of the most common measurements in clinical practice. On a beat-to-beat basis, blood pressure measurements in the same individual can vary markedly from −24 mmHg to +33 mmHg, owing to a multitude of intrinsic, extrinsic, and behavioral factors.Clinical studies investigating the impact of hypertension have traditionally sought to overcome the intrinsic variability in blood pressure measurements by using an averaged measurement with standardized measurement procedures. However, growing evidence suggests that the presence of increased blood pressure variability carries prognostic implications for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality outcomes, independent of blood pressure elevation alone.,,Previous research has suggested that increased blood pressure variability is associated with an increased risk for the development of AF in the general population,but these findings have yet to be corroborated in those with diabetes, who are known to be a higher cardiovascular risk population.

In this issue of JACC: Advances, Kaze et alinvestigate the link between increased blood pressure variability and incident AF in those with type 2 diabetes through a retrospective cohort analysis of the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) study—a multicenter 2-by-2 factorial randomized control trial investigating the impact of intensive blood pressure and/or glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.Blood pressure variability was measured using at least 5 blood pressure measurements across multiple visits obtained between the 4th and 24th months of follow-up. Variability was defined as the intraindividual standard of deviation across visits, and also measured using coefficient of variation, and variability independent of the mean. They report that having higher blood pressure variability was associated with an increased incidence of AF during the follow-up period, defined as AF diagnoses using outpatient 12-lead electrocardiogram screening after month 24 of follow-up.

### Hypertension and atrial fibrillation: diagnostic approach, prevention and treatment. position paper of the working group' hypertension arrhythmias and thrombosis' of the European Society of Hypertension [^df704ab0]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disorder and atrial fibrillation is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia. Both these conditions frequently coexist and their prevalence increases rapidly with aging. There are different risk factors and clinical conditions predisposing to the development of atrial fibrillation, but due its high prevalence, hypertension is still the main risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms (such as structural changes, neurohormonal activation, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, etc.) have been advocated to explain the onset of atrial fibrillation. The presence of atrial fibrillation per se increases the risk of stroke but its coexistence with high blood pressure leads to an abrupt increase of cardiovascular complications. Different risk models are available for the risk stratification and the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. In all of them hypertension is present and is an important risk factor. Antihypertensive treatment may contribute to reduce this risk, and it seems some classes are superior to others in the prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation and prevention of stroke. Antithrombotic treatment with warfarin is effective in the prevention of thromboembolic events, although quite recently, new classes of anticoagulants that do not require international normalized ratio monitoring have been introduced with promising results.

### Relationship between systolic blood pressure and renal function on clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation: a report from the prospective AF-GEN-UK registry [^1926e013]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Elevated systolic blood pressure (BP) is the most significant modifiable risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality. From 1990 to 2019, the number of disability-adjusted life years due to elevated systolic BP increased from 154 million to 235 million, while the number of premature deaths rose to 10.8 million. There are many pathways linking hypertension to poor health outcomes and optimal BP levels may be influenced by co-morbidities, although these interactions remain unclear. Elevated BP contributes significantly to incident atrial fibrillation (AF). The risk of AF among patients with hypertension is 1.7-fold higher than in normotensive individuals. When AF occurs, patients with hypertension are more prone to developing debilitating complications, such as stroke, heart failure and advanced chronic kidney disease. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on AF management recommend a target systolic BP of 120–129 mmHg as this level is associated with the lowest risk of poor outcomes.

The incidence of both hypertension and AF increases with age, contributing to the healthcare burden, and evidence shows that systolic BP, rather than diastolic BP, is a better predictor of outcomes in patients >50 years old. Both hypertension and AF negatively affect renal function, another important health outcome prognosticator. However, the interaction between systolic BP and renal function in patients with AF remains unclear, and the optimal systolic BP in AF remains uncertain from this aspect. Hence, the necessity of active BP monitoring and early identification of deterioration of kidney function, as well as a better understanding of how the level of renal function influences the risk of AF complications in people with different BP levels in real-world settings.

The UK extension of the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP) Long-term General Registry of patients with AF, the AF-GEN-UK study, assessed the contemporary management of AF in primary and secondary care in the UK. In this analysis, we assessed the combined impact of systolic BP levels and renal (dys)function and their possible interaction on mortality, thromboembolic and haemorrhagic events in patients with AF from the AF-GEN-UK study.

### Systolic blood pressure time in target range and incident atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertension: insights from the SPRINT trial [^4512b3e6]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) time in target range (TTR) indicates the mean value, exposure time, and variability in blood pressure over time. The prognostic value of SBP TTR for incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with hypertension is unclear.

Methods

We performed a post hoc analysis of SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), a randomized controlled trial comparing intensive (<120 mmHg) and standard (<140 mmHg) SBP interventions in participants with hypertension. SBP target ranges for intensive and standard arms were defined as 110 to 130 and 120 to 140 mmHg, respectively. TTR was calculated by linear interpolation method using SBP from months 0 to 3. We used Cox proportional regression models to assess the association of SBP TTR with incident AF.

Results

Among 7939 participants included in this analysis, 187 incident AF cases occurred during follow-up. After multivariable adjustment, a 10% increase in SBP TTR was independently associated with a 7% lower risk of incident AF (hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.97]; P =0.003). The restricted spline curve depicted a linear and inverse relationship between SBP TTR and incident AF. Sensitivity analyses generated consistent results when calculating TTR over a longer period or setting target range as 110 to 140 mmHg for the whole population.

Conclusions

Higher SBP TTR independently predicts a lower risk of incident AF. Efforts to attain SBP within 110 to 140 mmHg over time may be an effective strategy to prevent AF.

Hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF) risk—hypertension is a major risk factor for AF, with Framingham Heart Study odds ratios for incident AF of 1.5 in men and 1.4 in women; for prevention, the optimal systolic blood pressure appears to be 120–130 mmHg and, in hypertensive patients, the optimal on-treatment systolic BP goal appears to be <130 mmHg.

### Accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure measurement in patients with atrial fibrillation [^c781d176]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure (BP) measurement is not so satisfied, the BP reading is still associated with cardiovascular events and death in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Because the currently used auscultatory or oscillometric methods were developed on sinus rhythm (SR), these BP measurement methods were not reasonable for AF patients. It is suggested that the average of three BP readings in the AF patients is accepted in clinical, even so, high systolic BP (SBP) variability and inaccurate diastolic BP (DBP) value have been reported in AF patients. In sinus rhythm, oscillometric pressure pulses (OPPs) are spindle-like, regardless of the heart rate. However, the shape of OPP is obviously associated with frequency of ventricular rate (VR) in AF patients. When the VR is rapid, the OPP is far from a spindle-like shape. With intro-aortic BP as reference, a study demonstrated that the oscillometric SBP level significantly underestimated the intro-aortic SBP level in the AF patients with increasing VR. In clinical practice, the physician should use the average of three BP readings in the AF patients. When the mean pulse rates (PR) reported by the oscillometric BP devise is less than 90 bpm and the variation of three pulse rate <10 bpm, the oscillometric SBP readings may be clinically accepted in AF patients. It is necessary to develop a new BP measurement method for AF as the current methods in AF are not so accurate as in SR.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF)—hypertension associations and BP control implications are summarized. Hypertension “has the highest attributable risk for the development of AF” and “is present in >80% of patients with AF and is the most common comorbid condition, regardless of age.” Because both rise with age, hypertension “remains a key component in several AF and CVD risk prediction scores.” “BP control in individuals with hypertension reduces the risk for incident AF, especially in patients with HF,” and “In adults with AF and hypertension, optimal BP control reduces rates of MACE, including stroke.” “Lifestyle modifications that result in lower BP may decrease the recurrence of AF.” Pharmacologic signals include that “Small studies and secondary analyses of RCTs reported lower incident AF with ACEi or ARB, and 2 meta-analyses suggest reduction in recurrent AF with ACEi or ARB,” and “RCTs and observational studies suggest that MRAs reduce AF burden.” Overall, “Control of hypertension is a key component of AF management, although optimal treatment targets for the management of hypertension in AF remain unclear.”

### Blood pressure in atrial fibrillation and in sinus rhythm during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: data from the TEMPLAR project [^33d0910c]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

There are some strengths with this study. To our knowledge, this is the first study with real-life data in an out-of-hospital setting on the performance of ABPM monitoring in AF. We are also first to use episodes with assumed paroxysmal AF and adjacent episodes in normal rhythm for intraindividual comparisons of averaged BP during a complete ABPM registration. Interaction analyses of sex, age and antihypertensive medication suggest that our findings are valid for a broad population of hypertensive patients. Our results point towards the feasibility of using ABPM for clinical decision making also in patients with AF.

There are also important limitations to this study to consider. First, for the validation of true AF we cannot rule out that measurements during very frequent and long episodes of supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEBs) were included in error, since we did not have simultaneous ECG recordings. However, previous validation studies of this device (with even less strict criteria applied than ours) showed an excellent pooled specificity of 94%. The remaining proportion of false positives were almost exclusively SVEBs, where excessive supraventricular ectopic activity is closely related to both AF and to future cardiovascular events. Excessive supraventricular ectopic activity is usually defined as 30 premature atrial contractions per h (i.e 0,8% per h with a HR of 60 bpm) or a run of >20 premature atrial contractions (corresponding to less than 30 s). Considering our definition of assumed AF to require >30% of the time in assumed AF and episodes with a duration >30 min, makes the potential confounding of our results from premature atrial contractions limited. Second, some individuals displayed larger differences in BP between AF and SR (Fig. 3), however dispersed with a normal distribution. Larger differences were not clearly related to high vs low HR in our study, but seemed to be associated with a BP above the average for the study population. Further studies are needed to better understand the characteristics of these individuals. Third, the selection of patients among elderly mainly hypertensive subjects from community pharmacies may limit the generalizability of our findings.

### Exploring the impact of blood pressure variability on incident atrial fibrillation in type 2 diabetes [^2076db2c]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Finally, an intrinsic limitation in the extrapolating findings regarding increased blood pressure variability lies in the translation to clinical practice, as there are currently no therapeutic interventions to target blood pressure variability independent of blood pressure control. Thus, elucidating the underlying pathology would be important to elucidate therapeutic targets for intervention. It is important to emphasize that there has been ample evidence that the control of hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk reduction strategy and patients with blood pressures above goal should not be maintained at their elevated blood pressure in efforts to minimize variability.

In sum, the analysis reported by Kaze et alcorroborates and extends previously reported population-based findings linking increased blood pressure variability with the development of AF. Their findings raise important questions and highlight opportunities for future research, such as future investigations looking at the impact of blood pressure variability on thromboembolic stroke as an independent risk factor after adjustment for clinical and subclinical AF. While translating blood pressure variability to clinical practice or clinical interventions has consistently been challenging, the cumulative findings on the relationship between blood pressure variability and incident AF would suggest that individuals who develop an increase in blood pressure variability following otherwise stable blood pressure measurements may benefit from intensification of AF screening for earlier diagnosis and initiation of thromboembolic prophylaxis. As ambulatory rhythm and biometric monitoring becomes increasingly widespread, future studies in this space will be able to harness this technology to help refine our understanding of the association between blood pressure variability and development of atrial arrhythmias.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension—hypertension has the highest attributable risk for AF, is present in >80% of AF patients, and BP control reduces incident AF and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including stroke; lifestyle BP-lowering may decrease AF recurrence, ACEi or ARB have signals for reducing incident and recurrent AF in limited analyses, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) may reduce AF burden, and hypertension control is a key component of AF management though optimal BP targets in AF remain unclear.

### Oscillometric measurement of blood pressure: a simplified explanation. A technical note on behalf of the British and Irish hypertension society [^3dd6a227]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1 
The relationship between the pressure in an automated machine cuff and the flow of blood into the underlying arm

Some machines read pressure and volume changes during cuff inflation until the arm stops pulsating after which the cuff rapidly deflates. Oscillometric machines usually use the maximum volume change as an indication of the average of the systolic and diastolic BP within the artery. By combining this average with the rate of change of the pressure wave, the machines then use a variety of algorithms to estimate the systolic and diastolic BP. These algorithms vary from machine to machine resulting in slightly different interpretations of the pressures (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 
Cuff pressure changes used to calculate blood pressure

Pulse detection by oscillometric machines depends on the amount of change in the volume of the arm with each pulse (small pulses are more difficult to detect) and on the regularity and rate of those pulses. With regular pulses and a relatively smoothly changing arm volume it is much easier for the microprocessor to estimate the systolic and diastolic BP. However, if the pulses are irregular or there are movements in the arm under the cuff, pressure changes in the cuff will not rise and fall smoothly leading to difficulty in making the pressure calculations. This can arise with rhythm problems such as atrial fibrillation and when there are frequent extrasystoles which may have a smaller volume than regular beats. Very slow heart rates (<50 bpm) may lead to too few beats being detected during cuff deflation to permit an accurate estimate of BP.

The use of reliable solid-state transducers and microprocessor technology allows these pressure changes in the cuff to be detected and analysed permitting easy access to a fair and reproducible estimation of arterial BP economically and without the need for skilled interpretation.

Atrial fibrillation—decision-making for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 (2 in women) notes that treatment discussions may be needed and that single-point risk estimates are simplistic. The decision to treat with oral anticoagulants “may at times require additional discussion” because the recommendation strength is “less robust (2a).” The 1-point-concept is “simplistic,” and other factors such as AF burden can be considered. In ARISTOTLE, “a single elevated BP measurement” was associated with a “50% increased risk of stroke,” and additional patient-specific factors may influence risk but are “unclear” to incorporate into practice.

### Blood pressure in atrial fibrillation and in sinus rhythm during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: data from the TEMPLAR project [^cdb5843f]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This real-life study in an out-of-hospital setting investigated the performance of an ABPM device with an algorithm for AF detection (Microlife WatchBP 03 AFIB) in 430 mostly hypertensive subjects. For the first time intraindividual comparisons of BP measurements in adjacent episodes of assumed paroxysmal AF and in normal rhythm were assessed during a full ABPM registration. We found that averaged MAP was similar, averaged systolic BP tended to be lower, and diastolic BP higher in assumed AF, however with absolute differences of limited clinical relevance.

As compared to sinus rhythm, we observed slightly lower systolic BP and slightly higher diastolic BP values in assumed AF, rendering PP values to be dependent on rhythm in this study using intraindividual comparisons. This is in line with our previous findings comparing patients with high likelihood of AF to individuals with low likelihood of AF and other studies with intraindividual comparisons. However, those studies did not compare averaged BP values in adjacent episodes of AF and normal rhythm during an ABPM as we did in the current study. A lower systolic BP and higher diastolic BP seems to be a systematic error of cuff-measured BP, since similar findings are apparent also in SR, using invasive measurements as reference. Compared to invasive measurements, these errors seem to be larger in AF than in SR. Our results imply that using averaged values of MAP, which is the actual measure with oscillometric devices, provides more accurate information than the derived values of systolic and diastolic BP when using the oscillometric technique during AF. This notwithstanding, the differences for systolic and diastolic BP values between AF and SR were small (<1.5 mm Hg), suggesting little impact on clinical decision making.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, antihypertensive therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to ensure optimal blood control to reduce AF recurrence and AF-related cardiovascular events in patients with AF and hypertension.

### Controlled level and variability of systolic blood pressure on the risk of thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation and hypertension [^26910714]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is an independent risk factor for thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the association between blood pressure (BP) control and thromboembolic events remains under-evaluated in patients with AF. We aimed to identify the relation between BP control and the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in hypertensive patients with AF. Data on 13,712 consecutive patients with AF (9,505 with and 4,207 without hypertension) were retrospectively analyzed. The hypertensive group was divided into quartiles according to the initial BP, linearly interpolated mean BP, variability independent of the mean of the BP, and time in therapeutic range (&lt;130 mm Hg for systolic BP [SBP] and &lt;80 mm Hg for diastolic BP) during follow-up. The primary outcome was ischemic stroke and systemic embolism. The mean follow-up duration of the study population was median 2.7 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 4.9 years), and the median number of BP measurements was 14 (interquartile range 6 to 25) times. Strictly controlled initial and interpolated mean BP and low variability in controlled BP (variability independent of the mean) were associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism for both SBP and diastolic BP. A similar risk was observed in patients with strictly controlled SBP (time in therapeutic range under 130 mm Hg &gt;94%) and those without hypertension. In conclusion, continuous and strict maintenance of SBP under 130 mm Hg with low variability at outpatient clinic follow-up reduces the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with hypertension and AF.

Other Topics

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals, with the ACC/AHA CPG suggesting 1 year for reevaluation of adults with a normal BP, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for detection and management of secondary hypertension, definition and management of resistant hypertension, hypertensive urgencies and emergencies, masked and white coat hypertension, hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different race/ethnicity, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, CKD, peripheral vascular disease, DM and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the advantage of single-pill combinations to improve adherence and overcome therapeutic inertia, and team-based care. Both guidelines also focus on implementation, that is, models for delivery of care, use of health information technology, improving quality of care, health literacy, access to care, social and community services, and a patient-specific plan of care. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for treatment of isolated systolic hypertension, and it recommends reserving device-based treatments of hypertension for research settings. The ESC/ESH provides recommendations for managing concomitant CVD risk with specific recommendations for the use of statins, antiplatelet drugs, and oral anticoagulation (in atrial fibrillation), whereas the ACC/AHA largely defers to other ACC/AHA guidelines that cover these topics. Last, both guidelines identify gaps in evidence and provide a summary key message (ESC/ESH) or BP treatment thresholds and goals (ACC/AHA).

### Factors influencing blood pressure control in patients with atrial fibrillation and hypertension in Australian primary care [^92c13571]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a cross-sectional study based on the MedicineInsight database, an Australian primary care database consisting of longitudinal de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) from consenting general practices (GPs) across the country.EHR data included patient demographics, diagnosis, prescribed medications, pathology test results, observations and clinical encounters. MedicineInsight was established in 2011 by NPS MedicineWise; it used non-random sampling methods to recruit GPs across Australia and had recruited 419 practices meeting quality data selection by October 2018.

A subset of the MedicineInsight database was requested, which included patients with cardiovascular risk factors (chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyper/dyslipidaemia) or diagnosed with cardiovascular disease prior to the extraction date of 01 March 2021.

Study sample

We selected a study sample that included patients who were (1) ≥18 years old, (2) had a recorded diagnosis of AF/atrial flutter and hypertension, (3) had ≥3 consultations at the same practice within a 2-year period (‘active patient’) (figure 1). To characterise BP control within this population, we used the average systolic BP (SBP) and average diastolic BP (DBP) over the last 3 years. If the patient’s most recent BP measurement was taken ≥3 years ago, they were excluded from the current analysis due to inability of assessing recent BP control. Data were checked to ensure BP measurements were within reasonable limits (SBP=70–250; DBP=40–150 mm Hg) and were taken post-AF diagnosis.

Wearable devices: new perspective for HBPM (Box 8)

The recent technological advances have stimulated the development of wearable systems for health monitoring. Before regular adoption of wearable technologies for HBPM, important issues should be addressed, related to system accuracy, efficiency, reliability, legislation, interoperability, services, reimbursement and costs and ethical issues. Preliminary results are promising but there is a strong need for larger, long-term and well designed clinical studies to make these novel solutions really applicable in real-life patients’ care. The recent introduction of wearable devices measuring BP at wrist level with the oscillometric method also requires further investigations, also aimed at providing reference values for BP self-measured ‘on the move’.

Box 8

7.1.2 Clinical validation (Box 9)

As with all BP measurement methods, the use of accurate devices is fundamental for the reliable evaluation of HBP. Aiming to standardize the validation procedures of BP monitors and establish minimum accuracy standards, in the last three decades, the US Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the British Hypertension Society, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Working Group on BP Monitoring and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), have developed protocols for clinical validation of BP-measuring devices. Unfortunately, most of the devices available on the market have not been subjected to independent validation using one of these protocols [,–]. In 2018, the AAMI, ESH and ISO developed a single universally acceptable standard (AAMI/ESH/ISO, ISO 81060-2:2018), which is intended to replace all previous protocols. Until data on the accuracy of BP monitors using the Universal Standard become plentiful, it is recommended to use only those that have been validated by any of the above-mentioned protocols. A device that has been successfully validated in a general population sample might not be accurate in a special population [children, pregnancy, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), arm circumference >42 cm] and separate validation in each of these populations is recommended. Devices suggested by manufacturers to have equivalent BP measurement function need their equivalence to be independently checked. Updated lists of successfully validated BP measuring devices using an established protocol, and lists of equivalent devices are provided at.

Atrial fibrillation (AF)—hypertension-related risk and BP control: Hypertension has the highest attributable risk for AF and is present in >80% of patients with AF. BP control in individuals with hypertension reduces the risk for incident AF, and in adults with AF and hypertension, optimal BP control reduces rates of MACE, including stroke. Lifestyle modifications that lower BP may decrease AF recurrence. Small studies and secondary analyses of RCTs reported lower incident AF with ACEi or ARB, 2 meta-analyses suggest reduced recurrent AF with ACEi or ARB, and RCTs plus observational studies suggest that MRAs reduce AF burden. Control of hypertension is a key component of AF management, although optimal hypertension treatment targets in AF remain unclear.

### The effect of heart rate on blood pressure measurement in patients with atrial fibrillation: a cross-sectional study [^ef70fc21]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

This study explored the effect of heart rate (HR) on the stability and accuracy of blood pressure (BP) measurement and the optimal HR range for the most accurate blood pressure measurement in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. A total of 583 patients (383 and 200 with AF and sinus rhythm (SR), respectively) were included in this study. The noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), invasive blood pressure (IBP), and HR were repeatedly measured ten times at 30-second intervals for every patient. Both the AF and SR groups were then subdivided into five groups depending on the HR (i.e., < 60, 60-80, 80-100, 100-120, and ≥120bpm). The difference between the IBP and NIBP (i.e., △SBP) and the coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated, and the stability and accuracy of NIBP measurements were analyzed. CV and △SBP were significantly higher in the AF group. In the AF group, the CV of NIBP was highest when the HR was ≥ 100bpm; and △SBP was significantly lower in the HR groups with 60-80 and 80-100bpm (< 60bpm, △SBP 11.62±2.64mmHg; 60-80bpm, △SBP 7.10±1.92mmHg; 80-100bpm, △SBP 7.10±2.95mmHg; 100-120bpm, △SBP 10.52±2.72mmHg; ≥120bpm, △SBP 14.15±3.61mmHg, P<0.05). The stability and accuracy of the NIBP in the SR groups were not affected by the HR. In AF patients, the NIBP stability was low when the HR was high, and the NIBP was often underestimated when the HR was high or low. Sixty to 100bpm is the best HR range for measuring blood pressure in AF patients.

### Validation of an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device employing a novel method to detect atrial fibrillation [^5a0ba97c]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

We evaluated the accuracy of a 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) device with a new irregular heartbeat (IHB) algorithm for detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) during each BP measurement. Ninety patients with a history of elevated BP and some type of arrhythmia (mean age 63.2±10.3 years; 94% with hypertension; 81% with previously diagnosed AF) simultaneously underwent evaluation by 24-hr ABPM with the IHB algorithm and 24-hr Holter electrocardiography (ECG). Among the 3,347 valid readings, 843 readings were considered to indicate an IHB. Among these IHB readings, 195 readings were found to have an AF rhythm by 24-hr Holter ECG. The IHB algorithm showed 100% sensitivity and 79.4% specificity for accurately detecting AF rhythm. An IHB was detected in 12.1% of the measurements during normal rhythm, 48.8% of those during atrial premature complex, and 54.4% of those during ventricular premature complex. The percentage of IHBs detected during normal rhythm was higher in the daytime than at nighttime (16.3% vs. 4.5%, respectively), suggesting that daytime physical activity sometimes induces a false detection of IHBs. The optimal IHB parameters for suggesting potential AF were (1) an IHB burden defined as a percentage of IHB-positive readings in total valid BP measurements >22.5% (84.6% sensitivity, 85.1% specificity; AUC 0.906, p<0.0001) and (2) 2.5 or more consecutive IHBs during 24-hr ABPM (84.6% sensitivity, 83.0% specificity; AUC 0.881, p<0.0001). The novel 24-hr ABPM device with the IHB algorithm assessed herein could contribute to the future comprehensive management of hypertensive patients, with the main goal of preventing cerebrovascular events.

### Age-specific association between cumulative blood pressure exposure and atrial fibrillation risk in adults [^fbeea922]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study highlights the age‐specific impact of cumulative BP exposure on AF risk, with younger adults disproportionately affected. These findings support the need for personalized BP management strategies to reduce AF burden and improve long‐term cardiovascular outcomes. By addressing the cumulative effects of hypertension, clinicians and policymakers can better target interventions to prevent AF and its complications in diverse populations.

### Detection of atrial fibrillation using a modified microlife blood pressure monitor [^ee486b89]. American Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) and for stroke due to AF. Asymptomatic AF can result in a stroke, in patients with risk factors, if it is not detected and treated appropriately. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of an automatic oscillometric sphygmomanometer designed to detect AF.

Methods

The sphygmomanometer incorporates an algorithm for detecting AF while reducing false positive readings due to premature beats. A total of 405 unselected outpatients seen in two cardiology offices were evaluated by taking three sequential device readings and one electrocardiogram (EKG) on each patient.

Results

For detecting AF, the sensitivity was 95% and the specificity 86% with a positive predictive value of 68% and a negative predictive value of 98% for single device readings. For the three sequential device readings grouped together, the sensitivity was 97% and the specificity was 89%. The device correctly categorized most of the non-AF, abnormal rhythms. The specificity for those in sinus rhythm was 97%.

Conclusions

This device is able to detect AF with high sensitivity and specificity. Use of this device by patients who monitor their blood pressure at home may help detect asymptomatic AF and allow for treatment prior to the development of a stroke.

### Blood pressure control and risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation: results from the apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial [^0b5437ca]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In patients with AF and hypertension, having any elevated BP measurements was independently associated with a substantially higher risk of stroke or SE (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.25–1.86). These data strongly support a focus to recognize and treat elevated BP to optimally reduce the risk of stroke in all patients with AF.

### Automated blood pressure measurement in atrial fibrillation: validation process modification and evaluation of a novel professional device which detects atrial fibrillation and adapts its blood pressure measurement algorithm [^39dc1d09]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Blood pressure (BP) measurement in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients is problematic and automated monitors are regarded as inaccurate. The optimal procedure for validating BP monitors in AF is questionable. This study evaluated the accuracy of a novel professional oscillometric upper-arm cuff device (Microlife WatchBP Office), which has an algorithm for detecting AF and then applies an AF-specific BP measurement algorithm. BP variability, which is inherently increased in AF patients, was considered in the analysis.

Methods

Subjects with sustained AF were included in a validation study using the same arm sequential measurement method of the Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018) for special populations. Analysis was performed in all subjects and separately in those with and without high reference BP variability (>12/8mmHg SBP/DBP).

Results

Thirty-five subjects with 105 paired test/reference BP measurements were included (mean age 76.3±8.4 years, reference SBP/DBP 128.2±19.5/72.5±12.1mmHg, pulse rate 68.3±14.9bpm). Validation Criterion 1 (mean difference±SD) was 0.0±7.7/0.2±7.0mmHg in all 105 BP pairs (threshold ≤5±8mmHg). Criterion 1 was 0.5±6.1/-0.2±6.8mmHg in 18 subjects (54 BP pairs) with low reference BP variability and -0.6±9.2/0.6±7.3mmHg in 17 (51 pairs) with high variability. Criterion 1 did not differ in pulse rate < 70 vs. ≥ 70 bpm Validation Criterion 2 (SD of differences for 35 individuals) was 5.38/6.20mmHg (SBP/DBP; threshold ≤6.95/6.95).

Conclusion

A technology which detects AF and activates an AF-specific BP measurement algorithm introduces a challenging solution for clinical practice. Validation of BP monitors in AF patients should not ignore their inherently high BP variability.

### Different impact factors for accurate oscillometric blood pressure measurement between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation [^9300bdb4]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

This study was conducted to evaluate whether the impact factor on the accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure (BP) is different between the patients with atrial affiliation (AF) and sinus rhythm (SR). This study included 124 AF patients and 98 SR patients who underwent coronary arteriography. Upper arm oscillometric and intro-aortic BP were simultaneously measured three times, and the averages were recorded as final values, respectively. The difference between oscillometric and intro-aortic BP was recorded as delta BP. For reducing the influence of baseline BP on delta BP, a percentage difference (PD-BP) was calculated with the formula: PD-BP=delta BP/intro-aortic BP×100%. The oscillometric SBP and DBP levels slightly underestimated intro-aortic BP (by 2.2/1.6mmHg) in the SR group, but significantly underestimated (by 5.8/4.8mmHg) in the AF group. Age was negatively correlated with delta SBP and positively with delta DBP in SR patients, but not correlated in AF patients. Otherwise, ventricular rate (VR) was negatively correlated with delta SBP or delta DBP in AF, which indicated that the accuracy of oscillometric BP declined as the VR increased. With intro-aortic BP as reference, the accuracy of oscillometric BP in AF patients is lower than SR patients. Meanwhile, age may impact the oscillometric BP accuracy in SR patients, but VR may impact that in AF patients.

### Blood pressure in atrial fibrillation and in sinus rhythm during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: data from the TEMPLAR project [^550b5470]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

However, uncertainties regarding the accuracy of BP measurements in patients with ongoing AF have been emphasized, especially for automated devices, which are used for home BP and ABPM, and general practice guidelines for the use of automated devices in AF are lacking. Two meta-analyses comparing manual (mercury or aneroid) sphygmomanometers to automated (oscillometric or automated Korotkoff) home BP and ABPM devices in AF showed a reasonably good conformity between measurements in pooled analyses. However, all studies included were performed in a hospital setting, comparing short sets of measurements at rest. In addition, considerable heterogeneity according to type and brand of device, and small samples in the studies, did not allow for general recommendations and the authors emphasized the need for validation of out-of-office BP measurement in AF. Of note, inter-observer and intra-observer variability of BP measurements with mercury sphygmomanometers were reported greater during AF than in sinus rhythm (SR), leaving doubts about the manual sphygmomanometers as reference method in AF. BP may change during AF, as compared to SR, due to hemodynamic alterations. Some studies comparing BP in AF and in SR in the same subjects before and after direct current cardioversion to restore SR suggest a trend for higher systolic and lower diastolic BP in SR. However, results are inconsistent, study populations were small, and comparisons were not made to intra-arterial BP. One recent study comparing intra-aortic BP to brachial BP assessed by an oscillometric method showed a larger difference to invasive measurements in patients in AF than in those in SR. This suggests differences in BP to be more dependent on technical than on hemodynamic issues.

### How to evaluate BP measurements using the oscillometric method in atrial fibrillation: the value of pulse rate variation [^80b2d4ec]. Hypertension Research (2016). Low credibility.

An oscillometric device is recommended for blood pressure (BP) measurement in atrial fibrillation (AF), but there is still controversy concerning its accuracy. Therefore, evaluation of BP values in AF patients remains a challenge. This study included 251 patients with AF and 154 participants with sinus rhythm (SR). Pulse rate (PR) and BP were measured using an oscillometric device three times. The differences between the highest and lowest PR and the systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) were calculated as ΔPR, ΔSBP and ΔDBP, respectively. AF patients were stratified with respect to ΔPR in 0-5, 6-10, 11-15 and >15 subgroups. The AF group had a greater ΔPR (12.1±8.6 vs. 4.10±3.21 b.p.m., P<0.001), ΔSBP and ΔDBP than the SR group at similar SBP and DBP. A positive correlation existed between ΔPR and ΔSBP (r=0.255, P<0.001) in AF patients, but no correlation was found in SR subjects. Meanwhile, the ΔSBP in the 0-5 and 6-10 subgroups (9.58±5.61 and 10.67±6.77 vs. 8.45±5.25mmHg, nonsignificant) was similar to the SR group, whereas ΔSBP in the 11-15 and >15 subgroups was significantly greater than the SR group. Regardless of ΔPR, the ΔDBP in the AF group was significantly greater than that of the SR group. The AF patients who exhibited greater variability in their PR also had a greater variability in their SBP readings. The SBP measurement for AF patients is accurate as the measurement for patients with SR if the ΔPR is of 0-10 b.p.m. in AF.

### Accumulated hypertension burden on atrial fibrillation risk in diabetes mellitus: a nationwide population study [^1c46cc12]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of accumulated hypertension burden

During the health examination, a trained clinician measured the patient’s brachial blood pressure (BP) with a sphygmomanometer or an oscillometer with an appropriate-sized cuff, with the patient in the sitting position, after at least 5 min of rest. The BP measured at each health examination was classified into four categories: ‘no hypertension’ (systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 80 mmHg); stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mmHg and DBP 80–89 mmHg); stage 2 hypertension (SBP 140–159 mmHg and 90–99 mmHg); and stage 3 hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 100 mmHg), consistent with previous hypertension guidelines. We used the basic hypertension definitions from the 2017 ACC guideline for high BP and divided stage 2 hypertension into 2 groups: stage 2 (SBP 140–159 mmHg and 90–99 mmHg) and stage 3 (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 100 mmHg) for further detailed evaluation of hypertension burden.

To quantify hypertension burden, we used a semiquantitative scoring system for the BP measured at each health examination: 0 points for no hypertension, 1 point for stage 1 hypertension, 2 points for stage 2 hypertension, and 3 points for stage 3 hypertension. To estimate the accumulation of hypertension status, the above grouping was applied to three consecutively performed health examinations, and the points from each health examination were summed for each subject. As a result, the patients were categorized into 10 groups based on hypertension burden (0–9) after three consecutive health examinations. Groups 1 to 9 were regrouped into three clusters: 1’ (1–3), 2’ (4–6), and 3’ (7–9), with group 0 as the reference group (Fig. 1). In additional statistical analysis, we selected subjects of SBP < 130 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg and assigned 0 point to normal BP (SBP < 120 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg) and 1 point to prehypertension (SBP < 130 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg). And the patients were categorized into 4 groups of 0–3.

### Screening for atrial fibrillation: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^0fb76cac]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) screening protocols and detection yields—mSToPS and SCREEN-AF trials—are summarized as follows: The mHealth Screening to Prevent Strokes (mSToPS) trial (n = 2659) randomized participants to screening with 14-day episodes of continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring with a patch 3 months apart or to delayed screening, while SCREEN-AF randomized 856 participants to a similar intervention with a home blood pressure monitor used twice daily during each 2-week ECG monitoring period. The mean age of participants in this study was 80 years and all were required to have hypertension, and these 2 trials reported statistically significant absolute risk increases of 3% and 4.8% in detection of AF for screening vs no screening or delayed screening. The USPSTF found no trials that compared screening for AF with consumer-oriented devices vs no screening. SCREEN-AF also reported screening accuracy for an oscillometric blood pressure monitor twice daily over 4 weeks, with sensitivity 0.35 (95% CI, 0.15-0.59) and specificity 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.85) compared with continuous ECG monitoring over the same 4 weeks.

### How to demonstrate the prognostic impact of interdialytic home blood pressure variability in dialytic patients [^b8389b5f]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Dong et al.investigated the prognostic impact of interdialytic home blood pressure variability (BPV) in individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. They demonstrated that an incremental interdialytic home BPV was associated with mortality in this cohort. Several concerns have been raised.

In the authors' study, home blood pressure was recorded four times a day for a week on a nondialysis day and their variability was calculated.Another concern is the prognostic impact of intraday BPV during a day or interday BPV during several days.

Blood pressure recorded either predialysis or postdialysis displays a U‐shaped curve with mortality among dialysis patients.In the authors' study, they did not adjust for systolic blood pressure to evaluate the prognostic impact of BPV.Patients with low systolic blood pressure may have incremental mortality even though they have high BPV.

Incremental BPV was associated with not only cardiac death but also all‐cause death.Could the authors state detailed causes of noncardiac death? Also, an incremental number of dialysis patients are found to have severe aortic stenosis, which can be treated by transcatheter aortic valve replacement, if applicable.The prevalence of such diseases may increase as incremental BPV. Did the authors' patients have any valvular diseases?

Accurate measurement of blood pressure is challenging in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is high in dialysis patients.Atrial fibrillation is associated with mortality and morbidity. The indication of anti‐coagulants in dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation is controversial. Moreover, percutaneous left atrial appendage closure in this cohort has recently become available with acceptable feasibility.Do the authors have any individuals with atrial fibrillation?

### Blood pressure control and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (from the ORBIT-AF registry) [^6ddf3934]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and its association with clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients in community practice are poorly characterized. In patients with AF, we sought to (1) examine the prevalence of baseline uncontrolled hypertension and the overall change in SBP control, (2) identify predictors of uncontrolled SBP over 2 years of follow-up, and (3) determine the relation between SBP and clinical outcomes. We analyzed 10,132 patients with AF at 176 clinics in the ORBIT-AF registry between 2010 and 2014, classified as: (1) no history of hypertension; (2) controlled hypertension (baseline SBP <140 mm Hg); (3) and uncontrolled hypertension (baseline SBP >140 mm Hg). Predictors of SBP >140 mm Hg at baseline or in follow-up were identified with pooled logistic regression. Random effects Cox regression models were used to compare cardiovascular outcomes and major bleeding as a function of continuous, time-dependent SBP. Overall 8,383 (83%) of patients with AF had hypertension. Of these, 24.2% (n = 2032) had uncontrolled baseline SBP, with little change over 2 years. Predictors of elevated follow-up SBP included uncontrolled baseline SBP, females, previous percutaneous coronary intervention, and diabetes. For every 5 mm Hg increase in follow-up SBP, the adjusted risk of stroke or systemic embolism or transient ischemic attack (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.08, p = 0.01), myocardial infarction (aHR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11, p = 0.04), and major bleeding (aHR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06, p = 0.04) increased modestly. In conclusion, in patients with AF, higher SBP was associated with increasing adverse events; therefore, more rigorous blood pressure control should be emphasized.

### Systolic blood pressure and effects of screening for atrial fibrillation with long-term continuous monitoring (a LOOP substudy) [^4d35688a]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a well-known risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and stoke, but data on the interaction between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and effects of AF screening are lacking.

Methods

The LOOP Study randomized AF-naïve individuals aged 70 to 90 years with additional stroke risk factors to either screening with implantable loop recorder (ILR) and anticoagulation initiation upon detection of AF episodes ≥6 minutes, or usual care. In total, 5997 participants with available baseline SBP measurements were included in this substudy. Outcomes were analyzed according to the time-to-first-event principle using cause-specific Cox models.

Results

The hazard ratio of stroke or systemic arterial embolism for ILR versus control decreased with increasing SBP. ILR screening yielded a 44% risk reduction of stroke or systemic arterial embolism among participants with SBP ≥150 mmHg (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56 [0.37-0.83]). Within the ILR group, SBP≥150 mmHg was associated with a higher incidence of AF episodes ≥24 hours than lower SBP (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.70 [1.08-2.69]) but not with the overall occurrence of AF (adjusted P >0.05).

Conclusions

The impact of AF screening on thromboembolic events increased with increasing blood pressure. SBP≥150 mmHg was associated with a >1.5-fold increased risk of AF episodes ≥24 hours, along with an almost 50% risk reduction of stroke or systemic arterial embolism by ILR screening compared to lower blood pressure. These findings should be considered hypothesis-generating and warrant further study.

### 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure telemonitoring in patients at risk of atrial fibrillation: results from the TEMPLAR project [^a7ba7240]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the most common risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). The ability to screen for potential AF during blood pressure (BP) measurement may be a valuable tool for early AF detection. This study evaluated the frequency of irregular pulse rates suggestive of AF in subjects undergoing ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and compared the characteristics of patients at low risk of presumed AF vs. those at high risk. ABPM recordings were obtained in 4419 subjects aged ≥65 years visiting 304 community pharmacies, with clinically validated automated monitors equipped with an algorithm for detecting possible AF episodes during BP measurement. Subjects with <30% of the readings suggestive of AF were categorized as having a low risk of AF, and those with ≥30% of readings were classified as high risk. A total of 531 subjects (12.0%) were categorized as having a high risk of AF, with the risk increasing with advancing age. Subjects at high risk of AF had lower average systolic BP, higher average diastolic BP and pulse rate (PR), increased BP and PR variabilities, and blunted sleep-associated reductions in BP and PR. In repeated recordings, the reliability of the AF detection algorithm per se was good (kappa 0.476, p=0.0001; intraclass correlation coefficient 0.56, p=0.0001). Simultaneous BP measurement and screening for potential AF by ABPM in elderly people in clinical practice may help improve BP control and the detection of subjects at high risk of AF. However, a finding of presumed AF must always be confirmed by an electrocardiogram (ECG).

### The impact of atrial fibrillation on accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure measurement: effect of ventricular rate [^7169793b]. Hypertension Research (2020). Medium credibility.

This study evaluated the impact of ventricular rate (VR) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with oscillometric BP measurements. This study included 138 patients with AF and 112 patients with sinus rhythm (SR) who underwent coronary angiography. Left arm BP was measured three times with an oscillometric device, and the average was recorded as the final oscillometric value. At the same time, the average of three intra-aortic BP readings was used as invasive values. Delta BP was the difference between intra-aortic and oscillometric BP. Meanwhile, the BP percentage difference (PD-BP) was calculated with the following formula: PD-BP=(delta BP/intra-aortic BP)×100%. Based on the VR, four subgroups of AF and SR patients, <80, 80-99, 100-120, and >120bpm, were created, and the mean PD-BP for both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly higher in the AF group than in the SR group. Moreover, the mean PD-SBP values gradually increased as VR increased in both groups. More importantly, the difference in PD-SBP between the AF and SR groups increased as VR increased: when VR was <80bpm, the levels were similar (-2.0±3.5 vs. -1.4±2.7mmHg, NS), but these values in AF patients were significantly higher when VR was 80-99bpm (-3.7±5.0 vs. -1.8±2.3mmHg, p<0.05), 100-120bpm (-6.1±4.3 vs. -2.3±1.9mmHg, p<0.05) and >120bpm (-7.8±4.9 vs. -2.9±1.7mmHg, p<0.05). The accuracy of oscillometric BP measurements are dependent on the ventricular rate in AF patients even after three measurements, and a higher ventricular rate may result in larger underestimations of oscillometric BP.

### Opportunistic detection of atrial fibrillation using blood pressure monitors: a systematic review [^529855af]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects around 2% of the population and early detection is beneficial, allowing patients to begin potentially life-saving anticoagulant therapies. Blood pressure (BP) monitors may offer an opportunity to screen for AF.

Aim

To identify and appraise studies which report the diagnostic accuracy of automated BP monitors used for opportunistic AF detection.

Methods

A systematic search was performed of the MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and EMBASE literature databases. Papers were eligible if they described primary studies of the evaluation of a BP device for AF detection, were published in a peer-reviewed journal and reported values for the sensitivity and specificity. Included studies were appraised using the QUADAS-2 tool to assess their risk of bias and applicability to opportunistic AF detection. Values for the sensitivity and specificity of AF detection were extracted from each paper and compared.

Results and Conclusions

We identified seven papers evaluating six devices from two manufacturers. Only one study scored low risk in all of the QUADAS-2 domains. All studies reported specificity >85% and 6 reported sensitivity >90%. The studies showed that BP devices with embedded algorithms for detecting arrhythmias show promise as screening tools for AF, comparing favourably with manual pulse palpation. But the studies used different methodologies and many were subject to potential bias. More studies are needed to more precisely define the sensitivity and specificity of opportunistic screening for AF during BP measurement before its clinical utility in the population of interest can be assessed fully.

### Screening for asymptomatic atrial fibrillation while monitoring the blood pressure at home: trial of regular versus irregular pulse for prevention of stroke (TRIPPS 2.0) [^54a4e924]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of strokes. Physician screening for AF has been recommended. Home screening for AF may increase the likelihood of detecting asymptomatic AF in patients at risk for stroke because of AF. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and accuracy of screening for AF when taking home blood pressure (BP) measurements using an automatic AF-detecting BP monitor. Subjects aged >64 years or those with hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, or previous stroke were enrolled by their primary physicians and given the AF-BP monitor and an electrocardiographic event monitor to use at home for 30 days. The AF-BP monitor reading was compared with the electrocardiographic reading to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the device for detecting AF. A total of 160 subjects were enrolled, with 10 withdrawing, 1 excluded, and 10 with no AF-BP monitor logs or electrocardiographic recordings. Of the 139 subjects included, 14 had known AF. There was a total of 3,316 days with AF-BP monitor readings and electrocardiographic readings. On the basis of the initial daily AF-BP monitor readings, the AF-BP monitor demonstrated sensitivity of 99.2% and specificity of 92.9% for detecting AF. Two subjects with no histories of AF had AF-BP monitor readings of AF that were confirmed by the electrocardiographic monitor. One of these subjects was started on warfarin. In conclusion, home screening for asymptomatic AF while taking BP measurements can be performed accurately. This can be used to detect new AF, allowing treatment with anticoagulation to reduce the future risk for stroke.

Stroke risk modifiers—Patients with AF at intermediate to low (<2%) annual risk of ischemic stroke can benefit from consideration of factors that might modify their risk, including AF characteristics (eg, burden), nonmodifiable risk factors (sex), and dynamic or modifiable factors (blood pressure control) to inform shared decision-making discussions.

### Home blood pressure monitors owned by participants in a large decentralised clinical trial in hypertension: the treatment in morning versus evening (TIME) study [^a107af10]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Future research

Participants in the TIME study who reported owning their own HBPM were invited to submit home blood pressure measurements obtained using their HBPM through the TIME study web interface at intervals throughout the study. These measurements could be analysed to look for any evidence of variation in systolic and diastolic pressures associated with validation status. A qualitative study exploring the decision-making process of patients with hypertension when purchasing a HBPM may be warranted to determine factors which could influence the choice of HBPM. In addition, new HBPMs are becoming available, some with additional capabilities, such as detection of atrial fibrillation, or night-time blood pressures and it would be interesting to re-evaluate HBPM ownership again in the future.

Areas for further research—bleeding assessment, outcomes, special populations, and candidate concepts—state that “documentation of a bleeding score may be beneficial but that more data are needed before calculation of a bleeding score is advanced to the level of a performance or quality measure,” and although the “2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation” references HAS-BLED, “no specific guideline recommendations are included with regard to bleeding risk assessment.” The committee notes that “future research is needed to determine whether bleeding scores can lead to actionable risk stratification of patients” and that “there is insufficient evidence to support the use of an outcome measure (eg, stroke rate per capita) as a measure of quality of AF care.” It also acknowledges “patients with adult congenital heart disease some of whom have residual atrial septal defects that may change the indication for anticoagulation” and that “these patients are not featured in the CHA2DS2-VASc” but “are at greater risk of stroke with atrial fibrillation.” Additional concepts listed for exploration include “Shared decision making between the physician and patient on whether a rhythm or rate control strategy should be pursued,” “Toxicity from amiodarone screening every 6 to 12 months,” “Inappropriate use of anticoagulation in patients with extreme low risk of stroke (ie, CHA2DS2-VASc=0),” “Prevention of re-occurrence of atrial fibrillation or flutter by controlling blood pressure in patients with hypertension,” and “Exploring the feasibility of integration of pharmacokinetic guides for dose adjustments for new oral anticoagulants (eg renal conditions, or other conditions).”

### Increased arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of atrial fibrillation in hypertensive patients [^29f1dbfa]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia, and confers a high risk of stroke and heart failure. Hypertension and ageing are two important risk factors of incident atrial fibrillation and are both associated with increased arterial stiffness. The possible relationship between arterial stiffness and atrial fibrillation is insufficiently documented and is probably complex. We tested these relations in a cohort of hypertensive patients.

Methods

The population belongs to a registry which includes patients referred before administration of antihypertensive treatment and fulfilling the following criteria: office blood pressure (BP) above 140/90mmHg, essential hypertension, no history of cardiovascular events, type 1 diabetes or atrial fibrillation, 24-h ambulatory measurement of BP coupled with the measurement of timing of Korotkoff sounds to assess arterial stiffness [indexed theoretical value of QKD interval for a SBP of 100 mmHg, at heart rate (HR) of 60 b.p.m., indexed for height and QRS duration (QKDh)]. An echocardiographic examination was carried out at baseline in the majority of patients. Atrial fibrillation-free survival was analysed with a Cox model including sex, diabetes, smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, QKDh, average 24-h pulse pressure and mean BP, mean 24-h HR, BMI and left atrial diameter (LAD), when available.

Results

We included 853 patients and recorded 67 new onsets of atrial fibrillation (mean follow-up=102±62 months). Analysis found three variables significantly and independently linked to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation: age, QKDh and 24-h average HR. When LAD was introduced (n=480, 35 incident atrial fibrillation), three variables were linked to incident atrial fibrillation: age, QKDh and LAD.

Conclusion

Arterial stiffness is a strong predictor of future atrial fibrillation in hypertensive patients, independently of age, 24-h pulse pressure and LAD.

### Opportunistic detection of atrial fibrillation using blood pressure monitors: a systematic review [^4c3089f1]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Reference standard

The reference standard for AF diagnosis is a 12-lead ECG interpreted by a certified cardiologist.Of the seven papers examined, four performed a 12-lead ECG prior to or shortly after the BP measurement that was interpreted by at least one cardiologist blinded to the result of the index test.These studies were considered to have a low risk of bias and high applicability to the review question (likely to correctly classify AF).

The three remaining studies were either unclear about their use of a reference standard or adopted different approaches. Stergiou et al made the diagnosis of AF on the basis of a 12-lead ECG recording interpreted by a cardiologist; however, no blinding was mentioned (questionable risk of bias). Wiesel et al did not state the number of leads used for the ECG nor how the ECG was interpreted, so the risk of bias and applicability were classified as questionable. The remaining study,which was the only one to assess a device in the home environment, used an ECG event monitor that was used by the participant to obtain a 60 s recording prior to each BP reading. This method is less likely to correctly diagnose AF (low applicability); however, the results were interpreted by a blinded cardiologist (low risk of bias).

### Long-term blood pressure trajectories and incident atrial fibrillation in women and men: the troms ø study [^cf35c6cc]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

This large population-based longitudinal study with several observations per subject and a long follow-up provides an unique opportunity to explore associations between long-term individual patterns in BP, hypertension, use of antihypertensive medications, and the risk of incident AF separately in women and men. Blood pressure readings throughout the surveys were obtained with conventional office BP measurement conducted by trained personal using calibrated automated sphygmomanometers and following the same protocol. All AF events were confirmed on electrocardiogram and validated. However, several limitations require comments. First, although conventional office BP measurement has been considered the standard measure of an individual’s BP status and the basis for most epidemiological studies, other BP measurement techniques, such as out-of-office BP monitoring, provide readings that are more representative for daily life and enable diagnosis of white-coat and masked hypertension.However, there is no evidence suggesting that using other BP measurement techniques would change profiles/shapes of the BP trajectories. Of note, mean office BP recorded in research settings has been shown to be 10/7 mmHg lower than office BP measured in routine clinical practice.This difference must be considered when it comes to the clinical implications of our findings. Second, over the 16 years of follow-up BP was measured at three time points. Although four or five BP measurements would allow estimating more complex cubic or quadratic trends providing more detailed long-term BP patterns, three time points has been reported to be enough for proper estimation of developmental trajectories.Besides, numerous repeated measurements usually result in greater attrition rates that weaken statistical precision and potentially introduce bias. Third, many of the study participants attended only two of the three surveys limiting the possibility to check whether altering the trajectories would alter outcomes, potentially reducing the robustness of the trajectory analyses, and introducing some between-group bias. However, the associations between trajectory groups and AF risk were adjusted for the number of attended surveys per subject. Fourth, we lacked detailed information on antihypertensive treatment, such as type of drugs or doses. Moreover, information on use of antihypertensive medications as well as on physical activity and smoking was self-reported which might introduce information bias. However, in a cohort study such as ours, this bias would result in non-differential misclassification.

### Self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring-million hearts ® (...) [^b3e475a5]. millionhearts.hhs.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Self-Measured Blood Pressure Monitoring Strong scientific evidence shows that self-measured blood pressure monitoring, also known as home blood pressure monitoring, plus clinical support helps people with hypertension lower their blood pressure. SMBP monitoring is the regular measurement of blood pressure by the patient outside the clinical setting, either at home or elsewhere. SMBP requires the use of a home blood pressure measurement device by the patient to measure blood pressure at different points in time. This site provides a list of clinically validated blood pressure devices, based on the American Medical Association’s established criteria to independently validate clinical accuracy. This one-page overview outlines the viability, costs, and returns for implementing an SMBP monitoring program based on Medicare reimbursement. Self-Measurement: How Patients and Care Teams Are Bringing Blood Pressure to Control.

This report from the Public Health Informatic Institute provides key findings from a national health information technology assessment on SMBP and identifies gaps, barriers, and recommendations to advance the collection, transfer, and use of patient-generated SMBP data to improve hypertension management.

### Opportunistic detection of atrial fibrillation using blood pressure monitors: a systematic review [^7987e1a0]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in August 2014 of the MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and EMBASE literature databases using the keywords ‘blood pressure device’ and ‘atrial fibrillation screening’ and subject headings ‘blood pressure determination’, ‘blood pressure monitoring, ambulatory’, ‘sphygmomanometers’, ‘atrial fibrillation’ and ‘cardiac arrhythmias’. The search was restricted to English language, non-animal studies published between January 1990 and August 2014. Papers were eligible if they described a primary evaluation of at least one BP device for the detection of AF, were published in a peer-reviewed journal and reported values for the sensitivity and specificity of AF detection in the population studied. One person (SAK) screened the identified titles and abstracts for eligible studies. Studies that fulfilled all of the eligibility criteria and those which could not be ruled out on the basis of title and abstract were retrieved in full-text form. These were further reviewed until only studies that fulfilled the eligibility criteria remained.

The study characteristics and reported values for the sensitivity and specificity of AF detection, compared with a reference standard, were extracted from each paper. We appraised the studies using the QUADAS-2 toolfor their risk of bias and applicability to the clinical problem (ie, detection of AF during opportunistic screening) against four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard and flow and timing. For each paper, the contingency tables were reconstructed. To ensure consistency, CIs for sensitivity and specificity were estimated using a binomial approximation as described by Clopper and Pearson.
