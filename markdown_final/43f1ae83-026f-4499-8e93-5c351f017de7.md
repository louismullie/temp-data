## Question

Prominent atrophy of bilateral temporal and frontal lobes.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret prominent bilateral frontal and temporal lobe atrophy on MRI and how to refine the differential diagnosis accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the imaging pattern and its anatomic distribution. Then, I should correlate with the clinical syndrome to anchor the phenotype. Next, I will generate a prioritized differential diagnosis, including FTD variants, atypical AD, and other mimics. After that, I need to check for red flags and pitfalls that can mislead diagnosis. Then, I will outline a biomarker-driven workup to resolve uncertainty. Finally, I will synthesize a diagnostic formulation and note management implications, while verifying each step against the literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the imaging pattern and its implications. Prominent bilateral frontal and temporal atrophy strongly suggests a frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) process, particularly behavioral variant FTD, given the canonical involvement of mesial frontal, orbitofrontal, anterior insula, and anterior temporal regions, often with relative sparing of posterior parietal and occipital lobes early on [^116D8pwf] [^112XSVq5]. Wait, let me verify the symmetry point: while bvFTD can be asymmetric, many patients show symmetric or only mildly asymmetric frontotemporal atrophy, and asymmetry alone does not exclude FTD, so I should not over-interpret symmetry as arguing against FTD [^115wbrcc] [^1126r1SM].

> Next, I should review the clinical syndrome to see if it aligns with this anatomy. I need to check for early behavioral change, loss of empathy, disinhibition, apathy, compulsions, and executive dysfunction, which would support bvFTD; I should also screen for early language symptoms (anomia, comprehension loss, word-finding) that might push me toward semantic variant PPA if anterior temporal atrophy is asymmetrically left-predominant, or toward nonfluent/agrammatic PPA if left frontal opercular/perisylvian regions are more affected [^113SztiB] [^115wbrcc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if memory is disproportionately impaired early, that would tilt me back toward Alzheimer's disease, so I need to document the relative timing of memory versus behavior/language changes carefully [^111d4VWD].

> Now, I will prioritize the differential diagnosis. Most likely is bvFTD within the FTLD spectrum given the bilateral frontal and temporal atrophy and the expected behavioral phenotype, with subtyping guided by symptom detail and laterality of atrophy [^113TeAK9]. I should also consider atypical Alzheimer's disease, particularly early-onset or non-amnestic variants, which can present with frontal and temporal atrophy and early behavioral or language changes, so I must not anchor prematurely on FTD just because of the anatomy [^111d4VWD] [^117JUW49]. Less likely but plausible are semantic variant PPA (if asymmetric left anterior temporal atrophy with semantic deficits), right temporal variant FTD (if right-predominant anterior temporal atrophy with prosopagnosia and socioemotional deficits), and primary psychiatric disorders that can mimic bvFTD early on, so I should actively exclude these at the bedside and with ancillary testing [^111HdDEc] [^113SztiB].

> I need to ensure I check for red flags and pitfalls. Let me consider early episodic memory loss and posterior cortical involvement, which would favor AD over pure FTD, whereas relative sparing of posterior parietal/occipital cortex and prominent anterior cingulate/insula atrophy support FTD; but wait, I should double-check because AD can occasionally show anterior-predominant atrophy in early-onset or variant presentations, and FTD can later involve posterior regions, so this distinction is probabilistic rather than absolute [^115AcdEM] [^112iwjH2]. I should also verify the presence of vascular burden or comorbidities that could modify the clinical picture and confound interpretation of atrophy patterns [^111d4VWD].

> Next, I should review a biomarker-driven workup to resolve etiology. I will now examine amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42/tau/ptau to adjudicate AD versus non-AD pathology; a positive amyloid scan increases the likelihood of AD pathophysiology, whereas a negative scan in the right clinical context strengthens FTD likelihood, acknowledging that co-pathology can occur, especially in older adults [^111d4VWD] [^111Sm3hv]. Let me also consider FDG-PET: frontal and/or anterior temporal hypometabolism supports FTD, while posterior cingulate/precuneus hypometabolism with relative frontal sparing supports AD; hold on, I should verify because some FTD variants can show posterior involvement in later stages, so pattern-context matching is key [^112iwjH2] [^112Ln7s5]. If FTD is suspected, I should review genetics, at least MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72, given the substantial familial fraction in FTD and the prognostic and counseling implications [^113TeAK9].

> I should confirm how best to quantify and track the atrophy. Volumetric MRI of frontal, anterior temporal, insula, and cingulate can help stage severity and monitor progression; wait, I need to check whether serial imaging adds value — yes, longitudinal atrophy rates are more sensitive than cross-sectional measures and can help distinguish disease from normal aging and track treatment effects in trials or clinical care when repeated measures are available [^113pPB11] [^1143sW75]. But hold on, I should verify feasibility: visual rating scales are quick and useful clinically, though expert visual reads can miss subtle early FTD, so quantitative tools or machine-learning classifiers can improve sensitivity where available [^116CmDAt] [^113SztiB].

> Let me synthesize a diagnostic formulation. Given prominent bilateral frontal and anterior temporal atrophy, I would formulate "Probable behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration", contingent on documenting progressive behavioral and executive decline and excluding alternative causes. I should assign certainty levels per current criteria and plan biomarker confirmation to move from possible to probable or definite where feasible [^113TARxn] [^113TeAK9]. If amyloid is positive and the clinical picture includes early memory impairment or visuospatial deficits, I should broaden to "mixed FTD-AD" or "atypical AD with frontotemporal atrophy", and if amyloid is negative and behavioral/executive features predominate, FTD remains most likely, while remaining open to phenocopy syndromes and nonprogressive mimics in select cases [^111d4VWD] [^112y9VFo].

> I will now examine management implications. There is no disease-modifying therapy approved for FTD, so management is symptomatic and multidisciplinary, addressing behavioral dyscontrol, safety, caregiver burden, and genetic counseling when relevant; I should confirm that current expert guidance supports pragmatic pharmacotherapy for agitation, apathy, and compulsions, and nonpharmacologic strategies for behavior and caregiver support, while avoiding medications that worsen cognition or increase fall risk [^113TeAK9] [^1121aVhw]. For suspected AD, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine may be reasonable, but I need to ensure the diagnosis is supported by biomarkers before committing to long-term AD-directed therapy, especially when FTD features are prominent [^112XSVq5] [^111d4VWD].

> But wait, what if the anterior temporal atrophy is strikingly asymmetric to the right? In that scenario, I should reconsider and actively evaluate for right temporal variant FTD with early loss of empathy, prosopagnosia, and person-specific semantic impairment, recognizing its mirror-image pattern to semantic variant PPA and the diagnostic challenge of overlapping symptoms with bvFTD and AD; in such cases, detailed neuropsychology and multimodal imaging are especially important to avoid misclassification [^111HdDEc] [^112H6oVb]. Conversely, if the left anterior temporal pole and fusiform show knife-edge atrophy with fluent anomic aphasia, I should pivot toward semantic variant PPA and align counseling and expectations accordingly, noting the strong association with TDP-43 type C pathology [^1129n6pK].

> In summary, prominent bilateral frontal and temporal atrophy on MRI points toward an FTLD spectrum disorder, most often bvFTD, but I should not exclude atypical AD or other mimics without correlating the clinical syndrome and confirming with appropriate biomarkers. A structured, stepwise approach — define the imaging pattern, map to clinical phenotype, generate and test competing diagnoses, and resolve with biomarkers — minimizes error and guides management and counseling most effectively [^113TeAK9] [^111d4VWD].

Prominent bilateral frontal and temporal atrophy most strongly suggests **frontotemporal dementia (FTD)** [^113TeAK9], especially the behavioral variant, and is a core imaging feature in current diagnostic criteria [^1168LArF]. This pattern is also seen in semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) [^notfound] and can occur in atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly early-onset or language/behavioral variants [^115oJJD1] [^1129n6pK] [^117HKcQ7]. Key differentiators include early behavioral/executive decline with relative memory sparing (FTD) [^112XSVq5], asymmetric anterior temporal atrophy (svPPA) [^1129n6pK], and medial temporal/parietal involvement (AD) [^1143sW75]. MRI is the modality of choice to define the pattern [^115AcdEM]; **amyloid PET or CSF Aβ/tau** helps distinguish FTD from AD when uncertain [^113SztiB] [^116tMwAq]. Management is **supportive and symptom-targeted** [^1121aVhw]; prognosis is generally faster progression than AD, with median survival ~7–10 years [^112XSVq5] [^111p99nD].

## Clinical significance and associated neurodegenerative disorders

Prominent bilateral frontal and temporal atrophy is most characteristic of **FTD**, a neurodegenerative disorder with early involvement of frontal and anterior temporal lobes [^113TeAK9]. FTD includes behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) — defined by early behavioral change, disinhibition, apathy, and executive dysfunction — and language variants such as svPPA and nfvPPA [^113TARxn]. bvFTD typically shows bilateral frontal and anterior temporal atrophy with relative sparing of parietal and occipital lobes [^112XSVq5] [^1168LArF]. svPPA shows **asymmetric anterior temporal atrophy**, usually left > right, with severe semantic deficits [^1129n6pK]. Atypical AD can also present with prominent frontal/temporal atrophy, particularly early-onset or language/behavioral variants, and may mimic FTD clinically and radiologically [^113SztiB] [^117JUW49].

## Clinical symptoms and cognitive profiles

| **Disorder** | **Clinical symptoms** | **Cognitive profile** |
|-|-|-|
| FTD (bvFTD) | - Early behavioral change <br/> - Disinhibition <br/> - Apathy <br/> - Loss of empathy <br/> - Executive dysfunction <br/> - Relative memory sparing [^112XSVq5] | - Executive impairment <br/> - Poor impulse control <br/> - Social cognition deficits <br/> - Relatively preserved memory [^1132mDka] |
| svPPA | - Fluent speech <br/> - Severe anomia <br/> - Loss of word meaning <br/> - Semantic deficits <br/> - Behavioral changes (less prominent) [^111KHWUo] | - Severe semantic impairment <br/> - Anomia <br/> - Preserved grammar and fluency <br/> - Relative memory sparing [^111KHWUo] |
| Atypical AD | - Early behavioral/language changes <br/> - Memory impairment <br/> - Executive dysfunction <br/> - Visuospatial deficits [^111d4VWD] | - Memory impairment <br/> - Executive dysfunction <br/> - Language deficits <br/> - Visuospatial impairment [^117JUW49] |

## Neuroimaging findings and diagnostic criteria

MRI is the **gold standard** for delineating frontal and temporal atrophy patterns [^115AcdEM]. bvFTD shows bilateral frontal and anterior temporal atrophy with relative sparing of parietal/occipital lobes [^112XSVq5]. svPPA shows asymmetric anterior temporal atrophy (usually left > right) with involvement of the temporal pole, amygdala, and anterior hippocampus [^115wbrcc]. Atypical AD may show frontal/temporal atrophy with additional medial temporal and parietal involvement [^115AcdEM]. Current diagnostic criteria for bvFTD include frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy on MRI as a supportive feature [^1168LArF].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **key differentiators** include:

- **FTD vs. AD**: FTD shows early behavioral/executive decline with relative memory sparing; AD shows early memory impairment with posterior (parietal/temporal) involvement [^113SztiB] [^115AcdEM].
- **svPPA vs. bvFTD**: svPPA has asymmetric anterior temporal atrophy with severe semantic deficits; bvFTD has bilateral frontal/anterior temporal atrophy with behavioral changes [^1129n6pK] [^112wUU4D].
- **Atypical AD vs. FTD**: Amyloid PET or CSF Aβ/tau helps distinguish AD from FTD when clinical/imaging overlap exists [^111d4VWD] [^113SztiB].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **multidisciplinary and supportive**:

- **Pharmacological**: SSRIs for behavioral symptoms; antipsychotics cautiously for severe agitation; no disease-modifying drugs approved [^1121aVhw].
- **Non-pharmacological**: Behavioral interventions, caregiver support, speech therapy, occupational therapy, safety planning [^notfound].
- **Genetic counseling**: Consider for familial cases or early-onset disease [^112nc1Kr].

---

## Prognosis and progression

FTD generally progresses faster than AD, with **median survival ~7–10 years** from onset [^111p99nD] [^112XSVq5]. Disease course varies by subtype: **bvFTD** often progresses rapidly, whereas **svPPA** may progress more slowly [^111p99nD] [^113FurCK]. Early-onset disease and severe behavioral symptoms are associated with faster progression and poorer prognosis [^notfound].

Prominent bilateral frontal and temporal atrophy most strongly suggests **FTD**, particularly bvFTD, but also consider svPPA and atypical AD. MRI defines the pattern; **amyloid PET or CSF Aβ/tau** help distinguish FTD from AD when uncertain. Management is supportive and symptom-targeted; prognosis is generally faster than AD, with median survival ~7–10 years [^1121aVhw] [^112XSVq5] [^111p99nD].

### Neuropsychiatric symptoms and imbalance of atrophy in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia [^113NNZDF]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to asymmetry, the dorsal or ventral predominance of atrophy can differ among patients with bvFTD and could also relate to symptom heterogeneity. Dorsal prefrontal regions are responsible for cognitive and behavioral control as well as emotion regulation. Conversely, ventral frontotemporal regions and ventral subcortical structures, such as nucleus accumbens and amygdala are involved in salience detection, reward, and emotional reactivity (Etkin et al; Rosen et al.). Data‐driven approaches have grouped patients with bvFTD into distinct patterns of atrophy, with some groups involving more frontal atrophy, some more temporal, or others involving both equally (Ranasinghe et al; Whitwell, Przybelski, et al.). These studies have differed in their determination of whether these atrophy patterns are associated with distinct behavioral profiles. Most patients with bvFTD have an underlying pathological diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTLD is divided into subtypes, with some associated with dorsal or ventral predominance of atrophy. In a prior autopsy study, we found that subtypes that on average show greater temporal lobe involvement displayed greater loss of empathy and compulsive behavior than subtypes that tended to involve more dorsal frontal atrophy (Perry et al.). Temporal lobe involvement, particularly on the right side, can occur to a variable extent in patients with ventral atrophy in bvFTD and has been associated with a variety of behavioral features (Chan et al; Rosso et al; Thompson et al.). To our knowledge, previous studies have not specifically investigated clinical profiles associated with an imbalance between dorsal and ventral atrophy, referred to here as "dorsality".

The goal of this study was to investigate the frequency and clinical correlates of frontotemporal asymmetry (right vs. left) and dorsality (ventral vs. dorsal predominance) of atrophy in a large cohort of patients with bvFTD. We aimed to describe the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients who differ in imbalance of brain atrophy. We hypothesized that bvFTD patients with right‐lateralized frontotemporal atrophy would exhibit greater disinhibition and abnormal eating behaviors whereas those with left‐lateralized atrophy would show greater speech and language impairments (Gainotti; Perry et al; Regard & Landis; Whitwell et al; Woolley et al.). We also hypothesized that there would be greater cognitive and executive impairment in patients with dorsal predominant atrophy and more prominent socioemotional symptoms in the ventral predominant atrophy group.

### Fourteen years later: reviewing the diagnostic criteria for behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia [^113TARxn]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis can range in certainty between "possible", "probable", or "definite". A "possible" diagnosis of bvFTD is indicated in the presence of progressive emergence and recurrence of at least three of the core clinical features, in any combination. A diagnosis of "probable" bvFTD is reached in the presence of documented decline in functional ability, as well as evidence of characteristic changes on structural or functional brain neuroimaging. Finally, a diagnosis of "definite" bvFTD is established in the presence of histopathological confirmation or identification of a causative gene mutation. Retrospective analyses of these diagnostic criteria have demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity for both young‐ and late‐onset bvFTD.

Fourteen years since their publication, it has become increasingly apparent that these diagnostic criteria are not without their limitations. For example, the operationalization of these criteria is not provided, nor is the timeframe for what constitutes an "early" change. The threshold for detection of behavioral change from a pre‐disease baseline requires more investigation, particularly across culturally and linguistically diverse groups. Similarly, the cognitive profile of bvFTD is far from uniform. Executive dysfunction is neither uniquely nor exclusively impaired in bvFTD. Additionally, a subset of bvFTD patients present with marked episodic memory deficits in excess of impaired attention or prefrontal retrieval processes. Indeed, accumulating evidence has shown that the presence of marked episodic memory deficits does not exclude a diagnosis of bvFTD and that visuospatial deficits are more common than previously thought at various disease stages.

### Alzheimer's disease or behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia? Review of key points toward an accurate clinical and neuropsychological diagnosis [^114eVqo8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the most common neurodegenerative early-onset dementias. Despite the fact that both conditions have a very distinctive clinical pattern, they present with an overlap in their cognitive and behavioral features that may lead to misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. The current review intends to summarize briefly the main differences at the clinical, neuropsychological, and behavioral levels, in an attempt to suggest which aspects would facilitate an adequate diagnosis in a clinical setting, especially in Latin American and low- and middle-income countries, where the resources needed for a differential diagnosis (such as MRI or biomarkers) are not always available. A timely diagnosis of AD and FTD have significant implications for the medical management and quality of life of patients and careers.

### Automated speech analysis to differentiate frontal and right anterior temporal lobe atrophy in frontotemporal dementia [^114HeEyK]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) includes behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD) with predominant frontal atrophy and semantic behavioral-variant FTD (sbvFTD) with predominant right anterior temporal lobe (rATL) atrophy. These variants present diagnostic challenges because of overlapping symptoms and neuroanatomy. Accurate differentiation is crucial for clinical trial inclusion targeting TDP-43 proteinopathies. This study investigated whether automated speech analysis can distinguish between FTD-related rATL and frontal atrophy, potentially offering a noninvasive diagnostic tool.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used data from the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. Using stepwise logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, we analyzed 16 linguistic and acoustic features that were extracted automatically from audio-recorded picture description tasks. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate brain-behavior relationships.

Results

We evaluated 62 participants: 16 with FTD-related predominant frontal atrophy, 24 with predominant rATL atrophy, and 22 healthy controls (mean age 68.3 years, SD = 9.2; 53.2% female). Logistic regression identified 3 features (content units, lexical frequency, and familiarity) differentiating the overall FTD group from controls (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.973), adjusted for age. Within the FTD group, 5 features (adpositions/total words ratio, arousal, syllable pause duration, restarts, and words containing "thing") differentiated frontal from rATL atrophy (AUC = 0.943). Neuroimaging analyses showed that semantic features (lexical frequency, content units, and "thing" words) were linked to bilateral inferior temporal lobe structures, speech and lexical features (syllable pause duration, and adpositions/total words ratio) to bilateral inferior frontal gyri, and socioemotional features (arousal) to areas known to mediate social cognition including the right insula and bilateral anterior temporal structures. As a composite score, this set of 5 features was uniquely associated with rATL atrophy.

Discussion

Automated speech analysis demonstrated high accuracy in differentiating FTD subtypes and provided insights into the neural basis of language impairments. Automated speech analysis could enhance early diagnosis and monitoring of FTD, offering a scalable, noninvasive alternative to traditional methods, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on further clinical validation with other neuroimaging or fluid biomarkers and longitudinal cognitive data, as well as external validation in larger and more diverse populations.

### Frontotemporal dementia [^113TeAK9]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia is an umbrella clinical term that encompasses a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterised by progressive deficits in behaviour, executive function, or language. Frontotemporal dementia is a common type of dementia, particularly in patients younger than 65 years. The disease can mimic many psychiatric disorders because of the prominent behavioural features. Various underlying neuropathological entities lead to the frontotemporal dementia clinical phenotype, all of which are characterised by the selective degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices. Genetics is an important risk factor for frontotemporal dementia. Advances in clinical, imaging, and molecular characterisation have increased the accuracy of frontotemporal dementia diagnosis, thus allowing for the accurate differentiation of these syndromes from psychiatric disorders. As the understanding of the molecular basis for frontotemporal dementia improves, rational therapies are beginning to emerge.

### Predominant right temporal lobe atrophy: clinical, neuropsychological and structural differences based on amyloid status [^115CFank]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Right temporal lobe atrophy is a radiological sign shared by different variants of common neurological syndromes, such as rtvFTD and the preliminary and evolving descriptions of rAD. In this study, we retrospectively identified 17 patients with both predominant right anterior temporal atrophy and confirmation of their amyloid‐status (CSF or amyloid‐PET) and then built a complete clinical, neuropsychological and neuroradiological profile to compare subjects, depending on amyloid status.

Analysis of the clinical reports showed, aside from the ubiquitous presence of reported amnesic syndrome, a distinction between the two groups. Behavioral symptoms, such as social awkwardness and compulsive attitude, were more frequent in the amyloid‐negative patients only at the end of follow‐up: those differences could be explained by a discrepancy in frontal atrophy, associated with FTD but not with typical AD or the still‐evolving definition of rAD. While apathy was common in both groups, the loss of empathy, associated with the right frontotemporal areas, was found in very few subjects in either group.

The amyloid‐positive subjects, on the other hand, presented cognitive symptoms such as topographical disorientation and executive dysfunctions more often; topographical disorientation was present only in the amyloid‐positive group. The findings of the impairment of these right‐lateralized functions are consistent with the conclusions of other studies about cases of AD with asymmetric right predominant atrophy.

It is worth noting that there was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of prosopagnosia, a symptom that has characteristically been associated with involvement of the right temporal lobe and considered a main feature of rtvFTD. In our records though, prosopagnosia was more common in the amyloid‐positive cohort, both at the beginning and at the end of follow‐up. In total, 47.1% of our patients showed prosopagnosia (30% of A− and 71.4% of A+): a lesser percentage than found in other studies involving similar subjects, which ranged between and around 60% and 90%. This discrepancy could be explained by the retrospective nature of the present study: prosopagnosia is not a common and known symptom, and patients and/or caregivers might confuse it with undefined memory problems, so it could easily be missed if not investigated promptly by a clinician. Moreover, the concept of prosopagnosia in rtvFTD is under discussion as it is more likely a deficit in person recognition rather than just face recognition.

### Primary age-related tauopathy [^113TSfLi]. Acta Neuropathologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Structural neuroimaging studies also enable assessment of atrophy, another marker with relevance to disease progression and stage (Fig. 4 a). There is increased atrophy of the medial temporal lobe with increasing Braak stage, and when controlling for Braak stage there was a trend toward increased atrophy of anterior and medial temporal lobe with age in definite PART, although medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy are also very common in ADNC. There was also an association between Braak stage and atrophy of the left anterior hippocampal head with sparing of the posterior aspect, which may relate to preservation of episodic memory. In comparison to a cohort with ADNC, PART subjects had better maintenance of right hippocampus, bilateral amygdala, temporal neocortex (superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri), parietal neocortex (left superior/inferior gyri, right inferior gyrus), frontal (bilateral rostral middle gyri, bilateral medial orbitofrontal gyri, right superior gyrus), and left posterior and anterior caudal cingulate volume (Fig. 4 b), and cognitive deficits correlate more directly with regional atrophy in ADNC.

### A clinical-radiological framework of the right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia [^112Yb5zu]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

The concept of the right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia (rtvFTD) is still equivocal. The syndrome accompanying predominant right anterior temporal atrophy has previously been described as memory loss, prosopagnosia, getting lost and behavioural changes. Accurate detection is challenging, as the clinical syndrome might be confused with either behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) or Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, based on neuroimaging features, the syndrome has been considered a right-sided variant of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Therefore, we aimed to demarcate the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of rtvFTD versus svPPA, bvFTD and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we aimed to compare its neuroimaging profile against svPPA, which is associated with predominant left anterior temporal atrophy. Of 619 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia, we included 70 subjects with a negative amyloid status in whom predominant right temporal lobar atrophy was identified based on blinded visual assessment of their initial brain MRI scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed retrospectively and compared with age- and sex-matched patients with svPPA (n = 70), bvFTD (n = 70) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 70). Prosopagnosia, episodic memory impairment and behavioural changes such as disinhibition, apathy, compulsiveness and loss of empathy were the most common initial symptoms, whereas during the disease course, patients developed language problems such as word-finding difficulties and anomia. Distinctive symptoms of rtvFTD compared to the other groups included depression, somatic complaints, and motor/mental slowness. Aside from right temporal atrophy, the imaging pattern showed volume loss of the right ventral frontal area and the left temporal lobe, which represented a close mirror image of svPPA. Atrophy of the bilateral temporal poles and the fusiform gyrus were associated with prosopagnosia in rtvFTD. Our results highlight that rtvFTD has a unique clinical presentation. Since current diagnostic criteria do not cover specific symptoms of the rtvFTD, we propose a diagnostic tree to be used to define diagnostic criteria and call for an international validation.

### The presymptomatic and early manifestations of semantic dementia [^113FurCK]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

People with semantic dementia (SD) or semantic variant primary progressive aphasia typically present with marked atrophy of the anterior temporal lobe, and thereafter progress more slowly than other forms of frontotemporal dementia. This suggests a prolonged prodromal phase with accumulation of neuropathology and minimal symptoms, about which little is known. To study early and presymptomatic SD, we first examine a well-characterised cohort of people with SD recruited from the Cambridge Centre for Frontotemporal Dementia. Five people with early SD had coincidental MRI prior to the onset of symptoms, or were healthy volunteers in research with anterior temporal lobe atrophy as an incidental finding. We model longitudinal imaging changes in left- and right-lateralised SD to predict atrophy at symptom onset. We then assess 61,203 participants with structural brain MRI in the UK Biobank to find individuals with imaging changes in keeping with SD but with no neurodegenerative diagnosis. To identify these individuals in UK Biobank, we design an ensemble-based classifier, differentiating baseline structural MRI in SD from healthy controls and patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, including other causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We train the classifier on a Cambridge-based cohort (SD n = 47, other neurodegenerative diseases n = 498, healthy controls n = 88) and test it on a combined cohort from the Neuroimaging in Frontotemporal Dementia study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (SD n = 42, other neurodegenerative n = 449, healthy control n = 127). From our case series, we find people with marked atrophy three to five years before recognition of symptom onset in left- or right-predominant SD. We present right-lateralised cases with subtle multimodal semantic impairment, found concurrently with only mild behavioural disturbance. We show that imaging measures can be used to reliably and accurately differentiate clinical SD from other neurodegenerative diseases (recall 0.88, precision 0.95, F1 score 0.91). We find individuals with no neurodegenerative diagnosis in the UK Biobank with striking left-lateralised (prevalence ages 45–85 4.8/100,000) or right-lateralised (5.9/100,000) anterior temporal lobe atrophy, with deficits on cognitive testing suggestive of semantic impairment. These individuals show progressive involvement of other cognitive domains in longitudinal follow-up. Together, our findings suggest that (i) there is a burden of incipient early anterior temporal lobe atrophy in older populations, with comparable prevalence of left- and right-sided cases from this prospective unbiased approach to identification, (ii) substantial atrophy is required for manifest symptoms, particularly in right-lateralised cases, and (iii) semantic deficits across multiple domains can be detected in the early symptomatic phase.

### Neurofilaments and progranulin are related to atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration – A transdiagnostic study cross-validating atrophy and fluid biomarkers [^114g2mKR]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

In sum, NfL from serum or CSF, and pNfH, tau, ptau, and Aβ from CSF discriminate between FTLD subtypes, AD, and healthy subjects. However, fluid biomarker levels show great variation across cohorts, which might hamper their diagnostic and discriminative value.

4.3 Atrophy patterns are specific in FTLD subtypes and AD variants

We found specific brain atrophy in all diseases compared to healthy controls, consistent with hypotheses and the literature. In AD, atrophy was pronounced bilaterally in the insulae, GM of middle frontal, middle temporal, and inferior temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala. LvPPA showed predominantly left hemispheric atrophy, especially in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions.

As hypothesized, bvFTD showed symmetric atrophy in insulae, frontal regions, and subcortical structures, such as caudate nuclei and putamen. In line with Whitwell et al.temporal regions were atrophic. In nfvPPA, atrophy was found in frontal (and temporal) structures, with left hemispheric dominance, and reflecting speech‐related areas. The strongest overall atrophy was found in svPPA, with an emphasis on the temporal lobe and the left side.,

Concerning the atypical parkinsonian disorder PSP, it was expected that atrophy would be found in the brainstem and cerebellum as well as in frontal and subcortical areas, which was confirmed in the present cohort. In CBS, more pronounced atrophy was found in the left hemisphere, affecting frontoparietotemporal regions, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Taken together, FTLD subtypes and AD variants affected specific brain regions, confirming the diagnosis in our patient cohorts.

### Parietal lobe deficits in frontotemporal lobar degeneration caused by a mutation in the progranulin gene… [^113A94Ud]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Results All patients exhibited a clinical and radiologic phenotype compatible with frontotemporal lobar degeneration based on current consensus criteria. However, unlike sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration, parietal deficits, consisting of dyscalculia, visuoperceptual /visuospatial dysfunction, and/or limb apraxia, were a common feature, and brain imaging showed posterior extension of frontotemporal atrophy to involve the parietal lobes. Other common clinical features included language output impairment with either dynamic aphasia or nonfluent aphasia and a behavioral syndrome dominated by apathy. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration comprises a group of disorders that is characterized by focal atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Three clinical syndromes are described by consensus criteria1: frontotemporal dementia, progressive nonfluent aphasia, and semantic dementia.

Frontotemporal dementia is characterized by early personality change and progressive behavioral symptoms. The clinical features in this series fall within the wide phenotypic spectrum described previously for sporadic and familial FTLD. 1, 11 Considering the affected individuals as a group, the most consistent features are impaired language output, a behavioral syndrome with early and prominent apathy, and limb apraxia. Brain imaging was performed in 4 cases. The findings are summarized in Table 3, and representative magnetic resonance images are presented in Figure 2. Brain imaging findings show considerable individual variation in this series, but atrophy involving the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes was present in all cases. Cerebral atrophy was strikingly asymmetric in patients III-2 and III-4 and in patient III-11.

Postmortem examination revealed similar findings in 3 members of the kindred. Macroscopically, all 3 patients showed severe bilateral atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, with moderate atrophy of the parietal lobes and relative sparing of the occipital lobes. The cases described in the present series showed variability in the pattern of radiologic atrophy, but it is notable that each of the cases with detailed magnetic resonance imaging showed frontotemporal atrophy with associated involvement of the parietal lobes.

### Reduced cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate gyrus is characteristic of both typical and atypical Alzheimer's disease [^117HKcQ7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) can be difficult to differentiate clinically due to overlapping symptoms. Subject classification in research studies is often based on clinical rather than pathological criteria which may mean some subjects are misdiagnosed and misclassified. Recently, methods measuring cortical thickness using magnetic resonance imaging have been suggested to be effective in differentiating between clinically-defined AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in addition to showing disease-related patterns of atrophy. In this study we used FreeSurfer, a freely-available and automated software tool, to measure cortical thickness in 28 pathologically-confirmed AD patients, of which 11 had a typical amnestic presentation and 17 an atypical presentation during life, 23 pathologically-confirmed FTLD subjects, and 25 healthy controls. Patients with AD pathology, irrespective of clinical diagnosis, showed reduced cortical thickness bilaterally in the medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, posterior parietal lobe, and frontal pole compared with controls. We further showed that lower cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate gyrus, parietal lobe, and frontal pole is suggestive of AD pathology in patients with behavioral or language deficits. In contrast, lower cortical thickness in the anterior temporal lobe and frontal lobe is indicative of the presence of FTLD pathology in patients with a clinical presentation of FTD. Reduced cortical thickness in the posterior cingulate gyrus is characteristic of AD pathology in patients with typical and atypical clinical presentations of AD, and may assist a clinical distinction of AD pathology from FTLD pathology.

### Apathy and disinhibition in frontotemporal dementia: insights into their neural correlates [^115tujYR]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Aberrant social behavior is a defining symptom of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and may eventually occur in all syndromes composing the FTD spectrum. Two main behavioral abnormalities have been described: apathy and disinhibition, but their neuroanatomical correlates remain underspecified.

Methods

Sixty-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of FTD participated in the study. Voxel-based morphometry of MRI data was performed to explore the association between gray matter loss and severity of the two behavioral profiles as measured by the Apathy and Disinhibition subscales of the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale.

Results

Compared with a group of controls, the FTD group showed extensive bilateral atrophy predominantly involving frontal and temporal lobes. Within the FTD group, the severity of apathy correlated with atrophy in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The severity of disinhibition correlated with atrophy in the right nucleus accumbens, right superior temporal sulcus, and right mediotemporal limbic structures.

Conclusions

Prefrontal and temporal regions are differentially associated with apathy and disinhibition. Our results support the view that successful execution of complex social behaviors relies on the integration of social knowledge and executive functions, represented in the prefrontal cortex, and reward attribution and emotional processing, represented in mesolimbic structures.

### Accelerating regional atrophy rates in the progression from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease [^1143sW75]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Previous studies report increased cerebral atrophy rates and ventricular enlargement in AD versus controls. Most cross-sectional MRI studies have focussed on atrophy of medial temporal lobe structures, commonly using volumetric measures. These studies have shown that hippocampal volumes at the time of clinical diagnosis are on average 18% lower when compared with controls. Whole-brain volumes are decreased in AD also, and tend to be around 5% lower — this volume loss cannot be accounted for by medial temporal lobe damage and implies widespread atrophy beyond this region. Voxel-based morphometry studies have shown using cross-sectional comparisons that in addition to atrophy of medial temporal lobe structures, temporal-parietal atrophy is prominent in AD. In MCI patients progressing to AD versus stable MCI patients atrophy of the temporal lobe, and to a lesser extent of the parietal and frontal lobe was shown. Longitudinal measures of atrophy, which allow changes within the individual to be assessed, have been shown to be more sensitive at detecting group differences than cross-sectional volumes, in part because they are less susceptible to intersubject variability. A number of studies described the pattern of longitudinal atrophy in relatively small groups of sporadic and familial AD patients. They found increased atrophy in the medial temporal lobe over time, but also more widespread throughout the brain, in the parietal and frontal lobe. Longitudinal studies report that hippocampal atrophy rates increase in MCI. We extend these findings, by providing rates of atrophy in six brain regions. Our study confirms that the medial temporal lobe is affected at an early stage of the disease. Additionally, we found the mean atrophy rate in the remainder of the temporal lobe to be increased at an early stage as well, before a clinical diagnosis could be made with certainty. Regional atrophy rates in the remainder of the cortex further accelerated in AD.

### Patterns of white matter atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration… [^114ot2q6]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by atrophy in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. It accounts for 10% to 15% of all cases of dementia. The clinical manifestations and the patterns of anatomic involvement in FTLD are heterogeneous. For example, some patients have atrophy predominantly in the frontal lobe while others have more severe atrophy in the temporal lobe. 1, 2 The patterns of anatomic involvement in FTLD can also be asymmetric. 2, 3 The neuropathology of FTLD may be as heterogeneous as the clinical spectrum of symptoms. Frontotemporal dementia has been described as the "frontal lobe variant of FTLD"12 because of the prominent frontal lobe damage associated with this disease. 5, 6, 13, 14 However, GM atrophy in the temporal lobes has also been noted in FTD. 6, 8, 9, 15 For this reason, we expect patients with FTD to exhibit WM atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes relative to cognitively healthy subjects.

A Wilcoxon signed rank test revealed significant differences between the areas under the 2 receiver operator characteristic curves. The primary goal of this study was to identify the regional patterns of WM atrophy in vivo in 2 subtypes of FTLD using volumetric MRI techniques. The first major finding is that FTD and semantic dementia patients exhibited significant WM atrophy. Compared with controls, FTD patients had WM atrophy in the frontal lobe, while semantic dementia patients had WM atrophy in the temporal lobes. This finding is consistent with previous reports of WM pathology in patients with FTLD10, 14, 28 and a postmortem diffusion tensor imaging study of an FTD patient that found WM abnormalities in the frontal lobes.
10. We hypothesized that WM atrophy would parallel GM atrophy in FTLD. However, the only region where patients with FTD showed significant GM and WM atrophy compared with controls was the frontal lobe.

Patients with FTD also had significant GM but not WM atrophy in the parietal temporal lobes. One novel finding of this study is that patients with FTD had significant parietal GM atrophy compared with controls. Although parietal atrophy is not a feature typically associated with the disease, Figure 1A clearly shows parietal GM atrophy in the FTD patient compared with the control subject.

### Current concepts in the classification and diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degenerations: a practical approach [^112NCx68]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degenerations are clinically, genetically, and molecularly heterogeneous diseases characterized by mainly frontal and temporal atrophy and affecting behavioral, language, cognitive, and motor functions. The term frontotemporal dementia incorporates 3 distinct clinical syndromes seen in frontotemporal degenerations: behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, progressive nonfluent aphasia, and semantic dementia. Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome, corticobasal syndrome, and motor neuron disease syndrome are also associated with frontotemporal lobar degenerations. The neuropathologic hallmark of frontotemporal lobar degenerations is accumulation of abnormal proteins in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons and glial cells. Proteins involved in pathologic processes that represent the basis for frontotemporal lobar degeneration classification are tau protein, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa, and "fused in sarcoma" protein. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of practical approaches for neuropathologic diagnostics of the rapidly evolving classifications of frontotemporal lobar degenerations.

### Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's association workgroup [^111Sm3hv]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Copathology and T2N mismatch — an 89-year-old man with slowly progressive amnestic dementia and a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) underwent AT2N imaging that revealed an abnormal amyloid positron emission tomographic (PET) scan but an unremarkable tau PET scan; the magnetic resonance imaging scan showed marked bilateral hippocampal atrophy that was consistent with the cognitive impairment but inconsistent with the level of tauopathy (i.e. T2N mismatch), and the A+T2−N+ biomarker profile, along with the atrophy pattern on magnetic resonance imaging, suggested that the patient likely had comorbid AD and limbic-predominant age-related TAR DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy (LATE).

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for amyloid PET imaging of the brain 1.0 [^116tMwAq]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Amyloid PET brain imaging — positive scan interpretation and regional patterns state that in patients with significant amounts of Aβ deposition in the brain, radiotracer uptake in gray matter blurs the distinction of the gray/white junction; a key feature for distinguishing Aβ 'positive' from 'negative' patients is loss of gray/white matter contrast with uptake extending to the edge of the cortex forming a smooth, regular boundary, and a convex outer surface may be outlined while gaps between the two hemispheres may no longer be defined or may appear as a thin regular line; abnormal uptake tends to be symmetrical, with most distinct accumulation in lateral temporal and frontal lobes, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and parietal lobes while the sensorimotor and visual cortex can be relatively spared; striatal uptake (notable in the caudate head) is often found and may be decisive in subjects with major cortical atrophy, and in hereditary forms of AD particularly intense striatal uptake has been described; the cerebellar cortex does not usually show uptake in the majority of amyloid-positive subjects, thus the cerebellum can generally be used as a reference region for visual as well as for semi-quantitative interpretation; an intermediate (or indeterminate) scan pattern may also be encountered and package inserts should be consulted for the number of affected cortical regions required to define a "positive" scan.

### Frontotemporal dementia [^112etDEW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration are increasingly recognized as an important cause of early-onset dementia. Diagnostic consensus criteria have now been established for almost a decade, and form the framework for its clinical classification. While these criteria remain useful, a growing body of evidence suggests that revisions may be necessary to improve their validity and applicability.

Recent Findings

In each individual syndrome, the core features are not uniformly present, and criteria that are currently used to exclude a condition, such as impaired episodic memory, are often present. Imaging, however, may warrant increased diagnostic prominence, particularly for diagnosis in semantic dementia and prognosis in behavioural syndromes. There is clinical and pathological overlap between the syndromes, but the clinical distinction between progressive nonfluent aphasia and semantic dementia is strengthening. Several series have refined our understanding of the correspondence between clinical syndromes and histopathological subtype: strong for tau-negative, ubiquitin-positive forms and more variable for tau-positive forms, yet prospective studies are still rare. The influence of genetic factors varies substantially across the syndromes.

Summary

Further research should aim to integrate detailed clinical, radiological, pathological and genetic information.

### Multiparametric MRI-based biomarkers in the non-fluent and semantic variants of primary progressive aphasia [^117CwpaU]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atlas-based volumetric analyses confirmed the observed microstructural alterations, revealing that patients with nfPPA exhibited significantly more atrophy in the frontal lobes compared to those with svPPA, whereas svPPA patients showed more pronounced atrophy in the temporal lobes. These findings are consistent with the previous volumetric gray matter studies on PPA variants which have identified predominant frontal involvement in nfPPA and left temporal atrophy in svPPA. Furthermore, svPPA patients demonstrated higher atrophy than nfPPA in the left insula, as well as in the bilateral hippocampus and amygdala. The more severe degeneration of the latter aligns with the more pronounced microstructural loss in svPPA documented by TFAS and WBSS at the level of the ILF and UF, which have been shown to connect the hippocampus with the temporo-parietal lobes and the amygdala with the frontal lobes, respectively. Taken together, these findings highlight the centrality of limbic disconnection in the pathogenesis of svPPA. While definitive in vivo differentiation of underlying pathology remains elusive, our findings may have speculative implications for clinico-pathological correlations. The prominent involvement of limbic structures and their associated tracts in svPPA may reflect a selective vulnerability of these regions to TDP-43 type C proteinopathy, the pathology most commonly associated with this variant. This is consistent with imaging evidence showing greater hypothalamic volume loss in TDP-43-related syndromes compared to tauopathies. Although this interpretation remains speculative, it highlights the potential of structural MRI not only for phenotypic classification but also for probing disease mechanisms. Future studies incorporating longitudinal and pathology-confirmed cohorts will be critical to further clarify these associations.

Atypical Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration with Ubiquitin-Positive Inclusions (aFTLD-U)

In cases of aFTLD-U, neuroimaging shows extensive atrophy of the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes. A small case series of 2 patients by Rohrer et al. showed atrophy predominantly affecting the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, anteromedial temporal lobe, anterior cingulate, and caudate. An independent analysis of 3 cases with aFTLD-U showed that caudate atrophy was major and exceed the degree of atrophy seen in FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes (n = 10 in each group).

### Anatomical MRI staging of frontotemporal dementia variants [^1146Gciu]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The three clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia (behavioral variant [bvFTD], semantic dementia, and progressive non-fluent aphasia [PNFA]) are likely to develop over decades, from the preclinical stage to death.

Methods

To describe the long-term chronological anatomical progression of FTD variants, we built lifespan brain charts of normal aging and FTD variants by combining 8022 quality-controlled MRIs from multiple large-scale data-bases, including 107 bvFTD, 44 semantic dementia, and 38 PNFA.

Results

We report in this manuscript the anatomical MRI staging schemes of the three FTD variants by describing the sequential divergence of volumetric trajectories between normal aging and FTD variants. Subcortical atrophy precedes focal cortical atrophy in specific behavioral and/or language networks, with a "radiological" prodromal phase lasting 8–10 years (time elapsed between the first structural alteration and canonical cortical atrophy).

Discussion

Amygdalar and striatal atrophy can be candidate biomarkers for future preclinical/prodromal FTD variants definitions.

Highlights

We describe the chronological MRI staging of the most affected structures in the three frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromic variants. In behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD): bilateral amygdalar, striatal, and insular atrophy precedes fronto-temporal atrophy. In semantic dementia: bilateral amygdalar atrophy precedes left temporal and hippocampal atrophy. In progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA): left striatal, insular, and thalamic atrophy precedes opercular atrophy.

### Neuroimaging in frontotemporal dementia: heterogeneity and relationships with underlying neuropathology [^115YAuJG]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia encompasses a group of clinical syndromes defined pathologically by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. Historically, these syndromes have been challenging to diagnose, with an average of about three years between the time of symptom onset and the initial evaluation and diagnosis. Research in the field of neuroimaging has revealed numerous biomarkers of the various frontotemporal dementia syndromes, which has provided clinicians with a method of narrowing the differential diagnosis and improving diagnostic accuracy. As such, neuroimaging is considered a core investigative tool in the evaluation of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, patterns of neurodegeneration correlate with the underlying neuropathological substrates of the frontotemporal dementia syndromes, which can aid clinicians in determining the underlying etiology and improve prognostication. This review explores the advancements in neuroimaging and discusses the phenotypic and pathologic features of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, and nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia, as seen on structural magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography.

### Frontotemporal degeneration in a child [^117BbDei]. Pediatric Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There is a predilection for the frontal and temporal lobes in certain cases of dementia in the adult, leading to the syndrome of frontotemporal dementia. However, this syndrome has seemed to elude the developing brain until now.

Methods and Results

We describe an example of apparently selective neurodegeneration of the frontal and temporal regions during development associated with some of the clinical, magnetic resonance imaging, and fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scan features of canonical frontotemporal dementia in the adult. This patient does not have any of the common frontotemporal dementia-causing mutations or known progressive brain disorders of children.

Conclusion

This patient illustrates that symptomatic, selective, and progressive vulnerability of the frontal and temporal lobes is not restricted to adulthood, expanding the phenotype of frontotemporal degeneration.

### Phenocopy or variant: a longitudinal study of very slowly progressive frontotemporal dementia [^116P22o5]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD) can present with a range of social and cognitive impairments. Complicating this clinical picture is a group of non-progressive or 'phenocopy' patients. We present a patient and his father with very slowly progressive fvFTD over decades. Stable MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging abnormalities were present in the presenting patient, with serial neuropsychological assessments that showed no significant change over 15 years. His father also had a 20-year history of functional decline, associated with neuropsychological evidence of change. Neuropathological confirmation of the condition of his father became available. This revealed gross bilateral frontal atrophy and spongiosis in the frontal cortical regions with mild neuronal loss and rounded ubiquitinated perinuclear inclusions, consistent with early stage frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin by current neuropathological criteria. The phenotype of frontal variant FTD is broad. Many patients present with frontal networks dysfunction. We present evidence that some patients with a very slow clinical progression do have FTD.

### Theory of mind impairments in patients with semantic dementia [^115tdTBk]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Semantic dementia is characterized by semantic deficits and behavioural abnormalities that occur in the wake of bilateral inferolateral and predominantly left-sided anterior temporal lobe atrophy. The temporal poles have been shown to be involved in theory of mind, namely the ability to ascribe cognitive and affective mental states to others that regulates social interactions by predicting and interpreting human behaviour. However, very few studies have examined theory of mind in semantic dementia. In this study, we investigated both cognitive and affective theory of mind in a group of patients with semantic dementia, using separate objective and subjective assessment tasks. Results provided objective evidence of an impact of semantic dementia on cognitive and affective theory of mind, consistent with the patients' atrophy in the left temporal lobe and hypometabolism in the temporal lobes and the medial frontal cortex. However, the subjective assessment of theory of mind suggested that awareness of the affective but not cognitive theory of mind deficit persists into the moderate stage of the disease.

### Data-driven neuroanatomical subtypes of primary progressive aphasia [^1129n6pK]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging can be used to corroborate a diagnosis based on symptom presentation. The clearest anatomical progression occurs in svPPA, which is typically associated with left anterior temporal lobe atrophy. Recent studies have identified the initial phase of atrophy in svPPA as beginning in the bilateral amygdala and progressing through the left, then right temporal pole. Neuroimaging findings in nfvPPA, lvPPA and PPA-nos are more variable, with neuroanatomical similarities between nfvPPA and lvPPA resulting in difficulties in discriminating these phenotypes based on MRI scans alone. A recent study found an association between a clinical diagnosis of nfvPPA and initial atrophy of the left striatum, followed by the bilateral anterior insula, then the left thalamus, with relative sparing of the left precuneus and cuneus. A study of the neuroanatomical profile of lvPPA identified initial atrophy of the left posterior temporal lobe, with longitudinal involvement of the parietal lobe. Whether PPA-nos cases share a common underlying neuroanatomical profile is unknown. There is therefore considerable clinical and research interest in defining the neuroanatomical underpinnings of PPA.

A clinical diagnosis of PPA is typically associated with a primary pathology of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or Alzheimer's disease. There is pathological variation by clinical variant: > 80% of svPPA diagnoses are found to be caused by the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP43) proteinopathy at post-mortem; > 80% of nfvPPA diagnoses are associated with a primary tauopathy (FTLD-tau); and > 80% of lvPPA diagnoses are associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Genetic cases, typically caused by mutations in progranulin (GRN) or more rarely chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), represent a substantial minority of all PPA cases. Genetic PPA has been reported as most predominant in nfvPPA and PPA-nos.

The Three-Repeat Tauopathy Pick's Disease

Pick's disease (PiD) is the only sporadic 3R tauopathy FTLD. It is primarily associated with bvFTD, though nfvPPA, svPPA, and CBS can also occur. In general, neuroimaging in PiD demonstrates striking atrophy, often described as "knife-edge" due to its severity (Fig. 5), affecting the frontal and temporal lobes, specifically the dorsolateral PFC, ventromedial PFC, temporal poles, and the anteromedial and anterolateral regions of the temporal lobes, with often remarkable sparing of the peri-Rolandic gyri. Subcortical structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, posterior insula, and caudate, are also impacted, while the substantia nigra is fairly spared from neurodegeneration compared to the degree observed in 4R tauopathies such as CBD and PSP.

Fig. 5
Neuroimaging patterns associated with Pick's disease (FTLD-tau, 3R). Structural MRI and FDG-PET demonstrating the variability in patterns of atrophy and hypometabolism attributed to Pick's disease (3R tau) neuropathology. In the case of bvFTD, significant bilateral frontal lobe atrophy and hypometabolism is seen. In the case of nfvPPA, atrophy and hypometabolism is lateralized and is greatly impacting the left frontal lobe more so than the right.

In cases of bvFTD, circumscribed frontotemporal atrophy is present throughout the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. In a recent study by Whitwell et al. of 17 individuals with PiD (8 with bvFTD, 6 with nfvPPA, 1 with svPPA, 1 with unclassified PPA, and 1 with CBS), those with bvFTD showed a striking degree of predominantly right-sided atrophy involving the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Over time, atrophy increasingly involved the frontal poles, anterior and middle cingulate gyri, medial frontal lobe, gyrus rectus, orbitofrontal cortex, inferior and middle frontal gyri, temporal poles, inferior and middle temporal lobes, fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, right anterior hippocampus, precuneus, right angular and supramarginal gyri, and bilateral basal ganglia. Similar findings have been described in other studies.

### Case of early-onset Alzheimer's disease with atypical manifestation [^1157wykd]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The initial clinical manifestations of the patient included short-term memory decline, poor pronunciation and personality changes at an early stage, followed by behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, including hallucinations, delusions of theft, gradual decline in self-care as well as depression. The patient's brain MRI initially showed mild atrophy of the bilateral frontal lobe. With the progress of the disease, more severe atrophy of the cerebral cortex, temporal lobe and hippocampus appeared besides the further atrophy of the bilateral frontal lobe. The atypical manifestation such as early aphasia, frontal lobe atrophy and personality changes can mislead clinicians in diagnosing frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This is the main reason leading to the misdiagnosis of this patient, which should be taken as a lesson or future reference for clinicians.

### Differing patterns of temporal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and semantic dementia [^113GXF7e]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize and quantify the patterns of temporal lobe atrophy in AD vs semantic dementia and to relate the findings to the cognitive profiles. Medial temporal lobe atrophy is well described in AD. In temporal variant frontotemporal dementia (semantic dementia), clinical studies suggest polar and inferolateral temporal atrophy with hippocampal sparing, but quantification is largely lacking.

Methods

A volumetric method for quantifying multiple temporal structures was applied to 26 patients with probable AD, 18 patients with semantic dementia, and 21 matched control subjects.

Results

The authors confirmed the expected bilateral hippocampal atrophy in AD relative to controls, with involvement of the amygdala bilaterally and the right parahippocampal gyrus. Contrary to expectations, patients with semantic dementia had asymmetric hippocampal atrophy, more extensive than AD on the left. As predicted, the semantic dementia group showed more severe involvement of the temporal pole bilaterally and the left amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus (including the entorhinal cortex), fusiform gyrus, and the inferior and middle temporal gyri. Performance on semantic association tasks correlated with the size of the left fusiform gyrus, whereas naming appeared to depend upon a wider left temporal network. Episodic memory measures, with the exception of recognition memory for faces, did not correlate with temporal measures.

Conclusions

Hippocampal atrophy is not specific for AD but is also seen in semantic dementia. Distinguishing the patients with semantic dementia was the severe global but asymmetric (left > right) atrophy of the amygdala, temporal pole, and fusiform and inferolateral temporal gyri. These findings have implications for diagnosis and understanding of the cognitive deficits in AD and semantic dementia.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Cognitive–behavioral syndromes and differential diagnoses — This table outlines progressive clinical syndromes with characteristic features and likely neuropathologic etiologies. Progressive amnesic syndrome (single or multi-domain) is marked by "Difficulty with learning and remembering new information, sometimes as the main feature, often accompanied by other features (e.g., executive dysfunction, depression, anxiety)", with differentials including "Usually AD", "Often AD with co-pathologies (AD + VCID, AD + LBD, AD + VCID + LBD)", and "Sometimes hippocampal sclerosis, argyrophilic grain disease, pure CJD, pure LBD, TDP-43 proteinopathy/LATE, PART". Additional syndromic categories include "Progressive aphasic syndrome (e.g. PPA or progressive aphasic multi-domain syndrome)", "Progressive visuospatial dysfunction (e.g., posterior cortical atrophy syndrome)", "Progressive dysexecutive and/or behavioral syndrome (e.g., bvFTD)", "Progressive cortical cognitive-somatosensorimotor syndrome (e.g., corticobasal syndrome)", and "Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (e.g. PSP Richardson's syndrome)". The note emphasizes that "There is a probabilistic — not deterministic — relationship between syndromic diagnosis and etiologic diagnosis", that "AD neuropathologic changes can be associated with many clinical syndromes", and that "multiple etiologies are likely in individuals older than 85 years".

STRUCTURAL & FUNCTIONAL IMAGING

CT & structural MRI/T1–weighted imaging

Structural scans lend themselves well to assessing volumetric changes that occur in neurodegenerative disease with decreases in gyral and increases in sulcal size. These changes probably develop secondary to decreases in synaptic density, neuronal loss, and cell shrinkage. Every neurodegenerative disease has a predilection for specific brain systems or networks, with each associated with tissue loss in particular brain regions.

CT imaging is commonly used in acute settings and/or in clinical settings where MRI is not available or contra-indicated in order to rule out alternative pathologies. Although CT scanning is still regularly used for diagnostic assessments and for studies of brain-behavior correlation, MRI is currently the modality of choice for assessing many types of abnormalities seen in neurodegenerative syndromes.

The medial temporal lobes, especially the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (ERC), are among the earliest sites of pathologic involvement in AD, and studies have repeatedly shown decreased hippocampal and ERC volumes in patients with AD compared with age-matched controls (FIG. 1). Other severely affected areas include the lateral parietal and posterior superior temporal regions and medial posterior portion of the cingulate gyrus, but atrophy is also evident in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes, in keeping with the diffuse nature of AD (FIG. 1).

FIG. 1.

(High resolution version of this image is available in the electronic supplementary material.)

MRI has been used to study patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at high risk for progression to AD, with a conversion rate to dementia of ∼12–15% per year. MRI studies in MCI have shown that hippocampal volumes and cortical volumes in the parietal and lateral temporal regions are able to predict the likelihood of progression. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated greater atrophy rates in ERC, and in the temporal lobe as a whole, in MCI patients than in controls.

### Predominant right temporal lobe atrophy: clinical, neuropsychological and structural differences based on amyloid status [^1112mc76]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The correct classification of patients with right temporal atrophy is still not fully certain. The predominant right temporal atrophy has often been associated with variants of FTD, but our study suggested that other clinical syndromes could be associated with this radiological sign, such as AD and Lewy body dementia, as displayed by some of our patients. Due to the lack of pathological records for our subjects, it is not possible to know whether the amyloid positivity with biomarkers represents a co‐pathology FTD‐AD or simply represents a part of the AD continuum. Furthermore, the exact clinical phenotype associated with right temporal atrophy is not unequivocal: many of our patients shared common characteristics, even if their diagnoses were very different.

All this implies the need to enlarge the diagnosis spectrum of right temporal atrophy, which should not be considered an exclusive feature of FTD. In particular, considering cases of extrapyramidal syndromes, it is important to point out that, in the present case series, diagnoses were based on clinical characteristics, as this would imply a further broadening of the spectrum of possible presentation of this radiological pattern.

The clinical and radiological overlap highlighted by our results makes it difficult to clinically distinguish rtvFTD and AD without the confirmation of amyloid status. Even with that validation, the exclusion of an AD co‐pathology in the clinical presentation of amnesic syndrome and prosopagnosia cannot be made reliably, as other studies have suggested.

The features associated with amyloid‐positive status in our study, however, seemed to follow the same direction as the ongoing attempt to describe and present the right variant of AD, whose characteristics, which while they may be common to rtvFTD, are yet to be fully and precisely determined.

To identify and recognize an rAD variant is a complex task because of the different recognizability that right‐lateralized symptoms have compared to disturbances of language, an almost exclusively left‐lateralized phenomenon. Language impairments are easily recognizable, even by the patient or caregiver, whereas deficits in visuospatial or attention functions may be more subtle and difficult to identify. Moreover, it has been shown that right‐lateralized functions are also partly influenced by the left hemisphere, and thus the impact of the asymmetric right hemisphere atrophy could be compensated for by the contralateral area.

The EOAD and LOAD signatures of cortical atrophy show differential topographical overlap with large‐scale cortical functional networks. The EOAD signature includes several neocortical regions spatially consistent with the posterior component of the default mode network, the left language network, the frontoparietal executive control network, the dorsal attention network, and the visual association network. In contrast, a key region of the LOAD signature is the anterior MTL (entorhinal/perirhinal cortex), which corresponds to the temporo‐limbic component of the default mode network, or the "limbic"network. Given that these networks subserve different aspects of cognition, the relative proportion of neurodegeneration in these networks in EOAD and LOAD may underlie differences in cognitive impairments seen in the two age‐related AD phenotypes. Supporting this notion, patients with EOAD often present with prominent impairments in executive function, processing speed, visuospatial, and language functions. Although EOAD patients can show episodic memory deficits, these seem to be mediated by impairments in other cognitive domains. This suggests greater dysfunction of multiple cognitive networks in EOAD, whereas the "limbic"/temporo‐limbic default mode network dysfunction may be more isolated and underlie the typical amnestic‐predominant presentation in LOAD. Despite evidence for dissociable network involvement in EOAD and LOAD, no previous studies have directly compared these network‐based measures of atrophy between these phenotypes.

In this study, we performed a head‐to‐head comparison of MRI‐derived atrophy measures between individuals with EOAD and LOAD. We hypothesized a double dissociation between age‐related AD phenotype and the localization and magnitude of cortical atrophy, such that patients with EOAD would show greater atrophy in widespread frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal neocortical regions, whereas patients with LOAD would show greater atrophy primarily in the MTL and anterior and ventral temporal lobe. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the magnitude of atrophy in the EOAD signature regions would be most strongly correlated with the global severity of cognitive impairment in EOAD, whereas the magnitude of atrophy in the LOAD signature regions would be most strongly correlated with cognitive impairment in LOAD, supporting the potential value of tailoring this imaging biomarker to the specific patient population. Finally, we further tested the hypothesis that the strongest atrophy–cognition relationship would be observed when atrophy was measured within the phenotypically most vulnerable region within each signature, further supporting the importance of taking each phenotype's specific signature of atrophy into consideration when examining the most robust MRI biomarker of symptom severity.

### Neuroimaging in frontotemporal lobar degeneration – predicting molecular pathology [^116qaEez]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) encompasses a group of diseases characterized by neuronal loss and gliosis of the frontal and temporal lobes. Almost all cases of FTLD can be classified into three categories on the basis of deposition of one of three abnormal proteins: the microtubule-associated protein tau, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, or fused in sarcoma. The specific diagnoses within each of these three categories are further differentiated by the distribution and morphological appearance of the protein-containing inclusions. Future treatments are likely to target these abnormal proteins; the clinical challenge, therefore, is to be able to predict molecular pathology during life. Clinical diagnosis alone has had variable success in helping to predict pathology, and is particularly poor in the diagnosis of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, which can be associated with all three abnormal proteins. Consequently, other biomarkers of disease are needed. This Review highlights how patterns of atrophy assessed on MRI demonstrate neuroanatomical signatures of the individual FTLD pathologies, independent of clinical phenotype. The roles of these patterns of atrophy as biomarkers of disease, and their potential to help predict pathology during life in patients with FTLD, are also discussed.

### Right temporal degeneration and socioemotional semantics: semantic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia [^113vkgY6]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Focal anterior temporal lobe degeneration often preferentially affects the left or right hemisphere. While patients with left-predominant anterior temporal lobe atrophy show severe anomia and verbal semantic deficits and meet criteria for semantic variant primary progressive aphasia and semantic dementia, patients with early right anterior temporal lobe atrophy are more difficult to diagnose as their symptoms are less well understood. Focal right anterior temporal lobe atrophy is associated with prominent emotional and behavioural changes, and patients often meet, or go on to meet, criteria for behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Uncertainty around early symptoms and absence of an overarching clinico-anatomical framework continue to hinder proper diagnosis and care of patients with right anterior temporal lobe disease. Here, we examine a large, well-characterized, longitudinal cohort of patients with right anterior temporal lobe-predominant degeneration and propose new criteria and nosology. We identified individuals from our database with a clinical diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia or semantic variant primary progressive aphasia and a structural MRI (n = 478). On the basis of neuroimaging criteria, we defined three patient groups: right anterior temporal lobe-predominant atrophy with relative sparing of the frontal lobes (n = 46), frontal-predominant atrophy with relative sparing of the right anterior temporal lobe (n = 79) and left-predominant anterior temporal lobe-predominant atrophy with relative sparing of the frontal lobes (n = 75). We compared the clinical, neuropsychological, genetic and pathological profiles of these groups. In the right anterior temporal lobe-predominant group, the earliest symptoms were loss of empathy (27%), person-specific semantic impairment (23%) and complex compulsions and rigid thought process (18%). On testing, this group exhibited greater impairments in Emotional Theory of Mind, recognition of famous people (from names and faces) and facial affect naming (despite preserved face perception) than the frontal- and left-predominant anterior temporal lobe-predominant groups. The clinical symptoms in the first 3 years of the disease alone were highly sensitive (81%) and specific (84%) differentiating right anterior temporal lobe-predominant from frontal-predominant groups. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration-transactive response DNA binding protein (84%) was the most common pathology of the right anterior temporal lobe-predominant group. Right anterior temporal lobe-predominant degeneration is characterized by early loss of empathy and person-specific knowledge, deficits that are caused by progressive decline in semantic memory for concepts of socioemotional relevance. Guided by our results, we outline new diagnostic criteria and propose the name, 'semantic behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia', which highlights the underlying cognitive mechanism and the predominant symptomatology. These diagnostic criteria will facilitate early identification and care of patients with early, focal right anterior temporal lobe degeneration as well as in vivo prediction of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-transactive response DNA binding protein pathology.

### Clinical review. frontotemporal dementia [^113SztiB]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

How is frontotemporal dementia distinguished from other diseases?

FTD syndromes must be distinguished from non-degenerative processes that present with prominent behavioural, executive, and language disturbance (such as primary psychiatric illness, tumours, and cerebrovascular disease) and from other neurodegenerative diseases (notably atypical variants of Alzheimer's disease). Although cerebrovascular changes are common on brain MRI in older patients, primary progressive aphasia can usually be distinguished from vascular aphasic syndromes based on a history of insidious deterioration; the distinction between behavioural variant FTD and cerebrovascular behavioural syndromes is more challenging, but may rest on the relative extent of vascular and regional atrophic changes. Neuropsychological assessment is valuable in substantiating the bedside impression — particularly for detecting "subclinical" involvement of cognitive domains that help to define the phenotype, for quantifying impairment in domains that may be difficult to assess at the bedside (such as semantic memory or sentence comprehension), and for tracking deterioration over time. On MRI, lack of the focal brain atrophy profiles that characterise FTD or prominent white matter change are important clues to an alternative disease.

Because of the wide phenotypic variation within the spectra of Alzheimer's disease and FTD, it can be difficult to differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease in an individual case based on clinical and imaging features. Clinical "red flags" that a patient has FTD rather than Alzheimer's disease include early prominent behavioural features, especially if the social façade breaks down or insight is lost and if episodic and topographical memory remain relatively intact. Profiling of neurodegeneration marker proteins in cerebrospinal fluid is increasingly used in clinical diagnosis: a raised ratio of total tau protein to beta amyloid1 42 peptide sensitively predicts Alzheimer's pathology, and incorporation of other amyloid and phosphorylated tau species may further enhance diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid profiling is likely in future to be supplemented by molecular neuroimaging (for example, for amyloid) and by more specialised structural MRI analysis tools. One large study found that cerebrospinal fluid profiling and analysis of brain MRI data with a specialised classifier algorithm could distinguish pathologically proven FTD from Alzheimer's disease with around 75% accuracy. However, such techniques remain to be widely translated beyond specialist centres.

### Different patterns of magnetic resonance imaging atrophy for frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes… [^112bdXZD]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Results Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in the patterns of atrophy in the FTLD and Alzheimer disease groups. Patients with FTLD presenting with altered personal conduct had significant bifrontal atrophy, whereas patients presenting with semantic dementia had significant left temporal and bifrontal atrophy compared with other groups. Disinhibited behavior and hyperphagia correlated with right frontal atrophy, and fluent, anomic aphasia correlated with left temporal atrophy. The 3 clinical syndromes of FTLD as defined by the consensus criteria2 are frontotemporal dementia, progressive nonfluent aphasia, and semantic dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is a progressive disturbance of personal and social conduct and usually shows bilateral frontal lobe abnormalities on neuroimaging. The ANOVA findings were significant for overall differences in patterns of atrophy among diagnostic groups.

Figure 2 shows the pattern of atrophy for the diagnostic groups FD, PA, SD, and AD. Comparisons with the Fisher least significant paired t test that were significant at the. 05 level are listed in Table 2. The results show that the significant areas of atrophy are bifrontal in the FD group and left temporal and bifrontal in the SD group. The presence of a fluent, anomic aphasia correlates positively with left temporal atrophy. No other symptoms or signs have significant correlation with any areas of atrophy. The analysis was also performed using age and duration of illness as covariates, which did not affect the significance of the results. To further elucidate the specific anatomic areas important in these symptoms, the discriminant analysis was rerun for the 6 areas in the right frontal lobe for disinhibition and hyperphagia and the 4 areas in the left temporal lobe for fluent, anomic aphasia.

Fluent, anomic aphasia had a trend toward positive correlation with atrophy at the left temporal inferior level. The other important aspect of our study is the presence of focal atrophy to distinguish FTLD syndromes from probable AD. Focal atrophy appears to be specific but not sensitive in differentiating patients presenting with FTLD syndromes from those with AD. A likely reason is that FTLD patients may have very mild degrees of atrophy early in the course of illness.

### Neuroimaging in dementia: a practical guide [^111Xos9D]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Over 800 000 people in the UK are demented. Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia and frontotemporal lobar degeneration account for the majority. Although detailed clinical assessment forms the basis of evaluating a patient with cognitive impairment, structural and functional imaging techniques are increasingly being used. Neuroimaging can identify changes to supplement the clinical diagnosis and help to distinguish dementia subtypes. This may be important for treatment, prognosis and care planning. Furthermore, early changes on structural and functional imaging may have a role in preclinical detection, perhaps allowing people to start any treatments early. In this review, we explain the tools available to the neuroradiologist and examine the implications of imaging findings in assessing patients with cognitive impairment or dementia.

### Advances and controversies in frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis, biomarkers, and therapeutic considerations [^116sVR4R]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia comprises a group of clinical syndromes that are characterised by progressive changes in behaviour, executive function, or language. The term frontotemporal lobar degeneration encompasses the neurodegenerative diseases that give rise to these clinical syndromes and involve proteinopathies associated with frontotemporal network dysfunction. Improvements in clinical, genetic, and molecular characterisation have provided new insights into frontotemporal dementia and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with a much broader range of signs and symptoms at presentation than has been previously considered. Accurate and early diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia is now a possibility due to development of neuropsychological measures with a special focus on social cognition. Advances in plasma and CSF biomarkers, and innovations in structural and functional imaging, will prove useful for future clinical trials in people with frontotemporal dementia.

### Clinical and neuroanatomical signatures of tissue pathology in frontotemporal lobar degeneration [^112wUU4D]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

A central and difficult issue in the neurodegenerative brain diseases concerns the correspondence between phenotypic features and microscopic and molecular pathology. This issue has important implications for understanding disease neurobiology, for clinical diagnosis, and ultimately, for development and rational use of disease-modifying therapies. Such considerations are particularly pertinent to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD): a genetically and pathologically heterogeneous group of disorders that collectively constitute a common cause of dementia, particularly in younger age groups. FTLD is a macro-anatomical descriptive term referring to the relatively selective atrophy of frontal and temporal lobes that characterizes most cases. This atrophy is underpinned by diverse pathological processes; these can be broadly classified according to the major constituents of the cellular inclusions present [tau, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) or fused-in-sarcoma (FUS) protein, designated FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP or FTLD-FUS, respectively:]. A number of causative genes have been identified, of which the genes coding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and progranulin (GRN) are numerically the most important. Three canonical clinical syndromes of FTLD are described: behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and two language variants, semantic dementia and progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA). These syndromes overlap clinically with motoneuron disease (FTD-MND), corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome. There is a broad correspondence between canonical FTLD clinical syndromes and profiles of brain atrophy detected in vivo using techniques such as MRI: behavioural variant FTD is associated with atrophy predominantly involving the frontal, insula, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal lobes (especially in the non-dominant hemisphere); semantic dementia, with asymmetric atrophy predominantly involving the anterior inferior temporal lobes; and PNFA, with asymmetric (predominantly dominant hemisphere) atrophy involving anterior peri-Sylvian cortices.

3.6 Cognitive and behavioral features of Korean patients with sbvFTD

Generalcognitive indices, such as the MMSE and CDR, did not differ between the groups. Executive function was the most significantly impaired in the predominant frontal group, whereas it was relatively preserved in the sbvFTD and lATL groups. K‐BNT scores were significantly lower in the lATL group, whereas the sbvFTD group had an intermediate level of severity between the lATL and frontal groups. Visuospatial function (RCFT copy) and attention (TMT‐A) were relatively preserved in the sbvFTD and lATL atrophy groups, while they were most severely impaired in the frontal group. The NPI and FBI scores were high in the predominant frontal and mixed groups, with the sbvFTD group having similarly high scores compared to the frontal group, with no significant differences between them(Table 5).

3.7 Pattern of cortical thickness of Korean patients with sbvFTD

The sbvFTD group had the most severe cortical thinning in the right temporal lobe, with additional cortical thinning observed in the left temporal lobe and parts of the right frontal and parietal lobes. The lATL group, on the other hand, showed a mirror‐image pattern of sbvFTD, with the most pronounced cortical thinning in the left temporal lobe, along with atrophy in the right temporal lobe and some areas of the left frontal and parietal lobes. The frontal group had cortical thinning throughout the bilateral dorsolateral, medial, and orbitofrontal regions, as well as bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyri. However, the degree and extent of temporal thinning of frontal group were less than the sbvFTD and lATL groups (Figure 1C).

Based on clinical diagnosis, the sbvFTD group was divided into svPPA and bvFTD. The svPPA patients showed bilateral temporal thinning with right predominance, whereas the bvFTD patients had predominant thinning in right frontotemporal cortex (Figure 1D).

3.8 Validation of proposed sbvFTD diagnostic criteria in Korean patients with sbvFTD

When the initial symptoms of Korean sbvFTD patients were tested against the sbvFTD criteria, the sensitivity and specificity were 45% and 55%, respectively. When symptoms throughout the entire duration were accounted for, the sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 42%, respectively.

### Cerebral atrophy in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia… [^1168LArF]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The MRPI was increased in patients with bvFTD and underlying 4R tauopathies compared with other FTLD subtypes. Higher bvFTD atrophy scores were associated with faster clinical deterioration in bvFTD. The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia is the leading clinical presentation of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. 1 According to bvFTD diagnostic criteria, the presence of frontal or anterior temporal cerebral atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging can be used to increase diagnostic certainty of underlying. Participants with bvFTD were classified in 3 groups based on the certainty of underlying FTLD. In the first group, we included participants with bvFTD with high confidence of FTLD., respectively), medial temporal lobe, and the frontal insula regions and the total bvFTD. atrophy score were higher compared with bvFTD-LC. Current diagnostic criteria include the presence of "frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy on MRI" to increase the diagnostic confidence of FTLD in bvFTD, 5 but some cases may present with equivocal patterns of atrophy, and specific cutoffs for the definition of significant atrophy are lacking. Previous work showed low sensitivity of expert radiologists for the identification of frontotemporal atrophy, 33 and other reports suggested a significant overlap in the atrophy between some cases with bvFTD and controls.

34 It could be argued that clinicians not blinded to clinical information may have had increased sensitivity for the detection of participants with bvFTD.

### Left / right asymmetry of atrophy in semantic dementia: behavioral-cognitive implications [^113mAxiu]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize presenting symptomatology in patients with semantic dementia (SD) and to investigate whether left and right temporal variants of the disease have distinct behavioral and cognitive profiles.

Methods

Retrospective examination of case notes was performed in 47 consecutive referrals of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SD. Patients (and informants) were interviewed and underwent neuropsychological testing within 6 months of assessment. Patients were designated as having predominantly left (L > R; n = 36) or right (R > L; n = 11) temporal lobe atrophy based on MRI or CT of the brain.

Results

R > L and L > R SD groups did not differ in terms of presenting age (mean 63.4 ± 7.4 years), symptom duration (3.6 ± 2.3 years), or Mini-Mental State Examination scores (22.1 ± 6.7). The most frequently reported behavioral symptoms were food fads, irritability, depression, and preoccupation with puzzles; cognitive deficits included word-finding difficulties, reduced comprehension, difficulty with person identification, and reduced conversation. The frequency of several symptoms differed significantly between groups. The following aspects were more likely to be associated with major right temporal atrophy: social awkwardness, job loss, loss of insight, and difficulty with person identification. Word-finding difficulties and reduced comprehension were more salient features of L > R patients. Both groups showed deficits on semantic memory tests, as expected for this syndrome, but several items yielded greater impairment for L > R than R > L.

Conclusions

Patients with left and right predominant SD present with distinct behavioral-cognitive profiles. Characterization of these features may assist in the early and accurate diagnosis of SD.

### Sex is a defining feature of neuroimaging phenotypes in major brain disorders [^111q3Teq]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies of cortical thickness and atrophy in regions beyond the hippocampus also show divergent MRI patterns between males and females along the AD continuum. The most consistent of these patterns is faster atrophy in females than males. In a cross‐sectional vertex‐wide study of cortical thickness in 152 individuals with early stage AD (clinical dementia rating scale = 0.5 or 1), a hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three dominant patterns of cortical atrophy in AD (medial temporal/cingulate, parietal, diffuse), two of which differed by sex (females n = 101; males n = 51) (Noh et al.). Specifically, a higher proportion of females than males exhibited medial temporal/cingulate dominant atrophy (i.e. n = 52, 73.1% females) or diffuse dominant atrophy (i.e. nearly all association cortices affected except occipital and OFC, n = 72, 66.7% females), whereas the sex ratio for parietal‐dominant atrophy (i.e. bilateral parietal cortex, precuneus, DLPFC) was approximately equal (n = 28, 53.6% females). Individuals with the medial temporal and diffuse patterns were also significantly less educated than those with a parietal pattern, and were more likely to have an APOE 4 allele, whereas those with the parietal pattern were significantly younger than the other groups and exhibited the worst cognitive performance (Noh et al.). Secondary analyses revealed three additional subtypes within the diffuse atrophy group that differed significantly by sex: medial frontal (n = 33, 84.8% females), frontal–parietal (n = 31, 58.1% females), and frontal‐temporal (n = 8, 25.0% females). The most common pattern in females (medial frontal) was further characterized by greater cortical thickness than the frontal–parietal and frontal‐temporal groups, and poorer performance on tests of verbal and visual recognition (Noh et al.). Although these patterns reflect cross‐sectional estimates of sex differences in "atrophy", longitudinal work in early‐stage AD patients generally supports the finding of faster cortical thinning in females than males in medial temporal, ACC and frontal areas. Specifically, Lee et al. showed modestly faster cortical thinning in females (n = 22 at baseline, M age = 68.4 ± 8.8) than males (n = 14 at baseline; M age = 73.1 ± 5.6) over a 5‐year period in the DLPFC, medial PFC, STG, ACC, temporal–parietal and occipital cortices after adjusting for age, education, APOE 4 status, disease duration and onset, and ICV. A sex‐by‐time interaction effect was not significant, but this may be due to the presence of multiple atrophy subtypes, including parietal‐dominant, which did not differ by sex in Noh et al. Nonsignificant sex interactions may also be a function of small sample size, which was reduced to only 5 males and 12 females at Year 5 due to attrition (Lee et al.). Of note, there were no significant sex differences in cortical thickness at the baseline visit, which is consistent with cortical thickness estimates in a larger study of 193 AD patients (69.4% females) that did not differ significantly by sex (Seo et al.).

### A clinical-radiological framework of the right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia [^117GhR2J]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Radiological characteristics of right temporal variant FTD and comparison with semantic variant PPA

One of the key questions is whether these distinct clinical presentations have a distinct underlying atrophy pattern. To our knowledge, only three studies have assessed the atrophy pattern of rtvFTD systematically and the number of patients has been limited (n = 6–20) in these studies. In line with those studies, predominant anterior temporal atrophy with a greater degree on the right side was the characteristic imaging pattern of rtvFTD. However, different from those studies we found that the ipsilateral ventral frontal areas were also affected in both rtvFTD and svPPA initially. On the other hand, one longitudinal study has found that atrophy in the later stages of rtvFTD can be observed in right orbitofrontal areas whereas another study has argued that initial right anterior temporal atrophy is followed by subsequent involvement of the left temporal lobe to resemble patterns observed in svPPA. Although our study is not a longitudinal study, our results for the rtvFTD group showed involvement of both contralateral temporal and ipsilateral ventromedial frontal areas, in particular the inferior orbitofrontal lobe areas, which were also observed to be affected in the svPPA group. Even if rtvFTD and svPPA display a radiological mirror image initially, our results show that even in later clinical stages they do not have the same manifestation. Future studies combining longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging findings will be essential to further understand the disease course and large pathological studies will shed light on the pathophysiological basis of these related syndromes.

Clinico-radiological correlation of prosopagnosia in right temporal variant FTD

There is a general agreement that right hemisphere damage is necessary for the occurrence of prosopagnosia, but disagreement exists about the role of the left hemisphere. A recent prospective VBM study has shown that face identification is positively associated with right anterior fusiform gyrus volume in FTD. However, in that study, only one patient had the right predominant temporal lobe atrophy characteristic of rtvFTD. Another VBM analysis in semantic dementia has revealed that the right anterior temporal pole, the right fusiform gyrus and the right medial temporal lobe were associated with prosopagnosia in patients with semantic dementia. Although our results are similar to those earlier findings, we observed that the left temporal lobe, in particular the temporal pole and the fusiform area, was also associated with prosopagnosia in rtvFTD.

### Dissociable spatial topography of cortical atrophy in early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease: a head-to-head comparison of the LEADS and ADNI cohorts [^111cri1a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Results of our ROI‐based analyses clearly demonstrated the utility of phenotype‐specific AD signature regions for distinguishing between EOAD and LOAD based on the magnitude of atrophy as well as tracking the severity of cognitive/functional impairment. Each phenotype group exhibited relatively greater atrophy in their own signature mask, supporting the conclusions of our original studies identifying these signature regions. Furthermore, when we focused on the epicenter of atrophy within each signature, we found group differences with larger effect sizes in most cases. This is likely because some cortical regions are part of both the EOAD and LOAD signatures (Supplementary Figure S1), and that EOAD patients — who overall had greater atrophy than LOAD patients — showed prominent atrophy within the whole LOAD signature mask as well.

Within a set of cortical regions where both EOAD and LOAD patients showed atrophy, the magnitude of this atrophy was associated with the severity of cognitive impairment in all AD participants. This suggests that atrophy in cortical regions commonly affected in EOAD and LOAD could be used as an effective biomarker for cognitive impairment across the phenotypic spectrum of AD. Future work should investigate the utility of this measure in predicting longitudinal cognitive decline in a heterogeneous sample of AD participants following our recent work based on tau PET.

In general, the correlations between regional atrophy and global cognitive impairment were stronger in EOAD than in LOAD patients. This may be because EOAD patients were more impaired and presented different clinical phenotypes that likely contributed to the greater variability in the magnitude of cortical atrophy. In addition, this result might also reflect different representations of co‐pathologies between EOAD and LOAD, as prior studies identified the presence of various co‐pathologies in 42% of autopsied ADNI LOAD cases, whereas EOAD cases are less likely than LOAD to exhibit co‐pathologies.

At the level of large‐scale functional networks, results again reflected the neocortical‐ versus MTL‐predominant pattern of atrophy in EOAD and LOAD, respectively. We found atrophy to a comparable degree across the phenotypes in the default mode network, despite prominent neocortical atrophy in EOAD that is spatially consistent with some of its key nodes in the posterior temporo‐parietal cortices. This might be due to EOAD and LOAD patients showing similar levels of atrophy in the anterior nodes of this network (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex) and/or to LOAD patients having relatively greater atrophy in the anterior and lateral temporal nodes of this network, leading to comparable thickness estimates across the groups at the whole network level. A clearer dissociation might emerge within this network by examining its subnetworks or subsystems.

Dementia due to frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders — presentation, criteria, imaging, and epidemiology: Frontotemporal dementia is characterized in its early stages by changes in personality, significant apathy, executive dysfunction, deterioration of social skills, emotional blunting, behavioral disinhibition, and prominent language abnormalities, with difficulties with memory, apraxia, and other features of dementia usually following later; as the dementia progresses, it may be accompanied by extreme agitation, and early prominent personality/behavior change, severe apathy, and/or early language deficits help to distinguish it from Alzheimer's disease. Two sets of diagnostic criteria for frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders have been proposed, and the criteria of McKhann et al. include progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia, and hippocampal sclerosis; argyrophilic grain disease may also be included. Structural brain imaging typically reveals prominent frontal and/or temporal atrophy with relative sparing of the parietal and occipital lobes. The formal diagnosis of Pick's disease depends on the neuropathological finding of Pick inclusion bodies. About one-third of cases are familial, the disorder most commonly manifests in patients ages 50–60 years, and the course is progressive and can be more rapid than that of Alzheimer's disease.

Purpose Of Review

The clinical features of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) are well established; however, recent work has identified patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for the disease who do not appear to progress clinically. This review describes means of distinguishing this group at an early stage from patients who are likely to deteriorate.

Recent Findings

Despite indistinguishable clinical profiles, studies in a cohort of bvFTD patients showed a particularly good prognosis in a subgroup of predominantly male patients in whom initial structural imaging was normal. This could not be explained by differences in disease duration, and was confirmed by subsequent PET studies. Retrospective review of clinical data in these groups verified that the current clinical diagnostic criteria are both insensitive to true progressive bvFTD, particularly in the early stages, and also poorly specific. In contrast, measures of activity of daily living performance, executive function and tests of social cognition appear to have better discriminatory value for patients who show clear clinical progression, with many individual diagnoses verified by post mortem examination in this group.

Summary

It remains doubtful that the nonprogressive group have a neurodegenerative disease. The implication for the current clinical diagnostic criteria and their proposed revision is discussed.

### Clinical and metabolic imaging features of late-onset and early-onset posterior cortical atrophy [^113s4mDg]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

It was also predicted that limbic dysfunction would be associated with more severe impairment of memory functions in LO_PCA than EO_PCA (as found in the tAD group, who showed prominently left mesial temporal hypometabolism and more severe amnesia), but no evidence of greater memory or semantic or executive deficits in our LO_PCA patients was found. A possible explanation is the strong lateralization of the limbic hypometabolism to the right hemisphere in this group, paired with the lack of neuropsychological measures sensitive to right‐lateralized limbic functions. Perhaps the inclusion of formal tests of visuospatial memory and topographical orientation would have increased sensitivity for right limbic dysfunction and allowed differences between the two age groups to be detected.

In their LO_PCA sample, Suárez‐González et al. also found a pattern of cortical thickness similar to our LO_PCA patients' FDG‐PET pattern: in addition to posterior atrophy, their LO_PCA cases showed thinning of the mesial temporal, anterior temporal, inferior frontal and anterior cingulate cortex. They reported 'greater involvement of anterior regions' and hypothesized major impairment of 'prefrontal functions' in PCA with a late onset. It is suggested that these findings should be interpreted as a sign of involvement of the limbic system engaged primarily in memory processes.

On the whole, our results suggest that the predominantly simultanagnosic syndrome underpinned by bilateral OTP neurodegeneration, which is considered the most frequent presentation of PCA (sometimes referred to as the biparietal variant of PCA), might actually be representative of EO_PCA, whilst LO_PCA seems to be characterized by asymmetric right > left neurodegeneration involving OTP regions, which leads to impairment of visuospatial abilities and object recognition, but also by neurodegeneration of the limbic network, as seen in LO classical AD. The similarities and differences observed in the LO_PCA and tAD groups actually raise the question of whether LO_PCA might be an extremely asymmetric, right‐lateralized subtype of AD. Further studies are needed to establish how far from each other these two variants are, and if they represent two distinct entities or lie along a biological and clinical continuum.

### Cerebral atrophy in mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^115JWi7A]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

4.2 Gray matter and white matter

Apart from medial temporal lobe atrophy, decrease in gray matter volume was reported in the lateral temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. These findings are consistent with reports demonstrating cortical thinning in the superolateral parietal lobe and some regions of the frontal cortexas well as sulcal widening in the superior temporal and superior frontal sulci. There are also sporadic reports suggesting decrease in the volume of the parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, superior temporal lobe, lateral temporal lobe, inferior temporal lobe, frontal lobe, cingulate, parietal and occipital lobes, and insula. Therefore, although higher atrophy rates have been prominently reported in the medial temporal lobe and the atrophy rate in this region was positively associated with cognitive decline, brain atrophy is also widely distributed to other parts of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. Nonetheless, in spite of the widespread gray matter atrophy, estimated atrophy rates in these areas alone cannot explain the whole brain atrophy rate. Indeed, the gray matter forms less than half of the brain tissue and atrophy rates as high as the atrophy rate in the hippocampus are needed in all parts of the gray matter to explain the total brain volume loss.

Therefore, atrophy of white matter is likely to significantly contribute to whole brain atrophy, especially because axonal integrity depends on cell body viability in the gray matter and theoretically cell loss in gray matter atrophy should have an impact on white matter integrity. Loss of integrity in the white matter fiber tracts, particularly in the fornix and anterior and inferior cingulum, has been detected by DTI studies. These studies are limited in number and restricted in the selection of regions of interest. A relationship between hippocampal gray matter atrophy and subsequent disruption in the uncinated fasciculus and the cingulum bundle has also been reported.

Although too few studies investigating white matter atrophy were available for review and for reliable assessment of their magnitude, they suggest that white matter is not spared from MCI pathology. However, the rate of atrophy in white matter and its association with gray matter and whole brain volume loss are some important unanswered questions. White matter forms the dominant proportion of brain structure, which reflects the importance of connection and networks in neural structure and consequently brain function. Therefore, it is essential that more investigations focus on these questions.

### Predominant right temporal lobe atrophy: clinical, neuropsychological and structural differences based on amyloid status [^114nNzh7]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Predominant right temporal atrophy is a radiological sign usually associated with frontotemporal dementia but this sign can also be present in Alzheimer's disease. Given the overlap of clinical symptoms between the two conditions, it is important to know which characteristics allow them to be differentiated.

Objectives

To compare clinical, neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of subjects with prominent right anterior temporal atrophy, depending on the status of amyloid biomarkers.

Methods

Among patients followed in the dementia center of Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, subjects with right anterior temporal atrophy, defined as grade 3 or 4 on the corresponding visual rating scale, were identified. Only subjects with both an MRI scan and amyloid status available were considered. For selected subjects, data were extracted from clinical and neuropsychological records at initial presentation and at last available follow-up. Two raters applied a protocol of eight visual rating scales to compare brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities.

Results

Of 497 subjects, 17 fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 7 amyloid-positive and 10 amyloid-negative. At initial presentation, executive dysfunction and topographical disorientation were more common in amyloid-positive patients. At follow-up, behavioral symptoms, such as social awkwardness and compulsive attitude, were more frequent in the amyloid-negative patients. Amyloid-positive patients presented an overall worse neuropsychological performance, especially in the language and visuospatial domain, and had higher scores on the right anterior cingulate visual rating scale.

Conclusion

Patients with predominant right temporal atrophy showed clinical, neuropsychological and radiological differences, depending on the status of amyloid biomarkers.

### Neuropsychiatric symptoms and imbalance of atrophy in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia [^1126r1SM]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study provides a conceptual framework for understanding the clinical and anatomic heterogeneity of bvFTD. Frontotemporal atrophy is more often ventral than dorsal, and, while asymmetry is not uncommon, atrophy is most often symmetric, with left‐lateralized atrophy occurring as often as right. The severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms is related to the distribution of atrophy (or its absence) along both right–left and dorsal–ventral axes. Future studies are needed to investigate how behavioral symptoms relate to structural and functional changes to help clarify underlying cognitive component processes. The knowledge gained may suggest new avenues for targeted symptomatic therapy.

### Biomarkers in dementia: clinical utility and new directions [^113kPbLu]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Structural brain imaging

While by no means 100% concordant, pattern of brain atrophy can provide important clues, not only to clinical phenotype but also for the underlying pathology and in some cases genetic basis of disease. Based on clinical phenotype, patients with bvFTD often show atrophy of mesial frontal, orbitofrontal and anterior insula cortices. As the disease progresses there is involvement of the other frontal neocortical grey matter regions, the striatum, hippocampi, posterior insulae and parietal lobes. In SD, patients show bilateral but typically highly asymmetrical (left)-sided atrophy of the anterior temporal lobes involving the polar and perirhinal cortices and anterior fusiform gyri. As the disease progresses this degeneration extends caudally into the posterior temporal lobes and rostrally into the posterior, inferior frontal lobes. The structural imaging findings in PNFA are very heterogeneous and scans are often remarkably normal in the earliest stages. Typically, however, there may be volume loss involving the anterior perisylvian, and inferior opercular and insular portions of the dominant hemisphere. As the disease progresses there is involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, orbital and anterior cingulate regions and parietal lobe.MRI-based quantification of atrophy rates of whole brain or lobar volumes are potentially useful objective biomarkers of progression in FTD.

### Disentangling the neural correlates of corticobasal syndrome and corticobasal degeneration with systematic and quantitative ALE meta-analyses [^113vaGVZ]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Corticobasal degeneration is a scarce neurodegenerative disease, which can only be confirmed by histopathological examination. Reported to be associated with various clinical syndromes, its classical clinical phenotype is corticobasal syndrome. Due to the rareness of corticobasal syndrome/corticobasal degeneration and low numbers of patients included in single studies, meta-analyses are particularly suited to disentangle features of the clinical syndrome and histopathology. Using PubMed, we identified 11 magnetic resonance imaging studies measuring atrophy in 22 independent cohorts with 200 patients contrasted to 318 healthy controls. The anatomic likelihood estimation method was applied to reveal affected brain regions across studies. Corticobasal syndrome was related to gray matter loss in the basal ganglia/thalamus, frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. In corticobasal degeneration patients, atrophy in the thalamus, frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes were found. Finally, in a conjunction analysis, the bilateral thalamus, the bilateral posterior frontomedian cortex, posterior midcingulate cortex and premotor area/supplementary motor area, and the left posterior superior and middle frontal gyrus/precentral gyrus were identified as areas associated with both, corticobasal syndrome and corticobasal degeneration. Remarkably, atrophy in the premotor area/supplementary motor area and posterior midcingulate/frontomedian cortex seems to be specific for corticobasal syndrome/corticobasal degeneration, whereas atrophy in the thalamus and the left posterior superior and middle frontal gyrus/precentral gyrus are also associated with other neurodegenerative diseases according to anatomic likelihood estimation method meta-analyses. Our study creates a new conceptual framework to understand, and distinguish between clinical features (corticobasal syndrome) and histopathological findings (corticobasal degeneration) by powerful data-driven meta-analytic approaches. Furthermore, it proposes regional-specific atrophy as an imaging biomarker for diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome/corticobasal degeneration ante-mortem.

### PET findings and neuropsychological deficits in a case of fahr's disease [^115d1RKv]. Psychiatry Research (2001). Low credibility.

In a case of Fahr's disease with frontal lobe type dementia and hyperkinetic-hypotone syndrome, functional changes were investigated using positron emission tomography (PET) with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer. Computed tomography showed bilateral calcifications in the putamen and globus pallidus consistent with the diagnosis of Fahr's disease and a frontally pronounced brain atrophy. In contrast, reduced glucose uptake in PET was not only confined to the areas mentioned above, but extended to the temporal and parietal cortices, bilaterally. These functional changes corresponded to the neuropsychological deficits observed, i.e. disturbed selective attention and cognitive flexibility, verbal perseverations, and declarative memory deficits. It is suggested that functional changes may precede cerebral atrophy in Fahr's disease and may reflect deficits in functional circuits, which involve both the basal ganglia and the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.

### Neuroimaging in dementia [^116D8pwf]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Although regional volume loss occurs in both MCI and AD, the utility of using structural imaging for diagnosis remains unclear because in most volumetric studies of MCI and even AD, at least some overlap exists between patients and controls. As a result, imaging measures correctly identify between 80 and 100% of AD patients but a much smaller proportion of MCI patients, and this approach has significant limitations for assessing MCI-progressors from non-progressors.

Differentiating the different causes of dementia can prove challenging. Structural imaging can be useful in more advanced cases, especially in illnesses with focal degeneration. In FTD, a disorder that encompasses a heterogeneous group of patients sharing focal degeneration within the anterior frontal, temporal, and insular regions, MRI has revealed unique patterns of brain atrophy. FTD is a clinical term that includes these patients, while frontotemporal lobar degeneration refers to the pathologic change in this clinical group of focal degenerative disorders. In patients with the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD), frontal lobe volumes are reduced compared with those of both AD patients and age-matched controls. The target sites in FTD are the ventromedial frontal cortex, the posterior orbital frontal regions, the insula, and the anterior cingulate cortex, which differentiates this illness from AD as these areas are relatively spared in the latter disease, and atrophy in the frontal lobes is often in the lateral frontal lobe (FIG. 2). The target regions atrophied in bvFTD are the frontal components of the brain's emotional processing systems, so that their involvement in FTD explains the unique behavioral symptoms seen in that disorder. Patients with the semantic variant of FTD have relative preservation of frontal lobe volumes but marked loss of volumes in the temporal lobes, in particular the neocortex in the temporal pole (FIG. 2) as well as atrophy in the amygdala, which is a critical structure for emotional processing.

### A clinical-radiological framework of the right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia [^112H6oVb]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large systematic, retrospective study, we identified a uniquely large cohort of patients with rtvFTD based on brain atrophy pattern and set out to determine their clinical profile. Furthermore, we investigated overlapping and distinguishing clinical features of rtvFTD compared with svPPA, bvFTD, and Alzheimer's disease. We also studied the imaging phenotype of rtvFTD in more detail using VBM analysis and compared it with svPPA, the radiological differential diagnosis of rtvFTD. Prosopagnosia, episodic memory impairment and behavioural problems such as disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy and compulsiveness were the most prominent initial symptoms of rtvFTD, whereas language ability was relatively spared initially, unlike in svPPA. During the progressive disease course, language problems such as word finding difficulties and anomia became the main features of the disease. None of the current diagnostic criteria for bvFTD or svPPA fitted rtvFTD. VBM analysis revealed, apart from predominant right anterior temporal atrophy, involvement of the left temporal and the right ventral frontal areas. Notably, it exhibited a radiological mirror image of svPPA. Additionally, the temporal poles and the anterior fusiform gyrus — especially on the left-side — were associated with prosopagnosia in rtvFTD.

Prosopagnosia was the most unique symptom of rtvFTD. This result is consistent with expectations, as the relationship between prosopagnosia and right temporal lobe involvement has been described frequently.reported prosopagnosia in 10 of 11 cases with a right > left temporal atrophy, whereasreported prosopagnosia in 60% (12 of 20 cases) of patients with rtvFTD. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that impaired face recognition may not be mentioned as a specific problem by the patients and caregivers and specific tests for face recognition are usually not performed in general practice. Since it is not a clinical feature in one of the current diagnostic criteria for svPPA, bvFTD, and Alzheimer's disease, it might also easily be neglected by physicians.

### Mapping brain morphological and functional conversion patterns in predementia late-onset bvFTD [^1116VUGL]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is challenging during the predementia stage when symptoms are subtle and confounding. Morphological and functional neuroimaging can be particularly helpful during this stage but few data are available.

Methods

We retrospectively selected 25 patients with late-onset probable bvFTD. Brain structural MRI and FDG PET were performed during the predementia stage (mean MMSE score 27.1 ± 2.5) on average 2 years before. The findings with the two imaging modalities were compared (SPM8) with those in a group of 20 healthy subjects. The bvFTD patients were divided into two subgroups: those with predominant disinhibition (bvFTD+) and those with apathy (bvFTD-).

Results

Hypometabolism exceeded grey matter (GM) density reduction in terms of both extension and statistical significance in all comparisons. In the whole bvFTD group, hypometabolism involved the bilateral medial, inferior and superior lateral frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, left temporal and right parietal cortices and the caudate nuclei. GM density reduction was limited to the right frontal cortex and the left medial temporal lobe. In bvFTD+ patients hypometabolism was found in the bilateral medial and basal frontal cortex, while GM reduction involved the left anterior cingulate and left inferior frontal cortices, and the right insula. In bvFTD- patients, atrophy and mainly hypometabolism involved the lateral frontal cortex and the inferior parietal lobule.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that hypometabolism is more extensive than, and thus probably precedes, atrophy in predementia late-onset bvFTD, underscoring different topographic involvement in disinhibited and apathetic presentations. If confirmed in a larger series, these results should prompt biomarker operationalization in bvFTD, especially for patient selection in therapeutic clinical trials.

### Behavioural changes in frontotemporal dementia and their cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates [^112snb1F]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

The inherently shared phenotypic variation in FTD and the highly correlated atrophy across frontotemporal areas means that inter-subgroup comparisons limit the ability to localize precise functions to specific brain regions, and they can also be blind to the patterns of phenotypic variation that occur across the FTD clinical spectrum (including intermediate FTD cases who do not fall neatly into one diagnostic category). Therefore, we also used a data-driven transdiagnostic approach that treats FTD as a spectrum where patients represent phenotypic points along a frontotemporal atrophy continuum, to supplement classical diagnosis-based comparisons with multivariate analytics.

### Clinical and metabolic imaging features of late-onset and early-onset posterior cortical atrophy [^115oJJD1]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Age at onset (AaO) may have an impact on neural and clinical features of degenerative dementia. Several studies comparing the characteristics of patients with late‐onset (LO) or early‐onset (EO) Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlighted that LO cases usually show the classical, predominantly amnestic, phenotype, underpinned by prevalent mesial temporal neurodegeneration, whilst EO cases often present atypical, non‐amnestic, profiles, associated with prominent parietal or frontal damage and relative sparing of temporo‐limbic structures.

Since a high proportion of patients with PCA show AD pathology, this disorder has been labelled 'the visual variant of AD'. In PCA neurodegeneration targets primarily the occipito‐temporo‐parietal (OTP) regions, leading to early and prominent deficits of visual perception of objects, space and words, and to elements of Bálint–Holmes and Gerstmann syndromes, whilst episodic memory and executive functions, as well as disease insight, are relatively preserved.

### Primary progressive aphasia [^111KHWUo]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a focal dementia characterized by an isolated and gradual dissolution of language function. The disease starts with word-finding disturbances (anomia) and frequently proceeds to impair the grammatical structure (syntax) and comprehension (semantics) of language. The speech output in PPA can be fluent or nonfluent. Memory, visual processing, and personality remain relatively well-preserved until the advanced stages and help to distiguish PPA from frontal lobe dementia and the typical forms of Alzheimer's disease. The term "semantic dementia" was originally introduced to designate a different group of patients with a combination of verbal and visual processing deficits. In practice, however, this diagnosis is also being used in a variant sense to denote a subtype of PPA with fluent speech and impaired comprehension, even in the absence of visual processing deficits. Insofar as the diagnosis of semantic dementia can have these two different meanings, it is important to specify whether it is being used in the original sense or to denote a subtype of PPA. Structural and physiological neuroimaging confirms the selective predilection of PPA for the left hemisphere, especially for its language-related cortices. A few patients with PPA display the neuropathological markers of Alzheimer's disease, but in an unusual distribution. The majority of the autopsies in PPA have shown either Pick's disease or lobar atrophy without distinctive histopathology. The suggestion has been made that PPA and frontal lobe dementia constitute phenotypical variations of a unitary disease process within the "Pick-lobar atrophy" spectrum. Recent advances in chromosome 17-linked dementias justify a rigorous search for tau polymorphisms and tauopathy in sporadic PPA. An informed approach to this syndrome will increase the effectiveness with which clinicians can address the unique challenges associated with the diagnosis and care of PPA.

Sibling 008

This 71-year-old right-handed patient developed apragmatism over several months, without others behavioral troubles. On initial examination, he had a moderate dysarthria due to buccofacial apraxia. There were no signs of upper or lower motor neurons dysfunctions. Neuropsychological testing showed executive dysfunction associated with visuoconstructional deficit, without aphasia. Brain MRI showed major diffuse atrophy more prominent on the frontal and parietal lobes. Brain SPECT revealed severe hypoperfusion of frontal and parietal lobes, particularly in bilateral sulcus centralis (Fig. 3). Eight years after the disease onset, the clinical features were highly consistent with apraxia of speech associated with visuo-constructional deficit. Executive functions also deteriorated (Table 1), but autonomy was still preserved with an overall slow progression.

Sibling 009

This 74-year-old right-handed patient presented with visual and auditory hallucinations by the age of 72. He had bilateral hip fractures at the age of 67 caused by falls, but had no obvious clinical, biological, or radiological signs of PDB. Neurological examination was normal. Neuropsychological testing showed preserved memory functions with severe executive syndrome and visuo-constructional disabilities (Fig. 2). CT scan showed bilateral frontal atrophy. Brain ECD-SPECT revealed cortical frontal and temporal hypoperfusion (Fig. 3). Severe behavioral disorders subsequently appeared, especially self-mutilation that required hand amputation. Cognitive deficit worsened over time leading to the diagnosis of bvFTD. The patient was finally institutionalized and died at 80 years.

### Predominant right temporal lobe atrophy: clinical, neuropsychological and structural differences based on amyloid status [^11119yA7]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Predominant right temporal atrophy is a radiological sign usually associated with frontotemporal dementia but this sign can also be present in Alzheimer's disease. Given the overlap of clinical symptoms between the two conditions, it is important to know which characteristics allow them to be differentiated.

Objectives

To compare clinical, neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of subjects with prominent right anterior temporal atrophy, depending on the status of amyloid biomarkers.

Methods

Among patients followed in the dementia center of Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, subjects with right anterior temporal atrophy, defined as grade 3 or 4 on the corresponding visual rating scale, were identified. Only subjects with both an MRI scan and amyloid status available were considered. For selected subjects, data were extracted from clinical and neuropsychological records at initial presentation and at last available follow‐up. Two raters applied a protocol of eight visual rating scales to compare brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities.

Results

Of 497 subjects, 17 fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 7 amyloid‐positive and 10 amyloid‐negative. At initial presentation, executive dysfunction and topographical disorientation were more common in amyloid‐positive patients. At follow‐up, behavioral symptoms, such as social awkwardness and compulsive attitude, were more frequent in the amyloid‐negative patients. Amyloid‐positive patients presented an overall worse neuropsychological performance, especially in the language and visuospatial domain, and had higher scores on the right anterior cingulate visual rating scale.

Conclusion

Patients with predominant right temporal atrophy showed clinical, neuropsychological and radiological differences, depending on the status of amyloid biomarkers.

### Imaging cerebral atrophy: normal ageing to Alzheimer's disease [^113pPB11]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

With ageing populations, the prevalence of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease, is set to soar. Alzheimer's disease is associated with progressive cerebral atrophy, which can be seen on MRI with high resolution. Longitudinal MRI could track disease progression and detect neurodegenerative diseases earlier to allow prompt and specific treatment. Such use of MRI requires accurate understanding of how brain changes in normal ageing differ from those in dementia.

Starting Point

Recently, Henry Rusinek and colleagues, in a 6-year longitudinal MRI study of initially healthy elderly subjects, showed that an increased rate of atrophy in the medial temporal lobe predicted future cognitive decline with a specificity of 91% and sensitivity of 89% (Radiology 2003; 229: 691–96). WHERE NEXT? As understanding of neurodegenerative diseases increases, specific disease-modifying treatments might become available. Serial MRI could help to determine the efficacy of such treatments, which would be expected to slow the rate of atrophy towards that of normal ageing, and might also detect the onset of neurodegeneration. The amount and pattern of excess atrophy might help to predict the underlying pathological process, allowing specific therapies to be started. As the precision of imaging improves, the ability to distinguish healthy ageing from degenerative dementia should improve.

3.3 Pattern of cortical thickness of Korean patients with rtvFTD

For patients with rtvFTD, cortical thinning was most prominent in the right temporal and right frontal lobes, and also in the left temporal lobe, left orbitofrontal area, and right inferior parietal lobule compared to NCs. By contrast, patients with svPPA had the most severe cortical thinning in the left temporal lobe, with involvement of the left medial frontal region, left inferior parietal lobule, right temporal lobe, and bilateral orbitofrontal regions. The bvFTD group had bilateral frontal and temporal lobe cortical thinning; however, compared to the rtvFTD and svPPA groups, the degree and extent of temporal lobe thinning were less and those of frontal thinning were greater (Figure 1A).

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

NIA-AA probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia — diagnosis can be made when the patient "Meets criteria for dementia syndrome" and has "An insidious onset: symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over hours or days", with "Clear-cut history of worsening of cognition", and initial prominent deficits in an amnestic presentation or specified non-amnestic presentations. The amnestic presentation "is the most common syndromic presentation of AD dementia" with "impairment in learning and recall of recently learned information" plus another domain deficit, while non-amnestic variants include "Language presentation", "Visuospatial presentation", and "Executive dysfunction", each with additional domain deficits. The diagnosis "should not be applied" when there is evidence of substantial concomitant cerebrovascular disease, core features of dementia with Lewy bodies, prominent behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, prominent semantic variant or non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia, or another concurrent active disease/comorbidity/medication affecting cognition. "Biomarker evidence increases the certainty" that AD pathophysiology underlies the syndrome; if both amyloid-beta and neuronal injury biomarkers are present the "likelihood is high that dementia is due to AD", if either are absent it is "highly likely not due to AD", and if conflicting, likelihood is "intermediate".

### Neuroimaging in frontotemporal dementia: heterogeneity and relationships with underlying neuropathology [^1163Lx1w]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging Heterogeneity Within FTD Clinical Phenotypes: Data-Driven Approaches

In parallel to the aforementioned studies looking at neuroimaging patterns in groups of patients based on their neuropathological subtype, another approach has emerged: using neuroimaging data itself to identify subgroups of patients. This approach has gained much interest in the Alzheimer's field in recent years, and some groups have applied similar data-driven methods to patients within specific FTD syndromes.

bvFTD

In those with a clinical diagnosis of bvFTD, the patterns of neurodegeneration are quite heterogenerous. A 2009 study by Whitwell et al. of 66 subjects diagnosed with bvFTD found four distinct anatomical subtypes based on the pattern of atrophy; all were associated with significant behavioral abnormalities, though memory, executive function, and language deficits were variable across subtypes. The frontal dominant subtype (n = 21) showed atrophy largely restricted to the frontal lobes, though the parietal lobes were also affected to a mild degree. The frontotemporal subtype (n = 12) also demonstrated a substantial degree of frontal atrophy and mild parietal atrophy, but also demonstrated significant atrophy of the temporal lobes, whereas the frontal dominant subtype did not. These two subtypes were associated with similar deficits in executive functioning, but the frontotemporal subtype had greater memory and language deficits compared to the frontal dominant subtype. The temporofrontoparietal subtype (n = 27), as the name suggests, showed frontoparietal atrophy with additional involvement of the medial temporal lobes, though frontal lobe atrophy was not as severe as that seen in the frontal dominant and frontotemporal subtypes. Executive functioning deficits were less severe in the temporofrontoparietal subtype compared to the frontal dominant and frontotemporal subtypes, and mamory and language deficits were similar to that seen in the frontotemporal subtype. The temporal dominant subtype (n = 6) showed atrophy that was entirely localized to the temporal lobes and much more pronounced than the other three subtypes. Memory and language deficits were most prominent in the temporal dominant subtype, whereas executive functioning deficits were mild.

Diagnostic formulation in suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders — three-step approach and implementation guidance emphasize that the first step is to delineate the patient's cognitive functional status, the second step is to characterize the specific clinical profile of the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the third step is to establish the most likely brain disease (or condition) causing the clinical syndrome; a structured and individualized approach detailed in Recommendations 4 to 9 should be used, and for a majority of individuals with a typical presentation of dementia due to AD a first tier of clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging should be sufficient, after which clinicians decide if data are sufficient to reference established clinical diagnostic criteria or if additional tests or referrals are needed, noting that molecular biomarker confirmation may be desired and that despite increasing age raising the likelihood of multiple processes, a specific primary etiologic diagnosis is most likely and should be established and communicated.

Diagnosis of dementia — quantitative imaging for Alzheimer disease (AD) indicates that only one prospective Class I quantitative computed tomographic study using autopsy-confirmed diagnosis found that among 86 autopsied cases a medial temporal lobe width below the 5th percentile was 95% sensitive but only 40% specific for AD; across Class II CT or MRI studies of medial temporal atrophy, sensitivity ranged from 77 to 92% with specificities from 49 to 95%; automated MRI volumetrics were most reliable but are labor-intensive and not widely available; measurement of hippocampal atrophy by MRI may not be useful in clinical practice because of low precision; and combining medial temporal measures with functional neuroimaging or apolipoprotein E genotyping may improve diagnostic accuracy.

Diagnosis of dementia — SPECT, PET, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) states that SPECT and PET may be helpful in distinguishing FTD from AD; many patients with FTD show hypoperfusion of anterior cerebral cortex with relative sparing of posterior cortex on SPECT and PET; however, in these few Class II studies the highly selected participant pools limit generalizability of the reported specificities and sensitivities; and in patients with cognitive or behavioral deficits suggestive of FTD, no studies addressed what additional value a SPECT or PET scan provides.

### Neuroimaging in frontotemporal dementia: heterogeneity and relationships with underlying neuropathology [^112iwjH2]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Structural MRI may reveal atrophy of the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex in the earliest stages of the disease before patients fulfill the criteria for a diagnosis of bvFTD. As the disease progresses into the mild stages, additional areas become increasingly involved. The frontal lobes are widely impacted and typically exhibit degeneration of the frontal poles, dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, orbitofrontal cortex, and premotor cortex. The anterior temporal lobes, limbic structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the thalamus and striatum, are also commonly impacted. In the later stages of the disease, atrophy becomes more pronounced and involves the contralateral hemisphere to a greater degree, widely affecting the frontal and temporal lobes. Atrophy may also extend posteriorly to involve the parietal lobes and cerebellum.

In cases where structural imaging is equivocal, FDG-PET can potentially help determine if there is underlying neuronal dysfunction. FDG-PET typically demonstrates hypometabolism of the frontal and temporal lobes and is generally spatially consistent with atrophy patterns, with larger effect sizes. Hypometabolism can often be found impacting the frontal lobes, particularly in the medial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. The anterior and inferior aspect of the temporal lobes are commonly impacted and extends to the posterior fusiform gyrus. The medial temporal lobe is also commonly involved and hypometabolism of associated limbic structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the caudate and thalamus. In the later stages of the disease, further hypometabolism is demonstrated in the regions initially impacted, as well as the frontal poles, supplementary motor area, middle temporal gyri, posterior cingulate cortex, precunei, inferior parietal lobes, lateral superior occipital cortex, and cerebellum.

### A clinical-radiological framework of the right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia [^111HdDEc]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The concept of the right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia (rtvFTD) is still equivocal. The syndrome accompanying predominant right anterior temporal atrophy has previously been described as memory loss, prosopagnosia, getting lost and behavioural changes. Accurate detection is challenging, as the clinical syndrome might be confused with either behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) or Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, based on neuroimaging features, the syndrome has been considered a right-sided variant of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Therefore, we aimed to demarcate the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of rtvFTD versus svPPA, bvFTD and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we aimed to compare its neuroimaging profile against svPPA, which is associated with predominant left anterior temporal atrophy. Of 619 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia, we included 70 subjects with a negative amyloid status in whom predominant right temporal lobar atrophy was identified based on blinded visual assessment of their initial brain MRI scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed retrospectively and compared with age- and sex-matched patients with svPPA (n = 70), bvFTD (n = 70) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 70). Prosopagnosia, episodic memory impairment and behavioural changes such as disinhibition, apathy, compulsiveness and loss of empathy were the most common initial symptoms, whereas during the disease course, patients developed language problems such as word-finding difficulties and anomia. Distinctive symptoms of rtvFTD compared to the other groups included depression, somatic complaints, and motor/mental slowness. Aside from right temporal atrophy, the imaging pattern showed volume loss of the right ventral frontal area and the left temporal lobe, which represented a close mirror image of svPPA. Atrophy of the bilateral temporal poles and the fusiform gyrus were associated with prosopagnosia in rtvFTD. Our results highlight that rtvFTD has a unique clinical presentation. Since current diagnostic criteria do not cover specific symptoms of the rtvFTD, we propose a diagnostic tree to be used to define diagnostic criteria and call for an international validation.

Discussion

The patient exhibited insidious memory decline as the first clinical manifestation. The initial MRI revealed a mild global cerebral cortex and bilateral hippocampi atrophy with frontal lobe predominance, and APOE ɛ3/ ɛ4 genotype showed 3–4 times increase in suffering from late-onset AD. These findings are suggestive of a diagnosis of AD; despite this, we did not find the mutation of early-onset AD pathogenic genes including APP, PS1 and PS2. With disease progression, the patient experienced more prominent personality changes in the early stages of the disease. MRI at this stage revealed moderate atrophy of the cerebral cortex and bilateral hippocampi, with frontal lobe predominance. There was similar result in that ReHo value decreased in the frontal lobes through the analysis of BOLD functional imaging data. Despite combination therapy with a cholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (Memantine), cognitive function continued to decline rapidly over the course of 3 years. These particular symptoms seemed suggestive of a diagnosis of FTD. Although the patient began to show mild memory decline and errors in calculation in the early stages, she also exhibited prominent deterioration in personality and social etiquette in the first 2 years. Symptoms indicative of frontal lobe pathology included abulia, apathy, impaired verbal fluency and execution dysfunction. We also considered Lewy body dementia (LBD), given the patient's abnormal emotional behaviours, but excluded this possibility due to the lack of a Parkinson-like syndrome and definitive hallucinations. Another possibility was a form of rapidly progressive dementia such as prion protein disease. However, the patient was without deficits upon neurological examination or characteristic abnormalities ('cortical ribbon sign') on MRI. Beta amyloid is a common biomarker of AD. PIB can specifically bind to extracellular and intravascular fibrous Aβ, allowing PIB PET to be used as an Aβ-specific molecular probe to assess the deposition of Aβ plaques in different brain regions. It can also be used as a non-invasive test method to help dynamic monitoring of protein deposition, playing an important role in early diagnosis of patients with AD. Finally, the patient's 11C-PIB PET result confirmed the diagnosis of early-onset AD, given her memory decline as the first clinical manifestation, obvious cortex and hippocampus atrophy on MRI, diffuse cortical dysfunction supported by neuropsychological examinations during advanced stages of the disease and increased PIB binding in diffuse cortical areas.

### Prominent hypometabolism of the right temporoparietal and frontal cortex in two left-handed patients with primary progressive aphasia [^114Rdr52]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is characterized by progressive deterioration of language function with relative preservation of other cognitive functions. Previous studies based on neuroimaging and histology point to predominantly left temporal pathology in PPA patients. Here we report two left-handed subjects with typical symptoms of the nonfluent form of PPA in whom 18F-FDG PET revealed an asymmetric right-hemispheric pattern of reduced glucose metabolism in the frontal and temporoparietal cortex. These findings support the hypothesis that PPA can be considered as a symptom complex rather than a disease entity.

### Predicting disease progression in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia [^114XtpPG]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Medium credibility.

The present study aims to predict individual disease progression in bvFTD within 1 year after initial diagnosis using differentiated structural cerebral imaging data alone. According to the revised diagnostic criteria (Rascovsky et al.), probable bvFTD is characterized by frontal and/or temporal atrophy on MRI — but there are pronounced individual differences in atrophy patterns within these brain areas: there is clinical and pathological diversity between bvFTD patients, especially at the beginning of the disease. By detecting and quantifying cross‐sectionally the volume loss of different specific frontal and temporal subregions in patients (given in milliliters), we intended to find atrophy patterns that allow us to predict individual disease progression rate between two investigations with a temporal distance of 1 year. This method could be suitable to address the complexity of this disorder and at the same time build a helpful tool in clinical trials to predict disease progression rate.

### Cortical atrophy patterns of incident MCI subtypes in the mayo clinic study of aging [^112cDmp4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition to expected medial temporal lobe involvement, the amnestic cluster showed cortical thinning in the rest of the temporal lobe as well as frontal and parietal regions. This pattern is comparable to findings from other studies of prevalent MCI 9, 10, 38 that used conventional criteria for diagnosing MCI. 29 The degree of thinning in our amnestic cluster was similar in the left versus right entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices. Some studies report a predilection for more prominent left than right medial temporal involvement in amnestic MCI. 6, 8, 9, 10, 38 In contrast, two others found right‐sided predominant atrophy 1, 39 and another found right medial temporal lobe atrophy but left parietal lobe atrophy. 2 Some of the variability in findings could be due to the measures used to assess memory.

Previous studies have found left lateralized 4, 8 and bilateral findings 3 in MCI with prominent language involvement. Other investigators have also showed multiple brain regions were affected in multi‐domain MCI, including medial/lateral temporal, parietal and frontal regions 3, 4, 9, 11 and specifically, bilateral cortical thinning in a dysexecutive subtype. 8 The lack of substantial thinning of the temporal poles and precuneus, areas included in the AD‐signature region, 40, 41 along with relatively more involvement of lateral frontal regions than the other MCI subtypes suggests that individuals in the dysexecutive MCI cluster may be on a unique trajectory compared to the subtle cognitive impairment, amnestic MCI, and dysnomic MCI subtypes. Despite considerable overlap in the brain regions involved in the amnestic, dysnomic, and dysexecutive clusters, there are important regions where they do not overlap, which is informative and relates to the cognitive profiles we observe after clustering. 14

Neuroanatomical associations of frontotemporal lobar degeneration pathologies

No single cortical or subcortical region was specifically involved in association with a particular pathological process. However, pathological groups varied substantially in the hemispheric distribution of atrophy. This variation was evident at group level, in a quantitative volumetric analysis of preselected brain regions (Table 2) and in a qualitative but unbiased comparison of atrophy profiles (using voxel-based morphometry, Table 3); and after taking individual variation into account, in a cluster analysis (Fig. 4). In particular, the pathological groups here segregated according to whether they were associated with relatively symmetric versus strongly asymmetric involvement of the cerebral hemispheres (Table 2, Figs 1 and 4), and whether they were associated with relatively localized temporal versus extra temporal atrophy within an affected hemisphere (Table 3, Figs 2–4).

### Neuroimaging in frontotemporal dementia: heterogeneity and relationships with underlying neuropathology [^111Znx41]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

In cases of PSP-bvFTD, frontal atrophy is often relatively mild, and the temporal lobes are almost always spared, whereas posterior cerebellar atrophy is prominent and might help distinguish PSP-bvFTD from other subtypes. Atrophy in CBD-bvFTD (Fig. 6) tends to be more frontal than that seen in PSP. It involves the dorsolateral and medial frontal regions, with involvement of both the precentral and postcentral gyri, distinguishing CBD-bvFTD from other subtypes. In cases of nfvPPA, the left inferior frontal gyrus is the epicenter of disease and is atrophic in both PSP and CBD. PSP-nfvPPA exhibits a greater degree of atrophy in the bilateral precentral and middle frontal gyri, supplemental motor area, dorsal midbrain, and right cerebellar regions compared to CBD-nfvPPA. In CBD-nfvPPA, atrophy is distributed more widely and found in the left insula, putamen, supplemental motor area, and the left precentral, middle, and inferior frontal gyri. In a group of 26 patients with underlying 4R tau pathology (PSP or CBD) and various clinical diagnoses (including bvFTD), Spina et al. showed strong associations between grey matter volumes measured on antemortem MRI and neuropathological measures at autopsy. More specifically, they showed that higher scores of tau inclusion burden and neurodegeneration (a composite measure of neuronal loss, astrogliosis, and microvacuolations) were partly independently predictive of lower grey matter volumes.

FTLD-tau caused by MAPT mutation is overall characterized by early and severe symmetric bilateral temporal lobe degeneration, with early involvement of the anterior cingulate gyrus, orbitofrontal, and fronto-insular regions. Early degeneration of the hippocampal formation is common.

### Cognitive profiles discriminate between genetic variants of behavioral frontotemporal dementia [^1132mDka]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) includes a large spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders with a variable clinical presentation of either progressive behavioral and executive deficits (behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD]) or language dysfunction (primary progressive aphasia [PPA]), associated with prominent frontal and/or anterior temporal lobe degeneration. bvFTD is the most common phenotype in the clinical spectrum and the neuropsychological profile is generally characterized by impaired executive function (e.g. planning, set shifting and working memory), social cognition (e.g. theory of mind, emotional processing), whereas memory and visuoconstruction are relatively spared in comparison to executive dysfunction. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that these cognitive impairments vary in severity and progression. Executive dysfunction may be absent or overshadowed by behavioral dysfunctions and/or significant episodic memory impairment can be present even at the earliest stages of the disease. Factors influencing the variety in cognitive impairments between patients with bvFTD are not yet understood.

### Role of neuroimaging in multidisciplinary approach towards non-Alzheimer's dementia [^115ZYGFE]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD)

FTLD is a group of neurodegenerative diseases with a relatively rarer form of rapidly progressive dementia, characteristically involving the fronto-temporal lobes and insula. Clinically it comprises three subtypes: behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD) and nonfluent aphasia. The bvFTD is characterized by marked personality changes and behavioural problems, the most aggressive subtype with earliest average age of onset (fifth to sixth decade) and male preponderance. SD or the temporal variant is also known as the least aggressive variant, and typically presents with either word finding difficulty or prosopagnosia (inability to recognize faces), depending on the predominant temporal lobe predilection. Patients with non-fluent aphasia generally present with speech apraxia. The characteristic neuropathological finding in FTLD is tau proteinopathy, as in AD. Neuroimaging is non-specific in the early phase of disease with overlap among subtypes, and is used primarily to exclude other forms of dementia. With clinical progression, FTLD subtypes frequently show specific patterns of focal cortical atrophy with the classic "knife edge" appearance involving frontal and/or temporal lobes. In the bvFTD subtype, bifrontal atrophy is the most common finding, which usually progresses to involve the temporal lobes at a later stage of the disease. Behavioural changes are usually attributed to predominant involvement of the right frontal lobe (Fig. 6). The SD variant has predominant anterior temporal lobe atrophy and is more frequently marked on the left side, unlike AD, in which the temporal lobe involvement tends to be symmetric with no antero-posterior gradient. Prominent atrophy of the left perisylvian region is characteristic of non-fluent aphasia. Additionally, molecular imaging with either FDG-PET or rCBF (relative Cerebral Blood Flow) SPECT and quantitative analysis using 3D T1 MRI have shown good specificity in differentiating FTLD and AD based on identification of asymmetric and predominantly anterior versus posterior pattern of hypometabolism/perfusion and atrophy.

### Atrophy patterns in histologic vs clinical groupings of frontotemporal lobar degeneration [^115raQkh]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Predictable patterns of atrophy are associated with the clinical subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD): behavioral variant (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SEMD), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). Some studies of pathologic subtypes have also suggested specific atrophy patterns; however, results are inconsistent. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that clinical, but not pathologic, classification (FTD with ubiquitin inclusions [FTD-U] and FTD with tau inclusions [FTD-T]) is associated with predictable patterns of regional atrophy.

Methods

Magnetic resonance scans of nine FTD-U and six FTD-T patients (histologically confirmed) were compared with 25 controls using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Analyses were conducted with the patient group classified according to histologic or clinical variant. Additionally, three Alzheimer pathology patients who had the syndrome of SEMD in life (FTD-A) were analyzed.

Results

The VBM studies in clinical variants confirmed established patterns of atrophy (SEMD, rostral temporal; bvFTD, mesial frontal; PNFA, left insula). FTD-U and FTD-T VBM results were very similar, showing severe atrophy in the temporal poles, mesial frontal lobe, and insulae. A conjunction analysis confirmed this similarity. Subgroup analysis found that SEMD associated with either FTD-T or FTD-U was associated with similar rostral temporal atrophy; however, FTD-A had a qualitatively different pattern of left hippocampal atrophy.

Conclusions

While there is predictable atrophy for clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), histologic FTD variants show no noticeable differences. Reports of specific atrophy profiles are likely the result of idiosyncrasies in small groups. Semantic dementia associated with Alzheimer pathology, however, presented a distinct atrophy pattern.

### Therapy and management of frontal lobe dementia patients [^113RcD44]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with frontal lobe dementia (FLD) include those who suffer from Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, FLD without specific histopathologic features, as well as the infrequent families with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism associated with chromosome 17. Currently there have been no systematic efforts to manage and to treat patients with FLD. Drawing on the accumulated experience of clinicians and the known therapeutic approaches for patients with other neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD, the author discusses possible neurotransmitter replacement and biologic therapeutic approaches for patients with FLD.

### The clinical profile of right temporal lobe atrophy [^116RzbW1]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is currently associated with three syndromic variants. Disorders of speech and language figure prominently in two of the three variants, and are associated with left-sided frontotemporal atrophy. The detailed characterization of these syndromes contrasts with the relative paucity of information relating to frontotemporal lobar degeneration primarily affecting the right cerebral hemisphere. The objective of this study was to identify the clinical profile associated with asymmetrical, predominantly right-sided, temporal lobe atrophy. Twenty patients with predominant right temporal lobe atrophy were identified on the basis of blinded visual assessment of the MRI scans. The severity of right temporal lobe atrophy was quantified using volumetric analysis of the whole temporal lobes, the amygdala and the hippocampus. Profiles of cognitive function, behavioural and personality changes were obtained on each patient. The pattern of atrophy and the clinical features were compared with those observed in a group of patients with semantic dementia and predominant left-sided temporal lobe atrophy. The mean right temporal lobe volume in the right temporal lobe atrophy group was reduced by 37%, with the mean left temporal lobe volume reduced by 19%. There was marked atrophy of the right hippocampus and right amygdala, with mean volumes reduced by 41 and 51%, respectively (left hippocampus and amygdala volumes were reduced by 18 and 33%, respectively). The most prominent cognitive deficits were impairment of episodic memory and getting lost. Prosopagnosia was a symptom in right temporal lobe atrophy patients. These patients also exhibited a variety of behavioural symptoms including social disinhibition, depression and aggressive behaviour. Nearly all behavioural disorders were more prevalent in the right temporal lobe atrophy patient group than the semantic dementia group. Symptoms particular to the right temporal lobe atrophy patient group included hyper-religiosity, visual hallucinations and cross-modal sensory experiences. The combination of clinical features associated with predominant right temporal lobe atrophy differs significantly from those associated with the other syndromes associated with focal degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes and it is, therefore, proposed that this right temporal variant should be considered a separate syndromic variant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration.

### An algorithmic approach to structural imaging in dementia [^115wbrcc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Focal lobar atrophy

Atrophy with a focal lobar predominance is a useful starting point to help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with cognitive decline. In particular, an asymmetrical pattern of atrophy (left greater than right or vice versa) or more anterior than posterior atrophy, is more suggestive of underlying FTLD pathology rather than AD pathology.
Frontal lobe: Disproportionate frontal lobe atrophy is associated with FTLD pathology but does not differentiate between different FTLD histopathologies (eg, Pick's disease or corticobasal degeneration (CBD)). Patients with behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) may have symmetrical or asymmetrical frontal atrophy with or without additional temporal lobe atrophy. Despite a typically asymmetric clinical presentation, symmetrical frontal lobe atrophy is the predominant imaging finding in patients with dementia due to CBD pathology. However, many patients with a clinical diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome are found to have pathology other than CBD at postmortem, which may account for some of the variability reported in the literature. Currently imaging features are not included in the diagnostic criteria for CBD. Left-sided posterior frontoinsular atrophy, which may be limited to a subtle widening of the left sylvian fissure, is typically found in cases of progressive non-fluent aphasia(see figure 4).
Temporal lobe: Asymmetric temporal atrophy is most commonly due to FTLD pathology but can also be due to AD. The semantic dementia variant of FTD has a characteristic pattern of loss: typically, left greater than right focal anterior temporal atrophy particularly involving the temporal pole (which progresses to 'knife edge' atrophy), the amygdala and anterior hippocampus and often selective loss of anterior fusiform gyrus, with relative preservation of more posterior structures. Asymmetrical atrophy of the right temporal lobe with a similar distribution to SD may also occur, most commonly presenting as bvFTD and often with additional features of prosopagnosia and/or topographical memory impairment. While the asymmetry is usually dramatic in SD and the right temporal variant of bvFTD, both temporal lobes usually become involved and over time the pattern of atrophy may start to look more symmetrical (see figure 4). Logopenic aphasia (LPA) is also associated with greater left-sided atrophy in the temporal lobe although in contrast to SD the pattern of atrophy extends more posteriorly than in SD, predominantly affecting the posterior perisylvian and temporoparietal areas (angular gyrus, posterior middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus)(see figure 4). Unlike the majority of clinical syndromes associated with an asymmetrical pattern of atrophy, LPA is typically found to be a result of AD pathology. Nonetheless the presence of an anterior/posterior atrophy gradient in the temporal lobe is suggestive of FTLD rather than AD and can usefully be assessed by scrolling posterior to anterior through coronal T1 slices of the temporal lobe.
Parietal/Occipital lobe: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) involving the parietal/occipital cortex is usually the result of underlying AD pathology (see figure 4), however the differential diagnosis includes CBD, DLB and other less common causes. PCA with additional medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy supports AD as the most likely cause however the MTL may initially be (relatively) spared in posterior variant AD (PCA), especially in early-onset cases. Visual rating of posterior atrophy in combination with MTL atrophy rating has been reported to help discriminate AD from FTD and AD from normal ageing with a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 87%. Gross frontoparietal atrophy (extending into the temporal lobe) confined to a single hemisphere has been described in patients with progranulin mutations and should be considered in the presence of a strong family history.

### Disentangling the neural correlates of corticobasal syndrome and corticobasal degeneration with systematic and quantitative ALE meta-analyses [^113KCotw]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, here we present the first powerful data-driven meta-analyses identifying and comparing the neural correlates of CBS and CBD for MRI measuring atrophy in comparison with healthy control subjects. The design enabled high validity and statistical power by including 200 patients with this rare disease and 318 healthy control subjects. Additionally, the inclusion criterion of whole brain imaging studies for all meta-analyses guaranteed a data-driven approach.

Our results reveal that CBS is characterized by gray matter loss in the basal ganglia/thalamus, frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. In CBD patients, atrophy in the thalamus, frontal, temporal and occipital lobes was found. The latter results on CBD agree with Dickson et al.who described histopathologically atrophy and tau-immunoreactive lesions in the superior frontal/parietal, pre- and postcentral gyri, the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the thalamus in CBD.

Most remarkably, in a conjunction analysis focusing on common brain regions affected by both, CBS and CBD, our study identified four brain areas with significant atrophy: (1) the bilateral anterior thalamus, and (2) the bilateral posterior frontomedian cortex, posterior midcingulate cortex and premotor area/supplementary motor area, and, in the left hemisphere, (3) the posterior superior frontal sulcus and middle frontal gyrus/precentral gyrus, and (4) the left posterior superior frontal sulcus and middle frontal gyrus. As these regions obviously constitute the core hubs for CBS/CBD according to our meta-analyses, we want to discuss them now in more detail. With regard to disease specificity, we will compare results of our ALE meta-analysis with structural MRI ALE meta-analyses of other neurodegenerative diseases (Table 2). Note that the differential diagnosis between CBS/CBD, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease is of paramount interest, as all of these might be associated with an (atypical or typical) Parkinson's syndrome.

### Accelerating regional atrophy rates in the progression from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease [^1165NNsf]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Results

Demographics and clinical data are presented by patient group in Table 1. No between-group difference in sex or follow-up time was found. MCI patients were older than AD patients and controls. Frontal, medial temporal, temporal (excluding medial temporal), parietal, occipital and insular atrophy rates are given in Table 1. ANOVA for repeated measures with region as within-subjects factor, group as between-subjects factor, and age and sex as covariates showed main effects of diagnostic group (p < 0.001) and region (p < 0.001), and an interaction between diagnosis and region (p < 0.001), indicating different patterns of regional atrophy rates according to diagnostic group. Figure 2 shows that for MCI patients, the highest annualized atrophy rates were observed not only in the medial temporal lobe, but also in the remaining (extramedial) part of the temporal lobe. With progression of the disease, the atrophy appears to spread more widely through the brain, with patients with clinically established AD showing higher atrophy rates in temporal, frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The atrophy rate in the medial temporal lobe appears to already have reached its maximum at a stage prior to clinical diagnosis, as this rate did not increase further in patients with AD when compared with MCI patients.

Fig. 2
Regional atrophy rate in six predefined lobar regions are presented by diagnostic group: frontal, medial temporal (hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus), temporal (extramedial), parietal, occipital and insular lobe. In controls, atrophy rates are around 0.5%/year for each region. In MCI patients, atrophy rates start to accelerate mainly in the medial temporal, and remaining temporal lobe (extramedial), and to a lesser extent in the other regions. AD is characterised by a further increase in atrophy rate in the remainder of the temporal lobe, parietal, frontal, occipital and insular lobe. Medial temporal lobe atrophy rates appear to be at a maximum, in the preclinical stage, since the rate is comparable to that of MCI patients.

### Expert opinions on pharmacological symptomatic treatment of behavioral symptoms in frontotemporal dementia: a survey of the neuropsychiatric international consortium on frontotemporal dementia (NIC-FTD) [^1121aVhw]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is the second most common cause of young onset dementia. FTD is characterized by progressive frontal, temporal, and/or insular atrophy. FTD encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical syndromes, of which behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) is the most common. bvFTD is characterized by profound and progressive changes in behavior and cognition. In bvFTD, patients often lack any insight into their disease.

Presently, there is no curative treatment available for bvFTD. Clearly, the lack of curative treatment poses a serious problem. Concomitantly, on the symptomatic level, there is no consensus on the optimal pharmacological treatment. Currently, clinicians confronted with behavioral symptoms in bvFTD have to treat these pragmatically. As there is no curative treatment for bvFTD expected in the near future, a more effective symptomatic treatment is pivotal to reducing the burden of this disease for both the patients and their caregivers. This burden is reflected by stated unmet needs according to caregivers and patient organizations.

### Rates of hemispheric and lobar atrophy in the language variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration [^115wF3js]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which presents with either behavioral or language impairment. The two language syndromes are known as progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SEMD). While cross-sectional imaging patterns of brain atrophy are well-described in FTLD, fewer studies have investigated longitudinal imaging changes. We measured longitudinal hemispheric and lobar atrophy rates using serial MRI in a cohort of 18 patients with PNFA and 17 patients with SEMD as well as 14 cognitively-normal control subjects. We subsequently calculated sample size estimates for clinical trials. Rates of left hemisphere atrophy were greater than rates of right hemisphere atrophy in both PNFA and SEMD with no significant differences between the groups. The disease groups showed asymmetrical atrophy (more severe on the left) at baseline with significantly increasing asymmetry over time. Within a hemisphere, the fastest rate of atrophy varied between lobes: in SEMD temporal > frontal > parietal > occipital, while in PNFA frontal > temporal/parietal > occipital. In SEMD, using temporal lobe measures of atrophy in clinical trials would provide the lowest sample sizes necessary, while in PNFA left hemisphere atrophy measures provided the lowest sample size. These patterns provide information about disease evolution in the FTLD language variants that is of both clinical and neurobiological relevance.

1 INTRODUCTION

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a clinically, neuroanatomically, and pathologically heterogeneous syndrome, most commonly caused by aggregation of two types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology, FTLD‐tau and FTLD‐TDP. Though neuropathological characteristics do not reliably predict distinct bvFTD clinical features, there is a specific correspondence between clinical symptoms and underlying neuroanatomy. Pathognomonic symptoms of the bvFTD syndrome, including early decline of social behavior and personal conduct, such as loss of empathy, coldness, and compulsiveness, correspond to neurodegeneration in specific cingulo‐insular and temporal lobe regions. However, both the symptom constellations and the underlying dysfunction in the associated intrinsically connected networks (ICNs) differ substantially across bvFTD patients. Thus, using patterns of anatomy to categorize patients into distinct, stable, clinical subtypes of bvFTD is likely to elucidate specific mechanisms and vulnerabilities in the affected regions. Particularly if these anatomic bvFTD subtypes remain distinct over the disease course, such classification would yield an improved taxonomy to help clinicians better predict the longitudinal progression of an individual patient's atrophy and clinical symptoms.

Objectives

Temporal lobe atrophy as assessed by MRI can be measured in several ways. Volumetric measurements are quantitative but very time consuming and require extensive training to perform, so are not easily transferable to clinical practice. Visual rating scales, by contrast, are quick and widely applicable. Although medial temporal lobe atrophy is well described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is uncertain how early these changes can be detected and whether they discriminate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases, most notably frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The objectives were (1) to develop a widely applicable temporal lobe rating scale, and (2) to characterise and quantify the patterns of temporal lobe atrophy in AD versus temporal and frontal variants of FTD.

Methods

The temporal lobe assessments were made using an established hippocampal rating scale extended to incorporate additional temporal regions. This was firstly validated with volumetric analysis and then applied to 30 probable AD, 30 FTD (consisting of 17 temporal variant (semantic dementia) and 13 frontal variant) and 18 control coronal MRI images.

Results

Bilateral hippocampal atrophy was found in 50% of the patients with AD. Contrary to expectations, patients with semantic dementia also had hippocampal atrophy, which for the left side exceeded that seen in AD; other regions (temporal pole, parahippocampal gyrus, and lateral temporal lobe), spared in AD, were severely atrophied in this group. The patients with frontal variant FTD occupied an intermediate position and were largely indistinguishable from AD.

Conclusions

Hippocampal atrophy is, therefore, not specific for AD. Semantic dementia can be distinguished from AD, by the presence of severe bilateral atrophy of the temporal pole, parahippocampal and lateral regions. These findings have implications for the differential diagnosis of dementias.

Abstract

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cortical and subcortical atrophies, with early involvement of the hippocampus and amygdala. A 58-year-old man with clinical presentation of primary progressive aphasia-particularly its svPPA (semantic variant)-and bilateral asymmetric (left-predominant) anterior temporal lobe atrophy on MRI was referred for brain perfusion SPECT. This revealed bilateral hypoperfusion of the anterior temporal lobe (sustained by software-fused SPECT/MRI), pointing toward FTD rather than Alzheimer disease. Furthermore, voxel-based MRI volumetric analysis confirmed bilateral atrophy affecting the hippocampus and amygdala. Combining SPECT with MRI was supportive of the early-onset FTD-related svPPA diagnosis.

UNDERSTANDING DISEASE PROGRESSION IN FTD

Together with diagnosis, one of the most common questions patients with dementia and their families ask is regarding prognosis. Disease duration in frontotemporal dementia is approximately 7–9 years on average from onset of clinical symptoms. It is, however, highly variable, and ranging between 18 months and > 20 years. Disease duration also varies across FTD subtypes. It tends to be longer in the language than the behavioral syndromes.

In bvFTD, the disease progression is also variable. Importantly, the current diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of 'probable' bvFTD offer high clinical certainty. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of individuals meeting the 'probable' criteria at baseline will continue to do so over time, or will move to the 'certain' diagnostic category (either because of postmortem confirmation or because of results from genetic investigations). In other words, while the exact underlying pathology in these individuals may still be unclear, the likelihood of being FTLD is high. The provision of the 'possible' and 'probable' disease certainty classification in the revision of the consensus criteria, has enabled the identification and investigation of 'possible' cases. In these individuals, the initial clinical presentation is unclear, often because of a lack of supporting neuroimaging evidence, or because of a limited constellation of clinical symptoms. Progression of these 'possible' bvFTD cases over time is becoming better understood, whereby half of these individuals will end up meeting the more stringent criteria for 'probable' or even 'definite' bvFTD over time. In these, individuals, the presence of memory deficits on cognitive testing at baseline, together with a positive family history of dementia appear to be the best predictors of a future 'probable' diagnosis.
