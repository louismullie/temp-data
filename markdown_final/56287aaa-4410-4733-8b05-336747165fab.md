## Question

can you correct siadh hyponatremia too quick

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SIADH-related hyponatremia can be corrected too quickly, what the associated risks are, and how to manage it safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of SIADH and why the brain is vulnerable during correction. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence linking rapid correction to osmotic demyelination syndrome and quantify the risk. Next, I will review guideline-based correction limits and how they vary by chronicity and risk factors. After that, I should examine which therapies most commonly cause overcorrection and why. Finally, I will outline practical, monitoring-based strategies to prevent and, if needed, reverse overcorrection, and reconcile this with emerging data on mortality and correction speed.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. In SIADH, inappropriate antidiuresis causes water retention and dilutional hyponatremia; the brain adapts by extruding inorganic ions and organic osmolytes to limit cerebral edema, but this adaptation makes it vulnerable to injury if serum sodium rises too fast, which can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome with potentially permanent neurologic deficits or death [^111fLWER] [^115CxKiL].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence for harm from rapid correction. Multiple series and reviews document that overly rapid correction, particularly in chronic or severe hyponatremia, is associated with osmotic demyelination; for example, a Swedish registry identified 83 MRI-documented cases, almost all chronic hyponatremia, with most corrected by more than 8 mmol/L in 24 hours, and contemporary reviews estimate roughly 40% full recovery, 25% persistent deficits, and about 6% mortality after ODS, underscoring the severity of this complication [^113h7J5E] [^111fLWER].

> I should confirm the correction limits endorsed by guidelines. For chronic or unknown-duration hyponatremia, most international guidance advises no more than 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours and no more than 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, with stricter targets of 4–6 mmol/L in 24 hours for high-risk patients such as those with sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hypokalemia, or advanced liver disease; for acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia, a controlled 4–6 mmol/L early rise is acceptable to mitigate cerebral edema, but the same 24–48 hour limits still apply thereafter to avoid ODS [^113h7J5E] [^113LDB46] [^114hmeK4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapies. I need to check which treatments most often overshoot. Observational registries show that hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produce the largest mean sodium increases and carry the highest risk of overly rapid correction, with overcorrection rates around 10–20% in some cohorts; tolvaptan labeling also warns that 7% exceed 8 mEq/L by about 8 hours and 2% exceed 12 mEq/L by 24 hours, reinforcing the need for close monitoring and proactive mitigation plans [^11653Q73] [^112rUkWQ] [^114CTyZS].

> Let me think about mechanisms of overcorrection. The main driver is often a sudden water diuresis once the underlying cause of antidiuresis resolves or is pharmacologically reversed, causing serum sodium to rise faster than intended; this is why frequent sodium checks and urine output monitoring are essential during active correction, and why some experts advocate a reactive or rescue desmopressin strategy to cap free water losses when the rise is too brisk [^113SHKnQ] [^113LDB46].

> I should double-check practical prevention and rescue strategies. If sodium is rising too quickly, guidelines recommend stopping the offending therapy, administering electrolyte-free water such as 5% dextrose, and giving desmopressin to halt aquaresis; proactive desmopressin can be considered in select high-risk scenarios, though evidence is limited and a reactive approach remains standard in most pathways [^114oqYXZ] [^113PyTGH] [^113ToEcJ] [^115eEJTN].

> But wait, what if someone argues that slower correction increases mortality. Recent meta-analytic data suggest that rapid correction may be associated with lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality compared with very slow correction, yet these are observational, confounded, and not designed to capture ODS risk; conversely, expert rebuttals emphasize that the ODS signal persists in high-risk phenotypes and that abandoning conservative limits could expose vulnerable patients to irreversible harm, so the balance still favors controlled correction with vigilant monitoring until higher-quality randomized data are available [^1147wBVW] [^113Nbhcf] [^114bTxzD].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. Yes, SIADH-related hyponatremia can be corrected too quickly, and doing so risks osmotic demyelination, especially in chronic or severe cases and in patients with additional risk factors; guideline-concordant limits of 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours and 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, with stricter 4–6 mmol/L targets for high-risk patients, remain prudent, with hypertonic saline and tolvaptan requiring the closest surveillance and a low threshold to relower sodium with dextrose and desmopressin if limits are exceeded [^113h7J5E] [^112sZjn1] [^114hmeK4].

---

In SIADH, **rapid correction of hyponatremia (> 8–10 mmol/L in 24 h)** [^116VvNY1] can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^111fLWER], a potentially irreversible neurologic injury [^111fLWER]. The risk is highest in chronic or unknown-duration hyponatremia, malnutrition, alcoholism, or liver disease [^113h7J5E]. To prevent ODS, **limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 h** (≤ 6 mmol/L in high-risk patients) [^112sZjn1] and monitor sodium every 2–4 h during active correction. If overcorrection occurs, promptly administer desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to safely relower sodium [^113ToEcJ] [^112nVQKK].

## Risks of rapid correction in SIADH

Rapid correction of hyponatremia in SIADH carries a **significant risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)** [^111fLWER], also known as central pontine myelinolysis. ODS is characterized by:

- **Neurological sequelae**: Dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma, and death [^112rUkWQ].

- **Irreversibility**: ODS can result in permanent neurological disability or death [^111fLWER].

- **Risk factors**: Chronic hyponatremia (> 48 hours), severe hyponatremia (≤ 120 mmol/L), malnutrition, alcoholism, liver disease, and hypokalemia [^113h7J5E].

---

## Recommended correction rates

Guidelines recommend **strict correction limits** to minimize the risk of ODS:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended correction rate** |
|-|-|
| General patients | ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours |
| High-risk patients (malnutrition, alcoholism, liver disease) | ≤ 6 mmol/L in 24 hours |
| Acute symptomatic hyponatremia | Initial 4–6 mmol/L increase to control severe symptoms, then slow correction |

---

These limits apply regardless of symptom severity; exceeding them **increases the risk of ODS** [^113h7J5E].

---

## Clinical evidence of harm from rapid correction

Multiple studies and case reports document **harm from rapid correction**:

- **Registry data**: Overcorrection (> 8 mmol/L in 24 hours) occurred in 10.2% of patients, with hypertonic saline and tolvaptan associated with higher rates [^114oZizi].

- **Tolvaptan trials**: Rapid correction (> 12 mmol/L in 24 hours) occurred in 1.7% of patients, with higher rates in SIADH subgroups [^115KMrVW].

- **Case reports**: Rapid correction has been directly linked to ODS, particularly in chronic hyponatremia [^113h7J5E].

---

## Monitoring and prevention strategies

To prevent rapid correction, **careful monitoring and proactive measures** are essential:

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check serum sodium every 2–4 hours during active correction [^notfound].

- **Desmopressin (DDAVP)**: Administer proactively or reactively to prevent or halt rapid correction, especially after hypertonic saline [^117SmC1L].

- **Hypotonic fluids**: Use 5% dextrose in water (D5W) to relower sodium if overcorrection occurs [^112sZjn1].

- **Urea**: Consider oral urea to achieve controlled, gradual correction with lower ODS risk [^113tpb9e].

---

## Management of overcorrection

If overcorrection occurs, **immediate action is required**:

- **Stop active therapies**: Discontinue hypertonic saline or vasopressin antagonists [^114oqYXZ].

- **Desmopressin**: Administer 1–2 mcg IV/SQ every 8 hours to halt aquaresis [^113ToEcJ].

- **Hypotonic fluids**: Infuse D5W to relower sodium safely [^113PyTGH].

- **Monitor closely**: Track sodium and neurologic status frequently [^113SHKnQ].

---

## Clinical outcomes of rapid correction

Rapid correction is associated with **increased risk of ODS**, permanent neurological disability, and death [^111fLWER]. Although some observational studies suggest lower mortality with faster correction, these findings are confounded and not supported by randomized trials; the risk of ODS remains a compelling reason to adhere to guideline limits [^113Nbhcf] [^1147wBVW].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Limit correction**: ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours (≤ 6 mmol/L in high-risk patients) [^113LDB46].

- **Monitor frequently**: Sodium every 2–4 hours during correction [^notfound].

- **Use desmopressin**: Proactively or reactively to prevent or halt rapid correction [^117SmC1L].

- **Relower if needed**: Use D5W and desmopressin if overcorrection occurs [^112nVQKK].

- **Consider urea**: For gradual, controlled correction with lower ODS risk [^113tpb9e].

---

Rapid correction of hyponatremia in SIADH can cause **severe, irreversible neurological injury** from osmotic demyelination [^111fLWER]. Adhering to guideline limits, monitoring closely, and using desmopressin and hypotonic fluids when needed are essential to prevent harm [^112sZjn1].

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

This review will address the management of hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in hospitalized patients. To do so requires an understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of SIADH, as well as currently available treatment options. The review will be structured as responses to a series of questions, followed by a presentation of an algorithm for determining the most appropriate treatments for individual patients with SIADH based on their presenting symptoms.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Vaptans are not the mainstay of treatment in hyponatremia: perhaps not yet [^111pdJne]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Two vasopressin antagonists ('vaptans') are now in the market for the treatment of euvolemic (Europe) or euvolemic and hypervolemic (United States) hyponatremia: conivaptan for intravenous use and tolvaptan for oral application. Although their specificity and effectiveness are considered established, their indications are not. At present, we do not know which symptoms of hyponatremia and which degree of hyponatremia should serve as indications for vaptans. Other areas of uncertainty relate to the following unanswered questions: do vaptans shorten the duration of hospitalization? Is it justifiable to use them to prevent relapse of hyponatremia in (chronic) SIAD(H)? (In this text we use the abbreviation SIAD(H) instead of the recently proposed abbreviation SIAD to emphasize that vaptans will work only in the presence of ADH ('SIADH') but not in the syndrome of nephrogenic antidiuresis.) Do they decrease the high mortality associated with hyponatremia? How do we justify the cost of chronic vaptan therapy? The optimal vaptan regimen (dose, timing of controls) to treat SIAD(H) is currently not established, as is the procedure to be recommended in a too rapid correction rate of (chronic) hyponatremia. Until these requirements shall be met by additional studies, we are hesitant to consider vaptans a treatment of choice for the appropriate hyponatremias.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116dV2Et]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Our recommendations about tolvaptan use

We recommend individualising treatment of SIAD, based on a benefit–risk analysis for each patient and several individual factors, including chronicity of hyponatraemia, aetiology of SIAD, comorbidities, symptoms and biochemical parameters.

We promote the use tolvaptan as the main pharmacotherapy for SIAD for the following reasons:

Tolvaptan is, undoubtedly, highly efficacious in correcting hyponatraemia. Evidence that tolvaptan improves hard clinical outcomes is currently lacking, but this applies to all treatment options for SIAD. Therefore, using our clinical judgement on a case-by-case basis, we decide whether each individual is likely to benefit from increasing serum sodium levels.
Tolvaptan is the sole treatment modality licenced for the treatment of SIAD in the United States and Europe, having undergone stringent review of risk–benefit balance by the regulatory authorities and based on high-quality evidence basis for efficacy and safety. On the contrary, the use of other agents is supported by low-quality data, derived primarily from retrospective uncontrolled studies and case series.
Regarding concerns about tolvaptan-related overly rapid hyponatraemia correction, greater effectiveness is associated with a higher risk for too rapid correction. However, it can be substantially reduced, provided patients undergo rigorous monitoring at frequent intervals and specific measures are implemented, when need arises, to prevent, or even reverse, overly rapid correction.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147wBVW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

Objective

To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

Study Selection

Comparative studies assessing rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers (N. A.F. J.R.M. J.M. A. A.C.) independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Results

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11 811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included (mean [SD] age, 68.22 [6.88] years; 56.7% female across 15 studies reporting sex). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction was associated with 32 (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55–0.82) and 221 (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.79) fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Low-certainty evidence suggested that rapid correction was associated with 61 (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.67) and 134 (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28–0.44) fewer deaths per 1000 treated patients at 30 days and with a reduction in LOS of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.51–1.89) and 3.09 (95% CI, 1.21–4.94) days, compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Rapid correction was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ODS.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, slow correction and very slow correction of severe hyponatremia were associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospital LOS compared to rapid correction.

### Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency [^112nVQKK]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency. Excessive correction usually results from the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis after resolution of the cause of water retention. The concurrent administration of desmopressin and 5% dextrose in water can be given to cautiously re-lower the serum sodium concentration when therapeutic limits have been exceeded. Nephrologists should be equally aggressive in correcting hyponatremia and in un-correcting it when their patients get too much of a good thing.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of overly rapid correction, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider administering an infusion of 10 mL/kg body weight of electrolyte-free water (such as glucose solutions) over 1 hour, in consultation with an expert and under strict monitoring of urine output and fluid balance.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113ToEcJ]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of overly rapid correction, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider adding IV desmopressin (2 mcg, repeated not more frequently than every 8 hours), after consultation with an expert.

### Urea for hyponatremia? [^113wC389]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Once the standard of care for cerebral edema, urea can also be used to treat hyponatremia. The 2014 European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend urea for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, while discouraging use of vasopressin antagonists. Although there is evidence that urea can diminish hypertonic injury to brain cells caused by rapid correction of hyponatremia, clinical trials are needed that include patients at high risk to develop complications from overcorrection.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^1125c297]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, despite the high prevalence of HN, and published guidance on its diagnosis and treatment, numerous shortcomings in current HN management are evident. HN in general and SIADH in particular are often diagnosed without attention to accepted diagnostic criteria. Strikingly, many patients receive no specific treatment for HN. FR was predictably the most frequent initial therapy but was ineffective in more than half of the cases. When unsuccessful, FR was often not followed with an additional therapy. Despite the availability of active therapies to correct [Na +], HS, and vasopressin-receptor antagonists, clinicians typically discharge patients with unresolved HN. From this study, we can conclude that educational efforts should focus on how to diagnose SIADH with rigor, on the lack of efficacy of FR alone and the potential for [Na +] to fall with FR alone, on the use of active treatments to raise [Na +] urgently when needed, and on increasing the awareness of situations where overly rapid correction is likely. One such circumstance highlighted in the present study is the immediate postoperative period after pituitary surgery where SIADH may occur but be transient and diabetes insipidus requiring desmopressin may supervene. Here, concomitant treatment with active therapies may pose a special risk. Randomized controlled trials of HN therapy are needed to compare relative efficacy, risks of over rapid correction, and overall costs, particularly for the active treatments. Given the strong association of HN with adverse outcomes, but persisting uncertainty about whether HN contributes to the poor outcomes or is only a marker of severe underlying disease, research efforts should, in addition, focus on which patients are more likely to respond to specific therapies and which will directly benefit from correction of HN.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116Pc3fn]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 8.
Diagnosis and initial management of nonmild hyponatremia while confirming a diagnosis of SIAD. CT, computed tomography; IV, intravenous; Na +, sodium; NaCl, sodium chloride; ODS, osmotic demyelination syndrome; pNa, plasma sodium concentration; SIAD, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis; subcut, subcutaneous. Original figure, with reference to guidelines by Spasovski 2014 and Verbalis 2013.

Hypertonic saline is the agent of choice because it is immediately effective and titratable; it will reliably increase serum sodium irrespective of the underlying etiology, at least initially, as its osmolality (1026 mOsmol/L) exceeds that of maximal urine osmolality. It is not recommended to continue hypertonic saline beyond resolution of acute severe symptoms because of the risk of serum sodium overcorrection, which can occur in around 20% of cases (unless the hyponatremia is documented to be of acute duration < 24 hours, and rapid correction is tolerated) (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia" and Fig. 7). Overcorrection risk is significantly higher if more than 2 boluses of 100 mL, or more than a single bolus of 150 mL, of 3% NaCl, are given. It has long been recognized that hypertonic saline will not necessarily have a long-term therapeutic effect in SIAD, as the administered sodium will eventually be excreted in the urine; however, its immediate efficacy may be lifesaving.

Hypertonic saline is typically administered in a high-dependency setting or emergency resuscitation bay to allow for frequent monitoring. It is safe to administer NaCl 3% through a either a peripheral or central line. Despite this, some administration protocols erroneously call for a central line or place other restrictions on 3% NaCl use, such as a requirement for ICU admission. Resulting delays in hypertonic saline due to administrative barriers can have fatal consequences. In response to such restrictions, alternative approaches are sometimes used to circumvent these requirements, for example, using 2% hypertonic saline in some US hospitals instead of 3%. However, the osmolality of 2% NaCl (684 mmol/L) is not reliably higher than maximally concentrated urine and its use may delay symptomatic improvement; therefore, is not an adequate substitute for 3% NaCl. We recommend that nonevidence-based protocols that differ from current best practice be amended to facilitate peripheral administration of 3% NaCl and emergency administration in any hospital setting with appropriate monitoring, rather than recommending work-around alternative therapies.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11168QRU]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons for a less pronounced effect on mortality in SIAD (if this is a true effect confirmed in future studies) are unclear and remain speculative. It has been shown that paradoxically, mortality rate seems to be lower in patients with pronounced hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/L) compared to patients with a milder hyponatremia. Interestingly, the degree of hyponatremia varies according to hyponatremia etiology, and notably, SIAD seems to predispose to very low sodium concentrations. In patients with pNa below 120 mmol/L, the therapeutic approach has been shown to be different, with a higher percentage of ICU admission and of hypertonic saline administration as well as a more rapid initial sodium correction rate. This could possibly explain the lower mortality rates but higher ICU admission rates in these patients. However, since exact sodium concentrations were not known, this remains speculative. An alternative explanation for the "protective" role of SIAD might be the exact opposite, that is, that patients with SIAD had milder hyponatremia. Finally, the severity of the intercurrent diseases, medical complications during hospitalization, or the proportion of patients receiving palliative care might not have been distributed in a comparable way in both groups.

Regardless of cause, hyponatremia as a whole is associated with increased mortality, and timely diagnosis and treatment are important in improving clinical outcomes.

### Hyponatraemia-treatment standard 2024 [^111Fe3u4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospital patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stay and financial burden. The speed of a correction with 3% sodium chloride as a 100- to 150-ml intravenous bolus or continuous infusion depends on the severity and persistence of the symptoms and needs frequent biochemical monitoring. The rapid intermittent administration of hypertonic saline is preferred for treatment of symptomatic hyponatraemia. In asymptomatic mild hyponatraemia, an adequate solute intake with an initial fluid restriction (FR) of 500 ml/day adjusted according to the serum sodium (sNa) levels is preferred. Almost half of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) patients do not respond to FR as first-line therapy. At present, urea and tolvaptan are considered the most effective second-line therapies in SIADH. However, the evidence for guidance on the choice of second-line therapy of hypotonic hyponatraemia is lacking. Oral urea is considered to be a very effective and safe treatment. Mild and asymptomatic hyponatraemia is treated with adequate solute intake (salt and protein) and initial FR with adjustments based on sNa levels. Specific treatment with vaptans may be considered in either euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients with high ADH activity. In order to ensure optimal patient outcome, close monitoring and readiness for administration of either hypotonic fluids or desmopressin may be crucial in the decision-making process for specific treatment and eventual overcorrection consequences. According to the guidelines, gradual correction and clinical evaluation is preferable over rapid normalization of sNa towards the laboratory reference ranges.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines-have they gone too far? [^117CEjPZ]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality affecting hospitalized patients. 1 It is an independent predictor for mortality and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher costs. The most serious potential complication is hyponatremic encephalopathy, a medical emergency that can result in death or irreversible brain injury if inadequately treated. 2 Hypertonic saline is a safe and effective means of correcting hyponatremia. 2–4 A rare yet serious complication from excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia is the development of cerebral demyelination.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^113h7J5E]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our treatment of hyponatremia should be informed by the best possible data, addressing two critical questions: How much correction is enough and how much is too much? Valid answers to these questions require studies of populations at high risk of complications from both excessive and inadequate correction of hyponatremia — patients with very low serum sodium. A study of individuals diagnosed with MRI-documented myelinolysis in the Swedish National Patient Register during 1997–2011 identified 83 patients with the disorder; 86.7% of patients were hyponatremic (all chronic), with a median sodium level at admission of 104 mmol/L, and all but six had been corrected by > 8 mmol/L in 24 hours. To be reliable, such studies will require rigorous methods to quantify increases in serum sodium throughout the hospital course and to accurately identify all complications — not just the most severe. In the future, those methods might include sophisticated software. But for now, meticulous chart review by hand, the method used when "osmotic demyelination syndrome" was given its name 37 years ago, remains the best approach.

Thankfully, changes in practice patterns have made osmotic demyelination syndrome less common than it was in the 1980s. On the basis of what we know today, correction of a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L by > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours or by > 18 mmol/L within 48 hours should be avoided — not because raising the serum sodium too rapidly commonly causes osmotic demyelination syndrome but because it can cause the syndrome. It has always been clear that overly rapid correction of hyponatremia does not inevitably lead to osmotic demyelination; rather, it is associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination.

The longer the duration of hyponatremia and the lower the serum sodium, the greater the risk for injury from excessive correction. If the sodium is ≤ 105 mmol/L or if there are additional risk factors for osmotic demyelination syndrome (alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease), correction by > 8 mmol/L per day should be considered excessive. The cost of limiting correction (more frequent blood draws and perhaps a somewhat longer hospitalization) is trivial when compared with the devastating consequences that can affect even surviving patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome. We strongly believe that abandoning established safeguards now is a bit like discarding your umbrella because you have remained dry in a rainstorm. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^112U3VUs]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The third research question relates to the main safety concern of tolvaptan, the likelihood for overly rapid hyponatraemia correction. Specifically, we need to establish the effectiveness and safety of tolvaptan in patients with very low serum sodium, for example, below 120 mmol/litre, who are most in need of hyponatraemia correction, and at the same time are exposed to the greatest risk of overcorrection. What is the magnitude of this risk when tolvaptan is used under stringent protocols, encompassing close electrolyte/fluid balance monitoring and measures to halt/reverse too rapid correction? In the era of personalised medicine, large prospective studies are warranted to demonstrate the parameters that can predict the magnitude of response to tolvaptan and are associated with high likelihood for over-rapid sodium correction. These data would provide the evidence basis for the development of a risk calculator for tolvaptan-related overly rapid sodium increase, individualising the starting dose and monitoring of tolvaptan. Various protocols of tolvaptan initiation, titration, monitoring and corrective measures should be prospectively tested to develop an algorithm for tolvaptan use, readily applicable to clinical practice, achieving maximal drug efficacy and safety. For example, an open-label randomisation trial is in progress, randomising patients with non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia to receive either 7.5 mg tolvaptan or fluid restriction imposed at 1000 ml/day, testing the hypothesis that tolvaptan can improve the rate of sodium correction as well as clinical outcomes, without exposing the patients at high risk of serum sodium overcorrection. These studies will determine the utility of tolvaptan in clinical practice and provide an evidence-based framework for tolvaptan administration and monitoring.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11183jyJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

There is little high-level evidence to guide chronic SIAD treatment because of the difficulty of conducting randomized trials due to the heterogeneity of patients with this condition, severity of illness that makes placebo therapy ethically difficult, and the potential for resolution of conditions perpetuating the nonosmotic release of AVP, which can confound trials of SIAD treatments. However, this tendency for "autocorrection" of hyponatremia due to SIAD, if caused by a reversible underlying condition, makes rigorous RCTs even more important to confirm any apparent benefits in observational studies. A 2017 systematic review of chronic hyponatremia treatments did not identify RCTs of any treatments other than vaptans, but since then new RCTs have emerged. Published RCTs of therapies for chronic hypotonic hyponatremia to date are summarized in Table 6.

### Treatment of hyponatremia [^113pumUb]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review literature from the past 18 months on the treatment of hyponatremia. Therapy must address both the consequences of the untreated electrolyte disturbance (including fatal cerebral edema due to acute water intoxication) and the complications of excessive therapy (the osmotic demyelination syndrome).

Recent Findings

Correction of hyponatremia by 4–6 mEq/l within 6 h, with bolus infusions of 3% saline if necessary, is sufficient to manage the most severe manifestations of hyponatremia. Planning therapy to achieve a 6 mEq/l daily increase in the serum sodium concentration can avoid iatrogenic brain damage by staying well clear of correction rates that are harmful. Conservative correction goals are wise because inadvertent overcorrection is common. Administration of desmopressin to halt a water diuresis can help prevent overcorrection; if overcorrection occurs, therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium concentration is supported by data in experimental animals and was found to be safe in a small observational clinical trial. Even mild and apparently asymptomatic hyponatremia may lead to falls because of impaired gait, and an increased likelihood of fracture because of hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis, a newly described entity. Recently approved vasopressin antagonists now make it possible to normalize the serum sodium concentration on a chronic basis, but practical considerations have limited their use.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^1139hX9K]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Some of the rationale supporting current expert opinion recommending controlled correction of hypernatremia rests on a perceived symmetry with correction of hyponatremia. While it is appealing to group these 2 common sodium disorders together, published data do not support this approach. The evidence supporting slow correction of hyponatremia is supported by animal studies, numerous case reports and large observational studies. In contrast, there are no convincing reports of even 1 adult harmed by rapid correction of hypernatremia. From a physiological perspective the risk of neurological complications seems to be much higher with rapid correction of hyponatremia, as the adaptations of brain cells to hypernatremia are much slower than to hyponatremia. Also, while the risk of complication associated with rapid correction is more common with chronic hyponatremia compared with acute hyponatremia, chronic hypernatremia is considerably less common than acute hypernatremia. Our results were comparable for patients with hypernatremia on admission compared with those who were diagnosed during hospitalization, also supporting the safety of rapid correction of hypernatremia even when there is no clear documentation of an acute condition.

The 30-day mortality was alarmingly high in the reported cohort. This is in line with previous studies of severe hypernatremia. The absolute difference in survival between rapidly and slowly corrected patients was very large and remained so after adjustment for potential confounders. Interestingly, the size of the absolute difference in survival was comparable at 30 days and at 1 year following documentation of severe hypernatremia. This might suggest that the different mortality rates do not represent differences in the patient populations unaccounted by the statistical analysis, but rather the results of the treatment strategies for severe hypernatremia, namely the rate of correction. An additional support to this hypothesis is the strong correlation reported between the absolute sodium correction in the first 24 hours and patient survival. This implies that the high mortality rates known to be associated with severe hypernatremia might be partly attributed to lack of aggressive rehydration, which might improve patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Thiazide-associated hyponatremia, report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^115zTKGG]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a frequent and potentially life-threatening adverse side effect of thiazide diuretics. This sub-analysis of the Hyponatremia Registry database focuses on current management practices of thiazide-associated hyponatremia (TAH) and compares differences between TAH and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

Methods

We analyzed 477 patients from 225 US and EU sites with euvolemic hyponatremia ([Na+] ≤ 130 mEq/L) who were receiving a thiazide diuretic. Of these, 118 met criteria for true thiazide-induced hyponatremia (TIH).

Results

Thiazide was withdrawn immediately after hyponatremia was diagnosed only in 57% of TAH; in these patients, the median rate of [Na+] change (Δdaily[Na+]) was significantly higher than those with continued thiazide treatment (3.8 [interquartile range: 4.0] vs. 1.7 [3.8] mEq/L/day). The most frequently employed therapies were isotonic saline (29.6%), fluid restriction (19.9%), the combination of these two (8.2%), and hypertonic saline (5.2%). Hypertonic saline produced the greatest Δdaily[Na+] (8.0[6.4] mEq/L/day) followed by a combination of fluid restriction and normal saline (4.5 [3.8] mEq/L/day) and normal saline alone (3.6 [3.5] mEq/L/day). Fluid restriction was markedly less effective (2.7 [2.7] mEq/L/day). Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia occurred in 3.1% overall, but in up to 21.4% given hypertonic saline. Although there are highly significant differences in the biochemical profiles between TIH and SIADH, no predictive diagnostic test could be derived.

Conclusions

Despite its high incidence and potential risks, the management of TAH is often poor. Immediate withdrawal of the thiazide is crucial for treatment success. Hypertonic saline is most effective in correcting hyponatremia but associated with a high rate of overly rapid correction. We could not establish a diagnostic laboratory-based test to differentiate TIH from SIADH.

### Use of urea for the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone: a systematic review [^113tpb9e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We systematically searched previous studies including patients with SIADH who received urea treatment. In the 23 studies analyzed, 537 patients with SIADH were reported and 462 were treated with urea as the only therapy. Due to the absence of randomized clinical trials, in particular ones with adequate sample sizes, there is no definite evidence for the efficiency of urea in the treatment of hyponatremia in patients with SIADH. However, the available, lower-quality evidence suggests that urea is an effective treatment option with a very low risk of overcorrection and rarely reported adverse effects aside from dysgeusia.

In the pooled analysis we present here, urea increased serum sodium by 10.2 mmol/L within the reported follow-up time and seemed to be as effective in increasing serum sodium concentration as the VRA tolvaptan (serum sodium increase of 10.4 mmol/L until end of follow up). The rise in serum sodium starts as early as 24 to 48 hours after treatment initiation. Nearly all reported patients improved their serum sodium concentration with urea treatment to a level above 130 mmol/L. The average urea dose in the 23 studies was 15 g to 30 g urea per day with no reported adjustment to urine osmolality. For context, the dose recommendation in the European guidelines for treatment of SIADHwith urea is 0.25 to 0.50 g/kg per day. Urea raises serum sodium by increasing free water excretion through an osmotic-diuretic mechanism. The amount of free water excretion and therefore effectiveness of urea depends among others on the applied dose of urea and the urine osmolality. With increasing urine osmolality, the necessary dose of urea to improve serum sodium is higher. A practical guideline on dosing of urea in hyponatremia patients with regard to the initial urine osmolality exists. The risk of overcorrection of serum sodium concentration with urea is very low. Overcorrection is assumed to be a major contributor to the development of ODS even though a recent work showed only very low incidences of ODS in a large retrospective cohort of patients with hyponatremia and found no correlation between rapid corrections of serum sodium and ODS. Of note, the incidence was higher in patients with serum sodium below 110 mmol/L and overcorrection should, in our opinion, still be avoided especially in high-risk patients. The risk for ODS is still a matter of concern, and especially in patients at higher risk urea might be a safe and effective therapeutic option. However, in animal models, urea seemed to protect from ODS. Regarding the most common adverse effect of urea, dysgeusia, previous studies suggest that taste of urea can be improved by adding sucrose and citric acidor by dissolving urea in sweetened beverages.

Current guidelines on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia often fail to meet methodological criteria for development and reporting as described by AGREE II. Despite many similarities, recommendations are sometimes inconsistent, but to what extent this is attributable to the underlying development process remains unclear.

### Tolvaptan [^112rUkWQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Too Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Can Cause Serious Neurologic Sequelae

Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g., > 12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium < 130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium < 130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with tolvaptan therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients treated with tolvaptan should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving tolvaptan who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with tolvaptan and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with tolvaptan tablets may increase the likelihood of overly-rapid correction of serum sodium and should generally be avoided. Co-administration of diuretics also increases the risk of too rapid correction of serum sodium and such patients should undergo close monitoring of serum sodium.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116cGVeF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The Hyponatremia Intervention Trial (HIT) is a large, international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) currently underway aiming to recruit 2278 hospitalized participants with pNa less than 130 mmol/L to be allocated 1:1 to receive either targeted correction of sodium concentration or standard care. The trial will include patients with hyponatremia irrespective of underlying cause or volume status. Targeted correction will aim to be achieved by adhering to predetermined diagnostic and treatment algorithms. The primary outcome will be death or rehospitalization within 30 days, and secondary outcomes will include measures of falls, fractures, hyponatremia recurrence, quality of life, and adverse events (eg, ODS). The results of this trial will provide high-quality evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that intervention to correct hyponatremia improves clinical outcomes.

Data regarding the mortality risk of SIAD specifically are conflicting, with some studies showing increased mortality and some potentially showing reduced mortality compared with other causes of hyponatremia. A prospective observational study in Ireland evaluated mortality outcomes in 1323 hyponatremic patients (43.3% with SIAD) compared to matched controls. SIAD was associated with increased mortality compared to normonatremic controls (RR 1.76; 95% CI, 1.08–2.8). However mortality risk in SIAD was not as high as for other causes of hyponatremia. Hypervolemic patients had an RR of mortality of 2.9 compared to SIAD, and hypovolemic patients had an RR of 1.6. A recent Swiss retrospective population-based cohort study of 47 176 medical inpatients with hyponatremia (11.9% with SIAD) using propensity-score matching found no significant effect of hyponatremia on mortality as a whole, but sensitivity stratification by non-SIAD and SIAD hyponatremic patients showed opposing results. While non-SIAD hyponatremic patients had a 10% higher risk for in-hospital mortality, SIAD seemed to be associated with reduced mortality — however, 30-day readmission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospital stay were all increased in SIAD. SIAD is known to be underrecorded in hospital coding, hence the accuracy of SIAD classification in this study may be low. This is particularly relevant when assessing mortality rates, as if a patient dies of an underlying malignancy, anecdotally, the hospital discharge documentation is even less likely to record comorbid SIAD.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^116SGPFK]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hyponatremia secondary to SIADH is frequent in cancer patients and potentially deleterious. The aim of this sub-analysis of the Hyponatremia Registry database is to analyze current diagnostic and therapeutic management practices in cancer patients with SIADH.

Methods

We analyzed 358 cancer patients who had serum sodium concentration ([Na +]) ≤ 130 mEq/L and a clinical diagnosis of SIADH from 225 sites in the United States and EU.

Results

Precise diagnostic testing was performed in only 46%. Almost 12% of all patients did not receive any hyponatremia treatment. The most frequent therapies were fluid restriction (20%), isotonic saline (14%), fluid restriction/isotonic saline (7%), tolvaptan (8%), and salt tablets (7%). Hypertonic saline was used in less than 3%. Tolvaptan produced the greatest median rate of [Na +] change (IQR) (3.0 (4.7) mEq/L/day), followed by hypertonic saline (2.0(7.0) mEq/L/day), and fluid restriction/isotonic saline (1.9(3.2) mEq/L/day). Both fluid restriction and isotonic saline monotherapies were significantly less effective (0.8(2.0) mEq/L/day and 1.3(3.0) mEq/L/day, respectively) and were associated with clinically relevant rates of treatment failure. Only 46% of patients were discharged with [Na +] ≥ 130 mEq/L. Overly rapid correction of hyponatremia occurred in 11.7%.

Conclusions

Although essential for successful hyponatremia management, appropriate diagnostic testing is not routinely performed in current practice. The most frequently employed monotherapies were often ineffective and sometimes even aggravated hyponatremia. Tolvaptan was used less often but showed significantly greater effectiveness. Despite clear evidence that hyponatremia is associated with poor outcome in oncology patients, most patients were discharged still hyponatremic. Further studies are needed to assess the beneficial impact of hyponatremia correction with effective therapies.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116syrTq]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), the commonest cause of hyponatraemia, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, leads through aquaresis to an increase in serum sodium concentration and is the only medication licenced in Europe for the treatment of euvolaemic hyponatraemia. Randomised controlled trials have shown that tolvaptan is highly efficacious in correcting SIAD-related hyponatraemia. Real-world data have confirmed the marked efficacy of tolvaptan, but they have also reported a high risk of overly rapid sodium increase in patients with a very low baseline serum sodium. The lower the baseline serum sodium, the higher the tolvaptan-induced correction rate occurs. Therefore, a lower starting tolvaptan dose of 7.5 mg has been evaluated in small cohort studies, demonstrating its efficacy, but it still remains unclear as to whether it can reduce the risk of overcorrection. Most international guidelines, except for the European ones, recommend tolvaptan as second-line treatment for SIAD after fluid restriction. However, the risk of unduly rapid sodium correction in combination with its high cost have limited its routine use. Prospective controlled studies are warranted to evaluate whether tolvaptan-related sodium increase can improve patient-related clinical outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay in the acute setting or neurocognitive symptoms and quality of life in the chronic setting. In addition, the potential role of a low tolvaptan starting dose needs to be further explored. Until then, tolvaptan should mainly be used as second-line treatment for SIAD, especially when there is a clinical need for prompt restoration of normonatraemia. Tolvaptan should be used with specialist input according to a structured clinical pathway, including rigorous monitoring of electrolyte and fluid balance and, if needed, implementation of appropriate measures to prevent, or when necessary reverse, overly rapid hyponatraemia correction.

### Revisiting new data on the mortality benefit of rapid correction of hyponatremia: Déj à Vu all over again [^113Nbhcf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies in the 1980s linking rapid correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia to the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) led to a major controversy that eventually gave way to consensus guidelines. Efforts to limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L per day in patients at high risk of developing ODS became common practice. Recent studies have questioned these guidelines, suggesting that ODS is rare and that slow correction may increase mortality. In this review, we revisit the history of the controversy and find that these claims have persisted for four decades. Older studies supporting faster correction are flawed by referral bias while newer studies are limited by confounding as comorbidities influence rates of both mortality and hyponatremia correction. While both old and new studies emphasize the rarity of MRI-documented ODS after rapid correction, they were not conducted in hyponatremic patients who were at risk for ODS. Old studies reporting hyponatremic deaths due to cerebral edema overestimate its true incidence and new studies reporting an association of mortality and slow rates of sodium correction do not document cerebral edema as a common contributor to death. Further research is required to better define the incidence of both ODS and cerebral edema in patients at risk for these complications. Until then, we conclude that the risks of rapid correction-including irreversible neurological damage-necessitate caution. Clinicians should continue to prioritize slow, controlled sodium correction to protect high-risk patients from harm.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^115cSj3z]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion" for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretions.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of SIADH, a condition characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone from the posterior pituitary gland or other sources. The criteria are primarily used to identify patients with hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder, who may have SIADH as the underlying cause.

The diagnostic criteria consist of essential and supplemental components. The essential criteria include effective serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg, absence of clinical evidence of hypovolemia or hypervolemia, urine sodium concentration greater than 30 mmol/L with normal dietary salt and water intake, absence of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary or renal insufficiency, and no recent use of diuretic agents.

The supplemental criteria, which provide additional diagnostic support, include serum uric acid less than 0.24 mmol/L, serum urea less than 3.6 mmol/L, failure to correct hyponatremia after 0.9% saline infusion, fractional sodium excretion greater than 0.5%, fractional urea excretion greater than 55%, fractional uric acid excretion greater than 12%, and correction of hyponatremia through fluid restriction.

The Diagnostic Criteria for SIADH is a comprehensive tool that incorporates a wide range of clinical and laboratory parameters, providing a robust framework for the diagnosis of this complex disorder.

The diagnostic criteria calculator for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is designed to analyze clinical criteria that can indicate the presence of this condition. It evaluates 13 specific criteria, each associated with a distinct point value. Responses to these criteria are typically marked as either true or false.

Here's how the criteria are scored:

- Effective serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg carries a weight of 8 points.
- Urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg is assigned 8 points.
- No clinical evidence of hypovolemia or hypervolemia also grants 8 points.
- Urine sodium concentration > 30 mmol/L with normal dietary salt and water intake merits 8 points.
- Absence of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, or renal insufficiency scores 8 points.
- No recent use of diuretic agents is worth 8 points.
- Serum uric acid < 0.24 mmol/L or < 4 mg/dL earns 1 point.
- Serum urea < 3.6 mmol/L or < 21.6 mg/dL contributes 1 point.
- Failure to correct hyponatremia after a 0.9% saline infusion results in 1 point.
- Fractional sodium excretion > 0.5% leads to 1 point.
- Fractional urea excretion > 55% scores 1 point.
- Fractional uric acid excretion > 12% provides 1 point.
- Correction of hyponatremia through fluid restriction adds 1 point.

The calculator sums the points for criteria that are marked true, resulting in a total score that is used to interpret the likelihood of SIADH being present. The interpretation process is as follows:

- If the total score is 7 or below, the criteria for SIADH are not met, suggesting that the condition is unlikely.
- A score ranging from 8 to 47 indicates that the criteria for possible SIADH are met, which implies a potential diagnosis.
- A score of 48 or higher confirms that the criteria for definite SIADH have been met, suggesting a strong likelihood of the condition.

This scoring and interpretation framework aids in systematically assessing whether the clinical criteria for SIADH are fulfilled.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^115vMp42]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of oral urea was reported as early as the 1980s, but its use remained rather limited. In recent years oral urea was "rediscovered", with several observational studies reporting positive experiences for the treatment of hyponatremia. A recent systematic review confirmed that oral urea is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for SIAD despite the lack of data from randomized controlled trials.

With the use of oral urea for SIAD becoming more widespread, it is also becoming increasingly important to better understand which clinical factors determine the hyponatremia correction rate during treatment. For example, several studies have shown that a lower baseline plasma sodium concentration predicts more rapid correction of hyponatremia, but it is not known whether this also pertains to treatment with oral urea. Previous studies also identified specific parameters that were associated with the response to therapy, including urine osmolality for fluid restriction and body weight for hypertonic saline. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate which clinical factors are associated with hyponatremia correction. To address this, we analyzed the hyponatremia correction rate during oral urea treatment in 140 patients from two university medical centers.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^112sZjn1]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia").

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^1175CAmS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

### Complications and management of hyponatremia [^113LDB46]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyponatremia causes significant morbidity, mortality, and disability. This review considers the literature of the past 18 months to improve understanding of these complications and to identify therapeutic strategies to prevent them.

Recent Findings

Acute hyponatremia causes serious brain swelling that can lead to permanent disability or death. A 4–6mEq/l increase in serum sodium is sufficient to reverse impending herniation. Brain swelling is minimal in chronic hyponatremia, and to avoid osmotic demyelination, correction should not exceed 8mEq/l/day. In high-risk patients, correction should not exceed 4–6mEq/l/day. Inadvertent overcorrection of hyponatremia is common and preventable by controlling unwanted urinary water losses with desmopressin. Even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, attention deficit, gait instability, osteoporosis, and fractures, but it is not known if the correction of mild hyponatremia improves outcomes.

Summary

Controlled trials are needed to identify affordable treatments for hyponatremia that reduce the need for hospitalization, decrease hospital length of stay, and decrease morbidity. Such trials could also help answer the question of whether hyponatremia causes excess mortality or whether it is simply a marker for severe, lethal, underlying disease.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^1114uqkz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis [^1173dQKV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium concentration [Na +] of less than 135 mmol/L, is the most frequently encountered metabolic disorder in clinical practice. It is especially common in elderly individuals, with reported incidences from 7% to 53% in ambulatory and institutionalized geriatric patients, respectively. Approximately 50% of chronic hyponatremia is due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Other causes include medications (e.g. diuretics), hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hepatic cirrhosis, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. Although chronic hyponatremia historically has been difficult to treat, the recent development of oral antagonists to the renal vasopressin V2 receptor offers the likelihood that both acute and chronic hyponatremia will be correctable in the near future. Thus this represents a opportune time to evaluate the adverse effects of chronic hyponatremia.

### Tolvaptan (Samsca) [^114CTyZS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Too Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Can Cause Serious Neurologic Sequelae

Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g., > 12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium < 130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium < 130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with SAMSCA therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients treated with SAMSCA should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving SAMSCA who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with SAMSCA and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with SAMSCA may increase the likelihood of overly rapid correction of serum sodium and should generally be avoided. Co-administration of diuretics also increases the risk of too rapid correction of serum sodium and such patients should undergo close monitoring of serum sodium.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116NqJCy]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Current international hyponatremia guidelines differ in their recommendations regarding the use of tolvaptan. US expert panel recommendations, while acknowledging insufficient evidence for tolvaptan use with serum sodium less than 120 mmol/L, endorse its use as a second-line treatment, with appropriate monitoring and prompt intervention if the recommended rate of serum sodium increase is exceeded, and even raise the possibility that it may be a potential first-line therapy option in the future. European guidelines, however, recommend against the use of tolvaptan in moderate-profound hyponatremia, primarily out of concern regarding the potential risk of excessively rapid serum sodium correction. Other potential concerns raised about tolvaptan include cost and risk of liver function derangement seen with sustained higher-dose tolvaptan therapy used for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (up to 120 mg daily). A US FDA safety notice was issued in 2013 limiting the use of tolvaptan in hyponatremia to less than 30 days' duration, and removing the indication for patients with cirrhosis. Safe long-term tolvaptan use for up to 4 years has been reported in 111 participants in the SALTWATER trial (the SALT trial extension study), though 1 patient with cirrhosis developed hepatorenal syndrome and died, which was considered "possibly related" to tolvaptan use. So far, there are no reported cases of liver dysfunction directly attributed to the lower doses and typically short durations of tolvaptan in SIAD.

We use tolvaptan as a second-line therapy in selected inpatients and occasional outpatients with SIAD, typically when refractory to FR. Safety information recommends initiation and reinitiation in the hospital to allow monitoring. Careful patient selection is important, plus close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output, readiness to administer IV dextrose if correction targets are exceeded, and daily reevaluation of each dose. Based on existing evidence and clinical experience, we have developed the following recommendations for tolvaptan use (Table 8), which form the basis of an inpatient RCT protocol that is currently underway (ACTRN12619001683123), aiming to provide a prospective evidence base to evaluate these recommendations. We use tolvaptan less frequently in outpatients because of the product information recommending against long-term use, high cost, and limited monitoring capacity — in this situation we prefer oral urea.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Disorders of salt and water balance after pituitary surgery [^114FHDD2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Management

SIAD after pituitary surgery should be managed similarly to that from other causes. Management options include fluid restriction, oral urea, oral tolvaptan, and administration of 3% hypertonic saline in severely symptomatic cases. Patients with acute hyponatremia of < 48 hours duration are often severely symptomatic if the plasma sodium falls to < 120 mmol/L and benefit from a prompt increase in plasma sodium to reduce cerebral edema. In comparison, those with hyponatremia of > 48 hours duration with minimal neurological symptoms require a slower correction, to avoid the risk of osmotic demyelination. A correction rate of no more than 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L during the first 48 hours is recommended in this cohort (75,76).

Fluid restriction is often first-line therapy for mild to moderate hyponatremia where the plasma sodium is 125 to 135 mmol/L. Although there are no randomized controlled trials proving the efficacy and safety of fluid restriction in the postpituitary surgery setting, clinical experience supports its continuing use. However, fluid restriction alone is often ineffective or slow at correcting hyponatremia (66,67,77,78). A recent randomized controlled trial in people with chronic SIAD demonstrated a median rise in plasma sodium by 3 mmol/L after 3 days of fluid restriction (1000 mL/day) compared with 1 mmol/L without any specific treatment. Thereafter, minimal increase in plasma sodium occurred, with the rise from baseline being 4 mmol/L vs 1 mmol/L after 30 days in the fluid restriction and no intervention groups, respectively. Similarly, another randomized controlled trial showed a rise in plasma sodium of 4.9 mmol/L after 4 days of fluid restriction (500–1000 mL/day), and by 5.7 mmol/L after 28 days. Data from a hyponatremia registry of over 3000 patients also showed only a very modest rise in plasma sodium of 2 mmol/L over the initial day of fluid restriction monotherapy. In a review of SIAD following pituitary surgery, monotherapy with fluid restriction achieved a mean rise in plasma sodium of 3.3 mmol/L over 72 hours and 32% of patients did not achieve any increase in plasma sodium. Predictors of failure of fluid restriction include urine osmolality > 500 mOsmol/kg, sum of the urine sodium and potassium exceeding plasma sodium, 24-hour urine volume < 1500 mL, and increase in plasma sodium < 2 mmol/L within the initial 24 to 48 hours of fluid restriction < 1000 mL/day. Fluid restriction should be at least 500 mL less than the estimated 24-hour urine output.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^114FMjeQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The Hyponatremia Registry has a number of limitations, most of which derive from its observational design. Although patients were subject to adjudication by experts, some uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the diagnosis "cancer-related SIADH". Furthermore, potentially hyponatremia-inducing drugs are highly prevalent and interfere with diagnostic precision. However, since the study's intent was to capture "real-world" practice, this limitation does not detract from observing how clinician-diagnosed SIADH in the oncology setting is managed. As in other hyponatremia trials, numerical changes of [Na +] were used as the primary measure of effectiveness; neither symptoms nor clinical outcome after therapy were reported routinely as it is extremely difficult to assign these unambiguously to hyponatremia, especially in the oncology setting.

In summary, despite the high prevalence of hyponatremia and published guidance on its diagnosis and treatment, numerous shortcomings in current management of hyponatremia in cancer-related SIADH are evident. Hyponatremia in a cancer patient is readily assumed by clinicians to be due to SIADH without sufficient attention to accepted diagnostic criteria. Moreover, many patients correctly diagnosed with SIADH do not receive any treatment for hyponatremia at all, and a considerable number of patients are discharged with unresolved hyponatremia. FR and NS are the two most frequently used therapies but are ineffective in about two thirds of cases. Of note, this lack of efficacy is more pronounced in cancer patients than in non-cancer-related SIADH. With the vaptans, a group of highly effective and yet safe compounds is available and the findings of this analysis strongly suggests that they should be viewed as first-line choice of treatment. However, they are only used in the minority of cases in current practice. We therefore conclude that there is a need to focus educational efforts on (1) how to diagnose SIADH correctly, (2) the lack of uniform efficacy of FR and NS, (3) the use of active treatments, and (4) increasing awareness of risk factors for overcorrection. Despite clear evidence that hyponatremia is associated with poor prognosis in particular in cancer patients, proof of causation is still lacking. Future research efforts should, therefore, focus on which cancer patients will benefit most from correction of hyponatremia.

### Therapy for SIAD: what does the future hold? [^112CE6tH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Tolvaptan, an oral selective arginine vasopressin antagonist, is the logical and highly attractive therapeutic option for SIAD on the basis of the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Tolvaptan, the sole therapy approved by regulatory authorities across all continents since 2008, is highly efficacious in increasing serum sodium concentration through significant aquaresis. Real-world data have confirmed the great efficacy of tolvaptan, but they have also reported overly rapid hyponatraemia correction in a substantial proportion of patients. The lower the baseline serum sodium, the higher the risk of over-rapid correction. For this reason, lower than approved initial tolvaptan doses, such as 7.5 mg, are frequently used in routine clinical care with the hope of lowering the risk of overcorrection, without having been evaluated in prospective studies. The fact that tolvaptan often acts as a cannon rather than a magic bullet in combination with its high cost has limited its use in selected cases.

With regard to urea, the main alternative pharmacotherapy for SIAD, it is an osmotic agent with evidence base of low quality which is mainly used in some European countries. The other barriers to its use include the lack of an approved preparation, its limited availability and its poor palatability. The utilisation of other pharmacotherapies, such as demeclocycline and combination of furosemide and sodium chloride, is also based on small case series and is limited due to concerns about their renal safety.

Empagliflozin, routinely used as an antidiabetic medication, has been the most recent addition to the list of drug candidates for SIAD. Empagliflozin, an SGLT-2 (sodium-glucose co-transport 2) inhibitor, increases urinary water excretion in SIAD through osmotic diuresis. The first RCT of empagliflozin 25 mg per day versus placebo, as adjunct to fluid restriction 1000 mL per day, showed a significantly higher serum sodium increase by 3 mmol/l over a 4-day period without any adverse events. A subsequent RCT of 4-week monotherapy with empagliflozin versus placebo showed promising results, with a corresponding median serum sodium increase of 4.1 mmol/l. The advantages of empagliflozin are its wide availability and broad clinical experience as well as its well-established safety profile with long-term cardiovascular and nephroprotective effects, but the effect on sodium rise, if any, seems to be modest.

### Rapidity of correction of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone following tolvaptan [^117CyYR1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Tolvaptan effectively corrects hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), but undesired overcorrection can occur. We hypothesized that pretherapy parameters can predict the rapidity of response to tolvaptan in SIADH.

Study Design

Multicenter historical cohort study.

Setting & Participants

Adults with SIADH or congestive heart failure (CHF) treated with tolvaptan for a serum sodium concentration ≤ 130 mEq/L at 5 US hospitals.

Predictors

Demographic and laboratory parameters.

Outcomes

Rate of change in serum sodium concentration.

Measurements

Spearman correlations, analysis of variance, and multivariable linear mixed-effects models.

Results

28 patients with SIADH and 39 patients with CHF treated with tolvaptan (mean baseline serum sodium, 120.6 and 122.4 mEq/L, respectively) were studied. Correction of serum sodium concentration > 12 mEq/L/d occurred in 25% of patients with SIADH compared to 3% of those with CHF (P < 0.001). Among patients with SIADH, the increase in serum sodium over 24 hours was correlated with baseline serum sodium concentration (r = -0.78; P < 0.001), serum urea nitrogen concentration (SUN; r = -0.76; P < 0.001), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.58; P = 0.01). Baseline serum sodium and SUN concentrations were identified as independent predictors of change in serum sodium concentration in multivariable analyses. When patients were grouped into 4 categories according to baseline serum sodium and SUN median values, those with both low baseline serum sodium (≤ 121 mEq/L) and low baseline SUN concentrations (≤ 10mg/dL) exhibited a significantly greater rate of increase in serum sodium concentration (mean 24-hour increase of 15.4 mEq/L) than the other 3 categories (P < 0.05). Among patients with CHF, only baseline SUN concentration was identified as an independent predictor of change in serum sodium concentration over time.

Limitations

Lack of uniformity in serial serum sodium concentration determinations and documentation of water intake.

Conclusions

Baseline serum sodium and SUN values are predictive of the rapidity of hyponatremia correction following tolvaptan use in SIADH. We advise caution when dosing tolvaptan in patients with both low serum sodium and SUN concentrations.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: core curriculum 2020 [^114RpkPA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to influence water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration. Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established. This Core Curriculum article discusses the normal regulation of tonicity and serum sodium concentration and the diagnosis and management of hypo- and hypernatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^115yzmgu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

Administration of desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone) either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction. The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours. On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal; because their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome is extremely low, the US/Irish expert panel deemed efforts to prevent or reverse excessive correction to be unnecessary. Similarly, in most patients presenting with a sodium > 120 mmol/L, relowering the serum sodium after correction by > 8 mmol/L or even > 12 mmol/L was not recommended. In patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, initial correction by 8–12 mmol/L is more than necessary, but unlikely to be harmful unless the 48-hours limit of 18 mmol/L is exceeded; the panel deemed relowering of the serum sodium to be optional after correction by > 10–12 mmol/L but recommended that further increases in serum sodium should be avoided for the next 24 hours. Other experts have adopted the stricter limit of 8 mmol/L in 24 hours for all patients.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in cancer patients [^11621W7x]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, a common electrolyte abnormality in oncology practice, may be a negative prognostic factor in cancer patients based on a systematic analysis of published studies. The largest body of evidence comes from small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), for which hyponatremia was identified as an independent risk factor for poor outcome in six of 13 studies. Hyponatremia in the cancer patient is usually caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which develops more frequently with SCLC than with other malignancies. SIADH may be driven by ectopic production of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by tumors or by effects of anticancer and palliative medications on AVP production or action. Other factors may cause hypovolemic hyponatremia, including diarrhea and vomiting caused by cancer therapy. Hyponatremia may be detected on routine laboratory testing before or during cancer treatment or may be suggested by the presence of mostly neurological symptoms. Treatment depends on several factors, including symptom severity, onset timing, and extracellular volume status. Appropriate diagnosis is important because treatment differs by etiology, and choosing the wrong approach can worsen the electrolyte abnormality. When hyponatremia is caused by SIADH, hypertonic saline is indicated for acute, symptomatic cases, whereas fluid restriction is recommended to achieve a slower rate of correction for chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia. Pharmacological therapy may be necessary when fluid restriction is insufficient. The orally active, selective AVP receptor 2 (V(2))-receptor antagonist tolvaptan provides a mechanism-based option for correcting hyponatremia caused by SIADH or other conditions with inappropriate AVP elevations. By blocking AVP effects in the renal collecting duct, tolvaptan promotes aquaresis, leading to a controlled increase in serum sodium levels.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1117skm3]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

For hypervolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, seven guidance documents recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment (Table 3). Three guidance documents advocated concomitant salt restriction, without clear dose recommendations, and one to avoid hypotonic infusion solution. Three additionally proposed loop diuretics and three others generally stated to treat the underlying disease, whereas one advised to consider stopping diuretics. One guideline additionally proposed demeclocycline and two proposed vasopressin receptor antagonists as a second-line treatment for refractory hyponatremia, whereas one guideline specifically recommended against both demeclocycline and vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Targets and limits of speed of correction

Table 4 shows the key recommendations. The key areas include targets and limits for increase in serum sodium concentration.

Seven guidance documents provided targets or aims for the increase in serum sodium concentration in case of symptomatic and/or acute hyponatremia. Seven guidance documents provided limits for the increase in serum sodium concentration that should not be surpassed. Five did so independent of symptoms. Limits usually varied between 8 to 12 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L during the first 48 hours, irrespective of whether hyponatremia was acute or chronic. Three guidance documents set a stricter limit of < 8 mmol/L during the first 24 hours in cases where the patient was believed to be high risk for developing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Four discussed what to do in case of overcorrection, i.e. to stop current treatment and to consider re-lowering serum sodium concentration by starting hypotonic infusion and administering 1 to 4 μg desmopressin every 6 to 8 hours.

### Criteria for hyponatremic overcorrection: systematic review and cohort study of emergently ill patients [^113evMLF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalized patients. An overly rapid rate of correction of chronic hyponatremia is believed to increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes including osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). There is disagreement in the literature regarding the definition of hyponatremic overcorrection.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all English language studies to identify those that calculated sodium correction rate and classified patients' overcorrection status. We then identified all patients who presented to our hospital's emergency department between 2003 and 2015 with a corrected serum sodium ≤ 116 mmol/L. All methods from the systematic review for sodium correction rate calculation and overcorrection status were applied to this cohort.

Results

We identified 24 studies citing 9 distinct sodium correction rate methods and 14 criteria for overcorrection. Six hundred twenty-four patients presenting with severe hyponatremia (median initial value 113 mMol) were identified. Depending on the method used, the median sodium correction rates in our cohort ranged from 0.271 to 1.13 mmol/L per hour. The proportion of patients classified with overcorrection with the different criteria varied almost 11-fold, ranging from 8.5 to 89.9%.

Conclusion

Published methods disagree regarding the calculation of sodium correction rates and the definition of hyponatremic overcorrection. This leads to wide variations in sodium correction rates and the prevalence of overcorrection in patient cohorts. Definitions based on ODS risk are needed.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Short-term efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonists for treatment of hyponatremia [^1114eEMA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

We performed a meta-analysis to systematically measure efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonists (VRAs) tested in randomized controlled trials for treatment of hyponatremia.

Methods

MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and scientific abstracts were searched without language restriction. Two authors independently screened citations and extracted data on patient characteristics, quality of reports, and efficacy and safety endpoints.

Results

Eleven trials were identified (1094 patients). By meta-analysis, VRAs achieved a net increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)](serum)) relative to placebo of 3.3 mEq/L at day 1 (95% confidence interval, 2.7–3.8), and 4.2 mEq/L at day 2 (95% CI, 3.6–4.8), persisting at days 3–5. Larger net increases in [Na(+)](serum) at days 1–4 were observed in euvolemic hyponatremia and with higher doses. VRAs induced a net increase in effective water clearance relative to placebo of 1244 mL at day 1 (95% CI, 920–1567), persisting at days 2 and 4. VRAs were associated with odds ratios of 3.0 for overly rapid correction of [Na(+)](serum) (P < .001), 7.8 for development of hypernatremia (P < .001), 3.3 for thirst development (P < .001), and 2.2 for postural hypotension (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Short-term use of VRAs in treating hyponatremia was successful at raising [Na(+)](serum). Additional experience is required to guide their optimal use and minimize safety concerns.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: treatment with tolvaptan [^111WR71R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia based on syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH) is observed in up to 15% of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The electrolyte imbalance is associated with a high morbidity and mortality and often delays appropriate treatment. Management of hyponatremia proved to be challenging until new vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists such as tolvaptan became available. This is the first report which presents a prospective case series with an efficient management of hyponatremia including tolvaptan in ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH (plasma sodium < 125 mmol/l).

Methods

Ten patients with SCLC and severe SIADH were followed after the onset of clinical symptoms of SIADH. Patients were chosen on the basis of histological proven diagnosis of SCLC and the clinical picture of a neurocognitive deficit caused by SIADH-related hyponatremia. All patient data were monitored for clinical improvement based on ECOG status, commencement of chemotherapy and correction of sodium levels.

Results

The treatment followed a diagnostic and treatment algorithm and lead to a rapid and efficient correction of both clinical symptoms and plasma sodium level.

Conclusions

Based on this algorithm all patients started chemotherapy in time. Subsequently, the treatment with tolvaptan lead to an improvement of the ECOG-performance status. In addition, all patients benefit from the effective management of SIADH which omitted prolonged hospital stays and non-elective hospitalizations due to an unstable clinical condition due to severe hyponatremia. These observations add new insight to management of SIADH in thoracic oncology and are of interest for specialists in oncology, endocrinology and pulmonary medicine.

### Sodium chloride and potassium chloride (potassium chloride in sodium chloride) [^1148ioRA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia

Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may cause hyponatremia. Hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury.

The risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia is increased in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH) treated with high volume of hypotonic Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia, and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as diuretics, certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications). See DRUG INTERACTIONS.

Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia such as hyponatremic encephalopathy, include pediatric patients, women (in particular, premenopausal women), patients with hypoxemia, and patients with underlying central nervous system disease. Avoid Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications. Brain adaptations reducing risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury when chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected, which is known as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

Fluid Overload

Depending on the volume and rate of infusion, and the patient's underlying clinical condition, the intravenous administration of Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause electrolyte disturbances such as overhydration/hypervolemia and congested states including central (e.g., pulmonary edema) and peripheral edema.

Avoid Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading. If use cannot be avoided, monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid base balance as needed and especially during prolonged use.

Figure 7.
Principles of management of acute vs chronic hyponatremia, and potential risks. Intensity of shading is a visual representation of osmolality. In acute hyponatremia, cerebral osmolar adaptation has not yet occurred so it is acceptable to allow (or induce) rapid correction of serum sodium, with low risk of ODS. We advocate a cutoff of hyponatremia duration less than 24 hours rather than 48 hours to maximize the safety of this approach. In hyponatremia with severe symptoms of any (or unknown) duration, emergency management with bolus hypertonic saline is indicated to prevent progression of potentially life-threatening cerebral edema (see "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). Once the target initial increment of serum sodium rise is achieved (eg, 4–6 mmol/L) and/or if symptoms improve, ongoing correction is determined by duration of hyponatremia. If duration is unknown, it is safest to assume it to be chronic and aim for gradual correction. In chronic hyponatremia, gradual correction of serum sodium allows for restoration of brain tissue osmolality toward the normal range with the import or synthesis of osmolytes (sodium, potassium, organic osmolytes as discussed in Fig. 3), and slow exit of excess intracellular water. The typical target rate of correction is 5 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours, or lower for those with risk factors for ODS. If rapid correction of serum sodium above the target rate occurs (overcorrection, eg, > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours), it is advised to relower serum sodium (eg, with IV dextrose 5%, and/or desmopressin (DDAVP), see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium" below) to prevent the rare complication of ODS. ODS can occur as a consequence of rapid exit of intracellular water damaging the myelin sheath, particularly in the pons, and can cause devastating neurological outcomes or death. Onset of symptoms of ODS is often delayed. Subsequent correction after relowering should be gradual.

### SIADH-related hyponatremia in hospital day care units: clinical experience and management with tolvaptan [^114zTYqv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (Na ˂135 mmol/l) is the most frequent electrolyte disorder in clinical practice, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is the commonest cause of hyponatremia in cancer patients. Correcting hyponatremia in these patients can reduce morbidity and mortality, increase the response to anti-cancer agents, and help reduce hospital length of stay and costs. Tolvaptan is an oral medication used to treat SIADH-related hyponatremia patients that needs to be initiated at hospital so patients can have their serum sodium monitored. If tolvaptan could be initiated in hospital day care units (DCUs), performing the same tests, hospitalization could be avoided, quality of life improved, and costs reduced. This is the first publication where a panel of oncologists are sharing their experience and making some recommendations with the use of tolvaptan to treat SIADH-related hyponatremia in DCU after collecting and examining 35 clinical cases with these type of patients. The conclusion from this retrospective observational analysis is that the use of tolvaptan in DCU is safe and effective in the therapeutic management of SIADH-related hyponatremia.

Management and recommendations for the use of tolvaptan to treat SIADH in hospital DCU

Clinical experience based on clinical cases with the use of tolvaptan in hospital DCU

Active treatment of SIADH-related hyponatremia must be started as soon as possible to avoid delays in the patients' oncologic treatment, and also because in a significant number of cases, the hyponatremia origin is paraneoplastic and the tumor treatment itself becomes a key factor for the correction of the natremia.

While in severe, very symptomatic situations, hypertonic saline solution is considered the standard of care in those cases of moderate hyponatremia, where a controlled increase of the natremia is desired, the first line treatment would be hydric restriction or tolpalvan administration. In particular, hydric restriction may not be possible in the oncologic population because these patients require high hydration for their intravenous treatment administration. Moreover, the natremia correction rate is often inadequate and has a low treatment adherence. Tolvaptan meets the requirements of rapidity, efficacy, safety, and adherence, so it can be considered a good treatment choice, especially in those patients in whom the treatment of the malignancy that is causing the SIADH requires an immediate start of chemotherapy that cannot be administered without adequate hydration volumes or in malnourished patients, for whom liquid restriction would worsen their nutritional state.

Tolvaptan is usually initiated in hospital due to the need for a dose titration phase with close monitoring of serum sodium and volume status 4–6 h after its administration. However, since this type of control can be done at DCU, these units could help avoid hospitalization in some selected cancer patients with hyponatremia, with all the advantages described previously.

To evaluate this retrospectively, a series of 35 clinical cases were collected from cancer patients receiving treatment with tolvaptan in 3 hospital DCU in Spain [Hospital Provincial de Castellón, Castellón (from September 2011 to May 2014); Hospital Doce de Octubre, Madrid (from March 2013 to September 2014); and Hospital Virgen de la Macarena, Sevilla (from August 2011 to December 2014)] (Table 3).

### Desmopressin to prevent rapid sodium correction in severe hyponatremia: a systematic review [^117SmC1L]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is common among inpatients and is associated with severe adverse outcomes such as osmotic demyelination syndrome. Current guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia. However, recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review current strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia.

Methods

Systematic literature search of 4 databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed and study quality was appraised.

Results

The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found 3 strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia: 1) proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration; 2) reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output; 3) rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent. A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series.

Conclusions

Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions about the optimal strategy for desmopressin administration to correct hyponatremia. There is a pressing need for better quality research to guide clinicians in managing severe hyponatremia.

5.11 Hyponatremia and/or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH)

Postmarketing cases of hyponatremia and/or Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) have been observed in patients treated with linezolid. In reported cases, the signs and symptoms included confusion, somnolence, generalized weakness, and in severe cases led to respiratory failure and even death. Monitor serum sodium levels regularly in the elderly, in patients taking diuretics, and in other patients at risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH while taking Linezolid. If signs and symptoms of hyponatremia and/or SIADH occur, discontinue Linezolid, and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.13 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing linezolid in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115ACxpd]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines received the highest scores for scope and purpose (median 62%; range 28% to 92%) and clarity of presentation (median 47%; range 27% to 75%), and lowest scores for applicability (median 19%; range 10% to 68%) and editorial independence (median 19%; range 2% to 79%).

Initial appraisal results differed more than one point on the Likert scale between two or more reviewers for 143/230 items (62%). The majority of discrepancies were found in the domain 'Clarity of Presentation', with 90% of items differing more than one point. Group discussion resulted in 287/920 (31%) of individual entries being changed. Finally, no scores differed more than two points and for 82% of items, scores were the same or within one point of each other. Major reasons for changing an entry were a change of own opinion after clarification of the opinion of other reviewers during the group discussion (180/920 entries; 20% entries); aiming for consistency between entries given same available data (39/920; 4%); re-evaluation of the score in light of a noted comment during the appraisal process (30/920; 3%); correction for available data that were overlooked during the initial appraisal (22/920; 2%); misinterpretation of the question during the initial appraisal (6/920; 0.7%); adjusting for arbitrary scoring of items that were felt to be inapplicable for some reason (3/920; 0.3%); adjusting for inconsistent approach to deal with the assumption that a criterion was fulfilled even if this was not clearly mentioned (4/920; 0.4%); and data entry error (3/920, 0.3%). Overall, this resulted in 29/60 (48%) of standardized domain scores being downgraded by a maximum of 10% and 10/60 (17%) of standardized domain scores being upgraded with a maximum of 10%; the remaining 35% remained unchanged.

Synthesis of recommendations

The included guidance documents addressed three major themes: diagnosis, treatment, and speed of correction.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^113SHKnQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

5.3 Hyponatremia

Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is a hypertonic solution [see Description, Table 1 (11)]. In the body, however, glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization. Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.

Depending on the tonicity of the solution, the volume and rate of infusion, and depending on a patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose, intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances, most importantly hypo- or hyperosmotic hyponatremia.

The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia, such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients; women, in particular, premenopausal women; patients with hypoxemia; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)].

Avoid Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.

Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema. To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications.

High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia.

5.4 Hypokalemia

Excessive administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection may result in significant hypokalemia. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, metabolic alkalosis, increased gastrointestinal losses (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting), prolonged low potassium diet, or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia. Avoid the administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk of hypokalemia or taking medications that may increase the risk. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium levels.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^11653Q73]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

As FR was the most frequently prescribed initial therapy, we separately analyzed the course of patients after FR. A total of 922 patients (30%) with a baseline [Na +] < 130 mEq/l were treated with FR initially (Figure 5). The majority did not correct [Na +] by an increment ⩾5 mEq/l and the majority of those patients received no additional treatment.

Overly rapid correction of [Na +] occurred in 7.9% of patients overall (Table 5) and was most likely in patients with SIADH (10.7%) and least likely with cirrhosis (3.6% P < 0.001, SIADH vs. cirrhosis). Of patients who received no active therapy, 1.4% experienced overly rapid correction. Compared with no therapy, the relative risk (95% confidence interval) for overly rapid correction was 1.6 (0.70–3.57for FR, 2.35 (0.97–5.65) for NS, 12.01 (5.14–28.04) for HS, and 8.57 (3.84–19.12) for tolvaptan. Overall, 17.1% of patients receiving HS and 10.8% of patients receiving tolvaptan monotherapy at any time (P = 0.08, HS vs. tolvaptan) experienced overly rapid correction, similar to the results for initial treatment responses (Table 3). Included among the overly rapid correction episodes that occurred with active therapy are one episode with HS and two with tolvaptan in patients who were also receiving variable doses of desmopressin to treat diabetes insipidus post parasellar surgery. A further six episodes with tolvaptan occurred after suprasellar or pituitary procedures alone. In total, six of these postoperative cases occurred at a single center. The group with the lowest starting [Na +] was at greatest risk for overly rapid correction: 3.6% for mild HN (referent), 5.0% (relative risk 1.39 (95% confidence interval 0.94–2.06)) for moderate HN, and 19% (5.34 (3.86–7.40)) for severe HN. No cases of the osmotic demyelination syndrome were documented in the HN Registry.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^1162d4wn]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

There is at least one reported case of atypical ODS occurring following correction of acute hyponatremia. A study in rats showed that that while rapid correction of acute hyponatremia is usually well tolerated, some risk of ODS may remain. In this experiment, acute profound hyponatremia (mean pNa 106 mmol/L) was A, induced rapidly and then reversed after 5 hours; B, induced over 10 hours, then corrected after 24 hours; or C, induced gradually over 48 hours then reversed after 72 hours (ie, chronic hyponatremia). Correction was achieved through either rapid or slow infusion of hypertonic saline. All rats in group A with rapid onset and reversal of hyponatremia survived with good neurological outcomes. Those in group B all survived, but 2 of 12 (17%) of those rapidly corrected after 24 hours had adverse neurological outcomes, compared to 100% good neurological outcomes with slow correction in this group. As expected, the worst outcomes were in the model of chronic hyponatremia (group C) following by rapid correction, which led to neurological deterioration in 10 of 12 rats, 7 of which died. This study did not observe harm related to slow correction for any duration of hyponatremia.

Although the conventional cutoff for "acute" hyponatremia onset is considered 48 hours, clinically we favor a more conservative less-than-24 hours definition, provided this is confirmed with pathology results, before permitting rapid correction, to minimize ODS risk.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^112r3aSR]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hyponatremia, defined as a plasma sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is one of the most common electrolyte disorders in hospitalized patients. While acute hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema with severe symptoms and requires prompt treatment with hypertonic saline, chronic hyponatremia does not pose an immediate risk. However, it can also have several adverse effects, including neurocognitive impairment, gait instability and falls, and osteoporosis and fractures, some of which are reversible upon treatment. This provides a rationale for the treatment of chronic hyponatremia, although overcorrection should be avoided to prevent the development of the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

The most common cause of chronic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). In SIAD, the non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) impairs free water excretion and treatment therefore relies on fluid restriction or stimulation of free water excretion. Although fluid restriction is an effective first-line treatment for hyponatremia secondary to SIAD, patients with severe antidiuresis often require additional treatment to increase free water excretion. Second-line treatments for SIAD include vasopressin receptor antagonists, loop diuretics, sodium chloride tablets, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and oral urea. Of these options, oral urea is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for SIAD because it produces a gradual correction of hyponatremia. Urea is a crystalline powder that is administered at a dose of 15–60 g per day and increases free water excretion by inducing osmotic diuresis. In a patient with SIAD who has a "fixed" urine osmolality of 500 mOsm/kg, solute intake of 700 mOsm/day and water intake of 2 L/day, adding 30 g urea (molecular weight 60 g/mol) will increase solute intake by 500 mOsm and will result in a negative water balance [urine volume = number of osmoles/urine osmolality, (700 + 500)/500 = 2.4 L].

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but current management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the current state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings, specifically which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

Results

The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for all active therapies than no active treatment. Hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produced the greatest mean rate of [Na(+)] change (interquartile range, both 3.0 [6.0] mEq/L/d) compared with lower interquartile range rates of [Na(+)] change for isotonic saline (1.5 [3.0] mEq/L/d) and fluid restriction (1.0 [2.3] mEq/L/d). The general pattern of responses was similar in both the US and EU cohorts. At discharge, [Na(+)] was < 135 mEq/L in 75% of patients and ≤ 130 mEq/L in 43% of patients. Overly rapid correction occurred in 10.2% of patients.

Conclusions

Current treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion often uses therapies with limited efficacy; the most commonly chosen monotherapy treatments, fluid restriction and isotonic saline, failed to increase the serum [Na(+)] by ≥ 5 mEq/L in 55% and 64% of monotherapy treatment episodes, respectively. Appropriate laboratory tests to diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were obtained in < 50% of patients; success rates in correcting hyponatremia were significantly higher when such tests were obtained. Few outcome differences were found between the United States and the European Union. A notable exception was hospital length of stay; use of tolvaptan was associated with significantly shorter length of stay in the European Union but not in the United States. Despite the availability of effective therapies, most patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: treatment with tolvaptan [^112zFnMM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

However, no prospective studies for the treatment of hyponatremia in SCLC patients have been reported on a larger scale, due to the lack of a standardized hyponatremia therapy. Recently, the vasopressin-2-receptor antagonist tolvaptan has been approved for the treatment of severe SIADH-associated hyponatremia. An efficient correction of hyponatremia by tolvaptan has been found in a subgroup of SIADH patients out of mixed etiologies. New data has shown that intervention with tolvaptan may be effective for correction and stabilisation of acute onset hyponatremia in SIADH patients.

Up to now, only few data exist for SCLC patients with SIADH and sodium levels below 125 mmol/l and no data showing a long term follow-up of treatment with tolvaptan. This analysis shows a prospective case series for hyponatremia management with tolvaptan in ten SCLC patients with severe SIADH.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^115KMrVW]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Postapproval observational studies of tolvaptan have reported efficacy in hospitalized patients with lower serum sodium concentrations than the SALT trials but have identified potential risks. While the SALT trials reported excessively rapid correction of hyponatremia (defined as an increase in sodium > 12 mmol in 24 hours) in 1.7% of overall tolvaptan-treated patients (5.6% in the SIAD subgroup), observational studies of tolvaptan in moderate to profound hyponatremia have reported highly variable rates of biochemical overcorrection (variably defined, usually ≥ 12 mmol/L over 24 hours) in patients with initial pNa less than 125 mmol/L, ranging from 0% to 30% of cases (Table 7). The largest data sets are an international hyponatremia registry that included 225 patients with SIAD treated with tolvaptan, which observed overcorrection (pNa > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours) in 12.1% of cases, and an international pharmacovigilance study of 252 tolvaptan-treated patients that observed overcorrection in 24.6% of cases. One reason for the higher rates of overcorrection in clinical practice compared to the SALT trials may be that in clinical practice tolvaptan is used second-line, which selects for patients with more severe SIAD. Some of these studies describe use that differs from standard practice, including combining tolvaptan with FR, or the concurrent use of additional therapies. Higher rates still of overcorrection are reported in observational studies in which tolvaptan has been used in less highly selected patient groups, including those likely to contain participants with acute hyponatremia, post pituitary surgery, or in emergency department populations, which are likely to contain individuals with readily reversible SIAD.

### Hyponatremia in neurotrauma: the role of vasopressin [^1145uhZg]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequent in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or following intracranial procedures, with approximately 20% having a decreased serum sodium concentration to < 125mmol/L. The pathophysiology of hyponatremia in neurotrauma is not completely understood, but in large part is explained by the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The abnormal water and/or sodium handling creates an osmotic gradient promoting the shift of water into brain cells, thereby worsening cerebral edema and precipitating neurological deterioration. Unless hyponatremia is corrected promptly and effectively, morbidity and mortality increases through seizures, elevations in intracranial pressure, and/or herniation. The excess mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia (< 125mmol/L) extends beyond the time frame of hospital admission, with a reported mortality of 20% in hospital and 45% within 6 months of follow-up. Current options for the management of hyponatremia include fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, mineralocorticoids, and osmotic diuretics. However, the recent development of vasopressin receptor antagonists provides a more physiological tool for the management of excess water retention and consequent hyponatremia, such as occurs in SIADH. This review summarizes the existing literature on the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of hyponatremia in the setting of neurotrauma.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^115eEJTN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

An alternative approach that has been proposed is "proactive DDAVP", that is, early empirical coadministration both of desmopressin (DDAVP) and hypertonic saline. The rationale is that overcorrection is frequently the result of a spontaneous water diuresis following resolution of transient SIAD, interruption of polydipsia, or cessation of a causative medication. This spontaneous water clearance can be prevented with preemptive desmopressin. The advantage of this approach would be that the rate of correction can be more precisely controlled with hypertonic saline alone (bolus or infusion), without variable outputs to contend with. However, by potentiating SIAD through the administration of an AVP analogue before overcorrection occurs or appears imminent, this approach risks exacerbation or prolonging of hyponatremia symptoms — especially in the presence of ongoing fluid input. In patients with a chronic cause of SIAD (eg, paraneoplastic SIAD), desmopressin is unlikely to have any effect as the underlying cause of antidiuresis is likely to continue. The only data for this proactive approach stem from an uncontrolled observational study in 24 patients with pNa less than 120 mmol/L, predominantly secondary to thiazide diuretics, treated with desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours and weight-based hypertonic saline titrated to achieve a pNa increase of 6 mmol/L in 24 hours. Overall, participants had a mean increase in serum sodium 5.8 mmol/L over 24 hours, 2 patients experienced a decline in serum sodium by 1 to 2 mmol/L after 4 hours, and 2 patients had an above-target increase in serum sodium greater than 10 mmol/L at 24 hours, but no adverse effects were reported. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support this strategy, and instead we endorse a "reactive" or "rescue" approach to desmopressin therapy, in keeping with current guidelines.

### Hyponatremia in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone… [^114NasC8]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, rapid elevation of serum sodium concentration may be imperative to correct neurological symptoms. Seven patients with hyponatremia secondary to SIADH were treated by oral intake of two to three doses of 30 g of urea over 24 hours or infusion of 80 g of urea as a 30% solution over six hours, water restriction, and sodium supplements. Serum sodium concentration increased from 117 ± 2 to 126 ± 1. 4 mmole/L after eight hours, to 130 ± 1. 3 mmole/L after 12 hours, and to
134. 5 ± 1. 2 mmole/L after 24 hours. The normalization of serum sodium was secondary to osmotic diuresis and to sodium retention induced by urea. Use of urea should be considered when symptomatic hyponatremia in SIADH must be quickly corrected. Decaux G, Unger J, Brimioulle S, Mockel J.

### Urea therapy for inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion from tuberculous meningitis… [^114mH5HL]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE SYNDROME of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone can occur in various CNS disorders. 1 Generally, the syndrome disappears when the underlying cause is treated, but treatment can be long or sometimes fails. Symptomatic treatment is necessary for rapid correction of hyponatremia when neurological manifestations are present. The treatment usually recommended is hypertonic saline with or without furosemide. 2 For long-term management of SIADH, water restriction or demeclocycline is used. 3 As urea is known to decrease brain edema4 and to induce osmotic diuresis, 5 a patient with SIADH secondary to tuberculous meningitis was treated with this drug. Administration of urea rapidly corrected the neurological symptoms and hyponatremia and also proved useful for the long-term management of SIADH despite large fluid intake. Report of a Case A 52-year-old man was admitted because of headache. Meningeal signs were present.
