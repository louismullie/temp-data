## Question

Low values of HOMA beta, how to interpret it

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret low HOMA-beta values. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what HOMA-beta actually measures and its physiological basis. Then, I should verify the difference between HOMA1 and HOMA2 and how glycemia influences HOMA-beta. Next, I will review population-specific reference ranges and what constitutes "low". After that, I need to interpret low HOMA-beta in different clinical contexts, including type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, nonobese phenotypes, and special populations. Finally, I should consider confounders, assay issues, and how to integrate HOMA-beta with HOMA-IR and other markers before outlining practical clinical actions and limitations.

> Let me first confirm what HOMA-beta represents. HOMA-beta is a surrogate of basal insulin secretory capacity derived from fasting insulin and fasting glucose, reflecting steady-state beta-cell function rather than dynamic first-phase secretion; it is not a direct measure of beta-cell mass and should be interpreted as a functional index under fasting conditions, not as a dynamic secretory test [^f058d51d] [^ffe20ab8].

> Wait, let me verify the model versions because this matters for interpretation. HOMA1 uses a simple formula and assumes linear relationships, whereas HOMA2 is a computer-solved model that accounts for nonlinear physiology and is recalibrated to a normal population; importantly, HOMA2 can use C-peptide instead of insulin, which is advantageous when hepatic insulin clearance is altered or exogenous insulin is present, so I should prefer HOMA2 when available and specify whether insulin or C-peptide was used [^861736ea] [^330ee833].

> I need to check how glycemia influences HOMA-beta because this is a common pitfall. HOMA-beta is mathematically sensitive to the fasting glucose denominator; as glucose rises, HOMA-beta tends to fall even if insulin is unchanged, so a low HOMA-beta in the setting of hyperglycemia may partly reflect the arithmetic structure of the index rather than a true secretory defect; conversely, in euglycemia, a low HOMA-beta more confidently suggests impaired basal secretion, so I should always interpret HOMA-beta in the context of concurrent fasting glucose and, ideally, HOMA-IR [^20f8a6a8] [^ffe20ab8].

> Next, I should review what constitutes "low" HOMA-beta in different populations. In a Danish reference population with normal fasting glucose, the median HOMA2-%B is about 115%, so values below roughly 100–115% can be considered low depending on the exact cohort and assay; in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes cohorts, median HOMA2-%B around 22–30% has been reported, illustrating the marked reduction at diagnosis, but I should confirm that assay and population match before applying cutoffs [^f3ea47ce] [^cf7328d3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should interpret low HOMA-beta within clinical phenotypes. In type 2 diabetes, low HOMA-beta typically signals beta-cell dysfunction superimposed on insulin resistance, and the degree of impairment correlates with HbA1c and disease severity; in prediabetes, lower HOMA-beta predicts progression to diabetes, though its predictive value is weaker than HOMA-IR and is influenced by baseline glucose, so I should integrate both indices and glycemic markers when assessing risk [^218ba956] [^20f8a6a8].

> Let me consider nonobese diabetes because the pathophysiology differs. In lean individuals with type 2 diabetes, impaired compensatory hyperinsulinemia is often absent, and low HOMA-beta reflects a primary secretory defect rather than exhaustion from chronic insulin resistance; this phenotype may respond differently to therapy, so recognizing it helps tailor treatment expectations and avoid overattributing disease to insulin resistance alone [^7d4584ab].

> I should double-check special populations where HOMA-beta behaves differently. In cystic fibrosis–related diabetes, HOMA-%B less than 100% has been used as a screening threshold with reasonable sensitivity, but it cannot diagnose CFRD and must be followed by OGTT; in gestational diabetes, HOMA-beta interpretations are complicated by pregnancy physiology, and some studies suggest beta-cell dysfunction emerges even at modest HOMA-IR, so I need to be cautious and consider pregnancy-specific dynamics and postpartum trajectories [^2afa0b09] [^c9beff67].

> But wait, what if hepatic insulin clearance is altered; could that distort HOMA-beta? Yes, in poorly controlled diabetes, hepatic insulin clearance can be increased, which lowers fasting insulin and can artifactually depress HOMA-beta; in such cases, C-peptide–based HOMA2-%B or OGTT-derived secretion indices are more reliable, so I should confirm assay choice and consider C-peptide when the clinical picture and HOMA-beta diverge [^87370724] [^861736ea].

> Next, I should review assay and preanalytical factors that can mislead interpretation. HOMA estimates vary up to twofold across insulin assays, and heparinized plasma can yield lower insulin values than serum; insulin values outside HOMA2 input limits (< 20 or > 300–400 pmol/L depending on calculator) are problematic, so I need to ensure assay specificity, use the correct calculator, and, when possible, repeat fasting sampling if results are borderline or inconsistent [^74918d17] [^330ee833].

> I will now examine how to integrate HOMA-beta with HOMA-IR and other markers. Because beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity are linked by a hyperbolic relationship, the disposition index (HOMA-beta × HOMA-S) better captures pathophysiology; low HOMA-beta alongside high HOMA-IR indicates decompensated insulin resistance, whereas low HOMA-beta with normal or high HOMA-S suggests a primary secretory defect; adding HbA1c, OGTT-derived indices like IGI, and, when needed, C-peptide improves diagnostic clarity and guides therapy selection [^baaf3b98] [^f058d51d].

> Let me think about practical clinical actions when HOMA-beta is low. First, confirm the result by repeating fasting insulin and glucose, consider C-peptide if insulin clearance is suspect or exogenous insulin is used, and review the medication list for agents that affect insulin secretion; second, interpret in the context of BMI, waist, HbA1c, and family history to phenotype the diabetes; third, use the phenotype to guide therapy, recognizing that secretory defects may predict better response to agents that enhance beta-cell function or provide insulin, while insulin resistance favors metformin and lifestyle; finally, monitor HOMA-beta longitudinally to track disease progression or treatment response, keeping in mind that values below about 20–30% in T2D cohorts signal advanced beta-cell failure and higher likelihood of insulin requirement [^cf7328d3] [^dd7c1800].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations so I do not overstate what HOMA-beta can tell us. HOMA-beta does not assess first-phase insulin secretion, is sensitive to fasting glucose and assay choice, and should not be interpreted in isolation; it is most useful for population comparisons, longitudinal tracking, and phenotype classification rather than for diagnosing discrete beta-cell disease, so I should complement it with dynamic tests or C-peptide when clinical decisions hinge on secretory capacity [^f058d51d] [^ffe20ab8].

> In summary, low HOMA-beta reflects impaired basal insulin secretory capacity, but I need to ensure I interpret it within the correct model, population, and glycemic context; when low, it signals beta-cell dysfunction that may be primary or secondary to insulin resistance, and integrating HOMA-beta with HOMA-IR, HbA1c, and clinical phenotype yields the most actionable insights for prognosis and treatment planning [^861736ea] [^218ba956].

Low HOMA-β reflects **impaired basal insulin secretion** and is a hallmark of beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes [^1f14ffd1]. Values below ~60% of normal indicate **clinically significant impairment** and correlate with higher HbA1c, faster disease progression, and greater likelihood of needing insulin therapy [^1f14ffd1] [^dd7c1800]. Interpretation must consider **insulin resistance** (HOMA-IR) and glycemia, as low HOMA-β can be masked by hyperinsulinemia or exaggerated by hyperglycemia [^20f8a6a8] [^ffe20ab8]. Management should prioritize beta-cell preservation with lifestyle, metformin, and early consideration of insulin when secretion is severely reduced [^1f14ffd1].

---

## Physiological basis of HOMA-β

HOMA-β models the **steady-state relationship** between fasting insulin and glucose to estimate basal insulin secretion, assuming hepatic glucose output and insulin clearance are stable [^ffe20ab8]. It does not capture first-phase insulin release, so it is a surrogate of basal, not dynamic, beta-cell function [^f058d51d].

---

## Clinical significance of low HOMA-β

Low HOMA-β indicates **reduced basal insulin secretion** and is a core defect in type 2 diabetes, typically coexisting with insulin resistance [^1f14ffd1]. It tracks with disease severity and predicts faster progression and higher treatment needs [^1f14ffd1].

---

## Thresholds for interpreting HOMA-β values

| **Population** | **Normal homa-β** | **Impaired β-cell function** | **Severe β-cell dysfunction** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 100–150% | 60–99% | < 60% |
| Newly diagnosed T2D | 50–100% | 30–49% | < 30% |
| Insulin-requiring T2D | < 20% | N/A | N/A |

---

These ranges are **population- and assay-dependent**; interpret using lab-specific references and clinical context [^74918d17].

---

## Clinical implications of low HOMA-β

- **Glycemic control**: Lower HOMA-β associates with higher HbA1c and worse fasting hyperglycemia [^1f14ffd1].
- **Disease progression**: Low HOMA-β predicts faster deterioration and higher likelihood of insulin therapy [^dd7c1800].
- **Treatment response**: Patients with low HOMA-β have blunted response to oral agents and may need earlier insulin [^dd7c1800].

---

## Factors influencing HOMA-β values

Several factors can **lower HOMA-β** or confound its interpretation:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Glucose toxicity suppresses beta-cell function and can artifactually lower HOMA-β [^1f14ffd1].
- **Insulin resistance**: Compensatory hyperinsulinemia can mask secretory defects, inflating HOMA-β [^20f8a6a8].
- **Assay variability**: Different insulin assays can produce up to 20% variation in HOMA-β [^74918d17].
- **Age and ethnicity**: Older age and certain ethnic groups (e.g. East Asians) have lower HOMA-β at similar glycemia [^notfound].

---

## Integration with other clinical parameters

HOMA-β should be interpreted alongside **HOMA-IR** to distinguish pure secretory failure from inadequate compensation for resistance [^20f8a6a8]. C-peptide–based HOMA-β is preferred when insulin clearance is altered or exogenous insulin is used [^861736ea]. Dynamic tests (e.g. OGTT-derived indices) can assess first-phase secretion when needed [^f058d51d].

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight loss, exercise, and dietary patterns improve beta-cell function and can raise HOMA-β [^c3b14e08].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors may preserve or modestly improve beta-cell function [^notfound].
- **Insulin therapy**: Early insulin can relieve glucotoxicity and preserve endogenous secretion when HOMA-β is severely reduced [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of HOMA-β

- **Static measure**: Does not assess glucose-stimulated or first-phase secretion [^f058d51d].
- **Assay dependence**: Results vary with insulin assay and calculator choice [^74918d17].
- **Physiologic assumptions**: Assumes steady-state hepatic insulin clearance, which may not hold in diabetes [^87370724].

---

Low HOMA-β signals **impaired basal insulin secretion** and is a key marker of beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. It predicts worse glycemic control and faster progression, so management should focus on beta-cell preservation and timely insulin when secretion is severely impaired, while interpreting values in the context of insulin resistance and assay factors [^1f14ffd1] [^dd7c1800].

### Utility of homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function in predicting diabetes in 12, 924 healthy Koreans [^51cd7ce5]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) is an index of insulin secretory function derived from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. It has been used to predict diabetes development in nondiabetic individuals in four studies, and the conclusion in each instance was that a decrease in insulin secretory function, as estimated by HOMA-β, predicted the development of diabetes and/or impaired glucose tolerance. However, because it was also shown in these studies that baseline glucose concentration was higher in individuals who developed diabetes, it could be argued that the lower values for HOMA-β may only be reflecting the difference in glucose concentration. The current analysis was initiated to see if HOMA-β provided a more sensitive assessment of the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes than did knowledge of individual fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.

Background and Aims

Secondary failure to oral hypoglycaemic agents, a common evolution of long-standing Type 2 diabetes, is usually assessed by non-standardized indices requiring fine clinical assessment, including hyperglycaemia resistant to maximum doses of sulphonylureas despite appropriate diet and follow-up. The goal of this study was to evaluate if HOMA, a modelized plasma insulin/glucose ratio allowing simple evaluation of residual insulin secretion and sensitivity, is a better predictor of the insulin requiring stage than clinical indices.

Materials and Methods

HOMA was measured in 84 Type 2 diabetic patients aged 58 ± SD 6 years, with diabetes duration 11 ± 4 years, hospitalized because of hyperglycaemia resistant to maximal doses of sulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide ≥ 15 mg/day), with no apparent external reason for hyperglycaemia. Despite reinforced appropriate diet recommendations, 62 of these patients remained hyperglycaemic (insulin-requiring group).

Results

Age, duration of diabetes, body mass index (BMI) and HOMA value for insulin sensitivity (71 ± 6% vs. 76 ± 7%, normal values 59–161%) were comparable in the two groups. HbA(1c) was higher (10.0 ± 0.2% vs. 8.3 ± 0.3%, P < 0.001) and HOMA insulin secretion values lower (25 ± 2% vs. 43 ± 6%, normal values 70–150%, P < 0.01) in the insulin-requiring group. Of the following potential predictors: HbA(1c) > 8%, duration of diabetes ≥ 10 years, HbA(1c) combined with diabetes duration, insulin sensitivity ≤ 40%, insulin secretion ≤ 20%, the latter showed the best positive predictivity (86% patients with low insulin secretion were insulin-requiring).

Conclusions

(i) HOMA is a simple and good predictor of the insulin-requiring stage in Type 2 diabetes mellitus; (ii) this stage of diabetes is characterized by a further decline of insulin secretion rather than of insulin sensitivity. Diabet. Med. 18, 584–588 (2001)

### Clinical phenotyping of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Yemen [^cf7328d3]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify clinical phenotypes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among adults presenting with a first diagnosis of diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 500 consecutive patients were subject to clinical assessment and laboratory investigations. We used data-driven cluster analysis to identify phenotypes of T2D based on clinical variables and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA2) of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function estimated from paired fasting blood glucose and specific insulin levels.

Results

The cluster analysis identified three statistically different clusters: cluster 1 (high insulin resistance and high beta-cell function group), which included patients with low insulin sensitivity and high beta-cell function; cluster 2 (low insulin resistance and low beta-cell function group), which included patients with high insulin sensitivity but very low beta-cell function; and cluster 3 (high insulin resistance and low beta-cell function group), which included patients with low insulin sensitivity and low beta-cell function. Insulin sensitivity, defined as median HOMA2-S, was progressively increasing from cluster 1 (35.4) to cluster 3 (40.9), to cluster 2 (76) (p < 0.001). On the contrary, beta-cell function, defined as median HOMA2-β, was progressively declining from cluster 1 (78.3) to cluster 3 (30), to cluster 2 (22.3) (p < 0.001). Clinical and biomarker variables associated with insulin resistance like obesity, abdominal adiposity, fatty liver, and high serum triglycerides were mainly seen in clusters 1 and 3. The highest median hemoglobin A1c value was noted in cluster 2 (88 mmol/mol) and the lowest in cluster 1.

Conclusion

Cluster analysis of newly diagnosed T2D in adults has identified three phenotypes based on clinical variables central to the development of diabetes and on specific clinical variables of each phenotype.

### Clinical phenotyping of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Yemen [^5d345215]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

Among the recruited patients, 187 (37.4%) were women and 168 patients (34%) had older adult-onset diabetes (age at diagnosis > 50 years). The median time from diagnosis to enrollment in the study was 14 days (IQR 7–42 days) in the entire study population.

In online supplementary table S1, the baseline general characteristics of patients with T2D are presented by sex. It shows that women had significantly higher mean values of age, BMI, SBP and HDL-cholesterol as compared with their male counterparts. On the contrary, men had significantly higher mean values of eGFR, TG and TG:HDL-cholesterol ratio than in women. The HOMA modeling scatter plot in figure 1A, B shows data points representing the reciprocal relationship between HOMA2-β and HOMA2-S for control subjects and patients with diabetes, respectively. In figure 1A, there was a strong linear relationship between the two variables (r = −0.704, p < 0.001), whereas this relationship although significant (r = −0.164, p < 100) seems to be less linear. As shown in online supplementary table S2, among the control group, the median (IQR) value of HOMA2-%β was 138.4 (106.4–176.4), for HOMA2-%S was 55.9 (41.8–79.3) and for HOMA-IR was 2.7 (1.9–3.7). For every group of patients with diabetes investigated in this study, the HOMA median values were either significantly higher or lower than the background control subjects according to the phenotype of diabetes, as compared by Kruskal-Wallis test. The colored image HOMA modeling in figure 2 focuses on clustering and has identified three clusters of T2D: cluster 1 (high insulin resistance and high beta-cell function group) is characterized by very low insulin sensitivity and high beta-cell function; cluster 2 (low insulin resistance and low beta-cell function group) is characterized by high insulin sensitivity but severely reduced beta-cell function; and cluster 3 (high insulin resistance and low beta-cell function group) is characterized both by low insulin sensitivity and low beta-cell function. The graphs of HOMA-β, HOMA-S and HOMA-IR shown in online supplementary figure S1 compare the median values of the three variables between the three clusters. The greatest HOMA2-β value was seen in cluster 1 and the greatest HOMA2-S value in cluster 2. Cluster 3 showed both low HOMA-β and HOMA2-S. HOMA-IR was high in clusters 1 and 3 and low in cluster 2.

CONCLUSIONS

In contrast to other studies, we did not find a lower HOMA-β to be associated with the development of diabetes when individuals had relatively similar glucose concentrations. Indeed, if anything, individuals who developed diabetes tended to have higher HOMA-β, reflecting the inadequacies of the HOMA-β calculation.

In an attempt to understand this fundamental disparity between the current findings and previous studies, we believe it useful to begin by examining the basis of the HOMA-β calculation. The HOMA calculation is derived from a computer-solved model that assumes certain relationships between basal plasma glucose and insulin concentration. Although values of both fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are used to solve the equation, the degree of glycemia is often the major determinant. In Table 1, for example, as glucose increases, insulin concentrations also increase, but HOMA-β declines. In fact, for individuals with IFG-110 to have similar HOMA-β as individuals with NFG, insulin concentrations would have to be ∼120 pmol/l or double the actual insulin concentration.

When examined in this light, it is easy to see why our results differ from others. There have been four prospective studies that have evaluated the role of HOMA-β in predicting diabetes. They all concluded that a lower HOMA-β was predictive of future diabetes. In three of the studies that provided results by diabetes status, baseline glucose was also higher in individuals who developed diabetes. In one of the studies, the baseline glucose was only different by 0.5 mmol/l, and the baseline HOMA-β was not significantly different. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, HOMA-β also did not predict the development of diabetes when adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.69–1.26]). However, when they added HOMA-IR to the model, HOMA-β became significant (0.34 [0.21–0.55]). The authors therefore concluded that a higher HOMA-β was protective against the development of diabetes and emphasized the importance of adjusting for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when evaluating insulin secretion. While this has biological basis, it should be noted that HOMA-IR and insulin concentration were nearly perfectly correlated (r = 0.98); therefore, adding HOMA-IR to the model merely adjusts for insulin concentration and isolates the effect of glucose concentration on diabetes risk.

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^bdc7f713]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The first important observation resulting from our study is that significant differences occur in the studied population of women in terms of the severity of insulin resistance evaluated using the HOMA-IR index at the time of GDM diagnosis. According to the International Diabetes Federation criteria, the HOMA-IR cut-off point to differentiate between low and high insulin resistance is 2.38, and HOMA-IR values range from 0.34 to 1.29 in the lowest quartile, whereas in the 4th quartile these values range from 2.89 to 20.39. Such differences in the HOMA-IR indicate a significant pathophysiological variation in the severity of insulin resistance at the diagnosis of GDM in the studied population.

Consistent with our results, several previous studies performed on smaller populations have demonstrated that HOMA-IR index assessed at diagnosis of GDM ranged from 1.6 to 25.

Interestingly 1/4 of the women in our study (the first quartile), exhibited a low degree of insulin resistance, while chronic insulin resistance is present in most of the GDM women, and it progresses in the course of pregnancy.

It is also worth of noticing that the highest rate of insulin resistance (fourth quartile) occurred in 1/4 of our female patients, while most women with this type of diabetes exhibit a mild degree of insulin resistance.

The results of our study clearly indicate a pathophysiological and clinical variation of GDM in respect to HOMA-IR values. The value of HOMA-IR index higher than > 1.29 is associated with a higher value of the pre-pregnancy body mass index, fasting glucose level, insulin level, and severity of GDM. Values of HOMA-IR in the range of 1.92–2.89 are specifically associated with reduced insulin secretion, while values of > 2.89 are additionally associated with a higher HbA1c level and an unchanged beta cell function, suggesting insufficient compensation for metabolic demands. It should be emphasised that there were no statistically significant differences between the HOMA-IR quartiles in terms of age, parity and time of diagnosis of GDM.

### Factors that influence pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients: a sub-analysis of the March trial [^9f1c9ab8]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Distribution of Patients

At 48-week follow-up, the subjects were categorized into three groups, lowly improved (LI), mediumly improved (MI), and highly improved (HI), based on the tertiles of change noted in HOMA-β (∆HOMA-β) and HOMA-IR (∆HOMA-IR).

In relation to HOMA-β, the LI group had ∆HOMA-β < − 13.9, the MI group had − 13.9 ≤ ∆HOMA-β < 13.9, and the HI group had ∆HOMA-β ≥ 13.9. The LI group in ∆HOMA-IR was assessed at < 0.6, the MI group had 0.6 ≤ ∆HOMA-IR < 2.9, and the HI group had ≥ 2.9 resistance.

Statistical Methods

SPSS version 21.0 was used to perform statistical analysis of the study. Continuous variables that had normal distributions were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Student t test and one-way ANOVA were adopted to analyze the differences in characteristics between the groups. Continuous variables that did not have normal distribution were expressed as median with a range of upper and lower quartiles and analyzed using a non-parametric test. Discontinuous variables were expressed as a percentage and analyzed using Chi-square test. In addition, logistic regression was performed to analyze the factors that may influence ∆HOMA-β and ∆HOMA-IR. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.

Compliance with Ethics Guidelines

All procedures performed in the study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^da156039]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission — expert consensus definition and historical criteria are detailed as follows: Remission was defined as HbA1c < 6.5% for at least 3 months with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy for the specific purpose of lowering blood glucose. The 2021 ADA consensus similarly defined remission as a return of HbA1c to < 6.5% (< 48 mmol/mol) that persists for at least 3 months in the absence of usual glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy. Historical categorizations included "partial" remission (HbA1c not diagnostic of diabetes [< 6.5%], fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dl [5.6–6.9 mmol/l]) and "complete" remission (HbA1c < 5.7%, fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l]), each requiring at least 1 year's duration; "prolonged" remission lasted more than 5 years. Earlier ABCD/PCDS criteria required confirmation on two occasions separated by at least 6 months and complete cessation of all glucose-lowering therapies, but the panel did not consider "weight loss" to be a necessary criterion. The panel recommended that remission should be deemed a realistic and achievable goal for many adults with T2D using diet as a primary intervention, while noting remission may be harder to achieve in long-standing disease (8 years or more). The panel reached consensus that insulin resistance can be measured using HOMA-beta and HOMA-IR to assess progress with therapy and to define expectations.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^f357861c]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes remission — complications and insulin resistance consensus states that preventing the long-term known microvascular and macrovascular complications related to diabetes are paramount in managing T2D, even in the absence of remission; insulin resistance can be measured using HOMA-beta (homeostatic model assessment for assessing beta-cell function) and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for assessing insulin resistance) to assess progress with therapy and to define expectations; and remission of T2D is accompanied by reversal or improvement of insulin resistance.

### What is the clinical usefulness of the metabolic syndrome? The casale monferrato study [^7da16ddf]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Data on the clinical usefulness of the metabolic syndrome with respect to cardiovascular risk are not conclusive. We have assessed this issue in a large population-based cohort of diabetic and nondiabetic people in Southern Europe.

Methods

An Italian population-based cohort of 3729 individuals (2211 without diabetes and 1518 with diabetes) was examined, with centralized measurements, including the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index in nondiabetic people. The usefulness of the metabolic syndrome (ATP III criteria) as an indicator of cardiovascular disease (CVD), independently of classical and novel risk factor [C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin excretion rate (AER)] was assessed by using unconditional logistic regression.

Results

One thousand, seven hundred and fifty-three individuals (47.0%) had neither diabetes nor the metabolic syndrome, 458 (12.3%) had the metabolic syndrome only, 442 (11.8%) had type 2 diabetes only and 1076 (28.9%) had both diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. The highest likelihood of having CVD was conferred by both diabetes and the metabolic syndrome [odds ratio (OR) = 4.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.25–5.87], independently of age, sex, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoke, AER, and CRP values. After further adjustment for its individual components, the association between CVD and the metabolic syndrome was no more evident. Among people with CRP 3 mg/l or less, ORs were similar in nondiabetic people with the metabolic syndrome and in diabetic people without it, whereas among those with CRP greater than 3 mg/l OR was two-fold higher in the latter. Values in upper quartiles of the HOMA-IR conferred a significant two-fold increased OR of CVD, even after adjustment for individual components of the metabolic syndrome, CRP and AER.

Conclusions

The additional information provided by the metabolic syndrome is limited, in both diabetic and nondiabetic people, whereas the HOMA index is a useful indicator of CVD, independently of individual components of the metabolic syndrome, classical and novel risk factors.

### Are HOMA-IR and HOMA-B good predictors for diabetes and pre-diabetes subtypes? [^d16774f0]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Diabetic patients included those with FBS ≥ 126 mg/dl or BS2hpp ≥ 200 mg/dl at the beginning or during the study or those who received antidiabetic therapy. Subjects with BS2hpp < 140 mg/dl and FBS < 100 mg/dl were considered as free of diabetes, isolated impaired fasting glucose (iIFG) was considered in cases with FBS between 100 and 125 mg/dl and BS2hpp < 140 mg/dl, isolated impaired glucose tolerance (iIGT) included FBS < 100 mg/dl and BS2hpp between 140 and 199 mg/dl, combined impaired fasting glucose & impaired glucose tolerance (CGI) was defined as FBS between 100 and 125 mg/dl and BS2hpp between 140 and 199 mg/dl. Pre-defined cut-offs from the previous statement from the Iranian National Committee of Obesity report were used to define binary metabolic syndrome variables. HOMA-IR was calculated using the formula FBS(mmol/L)*FI(Mu/ml)/22.5, and HOMA-B was calculated using the formula 20*FI(Mu/ml)/[FBS(mmol/L)-3.5].

### Effect of carnosine or β-alanine supplementation therapy for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^55c6b116]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Carnosine and beta-alanine (β-alanine) have shown potential in the management of chronic conditions, including metabolic disorders. However, their therapeutic efficacy in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes remains inconclusive due to heterogeneity in clinical trial results and limited synthesis of human evidence.

Objective

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of carnosine and β-alanine supplementation on patients with prediabetes and T2DM.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to 9 October 2024 for randomized controlled trials that compared carnosine or β-alanine supplementation to placebo in prediabetic and diabetic populations. The quality of evidence was appraised using the Jadad scale, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were analyzed using RevMan and Stata, employing fixed-effects models and I-V methods.

Results

Eight trials met the inclusion criteria, totaling 377 participants. Our analysis indicated that supplementation significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) (SMD: -0.53; 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.31; p < 0.00001) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (SMD:-0.36; 95% CI:-0.59 to -0.12; p = 0.003) compared to placebo. No significant effects were observed on body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin. low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), but a lowering effect was observed in total cholesterol (TC). Notably, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell Function (HOMA-β) values were improved, suggesting enhanced β-cell function, while changes in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusions

Carnosine and β-alanine supplementation show potential as adjunct therapies for improving FBG, HbA1c and HOMA-β in prediabetes and T2DM. Further rigorous studies are warranted to establish optimal dosage, treatment duration, and long-term efficacy in clinical practice.

### Are HOMA-IR and HOMA-B good predictors for diabetes and pre-diabetes subtypes? [^66dd11de]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate the association between the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell function (HOMA-B) with the incidence of diabetes and pre-diabetes subtypes.

Methods

A total of 3101 normoglycemic people aged 20-70years were included in the 6-year follow-up study. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate the incidence possibility of isolated Impaired Fasting Glucose (iIFG), isolated Impaired Glucose Tolerance (iIGT), Combined impaired fasting glucose & impaired glucose tolerance (CGI), and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) per standard deviation (SD) increment in HOMA-IR and HOMA-B in the crude and multivariable model.

Results

In the multivariate model, an increase in one SD change in HOMA-IR was associated with a 43, 42, 75, and 92% increased risk of iIFG, iIGT, CGI, and DM, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the increase in HOMA-B and the incidence of iIGT; however, after adjusting the results for metabolic syndrome components, it was inversely correlated with the incidence of iIFG [Odds Ratio = 0.86(0.75–0.99)].

Conclusions

HOMA-IR is positively correlated with diabetes and pre-diabetes subtypes' incidence, and HOMA-B is inversely correlated with the incidence of iIFG but positively correlated with iIGT incidence. However, none of these alone is a good criterion for predicting diabetes and pre-diabetes.

### Clinical phenotyping of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Yemen [^10e2dc96]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

T2D is a common chronic disease with complex etiology and high heterogeneity. In our study, we used a data-driven cluster analysis in classifying patients presented with newly diagnosed T2D into three clusters. Cluster 1 (high insulin resistance and high beta-cell function group) was generally associated with the highest HOMA2-β and HOMA-IR scores and the lowest HOMA2-S score and HbA1c value than was found in the other clusters. In accord with other studies, insulin resistance was associated with abdominal adiposity (UKPDS Asians), obesity and high TG concentration, and NAFLD. Cluster 2 (low insulin resistance and low beta-cell function group) had the lowest HOMA2-β score, BMI, WC and LAP, and the highest HOMA2-S score and HbA1c value than in the other clusters. As in UKPDS Afro-Caribbeans, high HbA1c was associated with greater impairment of beta-cell function. Cluster 3 (high insulin resistance and low beta-cell function group) was characterized by both low insulin sensitivity (low HOMA2-S, high HOMA-IR) associated with overweight, abdominal adiposity and NAFLD, and high HbA1c associated with reduced beta-cell function (low HOMA2-β).

### Utility of homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function in predicting diabetes in 12, 924 healthy Koreans [^094c9db3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we confirm that baseline glucose concentration is strongly associated with diabetes development, with 29% of individuals meeting the old IFG criteria (IFG-110) progressing to diabetes within 5 years. However, individuals who were at risk to develop diabetes were not characterized by insulin deficiency, as defined by absolute insulin concentration or HOMA-β. As pancreatic β-cell dysfunction has been established as a requisite defect in type 2 diabetes, these findings likely highlight the inadequacies of fasting measures as surrogates for pancreatic function.

### Use and abuse of HOMA modeling [^ffe20ab8]. Diabetes Care (2004). Low credibility.

Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is a method for assessing beta-cell function and insulin resistance (IR) from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin or C-peptide concentrations. It has been reported in > 500 publications, 20 times more frequently for the estimation of IR than beta-cell function. This article summarizes the physiological basis of HOMA, a structural model of steady-state insulin and glucose domains, constructed from physiological dose responses of glucose uptake and insulin production. Hepatic and peripheral glucose efflux and uptake were modeled to be dependent on plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Decreases in beta-cell function were modeled by changing the beta-cell response to plasma glucose concentrations. The original HOMA model was described in 1985 with a formula for approximate estimation. The computer model is available but has not been as widely used as the approximation formulae. HOMA has been validated against a variety of physiological methods. We review the use and reporting of HOMA in the literature and give guidance on its appropriate use (e.g., cohort and epidemiological studies) and inappropriate use (e.g., measuring beta-cell function in isolation). The HOMA model compares favorably with other models and has the advantage of requiring only a single plasma sample assayed for insulin and glucose. In conclusion, the HOMA model has become a widely used clinical and epidemiological tool and, when used appropriately, it can yield valuable data. However, as with all models, the primary input data need to be robust, and the data need to be interpreted carefully.

### Low bone turnover associates with lower insulin sensitivity in newly diagnosed drug-Naïve persons with type 2 diabetes [^f3ea47ce]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Type 2 Diabetes Phenotyping

We estimated insulin sensitivity (HOMA of insulin sensitivity, HOMA2S) and β-cell function (HOMA of β-cell function, HOMA2B) based on fasting serum C-peptide and fasting plasma glucose values using the revised HOMA version 2 (HOMA2). Persons were classified into three T2D phenotypes: (1) classical, low β-cell function (HOMA2B < 115.3%) and low insulin sensitivity (HOMA2S < 63.5%); (2) insulinopenic, low β-cell function (HOMA2B < 115.3%) and high insulin sensitivity (HOMA2S > 63.5%); or (3) hyperinsulinemic, high β-cell function (HOMA2B > 115.3%) and low insulin sensitivity (HOMA2S < 63.5%). The classification was done according to the median of β-cell function and insulin sensitivity in a Danish background population with normal fasting plasma glucose levels (cut-offs: HOMA2B 115.3% and HOMA2S 63.5%).

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^db9c822a]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose was 5.2 ± 0.5 mmol/l, and median serum insulin (measured by 11 insulin assays) was 59 (IQR 38–78) pmol/l in normoglycemic subjects, 6.2 ± 0.4 mmol/l and 117 (54–142) pmol/l for subjects with pre-diabetes, and 8.4 ± 2.2 mmol/l and 86 (46–142) pmol/l for type 2 diabetic subjects. A P value of 0.07 was obtained from a Kruskal-Wallis test for insulin across the groups. HOMA-β was highest in those with pre-diabetes at 109% (71–149), lower in those with normoglycemia at 85% (64–128), and lowest in those with type 2 diabetes at 63% (38–88) (P = 0.0002). HOMA-IR was 1.30 (0.84–1.65) in normoglycemic subjects, highest in subjects with pre-diabetes at 2.58 (1.24–3.12), and slightly lower in diabetic subjects at 2.13 (1.19–3.54) (P = 0.022). Values for HOMA-S were 82% (67–137) for normoglycemic subjects, 40% (33–84) in those with pre-diabetes, and 50% (29–93) in those with diabetes (P = 0.025).

Percentage of patients with data outside input limits for HOMA calculators

All glucose values obtained were appropriate for the HOMA calculator version 2.2. However, 4.3% of insulin results (55 in total) were < 20 pmol/l, and 1% (12 in total) were > 300 pmol/l and, therefore, were not accepted. The actual numbers of insulin values outside limits for each assay can be seen in supplemental Table 2 (available in the online appendix). HOMA estimates are presented in Fig. 1; both inclusion of participants with insulin values set to HOMA limits if outside these limits and exclusion if outside limits are shown.

Choice of HOMA calculator

For illustrative purposes only, the RIA calculator rather than SI calculator was used with assays specific for insulin; estimates of HOMA-β differed by 11% (P < 0.0001) and of HOMA-IR by 15% (P < 0.0001).

### Surrogate measures of first-phase insulin secretion versus reference methods intravenous glucose tolerance test and hyperglycemic clamp: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^f058d51d]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

In type 2 diabetes the incretin effect is reduced compared with NGT individuals. This could result in substantially lower insulin secretion when measured during an OGTT. Other confounding factors are variation in gastric emptying and intestinal absorption of glucose. Variation in gastric emptying has been shown to account for 35% of the variance in peak blood glucose levels at the end of an OGTT for both healthy people and patients with type 2 diabetes. However, most of the surrogate measures involving the OGTT use the insulin-to-glucose ratio, and therefore the impact of gastric emptying should be reduced.

HOMA-beta was the surrogate measure that was validated in the most studies and is an index that captures another aspect of insulin secretion. Unlike the surrogate measure involving the OGTT, it is based on a single fasting blood sample and is not specifically intended to measure the first phase of insulin secretion. It is used as a non-specific measure of insulin secretion, without any information about an acute stimulation of beta cells and can thus be considered a measure of steady-state insulin secretion during fasting. In a recent cluster analysis aimed at reclassifying adult-onset diabetes, insulin secretion was estimated using HOMA2-beta, a computer-estimated version of HOMA, using either insulin or C-peptide in a fasting state, both of which are available in many laboratories and can be used in routine healthcare (27–31). In this systematic review, it is evident that HOMA-beta has a consistently good correlation to first-phase insulin secretion even when calculated using insulin. In addition, this correlation had the lowest heterogeneity across the analyzed studies. This encourages the use of HOMA-beta as an estimate of insulin secretion in a clinical setting, even though it is a measure of steady-state insulin secretion and should not be interpreted as a measure of the first phase.

### Relative contributions of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction to the development of type 2 diabetes in Koreans [^2222edf5]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Controversies still exist regarding the relative contributions of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction to the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes in different populations. We examined the associations of baseline insulin resistance and β-cell function indices with the development of Type 2 diabetes in Koreans.

Methods

We analysed the clinical and laboratory data of 17 878 Korean adults (age 20–79 years) who underwent routine medical examinations with a median interval of 3.5 years (range 2.5–4.7 years). Using the homeostasis model assessment, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and β-cell function (HOMA-%B) indices at baseline were assessed.

Results

Those who developed diabetes (n = 732, 4.1%) had significantly higher fasting serum insulin level (53.4 ± 31.2 vs. 41.4 ± 23.4 pmol/l) and HOMA-IR (2.38 ± 1.45 vs. 1.65 ± 1.02) and lower HOMA-%B (74 ± 47 vs. 85 ± 48) at baseline (P < 0.001 for all). Both high HOMA-IR and low HOMA-%B were independently associated with an increased odds ratio of incident Type 2 diabetes. Among the participants who developed diabetes, 29% demonstrated predominant β-cell dysfunction (HOMA-%B < 25th percentile) and 51% had predominant insulin resistance (HOMA-IR > 75th percentile). When we divided the participants according to the median BMI of the whole population (23.7 kg/m²), 49% of participants in the low BMI group demonstrated predominant β-cell dysfunction and 26% had predominant insulin resistance, whilst 21% in the high BMI group demonstrated mainly β-cell dysfunction and 60% had mainly insulin resistance.

Conclusions

In individuals with low BMI, β-cell dysfunction is the predominant defect, whereas insulin resistance is the predominant pathogenetic factor in individuals with high BMI in the development of Type 2 diabetes in Koreans.

### Factors that influence pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients: a sub-analysis of the March trial [^8b420641]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Metformin and Acarbose in Chinese as the initial Hypoglycemic treatment (MARCH) trial has demonstrated a similar efficacy in HbA1c reduction between acarbose and metformin treatments in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. The current sub-analysis of the MARCH trail aims to evaluate the baseline characteristics that may influence the improvement of pancreatic β-cell function and insulin resistance after acarbose therapy in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM.

Methods

Of the 784 patients who entered the MARCH trail, 391 were assigned to the acarbose therapy group; 304 of these completed 48 weeks of follow-up of acarbose therapy. At 48 weeks, on the basis of the tertiles of change in homeostasis model assessment-beta cell function (∆HOMA-β) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (∆HOMA-IR), the subjects were divided into lowly, mediumly, and highly improved groups.

Results

In the highly improved HOMA-β group, patients had higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (PBG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), fasting serum insulin (FINS) concentration, and HOMA-IR in comparison to the lowly improved group (p < 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between HbA1c, SBP, and highly improved ∆HOMA-β (p < 0.05), while an inverse correlation was evident between HDL-c and highly improved ∆HOMA-β (p < 0.05). The highly improved HOMA-IR group had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), FINS concentration, and HOMA-β in comparison to the lowly improved group (p < 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between FBG, waist circumference, and highly improved HOMA-IR (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Newly diagnosed T2DM Chinese patients with lower baseline HDL-c and higher HbA1c and SBP values are more likely to achieve improvement in beta cell function whereas baseline fasting blood glucose and waist circumference were the significant factors associated with improvement in insulin resistance with acarbose therapy.

Trial Registration

The clinical trial registry number was ChiCTR-TRC-08000231.

### Surrogate measures of first-phase insulin secretion versus reference methods intravenous glucose tolerance test and hyperglycemic clamp: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^683c6a36]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The global burden of diabetes was estimated to be 463 million people in 2019 and is steadily rising. The key pathomechanisms of type 2 diabetes are impaired insulin sensitivity combined with a progressive loss of pancreatic beta-cell function. Longitudinal studies have shown that beta-cell function is altered many years before the diabetes diagnosis. With the increasing recognition of disease heterogeneity, insulin secretion has been used as a key feature in the subclassification of pre-diabetes and diabetes. In one recent work, adult-onset diabetes has been classified into five clusters, each of which features different pathophysiologic phenotypes and distinct patterns of complication. In this approach, a reliable measurement of insulin secretion is important to differentiate insulinopenic and hyperinsulinemic diabetes endotypes. In pre-diabetes subphenotyping, adequate methods for measurement of insulin secretion are similarly important for capturing key differences between pre-diabetes subphenotypes.

In healthy individuals, insulin is secreted in a biphasic manner in response to an increase in arterial glucose concentration. The first phase lasts approximately 10 min, and the second phase reaches a plateau after 2–3 hours, provided glucose is continuously elevated, in an experimental setting. In type 2 diabetes, the first phase of insulin secretion is impaired or even absent and the second phase is decreased. The first phase of insulin secretion is frequently used in pathophysiological studies of type 2 diabetes and the prediction of type 1 diabetes. Homeostatic model assessment and beta cell function (HOMA-beta) is used to estimate insulin secretion for the classification of diabetes and can have importance in clinical settings for optimizing diabetes treatment.

There are numerous methods to assess first-phase secretion; of these the hyperglycemic clamp (HGC) test and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) are referred to as the gold standards. Gold-standard methods are used in smaller populations for an accurate measurement of secretion, often in combination with an examination of insulin resistance in the same protocol. The HGC test allows assessment of both first-phase and second-phase insulin secretion, whereas the IVGTT is a reference test only for first-phase insulin secretion.

### Clinical characteristics and beta cell function in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus with different levels of serum triglyceride [^b808b442]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

To explore clinical characteristics and beta cell function in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed drug naive type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with different levels of serum triglyceride (TG).

Methods

Patients with newly diagnosed T2DM (n = 624) were enrolled and divided into different groups according to levels of serum TG. All patients underwent oral glucose tolerance tests and insulin releasing tests. Demographic data, lipid profiles, glucose levels, and insulin profiles were compared between different groups. Basic insulin secretion function index (homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function index, HOMA-β), modified beta cell function index (MBCI), glucose disposition indices (DI), and early insulin secretion function index (insulinogenic index, IGI) were used to evaluate the beta cell function.

Results

Patients of newly diagnosed T2DM with hypertriglyceridemia were younger, fatter and had worse lipid profiles, glucose profiles, and high insulin levels than those with normal TG. There is no difference in early phase insulin secretion among groups of newly diagnosed T2DM patients with different TG levels. The basal beta cell function (HOMA-β and MBCI) initially increased along rising TG levels and then decreased as the TG levels rose further. The insulin sensitivity was relatively high in patients with a low level of TG and low with a high level of TG.

Conclusions

Hypertriglyceridemia influences clinical characteristics and β cell function of Chinese patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. A better management of dyslipidemia may, to some extent, reduce the effect of lipotoxicity, thereby improving glucose homeostasis in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM.

### HOMA indices as screening tests for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes [^2afa0b09]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We assessed the diagnostic performances of homeostasis model assessment indices (HOMA) of β-cell function (HOMA-%β) and of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) for cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) screening.

Methods

Data were collected from a prospective cohort of 228 patients with CF (117 adults and 111 children). Fasting insulin and glucose levels were measured to calculate HOMA-%β and HOMA-IR. HOMA-%β < 100 indicated insulin secretion deficiency and HOMA-IR > 1 insulin resistance. Both were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV). Two-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (2h-OGTT) defined CFRD. Analyses were conducted separately for children and adults. Performances of HOMA-%β and HOMA-IR were calculated at inclusion, for each year of follow-up and for pooled data over the follow-up period.

Results

Sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were respectively: 88%, 45%, 98% and 11% for HOMA-%β and 42%, 48%, 91% and 6% for HOMA-IR in the pooled data of children; and 83%, 18%, 90% and 10% for HOMA-%β, and 39%, 80%, 92% and 18% for HOMA-IR in the pooled data of adults. Combining HOMA-%β and HOMA-IR did not improve performances.

Conclusion

Within both age groups, HOMA-%β < 100 provided good sensitivity and NPV. HOMA-IR > 1 had low sensitivity. Calculation of the HOMA-%β could be an interesting first-line screening approach to exclude CFRD and thus avoid unnecessary OGTT in patients for whom value is ≥ 100. However, HOMA-%β < 100 does not support the diagnosis of CFRD and should be complemented by OGTT.

### Hepatic insulin clearance is increased in patients with high HbA1c type 2 diabetes: a preliminary report [^3b5a9bf5]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that HIC was increased in patients with high HbA1c type 2 diabetes, especially in patients with HbA1c > 8%. The HIC was significantly correlated with HbA1c. The mean HbA1c of the high HIC group was significantly higher compared with that of the low HIC group below the median. Previous studies reported that HIC was decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, the glucose levels in these studies were mild, with fasting plasma glucose levels of 4.9 ± 0.1 mmol/Land 5.3 ± 0.5 mmol/L.HIC was shown to increase in animals with hyperglycemia, and insulin becomes unstable in the hyperglycemic condition because the zinc ion is important for insulin crystal; however, zinc ion regulation is disturbed in the hyperglycemic condition. These results suggest that HIC is decreased in patients with mild hyperglycemia, but HIC was increased in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Therefore, postprandial insulin levels in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes should be interpreted with caution. We suggest that postprandial C-peptide levels should be measured in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes to determine their ability to secrete insulin. However, there are no other clinical results or animal study results in the poorly controlled diabetes condition. Further research is required.

The insulin secretion index HOMA-beta and the insulinogenic index are significantly correlated with HIC. We also analyzed C-peptide-based insulin secretion ability because the insulin-based insulin secretion index is affected by insulin clearance. C-peptide-AUC0–30 and C-peptide-AUC0–120 were also significantly correlated with HIC. These correlations were weaker compared with HOMA-beta and the insulinogenic index. However, these results suggested that insulin secretion is important for insulin clearance. Because insulin use is a saturable process, the higher HIC values may result from reduced insulinemia rather than from a mechanism that is related to stronger glucose intolerance. Figure 1 shows that during the MTT, insulin is much higher in the low clearance group. Thus, the lower clearance may be strongly related to saturation mechanisms, rather than to homeostasis mechanisms. Further studies including investigation of the insulin secretion ability, such as using the hyperglycemic clamp, are required.

### Update on the effects of physical activity on insulin sensitivity in humans [^b95ea576]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The comparison of results between research studies into the effects of a physically active lifestyle and/or exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control are problematic due to differences in the methods of assessment of outcome variables. While the precise protocols vary, the general methods for assessing insulin sensitivity/glycaemic control include: (1) measuring fasting insulin concentrations, with elevated fasted (insulin) > 25 mIU/L indicating poor insulin sensitivity, as the pancreas endeavours to compensate for the lack of peripheral insulin sensitivity by secreting greater amounts of insulin, thereby resulting in hyperinsulinaemia; (2) oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), which involves the ingestion of a standard glucose bolus (75 g), followed by blood glucose monitoring for the subsequent 2 hours. Blood glucose concentrations of > 7.8 mmol/L and < 11.0 mmol/L at 2 hours are indicative of impaired glycaemic control, and > 11.0 mmol/L indicates diabetes; (3) hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, in which the participant is infused with insulin at a known rate, creating a hyperinsulinaemic state (~100 µU/ml), while simultaneously blood glucose levels are monitored and adjusted by a variable-rate infusion to maintain glycaemia (5.0–5.5 mmol/L). A high rate of glucose infusion indicates insulin sensitivity as the glucose is being rapidly taken up by the cells of the body, while a low rate of glucose infusion indicates a loss of insulin sensitivity, as the glucose is remaining in the blood rather than being taken up by the cells of the body;(4) hyperglycaemic clamp, in which plasma glucose levels are initially increased to ~125mg/dl above basal values and then maintained at this hyperglycaemic level, through the infusion of glucose. High infusion rates indicate good insulin sensitivity, while low infusion rates indicate insulin resistance (IR).; (5) homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), which uses fand is calculated as (glucose mmol/L x insulin)/22.5, with a relatively low score indicating well regulated fasting glucose that is being maintained through relatively low concentrations of insulin, hence good insulin sensitivity, whereas an elevated HOMA-IR value, such as > 2.5 indicates IR. In the updated homoeostatic model, HOMA2-IR, values > 1.5 suggest IR; (6) HOMA-β is a measure of β cell function derived from fasting values using the equation (20 x insulin)/(glucose mmol/L−3.5) %, with this measure indicating the extent to which a deficient β cell function, as opposed to IR, contributes to hyperglycaemia in the fasting state; (7) Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), which is an index of insulin sensitivity, calculated as QUICKI = 1/(log (fasting plasma insulin µU/ml) + log (fasting blood glucose mg/dL)).

### Prevalence of insulin resistance in the polycystic ovary syndrome using the homeostasis model assessment [^bf9a3376]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) in a large population of patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Prospective, case-control.

Setting

University medical center.

Patient(S)

Two hundred seventy-one PCOS patients and 260 eumenorrheic, non-hirsute, control women.

Intervention(S)

History and physical examination and blood sampling.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Total T, free T, DHEAS, sex hormone-binding globulin, and fasting glucose and insulin levels; homeostatic model assessment values for IR (HOMA-IR) and percent beta-cell function (HOMA-%beta-cell).

Result(S)

Patients with PCOS and controls differed significantly in all parameters studied, except fasting glucose. Because the HOMA-IR and HOMA-%beta-cell values were variably associated with race, age, and body mass index, the HOMA-IR and HOMA-%beta-cell values were then adjusted for these cofounders. After adjustment, 64.4% of PCOS patients were noted to be insulin resistant, and 2.6% had beta-cell dysfunction. Compared with PCOS patients without IR (n = 96), patients with IR (n = 174) were more obese and had higher beta-cell function.

Conclusion(S)

In patients with PCOS, the prevalence of IR was 64% according to the HOMA-IR measurement, after adjustment. Patients with IR were more clinically affected. Although IR is a common abnormality in PCOS, it does not seem to be a universal feature.

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^8107a8f7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Our results are consistent with the general opinion that chronic insulin resistance lies at the core of the development of the most common form of beta cell dysfunction present in GDM. The function of the beta cells decreases around a surprisingly low value of insulin resistance – as low as > 1.29. The obtained results stress the need for implementing a treatment aimed at improving tissue susceptibility to insulin in GDM women with a HOMA-IR of > 1.29. It is especially important to introduce healthy lifestyle changes, as well as a proper diet based on individualized caloric needs and weight gain. It should be pointed out, that limiting excessive growth of fatty tissue may also decrease the adverse effect of adipokines on the insulin secretion and reduce the intensity of insulin resistance of skeletal muscles.

Since metformin reduces insulin resistance, metformin treatment seems to be pathophysiologically sound in most of the GDM women, with the exception of subjects with a suspected of developing type 1 diabetes or with type 1 diabetes exhibiting itself in the course of pregnancy. Women with HOMA-IR values in the range of 1.92–2.89 exhibit a decreased beta cell function, suggesting insulin substitution, rather than the introduction of oral hypoglycemic drugs.

It is possible, based on existing evidence that starting insulin substitution in the latter subpopulation of women may delay the development of subsequent disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism and thus may partly reduce future cardiovascular risk related to diabetes.

Women with HOMA-IR values of > 2.89 are likely to benefit from metformin treatment combined with insulin therapy.

Another interesting finding in this study is the association between the degree of insulin resistance, beta cell function and the severity of GDM. Severity of GDM evaluated by starting insulin therapy and daily insulin dose, exhibits the strongest correlation with HOMA-IR index values. An increase in the HOMA index value of > 2.89 is accompanied both by an increase in insulin secretion and by an increase in insulin requirement, which suggests inefficient secretion in response to insulin resistance.

### Homeostasis model assessment: insulin resistance and β-cell function from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in man [^fa7e24ec]. Diabetologia (1985). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)" for polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) estimates insulin resistance based on fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma insulin levels. It is widely used to assess metabolic health, particularly in studies of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) offers insights into an individual's insulin sensitivity using two key measurements: fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. These inputs are required to evaluate insulin resistance and can be provided in different units.

For fasting glucose, you can use:

- mg/dL, with a range from 50 to 400
- mmol/L, with a range from 2.78 to 22.2

For fasting insulin, the options are:

- uIU/mL, with a range from 1 to 100
- pmol/L, with a range from 6 to 600

If the measurements are given in mmol/L or pmol/L, conversions will be necessary. Convert fasting glucose from mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by 18.0182. For insulin, convert from pmol/L to uIU/mL by dividing by 6.

After standardizing the units, the HOMA-IR score is calculated using the formula:

HOMA-IR Score = (fasting insulin in uIU/mL * fasting glucose in mg/dL) / 405

The result, rounded to two decimal places, determines the level of insulin resistance:

- Scores less than 1 indicate normal insulin sensitivity.
- Scores from 1 to just under 2 suggest mild insulin resistance.
- Scores from 2 to just under 3 imply moderate insulin resistance.
- Scores of 3 or more reflect severe insulin resistance.

These interpretations help contextualize how the body's insulin management might be impacting health, signaling the potential risk for conditions associated with insulin resistance.

### Latent associations of low serum amylase with decreased plasma insulin levels and insulin resistance in asymptomatic middle-aged adults [^8dfe9cb0]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Results

The mean and median values of most clinical parameters were within the normal ranges (Table 1). Five subjects were suspected of having type 2 diabetes because their PG at 120 min was ≥ 200 mg/dl, even though FPG was < 126 mg/dl. BMI and PG at 120 min were significantly higher in subjects with low serum amylase than in those with normal to high serum amylase. Table 2 shows the univariate linear correlation coefficients between serum amylase and variables associated with insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. Serum amylase was significantly correlated with BMI, but no other variable. HOMA-R was very closely correlated with FPI (r = 0.997, P < 0.001), but showed weaker correlation with FPG (r = 0.53, P < 0.001, data not shown). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that of the independent clinical variables listed in Table 1, BMI and PI at 60 min (β coefficient = –0.56 and 0.38, respectively, adjusted R 2 = 0.26, data not shown) were significantly associated with serum amylase. In multivariate logistic analysis, each 1-SD increase in BMI was significantly associated with low serum amylase, even after controlling for confounding factors (Table 3). By contrast, each 1-SD increase in QUICKI, and 1-SD decreases in PI at 0 and 60 min, HOMA-R, and HOMA-β was significantly associated with low serum amylase, particularly after adjusting for BMI (Model 3). The significant association between low serum amylase and PG at 120 min disappeared after adjusting for BMI. In all analyses adjusted for BMI (Model 3), each 1-SD increase in BMI was significantly associated with low serum amylase (data not shown).

### Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion determined by homeostasis model assessment and risk of diabetes in a multiethnic cohort of women: the women's health initiative observational study [^218ba956]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), based on plasma levels of fasting glucose and insulin, has been widely validated and applied for quantifying insulin resistance and beta-cell function. However, prospective data regarding its relation to diabetes risk in ethnically diverse populations are limited.

Research Design and Methods

Among 82,069 women who were aged 50–79 years, free of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and participating in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, we conducted a nested case-control study to prospectively examine the relations of HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA-B) with diabetes risk. During a median follow-up period of 5.9 years, 1,584 diabetic patients were matched with 2,198 control subjects by age, ethnicity, clinical center, time of blood draw, and follow-up time.

Results

Baseline levels of fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR were each significantly higher among case compared with control subjects, while HOMA-B was lower (all P values < 0.0001). After adjustment for matching factors and diabetes risk factors, all four markers were significantly associated with diabetes risk; the estimated relative risks per SD increment were 3.54 (95% CI 3.02–4.13) for fasting glucose, 2.25 (1.99–2.54) for fasting insulin, 3.40 (2.95–3.92) for HOMA-IR, and 0.57 (0.51–0.63) for HOMA-B. While no statistically significant multiplicative interactions were observed between these markers and ethnicity, the associations of both HOMA-IR and HOMA-B with diabetes risk remained significant and robust in each ethnic group, including whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians/Pacific Islanders. When evaluated jointly, the relations of HOMA-IR and HOMA-B with diabetes risk appeared to be independent and additive. HOMA-IR was more strongly associated with an increased risk than were other markers after we excluded those with fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl at baseline.

Conclusions

High HOMA-IR and low HOMA-B were independently and consistently associated with an increased diabetes risk in a multiethnic cohort of U.S. postmenopausal women. These data suggest the value of HOMA indexes for diabetes risk in epidemiologic studies.

### Effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist on insulin secretion index and serum wnt5a protein in patients with new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus [^67515545]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes has become a severe public health problem globally, and the complications of diabetes have brought a severe burden to patients. Insulin resistance and / or insufficient insulin secretion are its pathogenesis. Studies have confirmed that glucose toxicity, lipotoxicity, low-level inflammation, and oxidative stress are all involved in the pathological mechanism of pancreatic beta-cell secretion disorders. However, the specific mechanism of insulin secretion regulation is still a hot spot pursued by diabetes researchers worldwide. In recent years, the relationship between glucagon-like peptide-1 and insulin secretion has gradually been recognized by researchers.

The function of pancreatic islets is simply the ability of pancreatic beta cells to secrete insulin. Multiple hormones and proteins (Insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, somatostatin, adiponectin, etc) in the bodywork together to maintain blood glucose at a relatively stable level. In clinical studies, serum insulin and C-peptide levels are usually tested to assess islet function. There are many methods for evaluating pancreatic islet function currently used in clinical practice, such as the positive glucose clamp test, the mini-model procedure, the area under the curve (AUC) following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and the arginine test. However, due to the complexity of the above methods for detection, Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is usually used to explain the islet function of patients in clinical practice. In the study published by Turner et al. in 1985 in Diabetologia, they used the method and formula to calculate the HOMA index by measuring the individual's fasting blood glucose level and fasting insulin level. HOMA is divided into three categories: HOMA-IR, HOMA- IS and HOMA-β. HOMA-β is an index used to evaluate the function of an individual's islet β-cells and is currently a commonly used formula for assessing insulin secretion in clinical practice.

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^b1fef11c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Our findings are in discordance with several up to day published data performed in the small populations of Caucasian GDM women as well as in Japanese women. In these studies minimal increase in insulin secretion assessed by HOMA B in the range of 80–130 to 170–180 or by OGTT- derived indices of beta cell function fail to compensate for increased insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR index between 1–1.8 to 2,3 contributed to the development of gestational diabetes. In contrast, we show that basal insulin secretion decrease in the range of HOMA-IR between 1 to 2,39. On the other hand, these results my support our current suggestion that there is a major need for a treatment aimed at improving tissue insulin sensitivity at low insulin resistance index-HOMA-IR values. In another observations, beta-cell activity assessed by median of HOMA-B was equal 154 at the diagnosis of GDM and 200 alongside with the HOMA-IR- 2.1 and 2.4 respectively.

Interestingly, most of these estimates of beta cell activity are lower than those reported in our current study. We suggest that the relatively early week of gestation at the time of diagnosis of GDM as well as a younger age of studied subjects in our data compared with most of other studies are partly responsible for these differences. These discrepancies may be due to the small size of populations studied as well as may reflect the differences in diagnostic procedures, severity of glucose intolerance, or anthropometric and ethnical characteristics. In the another study of large size population of GDM women basal insulin secretion assessed by mean of HOMA-B in whole population was equal 200 + −300 while the insulin sensitivity index derived from-OGTT was reduced by 42% versus than in women with normal glucose regulation. These results are in accordance with basal insulin secretory capacity values derived from our current study and suggest pathophysiologic heterogeneity of the studied population of GDM women with respect to this pathophysiological parameter. It is suggested that results from HOMA-B a measure of basal insulin secretory capacity should be interpreted alongside with insulin sensitivity measure by HOMA-IR.

### Expansion of the homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function and insulin resistance to enable clinical trial outcome modeling through the interactive adjustment of physiology and treatment effects: iHOMA2 [^ef022052]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of progressive β-cell dysfunction, relative insulin deficiency, and variable degrees of insulin resistance that lead to dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Understanding the biochemistry, phenotypic details, and genetic mechanisms contributing to this can yield important information on pathophysiology. The progressive nature of the disease, as well as measuring the rate of deterioration, has presented an ongoing challenge to clinicians and scientists alike. Tools to track β-cell functional changes and insulin resistance fall into three broad categories: measures of glycemic status (e.g. fasting glucose, HbA 1c), physiological investigations (e.g. clamp techniques, glucose tolerance tests), and mathematical modeling (e.g. minimal model, Mari model, homeostasis model assessment [HOMA]).

No single approach proved sufficient, either, for a comprehensive quantitative description of β-cell dysfunction or insulin resistance. Measures of these parameters vary depending on whether measurements are from basal or stimulated or fasting or postprandial subjects and whether pharmaceutical agents are being taken. Physiological techniques, ranging from simple glucose tolerance tests to euglycemic clamps and stable isotope studies, require expertise and are time and resource intensive, limiting their use to relatively small numbers of subjects.

### Clinical phenotyping of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Yemen [^90ce4ac1]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) tends to have a complex etiology that cannot be encapsulated by a single feature. It broadly encompasses any form of diabetes that is not type 1 diabetes, Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) or secondary diabetes. Although patients with T2D often secrete large amounts of insulin, insulin sensitivity and secretion are imbalanced, and the increased concentration of insulin is not sufficient to meet the increased demands imposed by obesity and insulin resistance. The mediating pathways of hyperglycemia that contribute to beta-cell dysfunction include organs associated with insulin resistance like the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, leading ultimately to a progressive decline of beta-cell function in the face of insulin resistance. Deterioration of beta-cell function is reflected by elevated fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and reduced insulin secretion.

Evidence from the Whitehall II cohort studyindicated that insulin resistance and intermittent hyperglycemia were found about 13 years before the diagnosis of T2D, and unstable decompensation of beta-cell function started about 2–6 years before the diagnosis at a time when more sustained hyperglycemia at pre-diabetes range developed in the face of worsening insulin resistance. At the time of diagnosis of T2D, decompensation becomes stable, making beta-cells unable to compensate for insulin resistance due to reduced beta-cell mass with subsequent rapid and higher blood glucose concentration. Therefore, individuals with this type of diabetes usually have relative insulin deficiency due to progressive decline of beta-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of peripheral insulin resistance.

The steady-state of basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations is determined by their interaction in a feedback loop between the liver and the beta-cells, thereby maintaining an effective insulin action in the liver and at the periphery. A computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of beta-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's prediction allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient beta-cell function to the fasting hyperglycemia (Homeostasis Model Assessment, HOMA).HOMA is the oldest and the most widely used and published method for estimation of insulin sensitivity and assessment of beta-cell function. It offers some advantage over other methods in that it permits comparisons among studies that use the same metric.

Fasting insulin response assessments

Multiple-sampled glucose tolerance tests required to produce the Kraft and Hayashi patterns are resource-intensive. This may explain the popularity of fasting measures such as homeostasis modal assessment (HOMA). HOMA was originally developed to assess insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-β) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) from fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. This is based on the relationship between basal insulin and glucose concentrations reflecting hepatic glucose output and insulin secretion. Normal pancreatic beta-cell function or insulin sensitivity is considered 100% and normal insulin resistance is 1.0. HOMA variants can be determined either by using the calculations shown in figure 1 or by using HOMA 2 from the online calculator. HOMA2 uses model-derived estimates, which better accounts for variations in glucose resistance and when plasma glucose concentrations are above 10 mmol/L. However, there are numerous flaws to using measures based on fasting insulin as discussed below.

Figure 1
HOMA calculations where glucose is mmol/L and insulin is mU/L.HOMA, homeostasis model assessment; HOMA-β; HOMA to assess pancreatic beta-cell function; HOMA-IR, HOMA to assess insulin resistance; HOMA-S, HOMA to assess insulin sensitivity.

Flaws in using fasting insulin resistance models

There are several flaws with using insulin resistance models that are based on fasting insulin and glucose concentrations, including the physiology of insulin secretion and basal levels, the use of insulin resistance as the disease state of concern, and implementation and interpretation of the test itself.

Insulin physiology

Plasma insulin concentrations are labile due to the physiology of insulin release from the pancreas. Insulin is released in a pulsatile manner leading to oscillatory concentrations in the blood. These oscillations have a slow ultradian periodicity (~140 min), which is modulated by a small-amplitude high-frequency oscillation (periodicity 3–10 min). It is hypothesised that the periodic release of insulin prevents downregulation of receptors leading to insulin resistance. Loss of these regular insulin oscillations is considered to be an early indicator of diabetes.

However, these oscillations make a single sample of insulin impractical for clinical practice, as it will be unknown where the insulin levels lie in these periodic cycles. It has been suggested that if fasting insulin concentrations are required, then the average of three samples, taken at 5 min intervals, should be used; however, this rarely is done in clinical practice.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^330ee833]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SAS with SI and RIA calculators (version 2.2, 30 June 2004;) for HOMA estimates. HOMA version 2 was recalibrated to give HOMA-β and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) of 100% in normal young adults when assays available then were used for insulin, specific insulin, or C-peptide. In this study, the SI calculator was used for 10 assays quoted as specific for insulin and the RIA calculator was used for one assay stated to cross-react with proinsulin. As HOMA is based on steady-state physiology, the model includes limits for glucose. Values outside these limits, 3–25 mmol/l for both calculators (30 June 2004;), are considered non–steady state and HOMA is considered to be inappropriate. Input limits for insulin for the SI calculator are 20–300 pmol/l and for RIA calculator are 20–400 pmol/l. For Table 2, insulin values outside these ranges were set to the values of the appropriate limit. Corresponding results for HOMA estimates when these results are excluded are found in supplemental Table 1 (available in an online appendix at). Median score tests, i.e. median one-way nonparametric ANOVA, were used in Table 2 to test the significance of differences in a HOMA estimate derived from different insulin assays in serum for a particular glycemic state.

### Associations of the HOMA2-% B and HOMA2-IR with progression to diabetes and glycaemic deterioration in young and middle-aged Chinese [^861736ea]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several methods for assessing beta‐cell function and insulin sensitivity. The original Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) model proposed in 1985 was based on a mathematical feedback model first proposed in 1979. It is an estimate of beta‐cell function (%B) and insulin sensitivity (%S) during steady state calculated from fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin levels. The original HOMA model correlates with estimations derived from clamp studies and can be used as surrogates in epidemiological studies and clinical practice. In 1998, the updated HOMA model (HOMA2) was published to adjust for variations due to hepatic and peripheral glucose sensitivity, plasma glucose–insulin relationship for plasma glucose values above 180 mg/dl and plasma pro‐insulin levels. HOMA2 had been recalibrated to a normal population to set the reference value. They can be calculated using fasting C‐peptide (CP) levels instead of insulin, and had been shown to perform better than the original HOMA model in assessing IR or beta‐cell function as well as predicting progression to T2D.

In the late 1990s, we established multiple cohorts to ascertain the natural progression to T2D in Chinese in whom stored samples were available for the measurement of plasma CP levels. We selected subcohorts of young and middle‐aged Chinese to explore the associations of ID and IR estimated by HOMA2 with (1) progression to T2D in participants without T2D from a community‐based cohort; (2) glycaemic deterioration in patients with T2D from a clinic‐based cohort.

Results

The characteristics of all participants are presented in table 1. Fifteen subjects had a high-risk AC genotype, 1 non-DM subject had a high-risk CC genotype, and 47 had a low-risk AA genotype. The high-risk group exhibited significantly lower HOMA-beta values than the low-risk group (p < 0.05). However, differences in other parameters such as BMI, fasting glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and GDR were insignificant.

The characteristics of T2DM subjects are represented in table 2. Among the T2DM subjects, 8 were in the high-risk group and 22 in the low-risk group. Patients in the high-risk group had significantly lower HOMA-beta than those in the low-risk group (p < 0.05), but differences in BMI, fasting glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and GDR were insignificant. Furthermore, the high-risk group exhibited significantly higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol than the low-risk group (p < 0.05). The insulinogenic index tended to be comparatively lower in the high-risk group than that in the low-risk group, but the difference was statistically insignificant.

### Associations of the HOMA2-% B and HOMA2-IR with progression to diabetes and glycaemic deterioration in young and middle-aged Chinese [^971b26b2]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Homeostasis model assessment had been widely used to predict risks of T2D and metabolic syndrome, albeit similar data are sparse for the updated HOMA2 and in Chinese young adults. Compared with the original HOMA model, HOMA2 had better performance in predicting incident T2D.C peptide is produced in the same amount as insulin and considered a good measure of endogenous insulin secretion even in insulin‐treated patients. In a prospective population‐based cohort in Korea including 104,694 individuals with age distribution (38.9 ± 7.4 years in NGT and prediabetes) similar to our cohorts, researchers used the same criteria to define diabetes and reported that both HOMA2‐IR and HOMA2‐%B predicted incident T2D. While different study design and assays do not allow direct comparisons, Korean participantsappeared to have higher HOMA2‐IR than our Chinese participants (1.27 ± 0.45 vs. 0.87 ± 0.35 in NGT, 1.46 ± 0.55 vs. 1.08 ± 0.43 in prediabetes) with similar trends for HOMA2‐%B (100.09 ± 35.51 vs. 94.11 ± 28.4 in NGT, 93.14 ± 31.67 vs. 85.14 ± 28.67 in prediabetes) and TG (1.30 ± 0.83 vs. 1.23 ± 0.85 in NGT, 1.59 ± 1.04 vs. 1.39 ± 0.98 in prediabetes) (Table S1). These differences might be attributable to ecological, environmental, lifestyle and other factors which can modulate phenotypes and disease trajectories.

In our study, HOMA2‐IR predicted incident T2D independent of baseline glycaemic status (NGT, prediabetes) and 1 h PG. This finding is similar to other reports from Iranian (aged 20–86 years, using HOMA2) and Chinese (aged above 40, using HOMA1) cohorts, supporting the important role of IR mediated by obesity and glucolipotoxicity in progression to T2D in both young and older Chinese people. Given the lower beta‐cell capacity in Asians compared with Caucasians, the coexistence of IR might accelerate the loss of beta‐cell dysfunction leading to T2D. Besides, dyslipidaemia characterised by low HDL‐C was reported to increase T2D risk through promoting beta‐cell dysfunction. Identifying individuals with beta‐cell dysfunction for optimising control of glucose, lipid and body weight may retard the progression to T2D.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^74918d17]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated how beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity or resistance are affected by the type of blood sample collected or choice of insulin assay and homeostatis model assessment (HOMA) calculator (http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk).

Research Design and Methods

Insulin was measured using 11 different assays in serum and 1 assay in heparinized plasma. Fasting subjects with normoglycemia (n = 12), pre-diabetes, i.e., impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 18), or type 2 diabetes (n = 67) were recruited. Patients treated with insulin or those who were insulin antibody-positive were excluded. HOMA estimates were calculated using specific insulin (SI) or radioimmunoassay (RIA) calculators (version 2.2).

Results

All glucose values were within model (HOMA) limits but not all insulin results, as 4.3% were < 20 pmol/l and 1% were > 300 pmol/l. beta-Cell function derived from different insulin assays ranged from 67 to 122% (median) for those with normoglycemia (P = 0.026), from 89 to 138% for those with pre-diabetes (P = 0.990), and from 50 to 81% for those with type 2 diabetes (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, insulin resistance ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 (P = 0.0007), from 1.9 to 3.2 (P = 0.842), and from 1.5 to 2.9 (P < 0.0001), respectively. This twofold variation in HOMA estimates from the various insulin assays studied in serum may be significant metabolically. Insulin was 15% lower in heparinized plasma (used in the original HOMA study) compared with serum, which is now more commonly used. beta-Cell function differed by 11% and insulin resistance by 15% when estimates derived from specific insulin were calculated using the RIA rather than the SI calculator.

Conclusions

To enable comparison of HOMA estimates among individuals and different research studies, preanalytical factors and calculator selection should be standardized with insulin assays traceable to an insulin reference method procedure.

### Gastric bypass surgery reveals independency of obesity and diabetes melitus type 2 [^070728fb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

A similar pattern was observed for fasting glucose levels with significant differences between pre- and post-surgery levels and relative changes (8% in the non-diabetic sub-population up to 26% in the DMT2-NDM sub-populations, Additional file 2: Table S2). On average, glucose levels were normalized in the NDM and DMT2-NDM sub-populations, but not in the DMT2-DMT2 sub-population and some subjects did have persistent hyperglycemia post-surgery in all sub-populations. Importantly, the post-surgery level in diabetics did not reach the pre-surgery level of the non-diabetics and not at all the non-diabetic post-surgery level for at least some of the subjects in the diabetic sub-populations.

The HOMA-beta and HOMA-IR indices decreased 53–60% in the NDM sub-populations irrespective of gender (Table 2). No significant changes were seen in the diabetic sub-populations except for HOMA-IR in the male DMT2-NDM sub-population (Additional file 3: Table S3). The trends were however similar for HOMA-IR in all sub-populations with a substantial increase in insulin sensitivity. Importantly, the pre- and post-surgery levels of HOMA-IR were significantly different comparing NDM and DMT2-NDM (Table 2). The NDM and DMT2-NDM sub-population had similar levels of HOMA-beta values and seemed distinctively different from the DMT2-DMT2 sub-population, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. It should be noted that the number of subjects in the DMT2-DMT2 sub-population was low and variances rather high.

### Significance of pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 () genetic polymorphism in insulin secretion in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^e9fa47bc]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

DNA sequencing

A direct sequencing reaction was performed using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit, and the sequencing samples were analyzed using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). Sequencing data were evaluated using the ALF software package (Pharmacia, Tokyo, Japan) and GENETYXMAC software (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical analysis

Data are expressed as mean ± SD. We assessed differences in the mean values of clinical parameters between PDX-1 high-risk and low-risk subjects using the Mann-Whitney U test. We employed a multivariable linear regression model to test the differences in insulin secretion due to difference in PDX-1 genotype by adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). PRISM9 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA) was used for all the analyses. We conducted a power analysis to compare the HOMA-beta between PDX-1 gene high- and low-risk groups using an EZR calculator. We conducted a power analysis of the statistical test used for comparing HOMA-beta between the high- and low-risk groups. The mean HOMA-beta values in the high-risk and low-risk groups were 72.9 ± 54.2 and 107.0 ± 63.1, respectively. Assuming that the difference in the means of HOMA-beta in all subjects was 37.7 and the SD was 29.9, the estimated power was 86%. If the difference in means of HOMA-beta in T2DM subjects was 34.1 and the SD was 8.9, the estimated power was > 99%. Values of p < 0.05 were significant.

### Abnormal insulin metabolism and decreased levels of mindfulness in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^01988c2a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

General information questionnaire

1. General Information Collection.

Within 48 h of admission, general demographic information and anthropometric indicators of the subjects were collected, including age, gender, education level (primary school and below, middle school, university and above), duration of diabetes (< 1 year, 1–5 years, 5–10 years, > 10 years), smoking history, drinking history, and body mass index (BMI).

2. Laboratory Examinations.

In this study, fasting blood specimens were taken from all admitted patients after fasting for at least 8 h to ensure accuracy and consistency of blood biochemical parameters. The laboratory measurements collected in this study included fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and serum C-peptide. The Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and β-cell function (HOMA-β) were calculated using the following formulas based on participants' fasting blood glucose and fasting C-peptide levels:

HOMA-IR = 1.5 + FBG * C-Peptide / 2800.

HOMA-β = (0.27 * C-Peptide) / (FBG − 3.5) + 50.

The study population was divided into four categories based on the median values of HOMA-IR and HOMA-β as cutoff points: low HOMA-IR/high HOMA-β, high HOMA-IR/high HOMA-β, high HOMA-IR/low HOMA-β, and low HOMA-IR/low HOMA-β. Of these, the low HOMA-IR/high HOMA-βgroup was defined as the control group due to its higher insulin sensitivity and relatively preserved β-cell function, reflecting a closer-to-normal metabolic state and thus serving as a baseline for comparison. All study subjects were randomised during hospitalisation according to the criteria of nativity.

### How to transform a metabolic syndrome score into an insulin sensitivity value? [^720f083c]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) predicts cardiovascular risk and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. The presence of a MetS is defined by the clustering of ≥ 3 out of 5 cardiometabolic criteria (hyperglycemia; hypertension; enlarged waist; low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; and hypertriglyceridemia), each of which is connected with insulin resistance. It is not known whether the severity of MetS, ranked from the sextet of scores range [0/5 to 5/5], is linearly related to reduced insulin sensitivity (IS) and/or lesser hyperbolic product across the glycemic spectrum.

Patients and Methods

A total of 839 adults (54 normoglycemic; 785 with abnormal glucose homeostasis, among whom 711 type 2 diabetes mellitus) had insulin sensitivity assessed together with their cardiometabolic phenotype.

Results

There was a significant gradient according to interval-scale MetS score in insulinemia; body mass index; (visceral) fat; hepatic steatosis; and macroangiopathy. There was an inverse linear relationship between increasing MetS scores and decreased insulin sensitivity, allowing to define an insulin resistance-predicting linear equation: IS (%) = [-15.1×MetS score]+109.4 (R(2) = 0.221). For each MetS category, mean IS values did not significantly differ between groups of patients across the glycemic spectrum. The hyperbolic product (β-cell function×IS) and/or its loss rate were inversely related to MetS severity.

Conclusion

Insulin sensitivity is linearly and inversely related to MetS severity across the 6 scores. This novel way to exploit information intrinsic to the MetS criteria provides an easy and low cost means to quantify insulin sensitivity across the glycemic spectrum. Moreover, a higher MetS score is associated with lesser residual insulin secretion, and faster B-cell function loss. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^43206474]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Insulin resistance assessment in overweight/obese youth — screening utility and necessity: Assessment of HOMA-IR in overweight obese children and adolescents may represent an important strategy for improving the efficacy of treatment for weight loss and chronic disease prevention, but measurement of fasting serum insulin or of HOMA-IR is not necessary to establish a need for weight control or weight loss, especially because cost limits broad use in insulin resistance screening.

### Thyroid function is associated with components of the metabolic syndrome in euthyroid subjects [^cd0d41f9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid disease and the metabolic syndrome are both associated with cardiovascular disease.

Objective

The aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that thyroid function, in euthyroid subjects, is associated with components of the metabolic syndrome, including serum lipid concentrations and insulin resistance.

Methods

A total of 2703 adult inhabitants of a middle-sized city in The Netherlands participated in this cross-sectional study. Subjects who were not euthyroid were excluded, as were subjects taking thyroid medication, medication for diabetes, and subjects for whom medication data were not available (n = 1122). Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (mU*mmol/liter2) was calculated as fasting insulin (mU/liter) times fasting glucose (mmol/liter) divided by 22.5. The metabolic syndrome was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.

Results

After adjustment for age and sex, free T4 (FT4) was significantly associated with total cholesterol [standardized beta (beta) = -0.059; P = 0.014], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = -0.068; P = 0.004), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 0.100; P < 0.001), and triglycerides (beta = -0.102; P < 0.001). Both FT4 and TSH were significantly associated with HOMA-IR (beta = -0.133; P < 0.001 and beta = 0.055; P = 0.024, respectively). Median HOMA-IR increased from 1.42 in the highest tertile of FT4 to 1.66 in the lowest tertile of FT4. FT4 was significantly related to four of five components of the metabolic syndrome (abdominal obesity, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure), independent of insulin resistance.

Conclusions

We have demonstrated an association between FT4 levels within the normal reference range and lipids, in accordance with the earlier observed association between (sub)clinical hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. Moreover, low normal FT4 levels were significantly associated with increased insulin resistance. These findings are consistent with an increased cardiovascular risk in subjects with low normal thyroid function.

### Functional assessment of pancreatic β-cell area in humans [^3e6ba093]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Given this technical inability to monitor changes in β-cell mass in humans, functional tests of insulin secretion may provide a feasible alternative. However, to be useful for clinical purposes, such a test would need to 1) be sufficiently practicable to allow for the repeated examination of large patient numbers and 2) predict β-cell mass with high accuracy.

The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) has commonly been applied to detect disturbances in glucose homoeostasis in patients at risk of or with overt diabetes, and different indexes of insulin secretion have been derived from the OGTT. An even less complicated assessment of β-cell function may be derived from indexes based on fasting glucose and insulin measurements, such as the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. However, because of the lack of accessibility of the human pancreas for routine biopsy sampling, the accuracy of these indexes for the prediction of β-cell mass has not yet been determined in humans. This question is of great clinical relevance for the design and interpretation of future clinical trials about the natural course of β-cell loss in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the impact of various treatments on β-cell mass and turnover, and the time course of β-cell loss after pancreas or islet transplantation. Therefore, we examined patients with an oral glucose load before they underwent pancreatic surgery. Different measures of insulin secretion were determined and related to the fractional β-cell area in the pancreatic tissue that was collected at surgery. By these means, we addressed the following questions: 1) Does pancreatic β-cell area predict glycemic control in humans? 2) Do established indexes of β-cell function predict pancreatic β-cell area in humans? and 3) Which measure of insulin secretion and glucose control derived from a prolonged OGTT shows the closest association with β-cell area?

### Metabolic characteristics of individuals at a high risk of type 2 diabetes-a comparative cross-sectional study [^3d564ef2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Two hundred subjects were FDR and 73 were non-FDR. In the FDR group, 170 individuals displayed NGT, 29 had IGT, 6 had IFG (of which 3 also had IGT) and 1 individual fulfilled the T2D criteria. Among the non-FDR, 70 were NGT, 2 individuals had IGT and 1 had IFG.

Crude characteristics

Clinical, anthropometric and biochemical characteristics of the complete and unmatched two groups are displayed in Table 1. The FDR were significantly older, displayed stronger heredity for CHD, and had lower BMI and weight, but still similar WHR supporting an increased predisposition for an abdominal adipose tissue profile. They also displayed higher plasma glucose concentrations during the OGTT, including AUC, however at equal insulin concentrations, as well as higher serum HDL and lower LDL. There were non-significant differences in insulin sensitivity (p -values < 0.1), while measurements of insulin secretion showed that the FDR had lower HOMA-β, higher IGI and DI were not statistically significantly different.

### Insulin resistance in chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^720b11b6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is associated with insulin resistance (IR), and both host and viral factors are important in its development. The association and the predictors of IR in chronic hepatitis B virus (CHBV) infection remain unclear.

Methods

A total of 69 CHBV-infected subjects were examined to study the relationship between histological findings and anthropometric and biochemical data, including IR determined by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). To assess the influence of CHBV infection on IR independent of any effect of hepatic fibrosis, overweight, or sex we also compared fasting serum insulin, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta (measure of beta-cell function) and C-peptide-insulin ratio (to distinguish impaired insulin degradation (low ratio) from insulin hypersecretion (normal ratio)) levels between the subset of 14 male normal weight (body mass index, BMI < 23) CHBV patients with stage 0 or 1 hepatic fibrosis and 50 male normal weight healthy controls matched by age and anthropometry (BMI and waist circumference).

Results

A total of 31 (44.9%) CHBV-infected patients were overweight (BMI > 23 kg/m(2)) and 18 (26.1%) were obese (BMI > 25 kg/m(2)). IR was seen in 34 (49.3%) patients. BMI (Spearman's coefficient = -0.436; P < 0.001) and serum triglyceride levels (Spearman's coefficient = -0.307; P = 0.010) were univariate predictors of IR. In multiple linear regression analysis, only BMI (P < 0.001) was an independent predictor of HOMA-IR. The subgroup of CHBV-infected patients and the controls had comparable levels of all markers of IR, including fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR.

Conclusions

IR in CHBV-infected patients is a reflection of the host metabolic profile and CHBV infection is not in itself correlated with IR.

### Metabolic syndrome and liver histology in paediatric non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^9a3d3d76]. International Journal of Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Our aim was to estimate prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS), obesity and comorbidities in a cohort of 120 children (3–18 years) with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to evaluate correlations between clinical or biochemical variables and liver histology.

Research Methods and Procedures

MS was diagnosed according to the adapted National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI); and ISI composite, insulin secretion (insulin response at 30 min after a glucose load; HOMA-beta cell; insulinogenic index) were all estimated. BMI z-score and total body fat (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were evaluated as indexes of obesity.

Results

MS was diagnosed in 66% of children. About 92% had weight above the 85th percentile, of which 42% were obese with weight above 97th percentile. Prevalence of hypertriglyceridaemia was 63%, low HDL cholesterol 45%, hypertension 40% and impaired glucose tolerance 10%. Levels of aminotransferases were higher as the number of comorbidities increased, the highest values being found in subjects with MS (P ≤ 0.05). Prevalence of a grade of steatosis ≥ 2 (P = 0.05) and fibrosis (P ≤ 0.01) was higher in subjects with MS. Histology was associated significantly with higher values of a number of clinical and biochemical parameters (steatosis ≥ 2 with BMI z-score (P = 0.04), fasting insulin (P = 0.02), HOMA-IR (P = 0.03), beta-cell secretion (P = 0.04); necroinflammation with BMI z-score (P = 0.007), glucose (P ≤ 0.0001), cholesterol (P ≤ 0.04) and white blood cells (P = 0.025); fibrosis with body weight (P = 0.05), BMI z-score (P = 0.03), cholesterol (P = 0.05), triglycerides (P = 0.05), fasting insulin (P ≤ 0.0001) and mean values of the hormone at the OGTT (P = 0.03), HOMA-IR (P ≤ 0.0001)).

Conclusion

Presence of MS or clinical and biochemical variables associated with the syndrome seems to be strictly related to histological features of NASH in paediatric fatty liver disease. Thus, routinely liver biopsy should be encouraged in these children.

### Surrogate measures of first-phase insulin secretion versus reference methods intravenous glucose tolerance test and hyperglycemic clamp: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^f6fdbe24]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

The most frequently used surrogate measures of insulin secretion are based on the OGTT, which is performed after an overnight fast. Subjects are given an oral load of 75 mg glucose, which triggers insulin secretion. Plasma insulin or C-peptide and glucose levels are measured at baseline and repeatedly for at least 120 min.

HOMA-beta is based on a fasting blood sample and assesses insulin secretion by calculating the ratio of insulin concentration to glucose concentration minus 3.5 mmol/L.

Although there are numerous surrogate indices for the first phase of insulin secretion, no systematic review has summarized the validation studies of surrogate indices. This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of surrogate measures by assessing the correlation between first-phase insulin secretion calculated using surrogate methods and the reference methods IVGTT and HGC. This was undertaken to help researchers decide which surrogate measure to use for larger studies.

### The yield of early-pregnancy homeostasis of model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) for predicting gestational diabetes mellitus in different body mass index and age groups [^9746f2b1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

The differences in the reported predictive values of HOMA-IR can be attributed to various baseline risks of participants in different studies and the heterogeneous nature of GDM. Generally, pregnant women with GDM are considered similar; however, substantial heterogeneity has been found between these women. Generally, insulin resistance and inadequate beta-cell response in late pregnancy have been considered as the main pathophysiological mechanisms of GDM. Nevertheless, some differences between lean and obese patients with GDM have been reported in small studies since decades ago. In Cheney et al.'s study, insulin and glucose responses to meals were compared in lean and obese women with GDM. The fasting and post-meal insulin levels in obese and lean (BMI < normal) women with GDM were higher and lower than those of the control group (normal BMI), respectively. The authors concluded that GDM is a heterogeneous abnormality in which the main mechanisms in lean and obese GDM women are insulin deficiency and insulin resistance, respectively.

The impact of BMI on the association between insulin resistance and GDM occurrence has been re-considered recently. In Inoue et al.'s study, different indexes of insulin secretion and resistance were evaluated in lean pregnant women with GDM (BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2) and compared to the control group without GDM and a similar BMI. The insulinogenic and composite insulin sensitivity indexes were lower in the GDM group, while no difference in HOMA-IR and HOMA-β was found between GDM and non-GDM groups. The authors concluded that β-cell dysfunction is the main pathophysiologic mechanism of GDM in extremely lean Japanese women.

In the study by Furukawa et al. women with GDM were divided into two groups with and without insulin resistance using the HOMA-IR index. Among the GDM women, the frequencies of insulin-resistant and non-insulin-resistant women were 64% and 36%, respectively. The insulin-resistant group had a higher BMI compared to the insulin-sensitive one, and HOMA-IR β (as the insulin secretion index) was lower in the insulin-sensitive group.

### Oral glucose tolerance testing at 1 h and 2 h: relationship with glucose and cardiometabolic parameters and agreement for pre-diabetes diagnosis in patients with morbid obesity [^88db5a42]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Routine laboratory tests

In addition to clinical parameters, data on HbA1c, serum insulin, creatinine, transaminases, as well on lipid profile [triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)], were also taken from the hospital clinical files. Values of HOMA-IR [(fasting serum glucose, mg/dL) × (fasting serum insulin, µU/mL)/405] were used as a measure of insulin resistance (IR) and values of HOMA-β [20 × fasting serum insulin, µU/mL)]/[(fasting serum glucose, mmol/L)–3.5)] were used as a measure of β-cell function. The OGTT was performed using a standardised protocol and blood samples were drawn at both in fasting and after 1 h and 2 h of 75-g OGTT regarding glucose and C-peptide, after overnight fasting. As part of the OGTT, based on insulin and glucose levels at the beginning and after 30 min, the insulinogenic index, as the ratio between the difference between insulin at 30 min and the begging and the difference between glucose at 30 min and at the beginning was calculated to evaluate the insulin response.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were described as mean and standard deviation (SD), or as median and interquartile range (IQR), and were compared using Student's T-test or the Mann–Whitney test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarised as counts and proportions. The Cohen's Kappa coefficient was computed to evaluate the agreement between the two measures of pre-T2DM diagnosis — 1hPG and 2hPG (primary endpoint). For the secondary objective, correlations between continuous variables (the relationship of 1hPG and 2hPG with parameters of glucose metabolism and cardio-metabolic risk) were carried out using the Pearson (r) correlation coefficient or the Spearman (ρ) correlation coefficient, as appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). A significance level of 5% was considered.

### Biomarkers of glucose-insulin homeostasis and incident type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: results from the vitamin D and omega-3 trial [^64eac67f]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the US and globally. Insulin resistance is an important underlying mechanism for these conditions. However, assessing insulin resistance using the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp is time- and labor-intensive, has not become adopted in routine clinical practice, and is not recommended for the diagnosis and management of T2D. Prior studies demonstrated that single markers of insulin resistance, such as Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), predict risks of T2D and CVD, independently of glycemic markers such as fasting glucose or HbA1c. In addition to insulin measures, C-peptide, a polypeptide produced from the cleavage of proinsulin into biologically active insulin, may also relate to cardiometabolic outcomes. C-peptide levels may better reflect long-term insulin secretion and beta cell function, due to its greater serological stability as a result of minimal hepatic metabolism and constant rate of renal clearance. A recent study suggests that a novel insulin resistance score (IRS) that combines insulin and C-peptide was better able to classify individuals as insulin resistant compared with traditional approaches such as HOMA-IR. Furthermore, assessing simultaneous changes in circulating insulin and C-peptide levels over time may help in identifying individuals who are at elevated cardiometabolic risk due to insulin resistance and provide them with intensive and/or tailored therapies. Existing studies assessing biomarkers of insulin resistance with incident CVD and T2D have been inconsistent, with some showing positive associations whereas others showed no associations, particularly when adjusting for traditional cardiometabolic risk factors. Thus, additional research into the predictive capabilities of these biomarkers, particularly in a contemporary low-risk general population is warranted.

### Expansion of the homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function and insulin resistance to enable clinical trial outcome modeling through the interactive adjustment of physiology and treatment effects: iHOMA2 [^3ca13a72]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the creation of the iHOMA2 model addresses some of the limitations with our previous invariant model. iHOMA2 is an application for extending the range of the existing HOMA2 model and can be used to evaluate therapeutic agents in greater physiological detail and can predict their effects on fasting glucose and insulin and on β-cell function and insulin sensitivity. iHOMA2 can be used for hypothesis testing, for the evaluation of pharmaceutical agents, for the estimation of effect sizes of therapies, and for evaluation of indicative changes to glucose when a combination of agents is used. It can be used in its default mode to generate HOMA2 results directly comparable with those in the literature. The iHOMA2 program is freely available for academic and noncommercial use.

### Critical evaluation of indices used to assess β-cell function [^baaf3b98]. Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

The assessment of β-cell function, defined as the relationship between insulin secretion rate (ISR) and plasma glucose, is not standardized and often involves any of a number of β-cell function indices. We compared β-cell function by using popular indices obtained during basal conditions and after glucose ingestion, including the HOMA-B index, the basal ISR (or plasma insulin)-to-plasma glucose concentration ratio, the insulinogenic and ISRogenic indices, the ISR (or plasma insulin)-to-plasma glucose concentration areas (or incremental areas) under the curve ratio, and the disposition index, which integrates a specific β-cell function index value with an estimate of insulin sensitivity, between lean people with normal fasting glucose (NFG) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n = 50) and four groups of people with obesity (n = 188) with 1) NFG-NGT, 2) NFG and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), 3) impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and IGT, and 4) type 2 diabetes. We also plotted the ISR-plasma glucose relationship before and after glucose ingestion and used a statistical mixed-effects model to evaluate group differences in this relationship (i.e., β-cell function). Index-based group differences in β-cell function produced contradicting results and did not reflect the group differences of the actual observed ISR-glucose relationship or, in the case of the disposition index, group differences in glycemic status. The discrepancy in results is likely due to incorrect mathematical assumptions that are involved in computing indices, which can be overcome by evaluating the relationship between ISR and plasma glucose with an appropriate statistical model. Data obtained with common β-cell function indices should be interpreted cautiously.

### Should insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin secretion (HOMA-β), and visceral fat area be considered for improving the performance of diabetes risk prediction models [^9d7d89a2]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

The characteristics of the study participants at baseline were described as means for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. χ 2 tests for categorical variables or t-tests for continuous variables were used to examine differences in baseline characteristics between individuals with incident diabetes and those who did not develop it.

Person-time was calculated from the date of the baseline examination to the date of first heath examination when diabetes was identified or to the date of the last health checkup, whichever occurred first. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to develop the risk models for diabetes, as in our previous study. We initially conducted a baseline model (model 1) including age, sex, BMI, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and HbA1c. Subsequently, we developed another four models: model 2, predictors in model 1 plus FPG; model 3, predictors in model 1 plus HOMA-IR and HOMA-β; model 4, predictors in model 1 plus FPG, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β; model 5, replaced BMI with VFA in model 2. All models demonstrated a low level of multicollinearity, specifically with a maximum variance inflation factor of around 3.5 for both HOMA-IR and HOMA-β in model 4.

We compared the performance of models 2–5 with model 1 by examining measures of discrimination and calibration. Discrimination is quantified by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for 10-year diabetes risk. In addition, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) were computed to show the improved performance (if any) of models 2–5 compared with model 1. In our study, the events per variable number is approximately 90 (943/11), significantly exceeding the recommended minimum of 10 to prevent overfitting. Therefore, the likelihood of overfitting is low. We further assessed calibration in two ways: visually by plotting the predicted 10-year risk of diabetes versus the observed risk in a calibration plot and performing the Greenwood-Nam-D' Agostino goodness-of fit test.

In sensitivity analyses, we reanalyzed the data after excluding women and participants with less than 1 year of follow-up, analyzed data by obesity status in men, and substituted HOMA-IR and HOMA-β with fasting insulin. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute). A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Clinical phenotyping of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Yemen [^20769420]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Research design and methods

A total of 500 consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed T2D were recruited into the study. Oral antidiabetic drugs were stopped 2 days before the study to avoid the effect of glucose-lowering drugs on fasting plasma glucose and specific insulin levels. Patients on insulin therapy and with type 1 diabetes and secondary diabetes were all excluded. The remaining patients meeting the criteria of T2D were enrolled into the study. To identify subgroups of T2D, we did data-driven cluster classification of all patients by k-mean cluster analysis based on HOMA insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S) and beta-cell function (HOMA2-%β) using the SPSS V.23 statistical package, together with HOMA-insulin resistance (IR) and other six variables, including age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), serum triglycerides (TG) and HbA1c, which were measured in a single clinic visit. For comparative purposes, HOMA modeling was also conducted on 165 healthy control subjects with a fasting plasma glucose ≤ 6.0 mmol/L. All patients were subject to clinical assessment and laboratory investigations. Clinical assessment included detailed history data, anthropometric measures and comprehensive clinical examination. Laboratory investigations included fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) and specific insulin (µIU/L), HbA1c (% [mmol/mol]) and estimated average glucose (eAG, mmol/L), serum creatinine (µmol/L) and creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL/min/1.73 m 2) using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine (CKD-EPI) equation, urine test and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR, mg/g), liver enzymes, fasting serum total, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL) (mmol/L), serum TG (mmol/L), and calculated total to HDL-cholesterol ratio. HOMA2 and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated from paired measured fasting plasma glucose and specific insulin concentrations, and were used in the cluster analysis to identify the clinical phenotypes of T2D. We used the latest software (V.2.2.3) of HOMA2 calculator released online by the Diabetes Trial Unit, Oxford, UK. The computer model was used to yield estimates of both beta-cell function (HOMA2-%β) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S). Hepatic insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated according to Matthews et al 's formula. The QUICKI, as another surrogate index that correlates with HOMA in determining insulin sensitivity in humans, was calculated as mentioned elsewhere.

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^a927bba4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

In general, our observations seem to be in line with data which investigated insulin resistance during pregnancy and its association with insulin therapy and beta cell dysfunction during pregnancy.

It has been demonstrated in several of the presented studies that insulin use during pregnancy is both a parameter of GDM severity and a strong predictor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Our present results suggest that the degree of insulin resistance, as assessed by the HOMA-IR index at the diagnosis of GDM, could be a potential predictor of GDM severity and of the future development of type 2 diabetes, because this parameter is associated with both beta cell dysfunction and insulin therapy.

The importance of insulin resistance for beta cell function in post-GDM has been partly illustrated by the results of the Troglitazone In Prevention Of Diabetes and Pioglitazone in Prevention of Diabetes studies, in which the protection of beta cell function was closely related to the degree of reduction in endogenous insulin requirements.

We acknowledge, that estimation of insulin sensitivity using HOMA-index is less precise than measurement with an insulin clamp, but we consider that HOMA method is more feasible in a large size cohort. Further, we have established, that HOMA would be an accurate measure of total insulin sensitivity thoroughout pregnancy in women with gestational diabetes. Additionally, results of some studies rise the pathophysiologic significance of rather chronic hepatic insulin resistance than the whole-body insulin resistance in declining of beta cell function in GDM women during pregnancy as well as postpartum.

A limitation of our study is the use the fasting state HOMA of beta cell function in population of GDM women. There are no evidences that insulin secretion as assessed by HOMA-B index a surrogate of basal insulin secretion is an adequate or is not adequate measure of beta cell function in GDM women. Taken into consideration the results of last data which suggest the pathophysiologic importance of hepatic insulin resistance in GDM women, the evaluation of basal insulin secretion may be a valuable metabolic parameter in these group of women.

Certain limitation is the lack of information on the dietary habits and the lifestyle prior to the study. Last data revealed, that dietary factors, both before and during pregnancy as well as physical activity are associated with GDM risk.

### Insulin resistance in pediatric obesity: from mechanisms to treatment strategies [^65717f68]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

3.1. Indictors for Predicting Insulin Resistance

Timely evaluation of the insulin secretion function of islets in children with obesity is essential for early intervention to prevent diabetes. The blood insulin-glucose clamp technique has been regarded as the golden standard method for evaluating insulin resistance due to its exceptional accuracy and repeatability; however, its complexity limits its application in measuring large samples. Current instruments employed for assessing insulin resistance in both epidemiological studies and clinical practice include the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA of percentage beta-cell function (HOMA- β), and quantitative insulin sensitivity test index (QUICKI). The triglyceride–glucose index (TyG-index) is commonly employed in large-scale studies or for identifying high-risk populations for diabetes due to its superior sensitivity in predicting insulin resistance, as compared to HOMA-IR. The influence of gender on indicators for predicting insulin resistance, particularly during mid-adolescence, should be acknowledged, as it may be associated with variations in sex hormone levels, development, and body fat distribution. A recent meta-analysis has confirmed that adolescents aged 12–18 years with obesity are more likely to develop insulin resistance, and related indicators such as insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR index were also elevated.

Currently, HOMA-IR serves as a reliable indicator of insulin resistance by providing an estimation based on fasting blood glucose and serum insulin concentration. The HOMA-IR index increases proportionally with the rise in insulin resistance. Furthermore, standardizing the measurement of fasting insulin is imperative to mitigate potential biases. The comparative evaluation values of fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and blood insulin-glucose clamp techniques for assessing insulin resistance have been demonstrated. Pires and colleagues discovered a positive correlation between HOMA-IR and various indicators including BMI, waist–hip ratio, body percentage, body weight, body fat, and visceral fat area. Among them, the waist–hip ratio exhibited the strongest association with HOMA-IR levels, highlighting central obesity as a significant risk factor for insulin resistance. However, there is no definitive cutoff value for HOMA-IR due to geographic and ethnographic differences, a comprehensive study conducted in 2019 involving a large sample of Czech adults identified a specific HOMA-IR cutoff point of 3.63, while Italian children have an established HOMA-IR standard > 4.

### Are HOMA-IR and HOMA-B good predictors for diabetes and pre-diabetes subtypes? [^2e9e9370]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Odds ratios of incidence of diabetes and pre-diabetes for HOMA-IR and HOMA-B

Model (1): crude model, Model (2): Adjusted for gender and age, smoking, level of education, and family history of type 2 diabetes, Model (3a): Adjusted for model 2 in addition to metabolic syndrome variables including waist circumference, blood pressure, triglyceride, and HDL, as binary variables, model (3b): Adjusted for model 2 in addition to metabolic syndrome variables including waist circumference, systolic & diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, and HDL as continuous variables

The main missing variable in our dataset was the insulin data (other missing variables were < 5%). The supplementary data represent comparisons between subjects with missing and non-missing data for insulin (Table S 1) and subjects who followed and did not follow (Table S 2). As there were some differences, we also did a sensitivity analysis considering multiple imputations (with the assumption of missing at random, i.e. the missing values depend on the measured variables), and the results changed negligibly (Table S 3).

The area under the HOMA-IR curve (AUC) for pre-diabetes/diabetes was 59% (CI: 57–62%), and the best cut-off point based on Youden's index was 2.22 (with 39% sensitivity and 76% specificity); also, the value for HOMA-B was 51% (CI: 49–54%) (Fig. 3) which was not statistically significant. The AUC of HOMA-IR and HOMA-B for iIFG (58 and 48%, respectively) and iIGT (56 and 52%, respectively) are also shown in Fig. 3, where the results are not meaningfully different from the analysis for the combined outcome.

### Subtypes of gestational diabetes and future risk of pre-diabetes or diabetes [^c9beff67]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

These findings highlight the problem with trying to define a subtype of GDM based on an insulin secretion measure alone. Specifically, whereas low Matsuda index can be interpreted as reflecting insulin resistance, the interpretation of an insulin secretion measure (Stumvoll 1st phase) in isolation is more precarious. Indeed, in two women with different degrees of insulin sensitivity, lower insulin secretion may be an appropriate response in the more insulin-sensitive woman for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Accordingly, the insulin secretory response needs to be evaluated in relation to ambient insulin sensitivity to provide insight into the pathophysiologic process (beta-cell dysfunction) that would reflect a secretory defect. As noted above, all women with GDM have such a defect, as evidenced by the poorer beta-cell compensation in pregnancy in all subtypes when compared to non-GDM, as shown in the current report and in previous studies. Moreover, we further demonstrate that, when secretion is considered in relation to sensitivity (with measures of beta-cell compensation such as ISSI-2 and IGI/HOMA-IR), it becomes apparent that beta-cell function does not differ between GDM subtypes. This similar degree of beta-cell dysfunction between the subtypes is the basis of their comparable glycemia and glucose tolerance at both 3-months and 12-months postpartum. Similarly, in an earlier study in which GDM subtypes were defined based only on Matsuda index and 83% of participants completed an OGTT at 6–16 weeks after delivery, the resultant insulin sensitivity subtypes of GDM did not differ in their postpartum glucose tolerance. Thus, while their insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion exist along spectra, women comprising GDM subtypes ultimately share similar underlying beta-cell dysfunction and hence similar future risks of pre-diabetes/diabetes.

### Stress-induced hemodynamic responses are associated with insulin resistance in mild hypertensives [^8cdb750e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

High blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure (PP) are recognized as independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, whereas insulin resistance (IR) is often associated with hypertension. The purpose of the study was to verify whether PP, taken at the doctor's office and during laboratory stimuli, might be predictive of IR.

Methods

Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA) was calculated in 75 grade 1 hypertensives (148 ± 2/92 ± 1 mm Hg). Then, patients underwent hemodynamic reactivity study, induced by color word stroop, cold pressor, and handgrip tests. Stress response was calculated as total area (value x time) - baseline area (baseline value x time).

Results

Patients with similar age, history of hypertension, blood lipids and office blood pressure, but different HOMA (IR-low: 36.3 ± 1.7 v IR-medium: 62.6 ± 1.6, P < .001; IR-high: 123.1 ± 12.8, P < .001 v IR-low and IR-medium), were divided in tertiles. They demonstrated a significant reactivity of systolic BP (IR-low: 225 ± 58 v IR-medium: 448 ± 43, P < .01; IR-high: 625 ± 55, P < .001 v IR-low and P < .01 v IR-medium), PP (IR-low: -8 ± 19 v IR-medium: 83 ± 13, P < .001; IR-high: 201 ± 19, P < .001 v IR-low and IR-medium), and stroke volume (SV) (IR-low: -138 ± 43 v IR-medium: 1 ± 27, P < .01; IR-high: 28 ± 24, P < .001 v IR-low), but similar arterial stiffness (PP/SV) response. Partial correlation between IR and hemodynamic measurements showed a significant association only for systolic BP (0.54, P < .001), PP (0.686, P < .001), and SV (0.384, P < .001) reactivity, but not for office and baseline values. Stepwise multiple regression showed that only PP (beta: 0.634, P < .001) and, among hemodynamic determinants, SV (beta: 0.401, P < .001) response entered into the equation.

Conclusions

The findings demonstrate that increased stress-induced PP, maintained by SV response, is the most predictive hemodynamic variable of reduced insulin sensitivity in mild hypertensives.

### Metabolic characteristics of individuals at a high risk of type 2 diabetes-a comparative cross-sectional study [^3bf21fd1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Differences and similarities in the matched set

Clinical, anthropometric and biochemical characteristics in the matched set, using propensity score, are displayed in Table 2. When comparing the two matched groups of individuals, FDR only had a significantly higher level of heredity for CHD, higher OGTT plasma glucose at 60 and 90 min, as well as AUC, lower serum LDL and higher serum creatinine.

Table 2
Subject characteristics after matching by propensity score

Data are, for categorical variables, given as frequencies (percentage) and for continuous variables as mean (standard deviation). P -values have been obtained as explained in the method section. FDR first-degree relatives, WHR waist-hip ratio, T2D type 2 diabetes, CHD coronary heart disease, HDL high-density lipoprotein, LDL low-density lipoprotein, HOMA-β homeostasis assessment model-beta, IGI insulinogenic index, DI disposition index, M and M/I insulin resistance level, GIR glucose infusion rate

Figure 1 a-d show mean plasma glucose and insulin concentrations during the OGTT in non-FDR and FDR, overall and in the matched set. Elevations in plasma concentration of glucose can be seen throughout the trial, including a larger AUC in the FDR group. AUC for plasma insulin did not differ significantly between groups.

AUC = area under curve. d OGTT plasma insulin response in the matched set (n = 146). OGTT = oral glucose tolerance test. AUC = area under curve

We examined least square means and 95% confidence intervals for IGI, HOMA-β, DI, M, MI and OGTT glucose and insulin, including AUC. Means and confidence intervals were derived from the complete cases, whereas p values were pooled over the 5 imputed data sets. OGTT glucose at 60 and 120 min, as well as AUC glucose were significantly higher, and OGTT insulin at 60 min were significantly higher among FDR (p < 0.05). The other examined variables did not reach statistical significance, however insulin and glucose levels tended to be higher in the FDR group throughout the OGTT. Also, IGI and DI both tended to be lower in the FDR group, indicating impaired β-cell function. These figure have not been included in this publication.

### Association between different levels of dysglycemia and metabolic syndrome in pregnancy [^7f76ab54]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is an association between the worsening of glucose tolerance with an increasing prevalence of MS. The worsening of glucose tolerance was directly associated with age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, lower education levels, lower family income, lower weight and length at birth, lower height and shorter legs in adulthood, higher BMI, larger waist, larger waist-to-hip ratio, higher systolic, and diastolic blood pressure. Laboratory findings of lower HDL cholesterol and higher levels of VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides were also associated with the worsening of glucose tolerance. Many of these features are components of MS. This led us to explore the metabolic nature of mild gestational hyperglycemia and GDM as part of the insulin resistance syndrome.

Using the HOMA2 model to assess beta cell function and peripheral insulin sensitivity, we have found that pregnant women that presented any degree of glucose intolerance also showed higher degree of insulin resistance at screening. Patients that presented mild hyperglycemia (impaired glycemic profile and normal OGTT) showed higher values of HOMA-IR and lower peripheral insulin sensitivity, although not statistically significant, compared with the control group, showing that besides presenting insulin resistance, they also had a compensatory hyperinsulinemia. The GDM group (impaired OGTT and normal glycemic profile) had high HOMA-IR values, which were not also statistically significant; however peripheral insulin sensitivity was significantly decreased, pointing to the presence of some insulin action deficiency. Finally, the overt GDM group (both impaired tests) showed the highest values of HOMA-IR probably due to a decreased insulin peripheral action and impaired β-cell function, what points to the presence of both pathophysiological mechanisms that are present in GDM as well as in DM2: insulin resistance and insulin deficiency (Figure 1).

Our study was limited by the small number of participants; so more research is warranted analyzing more patients.

### Impact of baseline characteristics and β-cell function on the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous once-weekly semaglutide: a patient-level, pooled analysis of the SUSTAIN 1–5 trials [^9afa11b6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Supporting the diabetes duration analyses, pancreatic beta‐cell function (glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion) was assessed using the homeostatic model assessment of beta‐cell function (HOMA‐B), 15, 16 including pooled data from SUSTAIN 1‐3 only (HOMA‐B cannot be applied in subjects taking exogenous insulin, as in SUSTAIN 4 [insulin glargine comparator] and 5 [add‐on to basal insulin]). 16 No specific thresholds for beta‐cell function were used and subjects were categorized into HOMA‐B tertiles: low (≤ 27.21%), intermediate (> 27.21% to 51.71%) and high (> 51.71%) endogenous beta‐cell function.

For background antidiabetes medication analyses, subjects were divided into subgroups (no background medication, metformin monotherapy, other OADs and basal insulin ± metformin). There were differences in background medications across trials: semaglutide was assessed in drug‐naïve subjects (SUSTAIN 1); as add‐on to existing stable background antidiabetes treatments (metformin, thiazolidinedione or both [SUSTAIN 2]; maximum two of metformin, thiazolidinedione and/or sulphonylurea [SUSTAIN 3]; metformin ± sulphonylurea [SUSTAIN 4]); and as add‐on to basal insulin ± metformin (SUSTAIN 5). Pooled SUSTAIN 2‐4 data were used for the metformin monotherapy and other OADs subgroups; data by trial were used for no background medication (SUSTAIN 1) and for basal insulin ± metformin (SUSTAIN 5).

### Glucose metabolism in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with a founder effect and a high diabetes prevalence: a cross-sectional study [^e9cd98dc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the p [Tyr400_Phe402del] LDLR mutation was not a determinant of the high prevalence of T2DM in these patients, it also did not serve as a protective factor against T2DM or other glucose metabolism disorders observed in this population. In participants without previously known T2DM, insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell secretory capacity were evaluated. While the euglycemic clamp technique is considered the gold standard for assessing insulin resistance, we used HOMA-IR, HOMA-Beta, the QUICKI index, the OGIS index, and the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, which are more suitable for epidemiological studies.

Among HeFH-GC patients without T2DM, HOMA-Beta was significantly greater than that of non-HeFH participants. Basal insulin and HOMA-IR showed a trend toward higher values, although these differences were not statistically significant. This pattern suggests increased insulin resistance in HeFH-GC patients, accompanied by a compensatory increase in insulin secretion, potentially identifying those at higher risk of developing T2DM.

Interestingly, when individuals with pre-DM were excluded — leaving only normoglycemic participants presumed to have normal carbohydrate metabolism — insulin levels (fasting and at 30 min), HOMA-IR, and HOMA-Beta were significantly higher in HeFH-GC participants, whereas the QUICKI index was lower, reaching statistical significance in all cases.

After the OGTT, nearly 50% of HeFH-GC patients without T2DM exhibited altered fasting glucose levels, and 30% showed OGTT-defined glucose intolerance, a prevalence similar to that observed in non-HeFH individuals. These findings suggest a strong genetic or environmental predisposition to diabetes within these families.

A comparison of glucose metabolism test results between HeFH-GC patients and an Italian cohort carrying different LDLR mutations suggested that different FH mutations do not influence insulin secretion, as assessed by HOMA-Beta. This finding does not support the hypothesis that LDL cellular uptake plays a role in pancreatic beta-cell function.

### Impaired compensatory hyperinsulinemia among nonobese type 2 diabetes patients: a cross-sectional study [^7d4584ab]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Obesity associated prolonged hyperinsulinemia followed by β-cell failure is well established as the pathology behind type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, studies on nonobese T2DM have reported it to be a distinct clinical entity with predominant insulin secretory defect. We, therefore, hypothesized that compensatory hyperinsulinemia in response to weight gain is impaired in nonobese subjects.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study from a community-based metabolic health screening program. Adiposity parameters including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), body fat percentage, plasma leptin concentration and metabolic parameters namely fasting insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured in 650 individuals (73% healthy, 62% nonobese with a BMI < 25).

Results

In contrast to obese T2DM, nonobese T2DM patients did not exhibit significant hyperinsulinemia compared with the nonobese healthy group. Age, sex, and fasting glucose adjusted insulin levels, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and HOMA-beta cell function (HOMA-B) were increased in obese T2DM compared with nonobese T2DM. Although adiposity parameters showed strong correlation with fasting insulin in obese healthy (r = 0.38, 0.38, and 0.42, respectively; all p values < 0.001) and T2DM (r = 0.54, 0.54, and 0.66, respectively; all p < 0.001), only BMI and leptin showed a weak correlation with insulin in the nonobese healthy group (0.13 and 0.13, respectively; all p < 0.05) which were completely lost in the nonobese T2DM.

Conclusions

Compensatory hyperinsulinemia in response to weight gain is impaired in the nonobese population making insulin secretory defect rather than IR the major pathology behind nonobese T2DM.

### Relationships between human serum resistin, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance [^86a399ef]. International Journal of Obesity (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Data on the association of resistin levels with markers of insulin resistance are highly contrasting in humans and very few studies about its role in inflammation are available. This study investigates associations between serum resistin levels and markers of insulin resistance, inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP)) and of oxidative stress (nytrotirosine (NT)).

Subjects

A randomly collected sample of 300 men from a population-based cohort was analysed, separated into two groups according to body mass index (BMI) and waist values.

Results

Correlations between resistin and BMI, waist, triglyceride, uric acid, fasting glucose, insulin and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) values were significant in subjects with normal BMI, but not in overweight/obese subjects. In a multiple regression model, after multiple adjustments and exclusion of diabetic patients, only fasting glucose remained significantly associated with resistin levels. Otherwise, resistin is associated to CRP levels in all individuals, after multiple adjustments and exclusion of diabetic patients (in normal BMI beta = 0.82; 95% CI 0.21, 1.42; in overweight/obese beta = 0.43; 95% CI 0.10, 0.76). In the same model, resistin values are negatively related to NT levels in normal weight individuals (beta = -1.61; 95% CI -0.77–2.45).

Conclusions

Serum resistin is weakly associated with metabolic abnormalities in subjects with normal BMI, while in overweight/obese patients this correlation is not significant, perhaps due to the higher fat content in these subjects. Serum resistin is directly correlated with CRP and inversely to NT. An intriguing hypothesis, which needs to be tested, is that resistin is secreted in response to a chronic low-grade inflammation, and has antioxidant properties.

### The reproducibility and reliability of insulin sensitivity and secretion indices in children and adolescents [^5ec8d693]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

With the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity, there has been a rise in obesity-related prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The incidence of pediatric T2D has increased by 7.1% annually between 2001 and 2012, and the prevalence of prediabetes has increased from 11.6% in 1999–2002 to 28.2% in 2015–2018. The early stages of developing prediabetes are defined by alterations in pancreatic beta-cell secretion of insulin and reduced insulin sensitivity at the cellular level. Reduced insulin sensitivity has been shown to confer a risk to developing prediabetes in the pediatric population. Given the increased prevalence of pediatric prediabetes and the more aggressive natural history of T2D in pediatrics compared with adults, it is necessary to identify children at risk of developing prediabetes prior to disease onset. Thus, it is important to identify effective and precise screening tools for prediabetes in the pediatric population.

The gold standard tests for insulin sensitivity and secretion evaluation are the hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp (HEC) and hyperglycemic clamp, respectively. These are valuable research tools but are clinically impractical because they are too burdensome and invasive for standard measurement. As a result, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion indices derived from fasting measures or oral glucose tolerance tests have been developed and validated in pediatrics as surrogate markers. OGTT-derived indices represent the efficiency of total body glucose utilization, taking into account both hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivities. In contrast, indices that only use fasting measures are more reflective of hepatic insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity indices include the Matsuda index, the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), and the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Insulin secretion indices include the insulinogenic index, disposition index, and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta Cell Function (HOMA-beta).

### Update on insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes [^1f14ffd1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Insulin Deficiency in the Pathogenesis of T2DM

T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic β-cell function at diagnosis and progressive β-cell dysfunction over time. Genes identified as predisposing to diabetes predominantly diminish basal or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion or β-cell mass. Glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, increased islet amyloid polypeptide accumulation, and excessive inflammatory cytokines have been identified as likely pathogenic mechanisms leading to β-cell failure in T2DM. Collectively, these cause decreased first-phase and, later, second-phase insulin secretion, accelerated β-cell apoptosis, and reduced β-cell mass. The UKPDS found an approximate 50% reduction in estimated β-cell function at diagnosis, based on homeostatic model assessment-B calculations, and a progressive decline in insulin secretion over the next 6 yr. A decline in β-cell function was seen, irrespective of the antihyperglycemic agents used, and correlated closely with the degree of glycemic deterioration. Antihyperglycemic medication requirements thereby predictably increase with longer duration of T2DM.

### Early postpartum metabolic heterogeneity among women who progressed to type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes: a prospective cohort [^c527ca61]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) poses a significant risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and exhibits heterogeneity. However, understanding the link between different types of post-GDM individuals without diabetes and their progression to T2D is crucial to advance personalised medicine approaches.

Materials and Methods

We employed a discovery-based unsupervised machine learning clustering method to generate clustering models for analysing metabolomics, clinical, and biochemical datasets. For this analysis, we selected 225 women who later developed T2D during the 12-year follow-up period from the cohort of 1010 women who returned to a non-diabetic state at 6–9 weeks (study baseline) after a GDM pregnancy based on 2-h 75 g research OGTTs. The optimal model was selected by assessing Bayesian Information Criterion values, class separation performance, and the potential for clinically distinguishable clusters, accounting for participant prenatal and early postpartum characteristics.

Results

The selected model comprises three clusters: pancreatic beta cell dysfunction (cluster-β: median HOMA-B 161.3 and median HOMA-IR 3.8), insulin-resistance (cluster-IR: median HOMA-B 630.5 and median HOMA-IR 16.8), and a mixed cluster (cluster-mixed: median HOMA-B 307.2 and median HOMA-IR 8.6). These clusters are distinguishable based on postpartum blood test parameters such as glucose tolerance, HOMA indices, and fasting lipid profiles including triglycerides, leptin, HDL-c, and adiponectin, as well as participant age and BMI. Metabolomic analysis identified unique molecular signatures for each cluster. However, the time to T2D onset was not statistically significant among the three clusters (p = 0.22).

Conclusion

This study enhances our understanding of the heterogeneity of early postpartum metabolic profiles that characterise the future onset of T2D diabetes in a diverse cohort of women with GDM, revealing insights into distinct mechanisms and personalised intervention strategies for the prevention of T2D.

### Hepatic insulin clearance is increased in patients with high HbA1c type 2 diabetes: a preliminary report [^87370724]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic insulin clearance (HIC) is an important pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. HIC was reported to decrease in patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, hyperglycemia was suggested to enhance HIC, and it is not known whether poorly controlled diabetes increases HIC in patients with type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether HIC was increased in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, and whether HIC was associated with insulin resistance and incretins.

Research Design and Methods

We performed a meal tolerance test and the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in 21 patients with type 2 diabetes. We calculated the postprandial C-peptide area under the curve (AUC)-to-insulin AUC ratio as the HIC; measured fasting and postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon levels and analyzed serum adiponectin and zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8) gene polymorphism.

Results

The HIC significantly correlated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (r_S = 0.58, p < 0.01). In patients with high HIC above the median of 6.5, the mean HbA1c was significantly higher compared with low HIC below the median. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-beta (r_S = -0.77, p < 0.01) and HOMA-IR (r_S = -0.66, p < 0.005) were correlated with HIC. The M/I value in the clamp study was correlated with HIC. GLP-1-AUC and GIP-AUC were not correlated with HIC. Glucagon-AUC was negatively correlated with HIC, but there were no significant differences between the high and low HIC groups. Adiponectin was positively correlated with HIC. The ZnT8 gene polymorphism did not affect HIC.

Conclusions

These results suggest that HIC was increased in patients with high HbA1c type 2 diabetes, low insulin secretion, low insulin resistance and high adiponectin conditions.

### Assessment of β-cell function in young patients with type 2 diabetes: arginine-stimulated insulin secretion may reflect β-cell reserve [^11260797]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Simple methods for the evaluation of dynamic b-cell function in epidemiological and clinical studies of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamic beta-cell function in young patients with T2D with different disease durations and treatments.

Methods

Overall, 54 subjects with T2D from the Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden (DISS) and 23 healthy control participants were included in this cross-sectional study. Beta-cell function was assessed by intravenous (i.v.) administration of arginine followed by i.v. glucose. The acute insulin and C-peptide responses to arginine (AIRarg and Ac-pepRarg, respectively) and to glucose (AIRglu and Ac-pepRglu, respectively)were estimated. Homeostasis model assessment of b-cell function(HOMA-b) andCpeptide assessments were also used for comparisons between patients with T2D and control participants.

Results

AIRarg and Ac-pepRarg, but not AIRglu and Ac-pepRglu, could differentiate between patients with different disease durations. AIRglu values were 89% (P < 0.001) lower and AIRarg values were 29% (P < 0.01) lower in patients with T2D compared with control participants. HOMA-b and fasting plasma C-peptide levels did not differ between the T2D and control groups.

Conclusion

In young patients with T2D, the insulin secretory response to i.v. glucose is markedly attenuated, whereas i.v. arginine-stimulated insulin release is better preserved and can distinguish between patients with different disease duration and antidiabetic therapies. This suggests that the i.v. arginine stimulation test may provide an estimate of functional beta-cell reserve.

### Crosstalk between circulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, adipokines and metabolic syndrome in obese subjects [^bdf0fb51]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

It has been demonstrated that the agonist of PPARγ, rosiglitazone, improves the metabolic profile and changes plasma levels of adipokines. So, it appears may be the increased PPARγ level had beneficial effect on metabolic profiles in animal model of MetS. Current study's findings demonstrated that the obese subjects with higher concentration of PPARγ were more susceptible to categorize in MetS group. We observed that in obese people who had more concentration of PPARγ the risk of MetS was increasing in compare to obese people who had lower concentration of PPARγ. In compare to animal model of MetS, the observed raised concentration of PPARγ may act as compensatory mechanism to affect on adipokines levels and other metabolism profile to improve the some MetS outcomes.

There are evidences that a 50% reduction in content of PPARγ receptor did not result in insulin resistance, as one might predict, but rather led to an increase in insulin sensitivity. As a result, it has been suggested that PPARγ deficiency might prevent or attenuate the insulin resistance associated with obesity and other factors. Therefore, due to relative PPARγ deficiency mitigates some physiological causes of insulin resistance, so make a condition as therapeutic maneuver with aimed to produce the same effect as PPARγ deficiency. Thus, this status could be of clinical value in the treatment of insulin resistance as strongly contributor of obesity and other components of the MetS.

Our results demonstrated no significant differences in HOMA-IR values between groups with low and high level of PPARγ. However, HOMA-IR has been widely used in various studies, but hardly has consensus on the cut-off points for classification of insulin resistance. An existing hesitation is the clinical value of HOMA-IR for application in clinical prediction of metabolic disorders. The major limitation of the use of HOMA-IR index in studies is that the model applies values calculated from lean young adults of Caucasian origin as standard to other subjects. Utilization of values for other population including older adults or obese subjects would probably be different from those documented for previous studies. So, it seems that obese individuals are known to be reasonably more insulin resistant. The ethnicity also considered as a main factor in the etiology of insulin resistance. Previous published results considering cut-off points for HOMA-IR in healthy subjects of our studied community demonstrated values less than observed in current study that likelihood was related to increased insulin resistance in obese individuals. Therefore, the not significant differences in insulin resistance between groups may explain through increased of HOMA-IR value in all of participants and not have defined cut-off points for studied groups.

### Exploring the potential role of C-peptide in type 2 diabetes management [^55e3a23b]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

6.5 Treatment response to metformin

The evidence on the impact of beta cell function on glycaemic response to metformin is weak and shows contradicting results, with study designs varying markedly among the limited number of studies. In a randomised study comparing pioglitazone and metformin as second‐line treatments in addition to sulphonylurea, participants experienced greater HbA1C reduction when beta cell response, assessed using HOMA‐B, was reduced. In contrast, another randomised study observed that individuals with positive stimulated C‐peptide had a better response to the combination of metformin and sulphonylurea. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis performed in another study did not include C‐peptide level as a significant factor for HbA1C reduction when diet‐controlled individuals are treated with a combination of metformin and sitagliptin.

6.6 Treatment response to sulphonylurea

Better beta cell response is associated with better treatment outcomes with sulphonylurea. In the GRADE study, a higher C‐peptide response to glucose was linked to greater initial HbA1C reduction as well as slower HbA1C progression.

6.7 SGLT2i

In theory, C‐peptide may help identify insulin‐treated individuals with severe insulin deficiency or those misclassified as T2D, thus preventing the complication of euglycaemic ketoacidosis due to SGLT2i. However, there is currently no supporting evidence for this and guidelines have not recommended assessing endogenous insulin secretion before starting SGLT2i.

### Phenotypic characterization of nonautoimmune diabetes in adult Ugandans with low body mass index [^e08e881a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the phenotypic characteristics of interest

Relevant information on the demographic (age, sex, and residence) and clinical characteristics (presence of serum and/or urine ketosis on admission, self-reported history of hypertension, and diabetes therapies initiated at the time of diagnosis of diabetes) was collected from all participants. This was followed by resting blood pressure (BP) and anthropometric measurement and the documentation of the systolic and diastolic BP, weight, height, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), BMI, waist:hip circumference ratio (WHR), and waist:height ratio (WHtR). Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) using an OMRON BF511 body composition monitor (Omron ® Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) was used to indirectly assess the total body and visceral fat levels. The BIA method assesses body composition (body fat and muscle mass) based on the resistance to a high-frequency, low-amplitude alternating electric current. Because we lack local or African-specific cut-offs for total body and visceral fat, we used the manufacturer's recommended cut-offs. A total body fat percentage of < 34% and < 22% in the female and male participants, respectively, was considered normal, while participants with visceral fat levels ≤ 9 were considered normal.

A fasting venous blood sample was drawn for the measurement of blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, insulin, C-peptide, serum creatinine [for the estimation of glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology formula], and three islet autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2A, and ZnT8-A). All participants were then subjected to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for measurement of the 30- and 120-min glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations and calculation of the oral insulinogenic index (IGI), as an additional surrogate marker of pancreatic beta-cell secretory function. Insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment 2-insulin resistance, HOMA2-IR) and the pancreatic beta-cell function (homeostatic model assessment 2-beta-cell function, HOMA2-%B), as additional surrogate markers of insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell function, respectively, were calculated using the online homeostatic model assessment-2 (HOMA2) calculator by the Diabetes Trial Unit of the University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

Child obesity — glucose abnormalities and insulin resistance screening considerations note a dearth of prevalence data on nationally representative datasets, particularly for HOMA-IR, and state that the presence of glucose abnormalities among youth with obesity supports the need for screening, but given the wide variability observed across population and clinic-based studies taking into account other risk factors may be important to avoid unnecessary tests.

### Glucose homeostasis and genotype-phenotype interplay in cystic fibrosis patients with CFTR gene deltaF508 mutation [^6b97d542]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine the clinical phenotype of adolescent/adult patients with cystic fibrosis, according to heterozygosity or homozygosity for cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) deltaF508 mutation, and to analyze their characteristics according to glucose tolerance status.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 76 cystic fibrosis patients with CFTR deltaF508 mutation (33 heterozygous and 43 homozygous) stratified according to normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n = 51) or abnormal glucose homeostasis (AGH) (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes; n = 25) had their homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of beta-cell function and of insulin sensitivity and hyperbolic product (beta-cell function x insulin sensitivity [B x S]) measured. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency was inferred from pancreatine requirements. Clinical effects of insulin therapy on weight and lung function were recorded.

Results

AGH was observed in 24 and 40% of heterozygous and homozygous subjects, respectively. AGH patients were older than NGT patients (mean ± SD age 29 ± 10 vs. 23 ± 8 years, P = 0.006), and their beta-cell function was lower (93 ± 49 vs. 125 ± 51%, P = 0.011). Insulin sensitivity values were comparable in NGT and AGH patients. A lower B x S product was observed in AGH, although it was nonsignificant when adjusted for error propagation. Pancreatic insufficiency was observed in 52 and 100% of heterozygous and homozygous patients (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Pre-diabetes and diabetes represent frequent comorbidities in CFTR deltaF508 mutation in the homozygous or heterozygous states. Impairment of insulin secretion, as shown by HOMA, is an important determinant when compared with the magnitude of compensation from insulin sensitivity. Given the high prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance, screening for (pre-)diabetes is mandatory. Insulin supplementation in diabetic subjects with CFTR deltaF508 mutation seems a rational therapy for consideration, although this does not preclude that therapy directed toward insulin resistance could also interact.

### Proinsulin / insulin ratio as a predictor of insulin resistance and B-cell dysfunction in obese Egyptians — — insulin resistance&B-cell dysfunction in obese Egyptians [^36319a86]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Insulin resistance (IR) and β-cell dysfunction are key pathological features of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of proinsulin level and proinsulin/insulin ratio in early prediction of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in obese Egyptian adolescent.

Patients and Methods

This Case control study was conducted from June 2017 to March 2018. Total of 60 patients were divided into 2 groups after exclusion of patients with diabetes: normal body weight group and Obese group. Demographic, clinical data were collected. Laboratory investigation included fasting insulin, proinsulin, and estimation of HOMA IR and HOMA-B were done.

Results

There are highly statistically significant increase in obese group regarding insulin, proinsulin, proinsulin/insulin ratio and HOMA-IR while there is significant decrease in HOMA-B in this group. The best cutoff value of Proinsulin in prediction of beta cell function was ≥ 7.829 pmol/L with sensitivity 95.8, specificity 72.2. The best cutoff value of Proinsulin/insulin ratio in prediction of insulin resistance was ≥ 0.1545 with sensitivity 87.5, specificity 61.1.

Conclusion

both beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance increased in obese group and so increased risk of type 2 diabetes. We found that Pro insulin/insulin ratio is a significant predictor for insulin resistance and Proinsulin is good predictor for beta cell dysfunction.
