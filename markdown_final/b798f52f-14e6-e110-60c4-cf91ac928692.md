## Question

I have patient with serpignous choroiditis who did not respond well to steroid and antimetabolite give im planning to give biological medication is it fine as we know there is an entity of serpignous like choroiditis associated with tb

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is appropriate to escalate to a biologic agent for serpiginous choroiditis that has not responded to steroids and an antimetabolite, and how to handle the concern about tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis before doing so. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing true serpiginous choroiditis from serpiginous-like (tuberculous) choroiditis. Then, I should verify the adequacy of prior therapy and the evidence base for biologics in serpiginous choroiditis. Next, I will review the risks of using TNF-α inhibitors in the context of possible tuberculosis and outline a mandatory TB workup. After that, I should consider alternative immunosuppressive strategies if TB is suspected or confirmed. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and safety considerations, including how to manage paradoxical worsening if it occurs [^eb757686] [^0f2b5ff4].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic distinction, because this is foundational. Serpiginous choroiditis is an idiopathic, typically peripapillary, recurrent chorioretinitis with absent to minimal vitreous cells and characteristic FA/ICGA/FAF patterns, and by classification criteria tuberculosis must be excluded to make that diagnosis, whereas serpiginous-like choroiditis is tuberculous and often multifocal with vitritis and different imaging signatures; I should double-check that the prior workup truly excluded TB before labeling this as idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis [^eb757686] [^0f2b5ff4].

> Wait, let me verify the prior therapy details and whether the antimetabolite was optimized. Standard approaches include systemic corticosteroids with a steroid-sparing agent such as azathioprine, mycophenolate, methotrexate, or cyclosporine; if the antimetabolite was underdosed or not titrated to effect, escalation to a biologic may be premature, so I need to check dose, duration, troughs if applicable, and adherence before concluding refractoriness [^581abdff].

> Next, I should review the evidence for biologics in serpiginous choroiditis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: most data are case reports and small series, with mixed results for TNF-α inhibitors; some reports suggest benefit with infliximab or adalimumab in refractory cases, but others show limited or delayed efficacy, and there is no robust RCT evidence establishing biologics as standard of care in serpiginous choroiditis, so expectations should be cautious and individualized [^24494215] [^74acb033] [^ff1c7092] [^55636d07].

> I need to ensure we address the TB risk explicitly. TNF-α blockade can reactivate latent TB and worsen tuberculous disease; therefore, before any TNF inhibitor, I should confirm a negative IGRA and chest imaging, and if there is any suspicion of serpiginous-like choroiditis or latent TB, I must treat TB first or choose a non-TNF pathway; guidelines emphasize ruling out TB and, when TB uveitis is suspected, using ATT with steroids rather than biologics initially, which I should adhere to strictly [^0f2b5ff4] [^63a123a3] [^a6499c73].

> Let me consider alternative immunosuppressive strategies if TB is a concern or if I want to avoid TNF blockade. Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil have historical evidence for inducing durable remission in refractory serpiginous choroiditis, albeit with significant toxicity, and intravitreal steroids can be adjuncts when systemic therapy is contraindicated or insufficient; I should weigh these against the patient's risk profile and disease severity [^5af62ad8] [^2ee7eba5].

> But wait, what if the apparent steroid/antimetabolite failure reflects paradoxical worsening from unrecognized tuberculous disease rather than true refractoriness. Paradoxical worsening can occur after starting ATT and may require intensified anti-inflammatory therapy; if I suspect this, I should coordinate with infectious diseases, continue or initiate ATT if indicated, and escalate steroids rather than add a TNF inhibitor, which could be dangerous in active TB biology [^553c7679] [^55063195].

> I should double-check the practical TB workup I would order before any biologic: IGRA or TST, chest radiograph, and if there are epidemiologic or imaging clues, chest CT; if ocular fluid PCR was not done and suspicion remains high, I would consider it, recognizing its limited sensitivity and the need to integrate clinical and imaging data; only if all are negative and the phenotype remains classic for idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis would I proceed toward a biologic with close monitoring [^0f2b5ff4] [^daca1749].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise plan. First, confirm the diagnosis and exclude TB with IGRA/TST, chest imaging, and careful phenotype review; if TB is suspected or confirmed, prioritize ATT with appropriate steroids and avoid TNF blockade. Second, if TB is excluded and the antimetabolite was truly optimized, consider a TNF-α inhibitor such as infliximab or adalimumab with counseling about limited evidence and infection risks, or alternatively consider alkylating agents or intravitreal steroid adjuncts. Third, monitor closely with multimodal imaging and be prepared to manage paradoxical reactions or treatment failures with adjusted immunosuppression rather than switching to a TNF inhibitor in the wrong context [^0f2b5ff4] [^24494215] [^5af62ad8].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that moving to a biologic can be reasonable in truly refractory, non-tuberculous serpiginous choroiditis after verifying prior therapy adequacy and excluding TB, but the evidence base is limited and heterogeneous, so shared decision-making, vigilant infection screening, and a low threshold to reconsider the diagnosis if the course is atypical are essential to safe and effective care [^eb757686] [^74acb033] [^ff1c7092] [^0f2b5ff4].

It is **not safe to start a biologic** for serpiginous choroiditis that is refractory to steroids and antimetabolites until tuberculosis has been confidently excluded. Serpiginous-like choroiditis is strongly linked to TB, and TNF-α inhibitors can reactivate latent TB, causing severe disease [^0f2b5ff4]. Before any biologic, obtain IGRA/PPD, chest imaging, and consider ocular fluid PCR [^daca1749]; if TB is suspected or confirmed, initiate antitubercular therapy with corticosteroids and avoid TNF-α blockers [^63a123a3]. If TB is excluded and disease remains active, infliximab or adalimumab may be considered with close monitoring, but evidence is limited and recurrence is common [^24494215] [^b80453fc].

## Differentiating serpiginous choroiditis from serpiginous-like choroiditis

Serpiginous choroiditis is an **idiopathic, autoimmune chorioretinitis** with peripapillary, geographic lesions and minimal vitritis, whereas serpiginous-like choroiditis is **TB-associated**, often multifocal with vitritis and responds to antitubercular therapy (ATT) [^eb757686] [^2be86351]. Accurate differentiation is essential because **biologics can worsen TB**.

---

## Risks of biologic therapy in serpiginous-like choroiditis

TNF-α inhibitors can reactivate latent TB, leading to severe or disseminated disease; this risk is **especially high in serpiginous-like choroiditis**, where TB is a key driver [^0f2b5ff4]. Case reports document progression despite ATT when TNF-α blockade is used, underscoring the danger [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup before initiating biologics

Before any biologic, **exclude TB with**:

- **Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or tuberculin skin test (PPD)**: screen for latent TB [^0f2b5ff4].
- **Chest radiography or CT**: look for active or latent TB [^a6499c73].
- **Ocular fluid PCR**: consider in atypical or refractory cases to detect M. tuberculosis DNA [^daca1749].

---

## Management of serpiginous-like choroiditis

When TB is suspected or confirmed, **prioritize ATT plus corticosteroids** and avoid TNF-α inhibitors:

- **Antitubercular therapy (ATT)**: standard 6-month regimen with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol [^notfound].
- **Systemic corticosteroids**: 1 mg/kg prednisolone tapered over 6–8 weeks to control inflammation [^notfound].
- **Avoid TNF-α inhibitors**: until TB is excluded or adequately treated [^0f2b5ff4].

---

## Alternative immunosuppressive strategies

If TB is excluded and disease remains active, consider:

- **Alkylating agents**: cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil for refractory cases [^5af62ad8].
- **Intravitreal or periocular steroids**: for local control or steroid-sparing [^2ee7eba5].
- **Other biologics**: limited evidence for non-TNF agents; use cautiously [^notfound].

---

## Evidence for biologic therapy in serpiginous choroiditis

Evidence for TNF-α inhibitors in idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis is limited to case reports and small series, with mixed results; some show control, others show progression or recurrence, so **careful patient selection and monitoring are critical** [^24494215] [^74acb033].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If a biologic is initiated, **monitor closely** for infection, recurrence, and complications:

- **Regular clinical exams**: track inflammation and visual acuity [^f8c7b39a].
- **Imaging**: fundus autofluorescence, OCT, and OCTA to assess activity and choroidal perfusion [^4bea855a] [^8e3231c5].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: CBC, LFTs, and infection surveillance [^c9a46bb2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Do not start a biologic for serpiginous choroiditis refractory to steroids and antimetabolites until TB is excluded. Serpiginous-like choroiditis is common and TNF-α inhibitors can reactivate TB; **confirm TB status first**. If TB is excluded and disease remains active, consider infliximab or adalimumab with caution and close monitoring, recognizing limited evidence and high recurrence risk [^24494215] [^b80453fc].

### Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis presenting as multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis [^2be86351]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical features, course, and outcome in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

A total of 105 patients (141 eyes) between May 2002 and July 2010.

Methods

Patients had the following inclusion criteria: (1) complete clinical records and digital fundus images at baseline and follow-up visits, (2) positive tuberculin skin test or QuantiFERON-TB Gold (Cellestis International Pty Ltd. Chadstone, Victoria, Australia) test result, (3) active serpiginous-like choroiditis in at least 1 eye, (4) all known causes of infectious (except tuberculosis) and noninfectious uveitis ruled out, and (5) a minimum of 9 months of follow-up from initiation of treatment that included antitubercular therapy (ATT) with oral corticosteroids (93 patients) or corticosteroids alone (12 patients).

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical characteristics and evolution of choroiditis lesions from the acute to healed stage, recurrence, visual outcome, and complications.

Results

Mean age was 33 ± 9.3 years (range, 12–54 years; 75 male and 30 female patients). Serpiginous-like choroiditis was bilateral (at least 1 eye active) in 66 patients (62.9%). Of 171 affected eyes, 141 (82.45%) had active lesions at presentation. Of 141 eyes, 115 (81.56%) showed vitreous inflammation. Lesions were multifocal in 133 eyes (94.3%), were noncontiguous to optic disc in 122 eyes (86.52%), and involved the macula in 125 eyes (88.65%). Of patients receiving ATT, all showed resolution of lesions and 9 (9.7%) developed recurrences (median follow-up, 21 months). In addition, 12 patients (12.9%) showed continued progression over a median 3.5 weeks after initiation of therapy. Of 12 patients treated with corticosteroids alone, none showed progression but 9 (75%) developed recurrence (median, 26.5 months). Final visual acuity of ≥ 6/12 was achieved in 108 eyes (76.60%) versus 72 eyes (51.06%) before treatment. Fovea was spared in 95 of 125 eyes (76%) with macular involvement. Five eyes (3.5%) developed choroidal neovascular membrane.

Conclusions

Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis presented as multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis affecting predominantly young to middle-aged men. It was frequently bilateral with vitreous inflammation and characterized by multifocal lesions that were noncontiguous to the optic disc and showed serpiginoid spread. Antitubercular therapy significantly reduced recurrences. Lesions responded to combined antitubercular and steroid therapy, usually spared fovea, and had a good final visual acuity.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^74acb033]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Serpiginous choroiditis was first described in 1932 by Junius as "peripapillary retinochoroiditis", after which there were various designations and reports on the subtypes. The disease is characterized by bilateral, chronic, progressive, and recurrent inflammation of the choroid, choriocapillaris, and retinal pigment epithelium. The disease is prevalent in healthy, young to middle-aged adults irrespective of race. Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis may present serpiginous-like choroiditis and must be ruled out. The optimal treatment is yet to be established because of the rarity and unknown etiology of the disease. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine and azathioprine, are commonly prescribed. Recently, some reports showed the efficacy of biological drugs such as infliximab and adalimumab and intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide therapy. However, these are single case reports, so the efficacy of the drugs may have been overestimated. In this paper, we present a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to adalimumab, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^ff1c7092]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment of serpiginous choroiditis is not established. While recent reports indicate the efficacy of adalimumab, there is limited evidence. We present a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to steroids, immunosuppressants, and adalimumab.

Case presentation

An 18-year-old woman presented with severe vision loss in both eyes. A fundus examination revealed a foveal grayish-white lesion, and optical coherence tomography revealed outer retinal damage. She was diagnosed with serpiginous choroiditis and treated with steroid pulse therapy, but the disease progressed continuously. The addition of sub-Tenon's injection of triamcinolone and oral cyclosporine did not change the disease course. We also administered subcutaneous injections of adalimumab, but even with the intensive treatment, the retinal lesions and subsequent atrophy progressed. Her right and left visual acuity declined from 20/22 to 20/66 and 20/200, respectively, during the 9 months of follow-up.

Conclusion

Here, we report a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and adalimumab. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal treatment for such cases.

### Continuous progression of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis after initiating antituberculosis treatment [^553c7679]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the frequency, risk factors, management, and outcome of eyes with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis showing continued progression following initiation of antituberculosis treatment.

Design

Retrospective, comparative, interventional case series.

Setting

Institutional.

Patient Population

One hundred ten patients of serpiginous-like choroiditis with 1) complete records, 2) tuberculin skin test, 3) active lesions in at least 1 eye, and 4) minimum 18 months follow-up.

Intervention

Based on the positivity of tuberculin skin test, the patients were categorized in Group A (84 patients with positive tuberculin test) and Group B (26 patients with negative tuberculin test). Of the 84 patients in Group A, 19 received systemic corticosteroids while 65 also received 4-drug antituberculosis treatment in addition. All patients in Group B received corticosteroids. Patients with continued progression received an increased dose of corticosteroids with or without immunosuppressive agents.

Main Outcome Measure

Development of continued progression.

Results

There were 61 men and 23 women in Group A and 19 men and 7 women in Group B. Continued progression was observed in 12 patients (14.28%) in Group A and none in Group B (P = 0.04). Of the 12 patients in Group A showing progression, 11 (16.9%) were receiving antituberculosis treatment and corticosteroids. The lesions responded in all eyes, and final visual acuity of 20/40 or better could be achieved in 10 eyes (75%).

Conclusion

Continued progression of choroiditis lesions occurs in 14% of patients after initiating antituberculosis treatment in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis. Increased immunosuppression with continuation of antituberculosis treatment resulted in good outcome.

### Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis [^dac09fe2]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Choroidal tuberculosis (TB) infection may present itself as a diffuse choroiditis that resembles serpiginous choroiditis, usually treated with immunossupressants. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with serpiginous-like choroiditis and evidence of systemic or latent TB are best treated with antituberculosis treatment (ATT) in addition to the corticosteroid therapy. The authors present a case of a 58-year-old man with decreased vision in his left eye. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 right eye and 20/200 left eye. Funduscopic examination revealed a diffuse choroiditis. Mantoux skin test showed an area of induration measuring 30×35 mm and the patient started ATT with complete resolution of retinal lesions after 2 weeks of treatment. His final visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye with no recurrences over a follow-up of 6 months. The use of ATT in these patients is likely to reduce active inflammation and eliminate future recurrences.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^55636d07]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We presented a refractory case of serpiginous choroiditis.

The disease progressed for 9 months despite the use of adalimumab. The course was inconsistent with recent two case reports showing the efficacy of adalimumab in serpiginous choroiditis refractory to conventional treatment. Both studies reported favorable responses, 1 month after the adalimumab treatment. However, adalimumab was used in the chronic phase in these reports (about 3 and 8 years after the onset, respectively). The progression was controlled with adalimumab after 8 months in the present case. While we cannot draw definite conclusions from a single case, the effect of adalimumab in the acute phase of refractory serpiginous choroiditis may not be as good as was previously reported for the chronic phase. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal treatment.

The present case indicated the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to monitor.

the disease progression. The lesion appeared as a hyperreflective area in the outer retina and progressed to retinal atrophy. The grayish-white lesion could also be confirmed in fundus examinations, but differentiating between the fibrotic scar and the recurred lesion was sometimes challenging (Fig. 3 f). The OCT-based treatment strategy, as established in age-related macular degeneration, needs to be tested in future studies.

Differentiating between serpiginous choroiditis and tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis is not always easy. In the present case, the failure of response to immunosuppressive treatments made us re-consider tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis and other infectious conditions. Additionally, the multifocal appearance was suggestive of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis. However, the repeated QuantiFERON test results were negative, and the OCT features reported in tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis were absent in the present case. Blood tests did not indicate other possible conditions such as syphilis or herpes. Considering the side effects of anti-tuberculous and anti-viral treatments, we continued immunosuppression and succeeded to cease the disease progression. A careful evaluation is necessary in such refractory cases.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^a6499c73]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Risk stratification for referral timeline

Ocular factors

If a patient has sight-threatening uveitis, they may be started on systemic steroids at presentation, before a CXR is reported, and the IGRA result is known. If the CXR does not show signs of TB, but the IGRA is positive then ocular treatment should be continued pending a TB clinic review and assessed for response. A TB clinic appointment within 2 weeks is appropriate for patients on high-dose steroids (prednisolone > 0.5 mg/kg equivalent) or within 4 weeks otherwise. This includes macular oedema, serpiginous choroidopathy or secondary choroidal neovascularisation (assuming intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment has been initiated).

If there is tissue damage from presumed direct infection such as a macular choroidal granuloma with overlying retinitis, or necrosing scleritis then immediate referral is warranted by discussion with the respiratory or infectious diseases team.

Systemic factors

If the CXR shows signs of active pulmonary or miliary TB then an immediate referral is needed to the respiratory or infectious diseases team. This also applies if the patient is unwell with otherwise unexplained systemic, respiratory or neurological symptoms, including night sweats and weight loss, which could indicate disseminated TB.

Clinical practice point

Immediate referral to a TB service is recommended if there is sight-threatening disease or suspicion of disseminated/pulmonary TB. Other presentations can be generally seen within 4 weeks, or 2 weeks if on high-dose steroids. All referrals should be explicit about the specific reason for the referral (see figure 1).

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^4521fe3c]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory testing, the patient was diagnosed with macular serpiginous choroiditis. He was started on 60 mg of oral prednisone daily. Because there was no subjective or objective improvement after 1 month and due to steroid-related side effects, he was tapered off the prednisone and started on 150 mg of oral azathioprine daily.

### Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings in serpiginous choroiditis [^0dd98411]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Serpiginous choroiditis (SC) is a recurrent inflammatory primary choriocapillaropathy, belonging to a group of rare idiopathic diseases called "white-dot syndromes", which were first described by Ezra in 1995. The disease commonly occurs bilaterally and asymmetrically, progressing in a centrifugal and phased manner. Patients, mostly between the age of 20 and 60 years, usually complain of blurry vision, scotomas, and metamorphopsia, equating to a diminished quality of life with irreversible loss of vision in cases where the macula is affected.

Three types of SC are currently recognized depending on the primary location of inflammation. The "peripapillary form" accounts for approximately 80% of cases and begins near the optic disc with a late affection of the macular region, whereas the "macular form" has a poor initial visual prognosis because of the early disease manifestation of the macula. In contrast to this, the "atypical form" starts in the periphery in a partly multifocal manner, may reach the macular region and possibly initiates as acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy. Before the diagnosis of SC can be determined, tuberculosis related uveitis has to be excluded.

There is currently no consensus regarding its optimal treatment options, which consists mostly of immunosuppressive substances and biologicals. However, disease recurrence is often observed despite therapy. A better anticipation of drug response and disease progression could help lower treatment burden.

In the past years, a multimodal imaging approach has been described to facilitate diagnosis and to assess disease progression and re-activation in white-dot syndromes.

The gold standard for retinal imaging is fluorescein angiography (FA).

However, indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is probably the current best tool to indicate the true extent of choriocapillaropathies.

But all current imaging modalities concentrate on the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), or choroid. However, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new 3D non-invasive diagnostic method which is capable of examining the retinal and choroidal vasculature concurrently and allows for a detailed study of vascular perfusion in all layers via motion contrast imaging.

Until now, there are only case reports concerning OCTA and one case series encompassing 3 patients in SC. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe these findings in greater extent and compare them to known diagnostic tools, such as FA, ICGA, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).

### Antitubercular therapy for uveitis of undetermined cause with positive interferon-gamma release assay: a single-blind, single-centre, phase 2 randomised controlled trial [^6ab7196e]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Before the current trial, multiple retrospective studies reported treatment outcomes in the management of TB uveitis, but no prospective trials had been conducted. There is no gold standard for diagnosing TB uveitis, partly due to the suboptimal diagnostic performance of current ocular fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genomes in ocular fluid samples. Most studies evaluating treatment outcome included both uveitis patients with proven active systemic TB and those showing TB immunoreactivity after other causes had been excluded. As previously summarised, treatment with antitubercular therapy (ATT) in these patients demonstrated an overall results toward a better resolution of uveitis but failed to achieve statistical significance. Cautious interpretation is warranted, as our previous retrospective analysis suggests that the severity of presenting uveitis might influence treatment decisions regarding the initiation of ATT, complicating the interpretation of the actual benefits of ATT in this context. Of note, based on the opinions of uveitis experts, in the absence of active systemic TB, there is no strong consensus on initiating ATT unless ophthalmologic presentations such as choroidal granuloma or serpiginous-like choroiditis (SLC) are observed. Other clinical presentations, including chronic anterior uveitis or panuveitis, were considered potential indications for ATT in high TB-endemic regions; however, additional supporting evidence, such as signs of healed or old TB lesions on chest radiography, in combination with a positive TB immunoreactivity test, is necessary for treatment initiation. In light of this, we conducted a phase 2 randomised controlled trial to determine whether ATT would eventually improve outcomes compared to treatment without ATT in terms of uveitis resolution and relapse, during subsequent follow-up of patients with uveitis of undetermined cause who were showing TB immunoreactivity, based on IGRA test positivity.

### Relapse in ocular tuberculosis: relapse rate, risk factors and clinical management in a non-endemic country [^62556fc0]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health concern, manifesting as active TB disease an estimated 10.6 million individuals globally. While the disease primarily affects the lungs, it can also manifest in extrapulmonary sites, including the eyes. The prevalence of ocular TB (OTB) among uveitis patients varies between 3% in non-high-burden settings and 7%–11% in high-burden settings. The decision to initiate antitubercular treatment (ATT) in presumed OTB cases, based on positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or tuberculin skin test (TST) results without clinically active systemic TB, remains challenging. Experts recommend starting ATT in patients with tubercular choroiditis, serpiginous-like choroiditis (SLC) or tuberculoma, who also display signs of systemic TB infection based on positive IGRA, TST or chest radiological features suggestive of TB. However, the decision is still challenging when patients present with uveitis manifestations other than the aforementioned phenotypes. In such cases, the diagnosis of OTB relies heavily on a positive IGRA/TST result. Meanwhile, reliance on only local or systemic immunosuppressive drugs without ATT to control inflammatory activity in presumed OTB has also been described, even though there are limited data to conclude which subsets of presumed patients with OTB benefit from treatment with immunosuppressant alone. A recent study by Alam et al explored the application of the Standardised Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group criteria to reclassify presumed patients with OTB. They observed two distinct groups: (1) uveitis patients with ocular clinical phenotypes strongly indicative of OTB based on the SUN criteria, tested positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) PCR from ocular fluid and/or had active TB and (2) those with TST-positive undifferentiated uveitis who did not meet the SUN criteria. Interestingly, the latter group exhibited higher intraocular T lymphocyte cytokine responses, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-1 on stimulation with early secreted antigenic target 6 kDa antigen. While the study did not report treatment outcomes, the authors hypothesised that ATT might be beneficial in the OTB group, whereas immunosuppressant therapy, without adjunctive ATT, could be sufficient for managing undifferentiated uveitis cases who showed TB-immunoreactivity.

### Tubercular retinal vasculitis: diagnostic dilemma and management strategies [^ba299aff]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

The second key component of pharmacotherapy is corticosteroids. Two specific manifestations of OTB, serpiginous-like choroiditis and TRV, are probably apt candidates for corticosteroids since both are likely to have a significant immunologic component in their etiology. In the context of TRV, corticosteroids may be required when the inflammation is sight-threatening: posterior, severe, hemorrhagic vasculitis with vitritis and macular edema, which probably indicates an added immune response to bacterial infection. Another indication for steroids in OTB is in cases of paradoxical worsening due to exaggerated inflammatory response after ATT. Though COTS study had the largest collection of TRV cases so far, because of ambiguity about definition, it could not clearly define the role of corticosteroids: whether they were beneficial, redundant, or harmful in routine treatment of TRV. One reason was that steroids were used by default in almost all of the cases. A rationale for high frequency of corticosteroid usage could be the predominantly occlusive nature of vasculitis – which required early control to prevent ischemic complications – whether secondary to TB or other causes like Behcet's disease. A recent controlled study however showed that for TRV sans the previously mentioned high-risk features, ATT alone suffices to treat the inflammation completely, and without recurrences. A meta-analysis of 28 clinical studies also failed to show any benefit of concomitant systemic steroids on the treatment outcomes, probably because the rationale for their use was not specified. To avoid the systemic side-effects of steroids, local therapy in the form of intravitreal dexamethasone implants can be used in cases of corticosteroid intolerance, especially when TRV is unilateral.

### Successful treatment of serpiginous choroiditis with alkylating agents [^5af62ad8]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the management and long-term outcomes of patients with serpiginous choroiditis treated with alkylating agents.

Design

Retrospective, noncomparative case series.

Participants

Nine patients with active, vision-threatening serpiginous choroiditis who had progressive inflammation while on steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents other than alkylating agents treated at three tertiary care uveitis referral centers.

Methods

Patients received systemic immunosuppression with an alkylating agent, either chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide. Prednisone also was given initially and was tapered and discontinued.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual acuity, clinical disease activity, duration of treatment, duration of drug-free disease remission, and side effects of alkylating agent therapy.

Results

No patients had recurrences while on therapy. No further visual loss was encountered after starting the therapy. Six of the patients regained vision. All but two patients achieved prolonged drug-free remissions, ranging in duration between 15 and 96 months (median, 78 months). Side effects included transient bone marrow suppression, nausea, and fatigue. Secondary malignancy was encountered in one patient, whose carcinoma of the urinary bladder was treated successfully.

Conclusions

Adequate immunosuppression with alkylating agents may favorably alter the long-term prognosis of patients with serpiginous choroiditis.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^990050ec]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 18-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with the complaint of central visual field defect in the right eye for 1 week and in the left eye for 3 days.

Her medical history was unremarkable except for pediatric asthma and appendicitis. She reported no raw meat consumption and had a dog until a year ago. She received vaccination for human papillomavirus 3 years ago. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/22 in both eyes.

The anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. The fundus examination showed bilateral grayish-white retinal lesions around the macula, and the optical coherence tomography showed corresponding hyperreflectivity and thinning of the outer retina (Fig. 1). The features of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis such as vitreous hyper-reflective spots, intraretinal edema, sub-retinal pigment epithelium drusenoid deposits, and choroidal granulomas were not present. The lesion was hypofluorescent and hyperfluorescent in the early and late phases, respectively, on fluorescein fundus angiography (FA). The lesion was hypofluorescent from the early to late phase on indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Fluorescein and indocyanine angiography (FA and ICGA in the left and right panels, respectively) images of the patient. On FA, the lesion appeared hypofluorescent in the early phase (a and c) and turned hyperfluorescent in the late phase (b and d). Meanwhile, ICGA showed a hypofluorescent appearance in both the phases

The intraocular pressures were 18 and 15 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively.

No abnormalities were detected with blood tests except for a mild increase of C-reactive protein (0.4 mg/dL) and white blood cells (10,020/μL). We performed QuantiFERON tests at the initial presentation and 2 weeks later, which showed negative results.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^bcdc4251]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The initial treatment for active serpiginous choroiditis lesions involves systemic corticosteroid therapy, while immunosuppressive therapy is crucial for preventing recurrences. Our patient was started on a daily oral regimen of azathioprine 150 mg to reduce the risk for recurrence and potential damage to the right eye. Unfortunately, the visual prognosis is usually quite poor, particularly in cases characterized by extensive atrophy and scarring.

In conclusion, we present what to our knowledge is the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis with an onset after a COVID-19 infection. Our findings align with the existing literature on ocular complications after COVID-19 infection; however, the atypical macular variant in this case makes it unique. Further research is required to elucidate the role of COVID-19 infection in the development of this rare disease.

### Progressive ocular inflammation following anti-tubercular therapy for presumed ocular tuberculosis in a high-endemic setting [^9341e535]. Eye (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the incidence and clinical course of patients developing progressive ocular inflammation following anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) for presumed ocular tuberculosis (TB).

Methods

Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who received ATT for presumed ocular TB and completed at least 12 months follow-up after initiation of ATT. The diagnosis of presumed ocular TB was based on presence of ocular signs suggestive of TB, evidence of past tubercular infection, and exclusion of mimicking clinical entities. All patients received a combination of ATT and corticosteroid therapy. Primary outcome measure was progression (worsening) of ocular inflammation, defined as a two-step increase in level of inflammation (anterior chamber/ vitreous) or the appearance of new lesions following initiation of ATT.

Results

A total of 106 patients (64 male, 42 female) received ATT for presumed ocular TB. Twenty-six (24.5%) patients developed progressive intraocular inflammation following ATT. Primary diagnoses in these patients were: anterior uveitis (n = 1), intermediate uveitis (n = 9), retinal vasculitis (n = 3), serpiginous-like choroiditis (n = 7), multifocal choroiditis (n = 2), and pan-uveitis (n = 4). Following progressive inflammation, diagnosis was revised in two patients (7.7%)-both responded to alternative therapy. Of the rest, majority (n = 16; 61.5%) resolved with escalation of corticosteroid therapy. Five patients (19.2%)-all having intermediate uveitis-required therapeutic vitrectomy for resolution. Three patients (11.5%) had persistent inflammation at end of follow-up period.

Conclusion

Progressive inflammation following ATT for presumed ocular TB is common. It generally resolves on escalation of corticosteroid therapy. Cases not responding to increased immunosuppression need to be re-investigated to rule out a nontubercular cause.

### Clinical and imaging factors associated with the outcomes of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis [^6d6e99f0]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To analyze baseline clinical and imaging risk factors associated with poor outcome in patients with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis (TB SLC).

Design

Retrospective clinical study.

Methods

Charts and fundus photographs of consecutive patients with active TB SLC seen at a single tertiary referral center with 6 months follow-up after initiation of treatment were reviewed. Logistic mixed models were performed to determine the clinical and imaging factors associated with the response to therapy, including the opacity of choroiditis graded according to a 3-point scale.

Results

This study included 203 eyes of 183 patients with active TB SLC. Poor initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and foveal and optic disc involvement were associated with poor response to therapy at 6 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.489, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.92–10.47; P = 0.001; OR 2.892, 95% CI: 1.23–6.81; P = 0.015; OR 11.633, 95% CI: 3.17–42.71; P < .001, respectively). The high opacity grades (2 and 3) were also associated with poor outcomes OR 9.541; 95% CI: 2.94–30.91; P = 0.001). Poor baseline BCVA and high grade of opacity of the lesions were the composite risk factors for paradoxical worsening of TB SLC (OR 7.555, 95% CI: 1.78–32.02; P = 0.006; OR 7.434, 95% CI: 1.34–41.18; P = 0.021, respectively).

Conclusions

TB SLC with higher grades of lesion opacity at baseline may be associated with greater risk of poor therapeutic response and paradoxical worsening. Grading of baseline lesion opacity may be used in future prospective studies to predict the biological behavior of the lesions and may serve as a guide to therapeutic interventions.

### Presumed tuberculosis-associated uveitis: rising incidence and widening criteria for diagnosis in a non-endemic area [^b9c87a13]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

PurposeTo assess the incidence, clinical ocular involvement and effectiveness of anti-tuberculous treatment in patients with chronic uveitis presumed to be associated with tuberculosis in a non-endemic community. Patients and methodsRetrospective case series of patients with uveitis and evidence of tuberculosis, with no other identified cause of uveitis, who underwent a 6-month course of standard anti-tuberculosis treatment between 2008 and 2015. The response to treatment was assessed at 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. ResultsForty-eight patients were included of whom 36 (75%) were born outside the United Kingdom. Only five had concurrent active pulmonary or nodal tuberculosis. There were 85 affected eyes, including 25 with granulomatous anterior uveitis, 32 with retinal vasculitis (occlusive in 21), and 20 with multifocal choroiditis or serpiginous-like retinochoroiditis. Gamma-interferon testing was positive in 95%. Complete resolution at end point was seen in only 60%, but a further 19% were inflammation-free on topical steroid only. Resolution was lower (50%) in those with panuveitis compared to other anatomical types (75%). Sixty-four eyes (75%) had a LogMAR visual acuity of 0.1 or better at the end of the study. ConclusionsThe incidence of presumed tuberculosis-associated uveitis (TBU) has almost quadrupled in this region. The efficacy of treatment has not been enhanced by the introduction of gamma-interferon testing to support diagnosis. Some patients may require more prolonged antibiotic therapy to ensure quiescence, but chronic non-infective anterior uveitis may in any case follow treated TBU.

### A review and update on orphan drugs for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis [^24494215]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Infliximab

Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds both circulating and membrane-bound TNF-α, has been reported to be effective for the treatment of uveitis associated with multiple uveitic diseases, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-related anterior uveitis, pars planitis, VKH, bird-shot chorioretinopathy, recalcitrant uveitic CME, multifocal choroiditis, sympathetic ophthalmia, serpiginous choroidopathy, and idiopathic uveitis.–

In addition, infliximab has been described to be a rapid and very effective therapy for the treatment of ABD-related panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. Sfikakis et al reported in a prospective study of 25 patients with ABD-related uveitis that > 90% of patients demonstrated the resolution of vitritis, CME, retinitis, and retinal vasculitis within 4 weeks after initiating infliximab therapy and benefit often occurred in under 1 week. It was shown to be more effective than conventional immunotherapy for ABD-related retinal vasculitis.

Infliximab also showed efficacy for JIA uveitis, with the majority of patients experiencing rapid control of uveitis after the second infusion. However, multiple case reports and series suggest that TNF-α inhibitors may cause sarcoidosis-like conditions. TNF inhibitors analogously are effective for psoriasis, but they have also been reported to cause psoriasiform skin disease and developing drug-induced lupus. Furthermore, TNF-α inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with serpiginous choroidopathy despite previously negative QuantiFERON test.

### Serpiginous choroiditis presenting in association withInfection and ulcerative colitis [^6ff49613]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This work reports a case of serpiginous choroiditis (SC) in association with ulcerative colitis and Clostridium difficile infection.

Methods

A case report is discussed.

Results

A 35-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis and recently treated C difficile infection presented with a rapid decline in central visual acuity in both eyes. Examination findings included geographic creamy-white lesions extending from the peripapillary region in both eyes. Multimodal imaging and negative infectious workup results supported the diagnosis of SC. Visual acuity and examination findings improved after initiation of systemic prednisone therapy. Adalimumab was initiated as a steroid-sparing treatment. At the last follow-up, 5 months after the initial presentation, SC and ulcerative colitis both remain in remission.

Conclusions

SC has been previously described in patients with systemic disorders, including autoimmune conditions. This patient developed SC following C difficile infection and in the context of active ulcerative colitis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SC in association with these entities.

### Distinct recurrence pattern in a case of bilateral tubercular posterior uveitis: reporting a unique clinical morphology and management challenge [^2846c9ce]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Intraocular tuberculosis has protean clinical manifestations and remains an important etiological differential for uveitis in an endemic region. A 27-year-old male presented with visual acuity of counting fingers close to face in right (OD) and 20/25 in left eye (OS). Examination revealed a choroidal granuloma in OS and healed serpiginous-like choroiditis in OD. Antitubercular therapy was started with systemic corticosteroids. Granuloma resolved completely; however, the patient presented with neuroretinitis and posterior scleritis, as first and second recurrence, respectively, within a oneyear period. These were managed with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy was added, after second recurrence. The patient responded well and maintains remission. This case presented a clinical challenge with distinct recurrence patterns of tubercular posterior uveitis in the same eye, which has not been reported before. Successful management entailed use of antitubercular therapy, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive therapy in a step-ladder approach, resulting in preservation of vision and achieving long-term remission.

### QuantiFERON TB-gold – a new test strengthening long-suspected tuberculous involvement in serpiginous-like choroiditis [^7f1138e9]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To obtain a diagnosis of tuberculosis in patients with a specific subset of uveitis, serpiginous-like choroiditis. This subset has been suspicious for tuberculous etiology in single case reports and old textbooks.

Design

Retrospective evaluation of a diagnostic test in a specific uveitis cohort.

Methods

QuantiFERON is an approved, antigen-specific test that utilizes synthetic peptides representing Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins. After incubation, interferon gamma secreted by T lymphocytes in response to these antigens is measured. We used the test in 21 of 26 patients identified from our database with serpiginous-like choroiditis. Rates of QuantiFERON positivity were compared to a group of healthy hospital employees (n = 208), another group of healthy hospital workers after tuberculosis contact (n = 117), and a group of randomly tested patients with other uveitis forms (n = 45).

Results

Eleven of 21 serpiginous-like choroiditis patients (52%) were tested positive. The rate of QuantiFERON positivity in the healthy control groups was 8.7% and 0.9%, and 13% in the other uveitis subsets. Four of the QuantiFERON-positive serpiginous-like choroiditis patients were treated with standard anti-tuberculostatic therapy; three finished the course and improved. Seven patients are either stable without therapy (n = 4) or on low-dose prednisone (n = 3).

Conclusions

QuantiFERON testing revealed a high number of positive patients, which indicates a tuberculous etiology in this uveitis subset. Whether bacterial activity or secondary immunologic processes are causative remains a matter of speculation.

### Serpiginous-like choroiditis as a marker for tuberculosis in a non-endemic area [^6161e683]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe the increasing incidence of multifocal outer retinal and inner choroidal inflammation as a marker for intraocular tuberculosis in the UK, a non-endemic area.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective case series.

Results

14 patients presented with serpiginous-like choroiditis over 10 years (seven within the last 2 years). Seven of 14 patients showed evidence of exposure to tuberculosis and received antituberculous treatment. 17 of 23 eyes showed stable or improved visual acuity. All with decreased acuity had direct macular involvement at presentation.

Conclusions

Multifocal outer retinal and inner choroidal inflammation is a marker for intraocular tuberculosis of increasing importance, even in a non-endemic area. Originally described as 'serpiginous-like choroiditis', the lesions are multifocal, irregular in shape, very numerous, widespread, often asymmetrical and often demonstrating both active and resolved lesions simultaneously. Active lesions show contiguous extension. We recommend that every patient with SLC should undergo testing for previous exposure to tuberculosis, and undergo antituberculous treatment if lesions are progressive and sight-threatening.

### Tuberculosis: an under-diagnosed aetiological agent in uveitis with an effective treatment [^c2c64491]. Eye (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To highlight the diversity of clinical presentations with tubercular uveitis in a nonendemic setting, and discuss the diagnostic approach and an effective treatment.

Method

Descriptive case series.

Results

A total of 12 cases of varied presentations of tubercular uveitis diagnosed over a period of 1 year of which six cases are described in detail. Presentations included choroidal tuberculomas, multifocal choroiditis, recurrent granulomatous uveitis, panuveitis with cystoid macular oedema, and serpiginous choroiditis. All cases had a chronic or recurrent course and responded very well to antitubercular treatment. Diagnosis was mainly assisted by positive tuberculin testing.

Conclusion

A high index of suspicion helps diagnose ocular tuberculosis in areas of low prevalence of the disease. It forms part of the differential diagnosis of any chronic or recurrent uveitis, especially in an at-risk patient. Antitubercular treatment seems highly effective.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with serpinginous choroiditis [^b80453fc]. Retina (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the long-term clinical course of serpiginous choroiditis-a recurrent inflammatory disease that causes progressive visual loss-and to determine the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients who met inclusion criteria for serpiginous choroiditis at The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics was performed. Information collected included duration of follow-up, number of recurrences of inflammation, visual acuities, and development of choroidal neovascularization. The number of recurrences of inflammation in patients treated with immunosuppressive agents was compared with that in patients treated only with corticosteroids or observation.

Results

Seventeen patients were identified who had a mean age at presentation of 39.6 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 149.2 months, with 13 patients who were followed up for > 60 months. Twelve eyes either presented with or developed macular choroidal neovascularization during follow-up. Thirteen of the patients were followed up for > 12 months. Of these 13 patients, 6 received treatment with immunosuppressive agents along with corticosteroids. Four of the six patients developed no further inflammatory recurrence. Seven of the 13 patients were treated with corticosteroids or observation. All of these patients developed recurrences (P = 0.021, Fisher exact test).

Conclusions

Immunosuppressive agents appear to reduce the rate of recurrent disease in serpiginous choroiditis compared with corticosteroids.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^8e40c08e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

After the initiation of the steroid pulse therapy, the subjective symptoms improved. However, the grayish-white retinal lesions continued to enlarge in both eyes. The disease progression was not controlled despite 3 more days of mPSL (1 g/day), following 60 mg of oral prednisone. Sub-Tenon's triamcinolone acetonide injection (20 mg) was administered to the left eye and then to the right eye. (Fig. 3 c).

We added oral cyclosporine (300 mg), and prednisone was switched to betamethasone (7 mg). The trough blood cyclosporin concentration was monitored and controlled at around 200 ng/mL. While the initially affected areas changed to atrophic scars, new lesions appeared adjacent to or away from the initial lesion (Fig. 3 d). Subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (80 mg) were started on the 27th day, and intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (20 mg) were administered in the right eye on the 34th day, but they could not stop the disease progression. Oral cyclosporine (300 mg) and betamethasone (3 mg) and biweekly subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (40 mg) were continued, but the retinal lesions progressed up to 8 months (Fig. 3 e). Her visual acuity declined to 20/66 and 20/200 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Both eyes showed a similar course during the observation period. The disease progressed up to the 9th month, but no new lesions were observed thereafter (Fig. 3 f).

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^a8128e6d]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To present the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection. Methods: A single case was analyzed. Results: A 28-year-old previously healthy man presented with severe unilateral vision loss in the left eye. A fundus examination showed severe atrophic pigmentary changes that corresponded with optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of a rapidly progressing amoeboid-like lesion disrupting the ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium. Multimodal imaging, including fundus autofluorescence, OCT angiography, and indocyanine green angiography, was supportive of serpiginous choroiditis. After a comprehensive systemic workup, the diagnosis of macular serpiginous choroiditis was confirmed. No improvement was seen with high-dose steroids; therefore, an immunosuppressive regimen was initiated. Conclusions: An exaggerated choroidal inflammatory response may be triggered by a COVID-19 infection, although causation cannot be inferred. Retinal manifestations should be considered when assessing patients presenting with visual symptoms after COVID-19 infection.

### Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in intraocular fluid of 11 suspected tuberculous uveitis patients by multiplex PCR [^990ecf02]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical data for patients with suspected tuberculous uveitis

In this study, 1 patient discontinued treatment due to ineffective diagnostic anti-TB therapy, while 3 patients either discontinued treatment or were lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 11 patients (13 eyes) with suspected tuberculous uveitis, who received standard anti-TB therapy for at least 6 months, treatment was effective. Clinical data for these 11 patients are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Clinical characteristics of 11 patients who responded to antituberculosis therapy

BCVA: best corrected visual acuity; NLP: no light perception; HM/BE: hand movement/before eyes TB: tuberculosis; T-SPOT: T cell spot test; PPD: purified protein derivative; ATT: antituberculosis therapy; Tuberculosis-associated Serpiginous-Like Choroiditis

Of the 11 cases (13 eyes) treated for clinically suspected tuberculous uveitis, 6 cases (54.5%) were male and 5 cases (45.5%) were female, with an average age of 63.6 years (range: 47–74 years). Three patients (27.3%) resided in urban areas, while 8 (72.7%) lived in rural settings. One patient had a history of tuberculous pleurisy. Four patients (36.4%) had a previous history of steroid therapy. In terms of the main clinical manifestations, 7 cases (63.6%) had iris nodules; 5 cases (45.5%) had vasculitis; 4 cases (36.4%) had choroidal lesions; and no cases developed tuberculoma or Tuberculosis-associated Serpiginous-Like Choroiditis (TB-SLC).

### Exploring the molecular intersection of posterior ocular tuberculosis: proteins, ocular autoimmunity, and immune receptor interactions [^ccf4be89]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health problem, and according to the World Health Organization, TB is one of the 10 most common causes of death worldwide. One-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and the microorganism persists latent among approximately 70% to 80% of immunocompetent infected people. Tuberculosis can affect various organs in the body. A rare form is ocular TB, which can lead to severe vision loss. The prevalence of ocular TB ranges between 10% and 26% in high endemic regions such as India and Saudi Arabia, whereas it is estimated to be found in 1% to 4% in low endemic regions such as the United States, Europe, and Japan.

Ocular TB can affect any tissue in the eye. It usually presents as TB uveitis (TBU). The prevalence of TBU varies from 0.2% to 10.5%. Tuberculosis-related posterior uveitis and choroiditis are the most common forms of TBU. It has been suggested that MTB directly infects the eye tissues or may indirectly lead to intraocular inflammation through the presence of MTB in the vitreous, aqueous fluid, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), or choroid in Tuberculous Serpiginous-like Choroiditis. Tuberculosis uveitis phenotypes vary widely, each potentially triggered by different mechanisms. Choroidal tuberculoma, for example, occurs as the immune system attempts to contain the infection by forming granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that surround and isolate the bacteria. Although granulomas are meant to prevent the spread of MTB, they also create a localized area of intense inflammation. This immune response appears to be directly caused by microbial invasion from MTB, and it typically responds effectively to antitubercular therapy. Conversely, tubercular serpiginous–like choroiditis is primarily driven by indirect immune responses, requiring extensive immunomodulatory treatment to control the inflammation (Fig 1). This condition is characterized by multifocal chorioretinal lesions mimicking idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis. The direct immune response is quite well understood. It involves initially macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, which recognize MTB through pattern recognition receptors. The following response of the adaptive immunity involves particularly CD4 + T cells, which release cytokines such as interferon gamma. However, the knowledge on the involvement of autoimmunity and crossreactivity, which seem to be very relevant in phenotypes such as serpiginous-like choroidopathy, is very limited.

### Intravitreal methotrexate in the management of presumed tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis [^fa3b45eb]. Retina (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report on the use of intravitreal methotrexate (IVT MTX) as part of treatment of presumed tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis progressing despite the use of tuberculostatics.

Methods

Case series of patients suffering from serpiginous-like choroiditis with positive tuberculin skin test who received IVT injections of MTX as part of treatment. Ocular disease was active despite the use of systemic tuberculostatic (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), and choroidal lesions showed signs of progression. A single injection of IVT MTX (400 μg/0.1 mL) was administered in the eye with macular-threatening features. Change in visual acuity, appearance of the lesion, and staining patterns on angiography were among the main outcome measurements.

Results

Three eyes from two patients were included. Both cases presented bilateral involvement with mild vitritis. In all three eyes, choroidal lesions healed within the first month after an IVT MTX injection with visual acuity improvement in two. No adverse reaction was related to the medication or to the procedure. Patients were followed for a mean of 13.5 months after being injected.

Conclusion

The use of IVT MTX seems effective in the management of the inflammatory component of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis, whereas systemic tuberculostatics are aimed at controlling the infectious one.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^0f2b5ff4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Inflammation involving the uvea and retina (uveitis)

Uveitis (intraocular inflammation) is the the most common manifestation of TB-associated eye disease.

Anterior uveitis is typically granulomatous, with 'mutton fat' deposits on the inner cornea and nodules may be seen on the iris due to granulomatous inflammation. Chronic non-granulomatous anterior uveitis may also occur and TB should be excluded in all cases of atypical anterior uveitis not responding to conventional therapy, in patients with socioepidemiological risk factors for TB.

Intermediate uveitis where the predominant site of inflammation is in the vitreous gel (vitritis), peripheral retina (vascular sheathing) and pars plana (pars planitis), is a non-specific finding in many patients with ocular inflammation. Clumps of cells in the vitreous and 'snowball' opacities suggest chronic granulomatous inflammation. Recurrent macular oedema is a significant cause of visual morbidity in some patients with TB-associated intermediate uveitis.

Posterior uveitis is an umbrella term for inflammation of the back of the eye.

Retinal vasculitis is a description of inflammatory changes associated with retinal blood vessels, predominantly veins and with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. There may also be significant vascular occlusion in OTB. Eales' disease refers to a retinal vasculitis characterised by occlusive disease and neovascularisation, leading to recurrent vitreous haemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment, although this term is usually reserved for patients in whom TB is not thought to be a contributing factor. This boundary is difficult to draw and many patients with peripheral occlusive disease secondary to TB may have this label attached to them.

Serpiginous choroidopathy, ampiginous and serpiginous-like choroidopathy are all diseases of the retinal pigment epithelium. Classic serpiginous disease originates around the optic disc and spreads in a contiguous, centrifugal manner. Ampiginous and serpiginous-like choroidopathy refers to placoid lesions present in the posterior pole and periphery, initially non-contiguous and evolving in a serpiginoid pattern with varying degrees of vitritis.
Choroidal granulomas, which may be small and multiple ('tubercles'), or present as a single, elevated choroidal mass ('tuberculoma'). Multiple tubercles or multifocal choroiditis) signify disseminated disease and are more commonly observed in immunocompromised patients.

Other posterior segment findings of TB include:

Tuberculous optic neuropathy, including tubercles on the optic nerve.
Panuveitis — severe inflammation involving all layers and compartments of the eye, more common in immunocompromised patients.

### Dexamethasone intravitreal implant in serpiginous choroiditis [^2ee7eba5]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone (DEX) intravitreal implant in patients with active serpiginous choroiditis (SC) already receiving maximal tolerated systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

In this retrospective longitudinal study we evaluated patients receiving 0.7mg DEX intravitreal implant for active SC despite maximal systemic immunosuppression. Medical history was reviewed over a period of 18months for each patient. We diagnosed SC activity using direct fundus examination and blue-light fundus autofluorescence. Primary outcomes were the rate of disease control and functional changes at end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of injection-related adverse events and the success of immunosuppression tapering at the last examination.

Results

We examined eight eyes of seven patients. We controlled SC activity with one injection in five eyes, two injections in one eye, and three injections in two eyes (total of 13 implants). Best-corrected visual acuity at the end of the investigational period improved in two eyes (25%), remained stable in four eyes (50%) and decreased in two eyes (25%). Three eyes showed transient intraocular pressure increase and two eyes disclosed cataract progression. The average dosage of systemic prednisone at baseline and after DEX intravitreal implant decreased from 8.8 to 2.8mg/day.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone intravitreal implant may be an effective treatment option to control active serpiginous lesions in patients in whom increased systemic corticosteroid therapy is contraindicated.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^f8c7b39a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

In terms of patient well-being, reduction in steroid dose, particularly to 7.5 mg or below per day, is a notable improvement and similarly a reduction or discontinuation of other immunosuppressants.

Improvement is established by one of the following:

Reduction in uveitis activity measured by AC cells or vitreous haze measured by SUN criteria. Although for clinical trials a 2-step improvement is required, for practice a single step would signify improvement but care should be taken that assessors are strictly adhering to SUN grading levels (ie, using standard image chart for vitreous haze), and if possible the same assessor will improve consistency.
Reduction in extent and activity of chorioretinitis as recorded with widefield fundus colour images or autofluorescence. Pretreatment and post-treatment WFFA can help to define reduction in chorioretinitis (see section on ocular imaging). Pretreatment and post-treatment widefield indocyanine green angiography may identify reduction in choroidal granulomas, but in practice other measures (including colour images or autofluoresence) are likely to be as clinically useful. Autofluorescence is increasingly used in the monitoring of serpiginous chorioretinitis, where a hyper-autofluorescent border of a lesion is suggestive of ongoing disease activity while a hypofluorescent lesion is regarded as being inactive.
Reduction in extent and activity of retinal vasculitis as measured on pre and post-treatment WFFA (see section 5 paragraph on ocular imaging). Vascular leak as an indication of active disease should improve with treatment (but may not resolve completely, especially if the leak is in response to contiguous retinal ischaemia). Vascular occlusion will usually remain after the retinal vasculitis is inactive although there may be some reperfusion after treatment. Disc or retinal neovascularisation secondary to retinal ischaemia would not be expected to improve with treatment for TB, so specific treatment would be required (peripheral retinal laser to ischaemic zones, or intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy).
A reduction in steroid load (frequency of drops or oral dose) is seen as improvement after treatment, where higher maintenance doses or repeat high-dose regimens may have been required to achieve and maintain disease control. Likewise, if other immunosuppression can be reduced.
If the uveitis is characterised by frequent flares then a reduction in their frequency. A flare would be characterised by a 2-step worsening of AC cells or vitreous haze; or reactivation of chorioretinitis or retinal vasculitis after inactivity. However, OTB tends to be chronic and progressive, without periods of remission between flares.

### Pitfalls in the management of TB-associated uveitis [^2252e55f]. Eye (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study is to highlight the pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis (TB)-associated uveitis.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of case records of four patients with TB-associated uveitis.

Results

In cases 1 and 2, failure to treat tubercular uveitis with anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) and unopposed steroid therapy led to a serious systemic consequence — development of intra-cranial tuberculoma. In case 4, similar failure to initiate ATT caused recurrent disease (focal choroiditis) in the eye. All four cases showed appearance of new lesions or worsening of existing lesions in the eye, following initiation of ATT. Such paradoxical reactions resolved by adding/increasing corticosteroid therapy.

Conclusion

TB-associated uveitis needs a strong index of suspicion for diagnosis and a combined anti-tubercular plus anti-inflammatory therapy for successful outcome.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^5294eb9b]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare, idiopathic eye disease characterized by asymmetrically bilateral, recurrent, progressive inflammation of the choroid that results in atrophy of the choriocapillaris and RPE. To our knowledge, ours is the first documented case of macular serpiginous choroiditis presenting after a COVID-19 infection.

Macular serpiginous choroiditis was diagnosed after a comprehensive assessment to eliminate possible causes that may be masquerading as placoid maculopathy. The most common etiology, tuberculosis-related serpiginous-like choroiditis, was deemed to be unlikely because there was no known exposure to tuberculosis and the interferon gamma release assay bloodwork was negative. The differentiation between serpiginous choroiditis and serpiginous-like choroiditis is critical because the immunosuppressive drugs used for serpiginous choroiditis can reactivate and exacerbate tuberculosis infection. The observed macular presentation was distinct from that of tuberculosis-related serpiginous-like choroiditis, which typically involves stippled, multifocal lesions in the posterior pole and fundus periphery and is often associated with significant vitritis. Similarly, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, which presents with large yellowish, multifocal placoid lesions and significant vitritis in immunocompromised hosts, was ruled out by laboratory work. In addition, the characteristic imaging hallmarks of acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis were not seen on OCT, including reversible, irregular focal thickening and nodularity of the RPE with a disrupted EZ, and progressive hyperfluorescence with focal hypofluorescence or leopard spotting was not seen on fluorescein angiography. All other infectious workups were negative.

### Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in intraocular fluid of 11 suspected tuberculous uveitis patients by multiplex PCR [^daca1749]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the context of diagnosing tuberculous uveitis, multimodal imaging tests play a crucial role alongside clinical presentation, especially when PCR detection of MTBC in intraocular fluid yields negative results. Various findings from multimodal imaging can provide significant clues suggestive of tuberculous uveitis. These include granulomatous anterior uveitis associated with extensive posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous choroiditis, among others. In our study, despite negative results from multiplex PCR testing for MTBC in intraocular fluid, we diagnosed 15 patients with clinically suspected tuberculous uveitis based on their ocular clinical presentations and comprehensive multimodal imaging examinations. Importantly, we opted to continue anti-TB therapy for these patients, leading to successful treatment completion in 11 patients. This underscores the clinical decision-making process where the absence of positive PCR results does not definitively rule out tuberculous uveitis, especially in the presence of suggestive clinical and imaging findings.

This study had several limitations that should be clarified. First, PCR detection necessitates low nucleic acid concentration in samples, theoretically allowing for testing of aqueous humor, vitreous stock, and diluted vitreous lavage fluid samples. However, due to cost and logistical constraints, primarily aqueous humor samples were used. Future research could consider including additional vitreous humor samples if feasible. Second, the study's sample size was limited. Future studies with larger samples could be conducted to better characterize the clinical features of patients who respond effectively to anti-TB therapy.

### Idiopathic multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy [^90df6955]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report nine cases of multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy.

Methods

A retrospective observational case series of eyes with multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy. Multimodal imaging findings were reviewed and presented.

Results

Fifteen eyes of 9 patients (6 women and 3 men), with a mean age of 48.1 years (median, 46 years; range, 23–74 years), presented with multifocal choroiditis serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy. All 15 eyes presented with serpiginoid peripapillary changes and had discrete patches of atrophy or punched-out scars in the posterior pole or periphery. Eleven eyes (73.3%) had cone-shaped retinal pigment epithelium elevations on optical coherence tomography, 10 eyes (66.7%) had mild vitritis, and 4 eyes (26.7%) had peripheral curvilinear streak lesions. Three eyes (20%) had choroidal neovascularization. All patients responded well to treatment with systemic immunosuppression, local corticosteroid injections, and/or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections.

Conclusion

Multifocal choroiditis may present with peripapillary chorioretinal changes resembling a serpiginous-like choroiditis in addition to the classic findings of patches of atrophy or punched-out scars in the posterior pole or periphery, cone-shaped retinal pigment epithelium elevated on optical coherence tomography and peripheral curvilinear streak lesions.

### Detection of type 1 choroidal neovascular membranes using optical coherence tomography angiography in tubercular posterior uveitis [^ee161143]. Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To study optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and multimodal imaging features of Type 1 inflammatory choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis and response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

Methods

In this study, multimodal imaging was performed using OCTA, enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Correlation of OCTA with other imaging modalities in the detection of CNV was performed. The changes in CNV configuration after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy were assessed.

Results

In this study, nine eyes (8 patients; 5 females; mean age: 32.5 ± 11.57 years) with diagnosis of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis were included. All the eyes had presence of low-lying pigment epithelial detachments on enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography. Using OCTA, it was possible to detect Type 1 CNV in all eyes. Type 1 CNV networks comprised fine anastomotic network of vessels, some of which had a hairpin loop configuration. After anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, there was a decrease in branching and anastomosis. The visual acuity significantly improved from 0.49 ± 0.26 (20/60 Snellen equivalent) at baseline to 0.26 ± 0.17 (20/36 Snellen equivalent) (P = 0.03) in all eyes.

Conclusion

Type 1 CNV can occur among patients with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis, leading to significant visual loss even in the healed stages of the disease. Optical coherence tomography angiography can help in the detection of Type 1 CNV where conventional multimodal imaging, including fluorescein angiography and OCT, fails to make a definitive diagnosis and thereby guide the initiation of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

### Clinical presentations and therapeutic effect of presumed choroidal tuberculosis [^2c9736a6]. Retina (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present the clinical findings and to evaluate the therapeutic response to systemic antituberculosis (anti-TB) therapy in 18 cases of presumed choroidal TB.

Methods

Retrospective noncomparative interventional case series. Eighteen patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination and relevant laboratory and radiologic investigations. All patients were treated with systemic anti-TB therapy accordingly.

Results

In 18 cases of choroidal TB, there were 8 men and 10 women ranging in age from 8 years to 52 years. Ten patients also had evidence of pulmonary TB and among of them, two patients had coexistent central nervous system TB, one patient had lymphoid TB, and one patient had abdominal TB. Those cases had varied clinical presentations including tubercle, tuberculoma, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous like choroiditis, and/or diffuse choroiditis. Two cases (11.1%) had bilateral presentation. All patients were referred to a TB specialist to initiate a full standard course of anti-TB therapy according to the guideline of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Aside from one case, which worsened to panophthalmitis, the others responded to anti-TB therapy very well. None of the patients had human immunodeficiency virus and none was immunocompromised.

Conclusion

Choroidal TB may present as variable clinical manifestations and occasionally be misdiagnosed as intraocular tumor or metastatic tumor. In our case series, the prognosis of this disease was well by giving systemic anti-TB therapy. So all ophthalmologists especially in developing countries should have a high degree of clinical suspicion to maximally maintain visual acuity.

### Presumed tubercular serpiginouslike choroiditis: clinical presentations and management [^e585dabb]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Choroiditis, choroidal tubercles, and tuberculomas are well known ocular manifestations of systemic tuberculosis. The present series aimed to report the occurrence of serpiginouslike choroiditis of presumed tubercular origin.

Design

Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.

Participants

Eleven eyes in seven consecutive patients with a diagnosis of choroidal tuberculosis simulating serpiginous choroiditis were studied between 1997 and 2000. TESTING AND INTERVENTION: All patients had their fundus photographs taken at the time of initial presentation as well as during follow-up. All patients underwent a Mantoux skin test and chest radiography. In addition, five patients had their aqueous or vitreous humor subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sputum examination, biopsy, or both were carried out whenever recommended by the pulmonologist. Systemic antituberculosis chemotherapy was instituted in combination with treatment for ocular inflammation.

Main Outcome Measure

Therapeutic response and visual improvement.

Results

There were five men and two women ranging in age from 17 to 32 years. Clinical presentations included three morphologic variants; multifocal progressive choroiditis showing wavelike progression to confluent, diffuse lesions resembling serpiginous choroiditis (three eyes); diffuse choroiditis characterized by diffuse plaquelike choroiditis with an amoeboid pattern suggestive of serpiginous choroiditis at initial presentation (four eyes); and mixed variety where opposite eyes had mixed features (four eyes). All patients had strongly positive Mantoux skin test results and positive chest radiograph results. The PCR results from aqueous and vitreous humor in four samples was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis; one had sputum positive for acid-fast bacilli, whereas two had histopathologic evidence of tuberculosis from cervical or parahilar lymph nodes. Treatment was associated with resolution of choroidal lesions and visual improvement. Final visual acuity of 20/30 or better was achieved in five eyes.

Conclusions

Choroidal tuberculosis may present as multifocal progressive or diffuse choroiditis resembling serpiginous choroiditis. It is important to recognize these presentations because these eyes show good response to systemic antituberculosis chemotherapy.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^3d1d8859]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Various forms of posterior uveitis have been reported after COVID-19 infection. To date, there have been 2 reported instances of ampiginous choroiditis, an entity sharing features of serpiginous choroiditis. The patients, both in their early 20s, developed bilateral ampiginous choroiditis approximately 1 week after COVID-19 infection. Similar to the report from Providência et al,1 patient had preexisting retinal lesions, suggesting that COVID-19 may have triggered a reactivation. Our patient did not have evidence of previously known retinal disease. Furthermore, there have been reports linking COVID-19 to other forms of inflammatory choroidopathies, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, punctate inner choroidopathy, and multifocal choroiditis. In addition, numerous patients have presented with MEWDS after COVID-19 infection. – Although a subset of patients had evidence of previous inflammatory ocular disease, many were young healthy patients presenting for the first time. Some presented acutely during or immediately after COVID-19 infection, while others, like our patient, experienced a delayed onset of weeks to months.

The temporal association between our patient's COVID-19 infection and the onset of serpiginous choroiditis raises intriguing questions about the role of the virus in triggering or exacerbating such conditions. Causation cannot be definitively established; however, our findings echo the sentiments of other researchers who have proposed a potential link between COVID-19 and choroidal inflammation. Many studies have noted optic nerve and vascular changes occurring weeks to months after COVID-19 infection, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy starting 6 weeks after infection and MEWDS symptoms developing 10 weeks after infection. However, these timelines are not exhaustive because retinopathies may initially go undetected when asymptomatic. Our observations align with this concept, showing that chorioretinal changes can manifest subacutely as the disease progresses. Nonetheless, serpiginous choroiditis is extremely rare, comprising 1% to 5% of all uveitis cases in areas of nonendemic tuberculosis, while COVID-19 is an increasingly common disease.

### What does IGRA testing add to the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis? A Bayesian latent class analysis [^500c688e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

In another series by Ahn et al. from Korea (low endemic setting), the authors found strong correlation of positive IGRA in presumed ocular TB. They also found retinal vasculitis and posterior uveitis to be the clinical phenotypes associated with tubercular uveitis (TAU) or ocular TB. Cordero-Coma et al. established immune response prevalence of 32.25% in 31 uveitis patients from Spain with estimated sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 100% with NPV of 86% for positive QFT. Mackensen et al. in 2008 and Gupta et al. in 2010 had established the association of QFT with serpiginous like choroiditis. Babu et al. have demonstrated the use of QFT in the diagnosis of presumed ocular TB in a prospective pilot study from a high endemic region. Sensitivity of QFT was shown to be 82% with specificity of 76% for diagnosis of intraocular TB based on clinical signs suggested by Gupta et al. However, in patients with a definite culture or biopsy proven systemic TB, the test has shown only 58% sensitivity and 77% specificity, highlighting the limitation of QFT in diagnosing active systemic TB.

In a population where TB is non-endemic, such as the UK, sensitivity of IGRAs is thought not to be as good as TST. Furthermore, specificity of the test has also been questioned. If IGRAs have helped clinicians with a new window of opportunity to diagnose latent TB it has also caused a reasonable degree of confusion with regards to its false positive and false negative results, with particular variation in low-endemic regions. It is hence essential to review the application and utility of IGRAs in low-endemic countries such as the UK.

The use of ATT to manage ocular TB is regarded as an effective treatment for ocular TB and response to therapy can be a good surrogate for diagnosis of ocular TB. Bansal et al. showed a reduced recurrence of ocular TB following ATT, in addition to steroids. ATT clears latent TB infection and subsequently protects against the manifestation of active TB in up to 90% of patients. Overall it would be expected that ATT would have been effective in treating ocular TB in this study and thus preventing any recurrence. It is unlikely that treatment failure in this study group could be attributed to failure of the ATT itself, and it can be compounded due to the heterogeneity in treatment regimen, inadequate treatment length, antibiotic resistance or non-compliance with the drug regimen.

### Fundus autofluorescence in serpiginouslike choroiditis [^9116ac66]. Retina (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the fundus autofluorescence characteristics in serpiginouslike choroiditis.

Methods

Twenty-nine patients with presumed tubercular serpiginouslike choroiditis between November 2008 and January 2010 underwent fundus autofluorescence imaging during the acute stage and at regular intervals till the lesions healed. All patients received antitubercular therapy with oral corticosteroids. The autofluorescence images were compared with color fundus photography and fundus fluorescein angiography. The main outcome measure was fundus autofluorescence characteristics of lesions during the course of the disease.

Results

The pattern of fundus autofluorescence changed as the lesions evolved from the acute to the healed stage. In acute stage, the lesions showed an ill-defined halo of increased autofluorescence (hyperautofluorescence), giving it a diffuse, amorphous appearance (Stage I, acute). As the lesions began to heal, a thin rim of decreased autofluorescence (hypoautofluorescence) surrounded the lesion, defining its edges. The lesions showed predominantly hyperautofluorescence with stippled pattern (Stage II, subacute). With further healing, the hypoautofluorescence progressed and the lesion appeared predominantly hypoautofluorescent with stippled pattern (Stage III, nearly resolved). On complete healing, the lesions became uniformly hypoautofluorescent (Stage IV, completely resolved).

Conclusion

Fundus autofluorescence highlighted the areas of disease activity and was a quick imaging tool for monitoring the course of lesions in serpiginouslike choroiditis.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^93b0480d]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Vasculitis — treatment considerations state that when vasculitis is confirmed, topical/periocular steroids may be considered for unilateral ocular involvement, whereas bilateral involvement, advanced vision loss, and/or systemic comorbidities often necessitate systemic treatment with corticosteroids, antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, biologics, or intravenous immunoglobulins, and infectious causes must be ruled out before immunosuppression.

### Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings in serpiginous choroiditis [^581abdff]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

Twenty-four eyes of 12 patients with SC were examined at our department of Ophthalmology. Eight patients (67%) were female and 4 male (33%). The mean age of all patients on the date of data collection was 60 +/− 15.6 standard deviation (SD) years.

One patient (2 eyes) was diagnosed with macular SC, 2 with atypical SC, and 9 with peripapillary SC. One eye was excluded due to the presence of significant macular edema and one due to the interruption of the examination, as requested by the patient owing to lightheadedness.

In total, 22 eyes of 12 patients with the diagnosis of currently inactive SC were examined and evaluated. Patient demographics and disease status are shown in more detail in Table 1.

A atypical; M macular; P peripapillary; OD right eye; OS left eye; OU both eyes

The mean BCVA was 20/100 [0.71 logMAR (SD 0.96)] with a median of 20/36 [0.25 logMAR (range 0–3)]. Three patients (25%) were under therapy with Cyclosporine A with a daily dose range of 1–3 mg/kg. Two patients (17%) were treated with Interferon alpha-2a (3 Mio. IE every 3 days) and another 2 patients (17%) with Methotrexate (15 mg/week). Other therapies consisted of Azathioprine (75 mg/day), Adalimumab (40 mg s.c. every 2 weeks) in combination with corticosteroids (7.5 mg/day), and Methotrexate (7.5 mg/week) in combination with corticosteroids (7.5 mg/day), each in one patient. One patient did not receive any therapy as shown in Table 1. Mean duration of disease was 5.8 years (SD 4.0) with a median of 5.9 years. Mean time since last recurrence was 4.5 years (SD 4.0) with a median of 3 years.

### Longitudinal analysis of serum cytokine profile among patients with tubercular multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis: a pilot study [^40439603]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the serum cytokines profile in patients with tubercular multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis (TB MSC) receiving anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) and oral corticosteroids.

Methods

In this prospective longitudinal study, patients with active TB MSC were included. Serum levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were analyzed using bead-based immunoassay. The levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β were measured using cytokine bead array. Serial measurement was performed at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 weeks after initiation of therapy. Patients developing paradoxical worsening (PW) of TB MSC were identified and their serum levels of cytokines were compared with those patients who showed healing of lesions. Comparison of cytokine levels with baseline values was also performed.

Results

Twelve patients (three females) were included in the study. Four patients showed paradoxical worsening of TB MSC at 3.2 ± 1 weeks after initiation of therapy. Compared to patients who showed healing of lesions, patients with PW showed higher baseline IL-10 (not significant; p = 0.28). Among patients developing PW, levels of IFN-γ peaked at 1 week ((p = 0.01) and levels of TNF-α peaked at 3 weeks (p = 0.02) (coinciding with PW) compared to patients who showed healing. There was no significant difference in TGF-β levels at any time point in either group (p > 0.47).

Conclusions

Baseline and serial levels of inflammatory serum cytokines may help in predicting the response to ATT and corticosteroids in TB MSC. Patients with paradoxical worsening may show rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines after initiation of ATT indicating higher bacillary load.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^759dc98b]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although respiratory disease from SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively documented, the ocular associations related to COVID-19 continue to be reported in the literature. Conjunctivitis remains the most frequent COVID-19 ocular manifestation (11.4%); however, an increasing number of cases of retinal and choroidal involvement have been reported. Diverse posterior segment manifestations have been found, including cotton-wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, posterior uveitis, retinal ischemia, and optic neuropathies. Some centers have had a significant increase in white-dot syndrome referrals during the pandemic, including serpiginous choroiditis.

Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare, idiopathic, sight-threatening posterior uveitis often observed in healthy young or middle-aged individuals that tends to have a poor visual prognosis. It is characterized by asymmetric, recurrent, progressive inflammation of the choroid, resulting in atrophy of the choriocapillaris and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Although the exact pathogenesis is unclear, serpiginous choroiditis has been proposed to be immunogenic in nature, often preceded by a viral prodrome. Various infectious etiologies have been implicated, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and the herpes virus.COVID-19 has also been proposed as an immunologic trigger for reactivation of serpiginous choroiditis, with 1 documented case to date of recurrence after COVID-19 infection.

We present what to our knowledge is the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis onset after COVID-19 infection.

### Antigen-specific intraocular cytokine responses distinguish ocular tuberculosis from undifferentiated uveitis in tuberculosis-immunoreactive patients [^a5c88d90]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Inclusion And Exclusion Criteria

Patients requiring diagnostic or therapeutic vitrectomy for the management of intraocular inflammation between October 1, 2020 and November 30, 2021 were included in the study. All patients had vitreous haze of ≥ 2+ (National Institutes of Health photographic scale) at the time of surgery. All patients included in the study received a TST (5 tuberculin units; Span Diagnostics, India), wherein ≥ 10 mm of induration at the end of 48 hours was considered a positive reaction. IGRAs were not performed in all patients because these tests are not recommended in the guidelines for management of extrapulmonary TB in India. The study was approved by the LV Prasad Eye Institute Ethics Committee (study code 2019-133-IM-26) and adhered to the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before their inclusion in the study.

For data analysis, the diagnosis of OTB was restricted to patients fulfilling the SUN classification criteria (published online April 2, 2021), and/or positive TB-PCR from vitreous samples. The SUN criteria included 4 clinical signs in the posterior segment: serpiginous-like choroiditis, occlusive retinal vasculitis, choroidal tuberculoma, and multifocal choroiditis (in the presence of active systemic TB). The OTB classification was applied when clinical signs were accompanied by evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (histologic/microbiologic, positive IGRA, or positive TST) and negative tests for sarcoidosis and syphilis. Patients with positive TST with or without IGRA but having undifferentiated uveitis not fulfilling SUN classification criteria for OTB and having negative TB-PCR were categorized as UNK. Patients with negative TST with or without a negative IGRA and having negative TB-PCR were categorized as non-TB control subjects. Finally, those with a positive TST with or without IGRA but presenting with a well-characterized non-TB entity were excluded from the study.

Indications For Pars Plana Vitrectomy In The Study

Indications for pars plana vitrectomy included: 1) clearing of inflammatory debris in patients with nonresolving or recurrent inflammation after corticosteroid or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy; 2) diagnostic vitrectomy to sample for PCR assay; and 3) management of complications of uveitis, such as rhegmatogenous or tractional retinal detachment, in the presence of active inflammation. However, eyes with vitreous haemorrhage were excluded.

### Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in intraocular fluid of 11 suspected tuberculous uveitis patients by multiplex PCR [^c584a26a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study approval and criteria for patient selection

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution (Approval number: 2021ky318) and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, and all participants provided informed consent before enrollment. We collected data from 15 patients (18 eyes) with clinically suspected tuberculous uveitis who underwent PCR detection of intraocular fluid at our hospital from December 2019 to December 2021. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for tuberculous uveitis: (a) Presenting with uveitis as the primary clinical manifestation, including acute anterior uveitis, chronic granulomatous anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, panuveitis, retinal vasculitis, choroidal nodule, multifocal choroiditis, choroidal granuloma, serpiginous choroiditis, among others; (b) Positive T-SPOT or purified protein derivative (PPD) test, presence of active TB focus or calcification focus on chest CT; (c) Exclusion of uveitis caused by other pathogenic factors, such as infectious agents (bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections), autoimmune disorders, and systemic inflammatory diseases; (2) Received at least six months of effective antituberculosis (anti-TB) therapy; (3) Provided informed consent to participate in the study; (4) Underwent regular follow-up with comprehensive case data recording. The study exclusion criteria were: (1) Presence of severe systemic diseases such as cardiac, cerebral, or renal disorders; (2) Refusal to participate in the study.

Clinical evaluations and diagnostics

All patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations, including slit lamp examination, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Additionally, chest CT scans and routine serum tests for uveitis-related markers, including infection and immune markers, were performed for all patients. A senior ophthalmologist with more than 10 years in our department integrated the patients' ocular manifestations, multimodal imaging findings, and laboratory results (including positive T-SPOT or PPD tests and chest CT findings) to exclude other forms of uveitis and clinically diagnose them with tuberculous uveitis.

### Relapse in ocular tuberculosis: relapse rate, risk factors and clinical management in a non-endemic country [^7c5608ce]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment group

We defined three treatment groups in this study: treatment group A: ATT (± local steroids), for patients treated without oral CS/IMT during the ATT course; treatment group B: combined ATT and CS/IMT, for those received CS/IMT during the ATT course for the initial uveitis presentation and treatment group C: without ATT, if no ATT was being given and the patient was only treated with local and/or systemic IMT. IMT involved a range of therapeutic drugs, including steroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (ie, methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil) and biologics (ie, anti-TNF and anti-IL-6 therapies) that was prescribed in a stepwise manner.

Good and poor responders

We assessed inflammatory activity at 6 months following treatment initiation for the initial uveitis in all patients. Good responders were defined as patients who met all of the following criteria at the first 6 months of treatment for initial uveitis episode: (1) absence of active inflammation in the retina, choroid, episclera or sclera, with both eyes showing ≤ 0.5+ AC or vitreous cells; (2) oral prednisone or its equivalent reduced to < 10 mg daily; (3) topical 1% prednisolone acetate (or equivalent) reduced to no more than two drops daily and (4) discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy with the exception of prednisone use < 10 mg daily. Patients who did not achieve these criteria were considered as poor responders.

Clinical inactivity

Clinical inactivity in this context was determined by a period of at least 90 days where both eyes exhibited AC cells ≤ 0.5+, vitreous cells/haze ≤ 0.5+ and the absence of any other form of clinically active uveitis, such as retinal or choroidal lesions. This assessment was conducted by the attending uveitis specialist, based on slit lamp examination and considering the results of any multimodal imaging modalities that were performed. In line with this definition, our study included patients who fulfilled the 'remission' criteria established by SUN, as well as those who achieved clinical inactivity while maintaining their anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive medication, reflecting the scenarios encountered in real-world clinical practice.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^a8f291d7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Recognised ocular phenotypes associated with TB

OTB refers to pathology inside the eye thought to be related to the host's infection by Mtb. Evidence of TB remote to the eye supports a diagnosis of OTB, but failure to demonstrate systemic disease does not exclude the possibility of OTB. Depending on the site and extent of involvement, patients may be asymptomatic or present with reduced vision, photophobia, floaters, ocular discomfort or redness(see box 1).

Box 1
Summary of ocular tuberculosis (OTB)

OTB is a clinical diagnosis and refers to intra-ocular inflammation (uveitis) associated with presumed or proven TB infection.
Typical uveitic presentations include peripheral occlusive retinal vasculitis, choroidal granulomas and inflammation of the retinal pigment epithelium.
Granulomatous anterior uveitis should be regarded with suspicion in patients from TB endemic areas or with other TB risk factors.

'Uveitis' refers to inflammation within the eye and can be anatomically classified as depicted in figure 2 (modified from Kanski's Clinical Ophthalmology — A Systematic Approach, ninth Edition, fig 12.1, p424).

Figure 2
Anatomical classification of uveitis depicting structures affected in anterior, intermediate and posterior uveitis.

OTB typically presents as a posterior uveitis, commonly affecting the retina and choroid. Peripheral occlusive retinal vasculitis, choroidal granulomas and 'ampiginous' choroidopathy (known as serpiginous chorioretinopathy') are recognised as classic presentations. However, many cases of presumed OTB present atypically, with phenotypic variation between different patient populations.

The focus of this document is intra-ocular inflammation associated with TB and this spectrum of pathology is described below, from anterior to posterior compartments. For completness, comments on TB-associated ocular surface and orbital disease are included, though these presentations are beyond the scope of this document.

### Placoid lesions of the retina: progress in multimodal imaging and clinical perspective [^6b3a3875]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Placoid lesions of the retina may be secondary to a wide spectrum of acquired inflammatory conditions that have been reported as single entities with different presentation and clinical course. These conditions include acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, persistent placoid maculopathy, serpiginous choroiditis, serpiginous-like choroiditis, relentless placoid chorioretinitis and acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. In this article, we will group these conditions under the name of 'placoids'. The recognition of the specific condition may be challenging in clinical practice, often resulting in diagnostic and therapeutic delay. Given the complex nature of placoids and their similarities, a systematic approach including differentiating between infectious and non-infectious aetiologies increases the chance of reaching the correct diagnosis. Detailed history and comprehensive clinical examination are the first steps to formulate a diagnostic hypothesis that should be corroborated by multimodal imaging and appropriate investigations. The advent of multimodal imaging has made it possible to extensively study placoids and revealed a constellation of specific findings that may help clinicians in the diagnostic process. The treatment of the conditions other than syphilis is complex and sometimes challenging. Our article is aimed at giving an overview of the individual entities associated with placoids and discussing the differential diagnosis. A practical and systematic approach is then proposed.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^65d530eb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

If, after a period of 6 months of ATT, patients with a diagnosis of presumed OTB continue to experience recurrent flare-ups, require ongoing high-dose steroid maintenance or augmentation of immunosuppression to control uveitis, or who exhibit progression of chorioretinitis or vasculitis on clinical examination or retinal imaging, then it would be concluded that ATT was ineffective and the cause of the ocular inflammation likely not to be TB.

It may be challenging to differentiate deterioration due to active disease (or a failure of treatment) from deterioration due to sequelae of inflammation. For instance, in a patient with retinal vasculitis who develops neovascularisation, treatment with ATT may be successful in achieving improvement in inflammation, however, the patient may still suffer recurrent vitreous haemorrhage. Similarly, in a patient with chorioretinitis, ATT may bring about control of inflammation, however, patients may still develop choroidal neovascularisation requiring antiVEGF therapy. Such scenarios require a good understanding of the condition and the ability to explain such situations to the affected patient.

In summary, the response of different manifestations of uveitis are measured with different ocular assessments. AC cells and vitreous haze measurement are standardised by SUN grading. A reduction in steroid load or other immunosuppressants are valid favourable outcomes.

Clinical practice points

Visual acuity alone is insufficient as a measure of outcome from treatment.
Improvement in fundus imaging can be used as an outcome measure when chorioretinitis and/or retinal vasculitis is affecting the peripheral retina.
The SUN criteria are useful standardised methods of assessing uveitis activity.
A reduction in steroid dose (typically below 7.5 mg per day) can be used as an outcome measure.

### Clinical characteristics and aetiology of uveitis in a viral haemorrhagic fever zone [^dfdeb5c8]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis is intraocular inflammation originating from the uveal tract and adjacent structures. Its prevalence varies globally. In the USA, a prevalence of 115.3 cases per 100,000 of population has been reported. In India, this was estimated at 714 per 100,000. Aetiology of uveitis, from studies in tertiary uveitis clinics, also varies globally. In the UK, Fuchs heterochromic uveitis (11.5%), sarcoid (9.7%), idiopathic uveitis (14.9%) and toxoplasmosis (6.9%) were the most common known diagnoses. In the USA these were idiopathic uveitis (34.9%), seronegative spondyloarthropathies (10.4%) and sarcoidosis (9.6%). In China, idiopathic anterior uveitis accounted for 27% of anterior uveitis, and Behcet disease (6.5%) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (15%) represented the most panuveitis cases. In India, uveitis was caused by tuberculosis in 14.5%, toxoplasmosis in 11.7% and serpiginous choroidopathy in 14.6%.

Precise assessment of choroidal inflammatory involvement

The choroid is the starting point of the inflammation in many diseases including MEWDS, APMPPE, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis, VKH, sympathetic ophthalmia and HLA-A29 BRC and is participating in the inflammatory process in many other diseases such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, posterior scleritis and many more which have extensively been analysed by ICGA. A reliable inventory of fundus inflammatory involvement can therefore only be performed with the help of ICGA. It will contribute essentially to the assessment of disease extension in those conditions involving the choroid.

In some diseases such as MEWDS only choroidal signs can be present and in others the clinically apparent part of the disease such as in multifocal choroiditis is only the peak of the iceberg (jellyfish effect) and the preponderant part of the disease can only be followed by ICGA (Fig. 20). In diseases originating from the choroid such as VKH disease the only way to detect subclinical disease is to perform ICGA (Fig. 21).

Fig. 20
Multifocal choroiditis (the jellyfish effect or constellation).

Fundus pictures show minimal signs limited to faint depigmentation (a, black arrows) and FA shows absolutely no abnormalities (b), whereas ICGA shows extensive choriocapillaris involvement with large geographic areas of non-perfusion (c, d) which we now know to be a risk factor for CNV, which the patient developed 1 year later as seen on FA (e) and fundus images (f).

Fig. 21
ICGA guided treatment of VKH disease.

VKH at presentation (1 = top left): numerous hypofluorescent dark dots (HDDs) indicating granulomatous foci in the choroid as well as fuzzy choroidal vessels indicating choroidal vasculitis. Following intravenous pulse steroid therapy followed by high dose oral steroids HDDs disappear completely and choroidal vessels regain a normal pattern (2 = top right). Upon tapering there is recrudescence of subclinical choroidal disease (3 = bottom left), that prompts re-increase of oral steroid therapy and introduction of azathioprine. After slow tapering of steroid therapy first followed by tapering of azathioprine over 2 years the patient remains recurrence free (4 = bottom right).

8 Dosage Modifications due to Serious Infections or Laboratory Abnormalities Serious Infections Hold TYENNE treatment if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled. Laboratory Abnormalities Rheumatoid Arthritis and Giant Cell Arteritis Liver Enzyme Abnormalities. Dose modify immunomodulatory agents if appropriate For persistent increases in this range:

- For patients receiving Intravenous TYENNE, hold TYENNE until ALT or AST have normalized
- For patients receiving subcutaneous TYENNE, reduce injection frequency to every other week or hold dosing until ALT or AST have normalized. Resume TYENNE at every other week and increase frequency to every week as clinically appropriate. Dose reduction of tocilizumab products has not been studied in the PJIA and SJIA populations.

Dose interruptions of TYENNE are recommended for liver enzyme abnormalities, low neutrophil counts, and low platelet counts in patients with PJIA and SJIA at levels similar to what is outlined above for patients with RA and GCA. If appropriate, dose modify or stop concomitant methotrexate and/or other medications and hold TYENNE dosing until the clinical situation has been evaluated. In PJIA and SJIA the decision to discontinue TYENNE for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical assessment of the individual patient. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS.

### Fundus autofluorescence features in the inflammatory maculopathies [^2f2d530d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The inflammatory maculopathies are a heterogeneous group of posterior uveitis syndromes that affect the macula with primary involvement of the inner and outer retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and the choroid. These conditions include acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMNR), acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), multifocal choroiditis (MFC), punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC), serpiginous choroiditis, and unilateral acute idiopathic maculopathy (UAIM). "Ampiginous" choroiditis, an entity bearing clinical features of APMPPE with more widespread and sometimes recurrent involvement, similar to the pattern observed in serpiginous choroiditis, is often included in this group of syndromes.

Most patients with an inflammatory maculopathy present with painless loss of vision with or without a viral prodrome, but differ in their clinical presentation, need for treatment, and visual prognosis. The rarity of these maculopathies and diverse spectrum of disease presentation can make the diagnosis and management challenging. Fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography have traditionally helped to differentiate these maculopathies and allow precise imaging of physiologic changes within the retina and choroid, while spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) has allowed us to visualize anatomic changes in posterior segment tissues. Advances in our understanding of these architectural changes have refined our abilities to diagnose and understand inflammatory pathologies involving the macula.–

Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging provides additional information regarding naturally occurring fluorophores including lipofuscin, which may accumulate during tissue injury and herald future RPE and overlying photoreceptor damage. Acute inflammation may alter the quantity and the quality of autofluorescence signal during the acute stage of macular disease. The structural changes in the RPE that occur after the tissue injury during the acute stage of inflammation may also lead to permanent changes in auto-fluorescence, which are visible on imaging as a decreased, or hypoautofluorescent, signal.–In some cases of posterior uveitis, such as serpiginous choroiditis, hyperautofluorescence at the border of a chorioretinal scar may herald the active phase of illness, while hypoautofluorescence is seen during disease convalescence.

### Classification criteria for serpiginous choroiditis [^eb757686]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine classification criteria for serpiginous choroiditis.

Design

Machine learning of cases with serpiginous choroiditis and 8 other posterior uveitides.

Methods

Cases of posterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the infectious posterior uveitides / panuveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated on the validation set.

Results

One thousand sixty-eight cases of posterior uveitides, including 122 cases of serpiginous choroiditis, were evaluated by machine learning. Key criteria for serpiginous choroiditis included (1) choroiditis with an ameboid or serpentine shape; (2) characteristic imaging on fluorescein angiography or fundus autofluorescence; (3) absent to mild anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation; and (4) the exclusion of tuberculosis. Overall accuracy for posterior uveitides was 93.9% in the training set and 98.0% (95% confidence interval 94.3, 99.3) in the validation set. The misclassification rates for serpiginous choroiditis were 0% in both the training set and the validation set.

Conclusions

The criteria for serpiginous choroiditis had a low misclassification rate and seemed to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.

### Endogenous tuberculous endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis: a systematic review of case reports and case series [^a37f744d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Definitions and Eligibility Criteria

Case reports and case series reporting original data of endogenous TB endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis were included. Endogenous TB endophthalmitis was defined as purulent intraocular inflammation due to hematogenous spread of MTBC, with rapid progression. Panophthalmitis was defined as severe acute suppurative intraocular inflammation with extension to the cornea or sclera, secondary to endogenous spread of MTBC. A priori, to avoid excluding older studies, our definition of MTBC infection did not require a confirmed mycobacterial culture or positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Rather, all cases that were reported as endogenous "TB endophthalmitis" or "panophthalmitis" by the original authors were included. Cases, that were not explicitly labeled as "endophthalmitis" or "panophthalmitis" by the original authors, meeting our definition were also included, after careful review of each case. Cases of multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis, chorioretinitis and tuberculomas without an associated rapidly progressive purulent panuveitis were excluded. Studies reporting post-operative and post-traumatic endophthalmitis and cases of non-tuberculous mycobacteria were excluded. We also excluded all pathological studies not including enough clinical information, studies that contained non-original data and those with no full-text available. Studies in languages other than English that could not be translated by the authors were also excluded.

### Fundus autofluorescence features in the inflammatory maculopathies [^972e2801]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

PIC

Three patients with PIC were evaluated with FAF imaging. The location of the lesions throughout the macula varied and included foveal, perifoveal, and peripapillary locations. The active lesions showed hyperautofluorescent borders surrounding hypoautofluorescent centers. The hyperautofluorescent areas also coincided with the location of prior choroidal neovascularization. The active lesions became hypoautofluorescent during the convalescent phase of disease illness (Figure 6).

MFC

Three female patients were included and presented with bilateral involvement with multiple lesions throughout the macula and mid-periphery. All patients were on immunosuppressive therapy at the time of recurrence. The active lesions appeared white or cream-colored and predominated in the retinal periphery. Because of the peripheral location of some of the lesions, visualized clinically and by fundus photography, the autofluorescence of these lesions was not quantifiable. FAF also demonstrated hyperautofluorescence in a petaloid configuration in one patient with bilateral cystoid macular edema (Figure 7). Patients with active lesions showed hyperautofluorescence of the lesions, whereas inactive lesions were found to be hypoautofluorescent.

Serpiginous choroiditis

Four patients with serpiginous choroiditis were assessed with FAF imaging in this series and all patients were treated with immunosuppressive therapy (ie, corticosteroids, corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppression, or both). All eyes demonstrated typical geographic lesions emanating from the peripapillary region. Disease activity was confirmed by the presence of new lesions by fluorescein angiography. Active borders of the serpiginous lesions coincided with hyperautofluorescence on FAF imaging (Figure 8). As immunosuppression was escalated and the disease progressed to convalescence, the previously observed hyperautofluorescence progressed through stages of intermixed hypo- and hyperautofluorescence to a homogeneous hypoautofluorescent appearance tightly corresponding to the zone of chorioretinal atrophy observed clinically and by fundus photography.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^b7763e8e]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

On fundus photography, the macular atrophic lesion appeared as a gray–yellow patch with indistinct borders (Figure 3, A and B). Fundus autofluorescence showed a corresponding hypoautofluorescent macular lesion surrounded by an amoeboid hyperautofluorescent ring projecting away from the fovea (Figure 4B). OCT angiography (OCTA) en face analysis showed severe inner choroidal ischemia at the lesion site (Figure 3, C and F). There was no macular neovascularization on OCTA. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) analysis also showed early-phase and late-phase hypofluorescence of the lesion, indicating choroidal ischemia (Figure 3, D and E).

Figure 3.
Multimodal imaging of the choroidal lesion 1 month after initial presentation. True color fundus photography of (A) the right eye and (B) the left eye shows a large unilateral gray–yellow macular lesion in the left eye. Indocyanine green angiography of the left eye shows hypofluorescence of the lesion during (D) the early phase and (E) the late phase of the study that corresponds with choroidal nonperfusion. Optical coherence tomography angiography en face analysis of (C) the choriocapillaris and (F) the choroid in the left eye shows severe ischemia of the affected choriocapillaris.

Figure 4.
Widefield pseudocolor fundus photography and fundus autofluorescence of the left eye at 1 month (A and B) and 4 months (C and D) from initial presentation. Images show a large foveal hypoautofluorescent lesion surrounded by an irregular hyperautofluorescence border that evolved over time.

An extensive inflammatory and infectious workup, including a complete blood count, complement proteins C3/C4, C-reactive protein, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, renal function tests, liver function tests, an antineutrophil antibody screen, and a vasculitis panel (antimyeloperoxidase, antiproteinase, antiglomerular basement membrane screens) yielded results within normal range or negative. Bartonella, toxocara serology, toxoplasma immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG, a Lyme disease antibody test, a syphilis enzyme immunoassay, an interferon gamma release assay tuberculosis test, and an HIV test were all negative. Aqueous fluid samples from the left eye were negative for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 and varicella zoster. Computed tomography of the head and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were within normal limits.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^c1e934e6]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, the patient's choroidal thickness changed over time; it was 342 µm on presentation, 378 µm 1 month later, and 233 µm 4 months later (Figure 2). Increasing choroidal thickness during acute inflammation and subsequent thinning after resolution is well-documented in posterior uveitis, consistent with an inflammatory process. The small pigment epithelial detachment observed on OCT (Figure 2C) was likely secondary to endovascular damage, increased vascular permeability, and blood–retinal barrier breakdown. Furthermore, the presence of choroidal hyperreflective foci (Figure 1) raises intriguing questions about the disease process. Although studies have shown similar findings in diabetic macular edema and dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa, there is no known evidence of similar patterns in patients with uveitis. It is speculated that these foci represent accumulations of activated microglial cells or migration of disrupted pigmented RPE cells.

To our knowledge, there is only 1 other report of serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection, in which a 41-year-old woman presented with multifocal peripapillary lesions in the left eye consistent with disease reactivation 1 month after a mild infection. Although most serpiginous choroiditis cases (80%) manifest with peripapillary lesions extending outward from the optic disc, our patient had a new onset of the rare macular variant. This variant is marked by an unfavorable prognosis attributed to early foveal involvement. A growing body of research proposes that SARS-CoV-2 may serve as a proinflammatory trigger in susceptible hosts, inducing autoimmune and autoinflammatory dysregulation. The choroid's rich vascular supply naturally fosters a favorable environment for inflammatory processes, but the exact mechanisms remain an active area of research.

### Intravitreal aflibercept for choroidal neovascularization associated with chorioretinitis: a pilot study [^b8ad54c3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In addition to the well-known causes of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), pathologic myopia, and angioid streaks, CNV may develop as a complication of chorioretinitis, with an incidence of 2%. The prevalence of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis varies among different entities, and commonly occurs in presumed ocular histoplasmosis (3.8%), toxoplasmosis (TX, 0.3%–19%), punctate inner choroidopathy (17%–40%), idiopathic multifocal choroiditis (33%), and serpiginous choroiditis (SC, 4.7%). CNV has also been reported in up to 9% of patients with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease.

There is no uniform consensus on the management of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis because of the lack of randomized or controlled clinical trials, which have not been performed due to the rarity of this condition.

There are different treatment strategies for chorioretinitis-associated CNV, including photodynamic therapy (PDT),–anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents such as bevacizumab and ranibizumab,–surgery, local and systemic corticosteroids, and combinations of these methods.

A review article published in 2014 describes the three main therapies available for CNV secondary to chorioretinitis in the last decade as PDT, intravitreal bevacizumab, and intravitreal ranibizumab. Aflibercept (EYLEA ®, Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc, Tarrytown, NY, USA), initially named VEGF Trap-Eye, is the most recent anti-VEGF agent to be granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (2011) for the treatment of neovascular AMD. The ocular formulation of aflibercept has been specifically purified and buffered to minimize the risk of eye toxicity when injected intravitreally. To the authors' knowledge, there are no published articles describing the use of intravitreal aflibercept in this pathology. However, in 2017, a short-term study showed that off-label intravitreal ziv-aflibercept is safe and effective in a small series of patients with CNV secondary to choroiditis.

The purpose of this report was to evaluate the potential benefits of intravitreal aflibercept injections for the treatment of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis.

### Multifocal choroiditis… [^ba2f1aad]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. W. RICHARDGREENMD Many of the white dot syndromes are considered to have a granulomatous pathogenesis. The histopathologic characteristics of this case of multifocal choroiditis seen within 15 months of apparent clinical onset show that the white dot lesions were nongranulomatous perivascular choroidal infiltrates, consisting mainly of B lymphocytes. Early choroidal neovascularization was also seen. -B35 positive. Results of serologic testing for syphilis were negative. Values for serum angiotensin-converting enzyme were within normal limits. Histopathologic findings. Immunohistochemistry using an avidin-biotin method with diaminobenzidine, counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin showed most of the lymphocytes present were B lymphocytes, but mixed with a substantial number of T lymphocytes.

There was no peripheral distribution of T cells as might be found in granulomatous inflammation and few macrophages were present. Findings from HLA-DR staining were essentially negative, with weak positivity of occasional macrophagelike cells within the infiltrate. Staining for von Willebrand factor confirmed neovascularization within the regions of the largest accumulations of lymphocytes. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of T lymphocytes around small inner retinal blood vessels. The choroidal infiltrates did not resemble the clearly granulomatous uveitic syndromes of sarcoidosis, sympathetic ophthalmia, Harada disease, or birdshot choroidopathy. 3, 4 The preponderance of B cells has been reported in the primate model of chronic experimental histoplasmic choroiditis5 and subretinal fibrosis and uveitis syndrome, 6 though the latter is associated with glial proliferation, which had not occurred in this case.

The former model of inflammation appears similar to the abnormality we found, notably that the infiltrate could persist despite clinical quiescence. Reactivation was found with antigenic challenge, whereupon the CD4+T-cell population was amplified. 7 Clinical recurrence is common in multifocal choroiditis, with 86% reported in one series. 1 The abnormalities in this case demonstrate that the possibility is present. This specimen showed the early stage of choroidal neovascularization. This has been noted clinically in 32% of eyes. 8.

### Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings in serpiginous choroiditis [^8e3231c5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

The standard adjustments of the retinal and choroidal layers did not correspond very well with the structures of deeper layers.

SE's were the main problem in patients with macular edema or scarring so that the interpretation of these images was difficult and led to the exclusion of one eye. Statistically significant differences of mean BCVA could be seen between patients with and without SE's which may be due to a missing fixation of the patients and a longer examination time of OCTA. The newer software with faster examination time and auto-fixation program overcomes some of these problems.

One last disadvantage concerned the lack of detection of fluid dynamics (pooling, staining, leakage) even though one could argue that this provided in-depth-selective images, free of masking affects.

Although this study's conclusions are limited by the numbers of eyes evaluated and there is missing knowledge of the pathophysiology of SC, lesions presenting in the disease can be visualized using OCTA as reliably as through the currently established techniques (ICGA, FA and FAF). The use of OCTA offers a non-invasive and high-resolution means to assess the disease in three dimensions, allowing for the ability to precisely locate the atrophic area. Furthermore, OCTA may help determine if the disease is in an active phase via, for example, identification of CNV (a known complication of this and other entities) even when ICGA is not able to do so, as reported by Mandadi et al. and as observed in tuberculous serpiginous-like Choroiditis. In this study, it was not possible to prove this hypothesis as all enrolled patients were in inactive disease stages.

Additionally, analogies could be seen between the changes of the choriocapillaris and choroid caused by SC and geographic atrophy. These included a focal flow impairment and rarefaction in the choriocapillaris beneath the area of the atrophic lesions, which is argued to represent non-perfused or hypo-perfused choroidal vessels with non-detectable flow in the literature.

OCTA is clinically valuable in the management of patients with SC. Even though the representation of the lesions with OCTA corresponded to the ones seen in the FA/ICGA/FAF/EDI-OCT, the inclusion of this tool in a multimodal approach for the diagnosis and management of SC should be considered as an extra or alternative examination.

### OCT angiography imaging in serpiginous choroidopathy [^19a76f62]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report OCTA findings in 3 cases, 2 active and 1 inactive, of serpiginous choroidopathy (SC) and describe OCTA changes in response to treatment.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Participants

We studied 6 eyes of 3 patients with SC.

Methods

Retrospective case series of 3 patients with SC undergoing multimodal imaging, including OCTA. In 1 treated eye, both pre- and posttreatment images were compared.

Main Outcome Measures

Description of OCTA findings in patients with SC.

Results

In the active phase, OCTA images show an apparent absence of the choriocapillaris with variable outer retinal and retinal pigment epithelial thickening. After treatment, OCTA of previously active lesions demonstrates a partial reappearance of the choriocapillaris, especially at lesion margins. In inactive SC, the choriocapillaris, along with the retinal pigment epithelium and outer retina, is notably absent.

Conclusions

Optical coherence tomography angiography suggests absence of choriocapillaris in both active and inactive phases of SC with partial reestablishment following treatment. Although the exact pathogenesis of SC is not elucidated by these findings, OCTA images allow us to better evaluate choroidal involvement.

### Double-layer sign: a new OCT finding in active tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis to monitor activity [^a980b58e]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe a novel spectral-domain (SD) OCT finding of a double-layer sign at the site of activity in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis (SLC) and how this sign can be used to assess treatment response in these eyes.

Design

Retrospective, observational case series.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed simultaneous fundus photographs and SD OCT and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images of eyes affected with tubercular SLC from the acute stage until resolution of lesions using the Heidelberg Spectralis HRA and OCT system (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany).

Main Outcome Measures

Occurence of the double layer sign (DLS) during activity; reduction in the double layer sign (DLS) with resolution of choroidal and retinal inflammation; correlation of SD OCT and FAF findings.

Results

Five eyes of 5 patients were studied in detail. Spectral-domain OCT findings included choroidal elevation and a double-layer sign (separation of hyperreflective retinal pigment epithelium [RPE] from Bruch's membrane, with the gap between them showing moderate reflectivity) at the site of activity. This correlated with hyperautofluorescence with indistinct borders on FAF imaging. Reduction in the double-layer sign became evident as the lesions began to resolve, and eventually this area was replaced by hyperreflective, irregular, knobbly elevations of the RPE. In eyes with severe inflammation and increased choroidal elevation on OCT, the double-layer sign was very prominent. As the choroidal elevation decreased on OCT, increased reflectance from the choroidal layers was evident. As the lesions resolved, the lesions became predominantly hypoautofluorescent on FAF and loss of RPE, ellipsoid zone, and external limiting membrane on SD OCT scan became evident. Good correlation was found between the resolution of the double-layer sign on SD OCT and FAF findings.

Conclusions

The double-layer sign on SD OCT may be a useful finding in monitoring the activity in tubercular SLC. The OCT changes can be correlated with FAF imaging in these eyes.

### Persistent placoid maculopathy: a new clinical entity [^e4a3c17b]. Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a previously unreported clinical entity superficially resembling macular serpiginous choroiditis but with a distinct presentation and clinical course.

Design

Retrospective observational case series.

Participants

Six patients, 50 to 68 years old, exhibiting this entity who were seen at 5 different centers from 1984 to 2006.

Methods

Review of medical records.

Main Outcome Measures

Best-corrected visual acuity (VA) and clinical and angiographic findings.

Results

The lesions in our patients are similar to those of acute macular serpiginous choroiditis. Our patients had well-delineated whitish plaquelike lesions involving the macula and sparing the peripapillary areas of both eyes. In contrast to serpiginous choroiditis, VA remained good despite early involvement of the fovea until complications related to choroidal neovascularization or pigmentary mottling developed. Angiographic characteristics and the clinical course were also atypical. Fluorescein angiography revealed well-defined early hypofluorescent areas that partially filled in in the late phase. Indocyanine green angiography showed the hypofluorescence to be persistent. Unlike serpiginous choroiditis, the white macular lesions faded over a period of months to years, whereas the characteristic angiographic findings often persisted longer. Choroidal neovascularization developed in 11 of 12 eyes, with subsequent conversion to disciform macular scars in 9 of 12 eyes. Unlike serpiginous choroiditis, none of the eyes showed chorioretinal scar formation unless related to choroidal neovascularization.

Conclusion

Persistent placoid maculopathy has features resembling macular serpiginous choroiditis but differs in its clinical course and effect on VA. It appears to be a new entity. The majority of eyes develop choroidal neovascularization that results in loss of central vision.

### The white dot syndromes [^070349c0]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the distinctive and shared features of the white dot syndromes, highlighting the clinical findings, diagnostic test results, proposed etiologies, treatments, and prognosis.

Design

Review.

Methods

Review of the literature.

Results

Common white dot syndromes are reviewed, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, birdshot chorioretinopathy, diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis, serpiginous choroiditis, and acute zonal occult outer retinopathy.

Conclusions

The white dot syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by multiple whitish-yellow inflammatory lesions located at the level of the outer retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid. For clinicians and researchers alike, they present significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

### Assesment of fundus autofluorescence in serpiginous and serpiginous-like choroidopathy [^4bea855a]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to correlate the activity status disclosed in fluorescein angiography (FA) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, and the variations of FAF images in the evolution of serpiginous choroidopathy (SC) and serpiginous-like choroidopathy (SLC).

Methods

Prospective consecutive case series. Patients with SC or SLC were included from July 2009 to December 2010. All patients underwent FAF imaging (Spaide Autofluorescence Filters, Topcon TRC 50IX) and FA (Topcon TRC 50IX).

Results

Twelve patients (eight males, mean age 51.2 years) were included. Bilateral involvement in nine cases. Three different patterns of FAF images were present: active inflammation, transitional, and inactive inflammation.

Conclusion

FAF may be a useful tool for following patients with SC and SLC. It is possible to reserve other invasive techniques, such as FA, for cases with suspicious activity disclosed by FAF imaging.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^9e7ce99f]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the left macula at initial presentation showed mild attenuation of the foveal ellipsoid zone (EZ) (Figures 1 and 2A). Focal hyperreflectivity of the inner choroid was noted nasal to the foveal center (Figure 2A). Although hyperreflective foci was seen in the vitreous on OCT, no vitreous cells were seen clinically at the initial visit and subsequent visits. On near-infrared reflectance imaging, there was a group of multiple, small, round, hyperreflective lesions nasal to the fovea that localized to the hyperreflective choroidal findings on OCT (Figure 1). One month later, after observation only, the patient presented to the retina clinic with severe atrophy of the outer retina and inner retina that was apparent on OCT (Figure 2B). Near-infrared reflectance imaging showed expansion of the hyperreflective lesion through the macula, with an amoeboid-like shape (Figure 2B).

Figure 1.
Near-infrared reflectance of (A) the right eye and (B) the left eye on initial presentation (1 month before referral to the retina clinic). (C–H) Near-infrared reflectance and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images show cuts of the left eye through the hyperreflective choroidal lesions. Arrows on OCT show the hyperreflective spots in the inner choroid that correspond with the hyperreflective areas nasal to the fovea seen on near-infrared reflectance. There is mild attenuation of the external limiting membrane, ellipsoid zone, and retinal pigment epithelium interdigitation lines. The neurosensory retina appears otherwise normal.

Figure 2.
Serial progression of near-infrared reflectance and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the left eye performed (A) at the patient's initial presentation to the eye clinic, (B) 4 weeks later, (C) 5 weeks later, and (D) 4 months after the initial visit. Near-infrared reflectance shows an irregular area of hyperreflectivity at the macula that corresponds with the hyperreflective foci in the outer retina and choroid on OCT. Over time, there is significant atrophy of the outer and inner retina with disruption of the ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium. Four months after the initial visit, a new pigment epithelial detachment is seen. In addition, there is a notable change in choroidal thickness over time as follows: 342 µm at the initial presentation, 378 µm at 1 month, and 233 µm at 4 months.

### Intravitreal bevacizumab for choroidal neovascularisation in serpiginous choroiditis [^e2680765]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effects of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in the treatment of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to serpiginous choroiditis (SC).

Design

Non-randomised, interventional case series.

Participants

Seven patients (seven eyes) affected by juxtafoveal CNV (six eyes) and subfoveal CNV (one eye) associated with SC were recruited.

Methods

Each patient underwent an ophthalmological examination, including measurement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After a first IVB injection (1.25 mg), patients were evaluated monthly over a 12-month follow-up. Further re-treatments were performed on the basis of detection of any type of fluid on OCT and/or presence of leakage on FA. The primary outcome considered was the median change in BCVA, as well as the proportion of eyes gaining at least 5 and 10 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters at the end of the 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included median changes in central macular thickness (CMT) and number of injections over the planned follow-up.

Results

Median BCVA changed from 0.3 to 0.4 LogMAR. A functional improvement of at least 5 and 10 ETDRS letters was obtained in two eyes (28%) and one eye (14%), respectively, at the 12-month examination. Four eyes (57%) had stable BCVA, whereas one eye (14%) experienced a two-line decrease. Median CMT at baseline was 261 μm, decreasing to 196 μm at the 12-month examination. The median number of IVB injections was 1 in 12 months.

Conclusions

IVB can achieve anatomical stabilisation of CNV secondary to SC, avoiding a decline in visual acuity, in almost 90% of cases over a 12-month follow-up.

### Role of optical coherence tomography angiography in detecting and monitoring inflammatory choroidal neovascularization [^91f1ef6a]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the utility of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) for the detection of inflammatory choroidal neovascularization (iCNV) and monitoring their response to treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of uveitis and associated iCNV with active exudation was performed. Active iCNV was determined by spectral domain OCT and/or fluorescein angiogram. Spectral domain OCTA outer retina to choriocapillaris slabs was evaluated for the presence of iCNV. Follow-up OCTA images were qualitatively assessed to determine whether regression of iCNV occurred after treatment.

Results

Thirteen eyes of 12 patients were included. The etiologies of uveitis include punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 4), multifocal choroiditis (n = 2), presumed sarcoid uveitis (n = 2), tuberculous choroiditis (n = 1), birdshot chorioretinopathy (n = 1), syphilitic uveitis (n = 1), serpiginous choroiditis (n = 1), and idiopathic panuveitis (n = 1). Inflammatory choroidal neovascularization was detected on en face OCTA in 10 of 13 eyes (76.9%). After iCNV treatment, en face OCTA demonstrated complete regression of iCNV in 5 of 10 eyes (50%), partial regression in 2 of 10 eyes (20%), and no regression in 3 of 10 eyes (30%).

Conclusions

Optical coherence tomography angiography is an effective modality for detecting iCNV and could provide detailed visualization regarding location, morphologic structure, and flow of the iCNV and its response to therapy.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and study of autoimmune retinopathy from the American Academy of Ophthalmology's task force [^50bf8236]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) therapeutic options and consensus — Intraocular and systemic corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and systemic immunosuppression with antimetabolites, T-cell inhibitors, and targeted B-cell therapy have all been employed. Fox and colleagues found expert consensus that local or systemic steroids, conventional immunosuppression, biologics, and intravenous immunogloblin were appropriate treatment options; however, consensus was not reached on the use of plasmapheresis. Rituximab is an attractive treatment option as it directly reduces antibody production, the addition to bortezomib to rituximab was suggested to provide benefit on electrophysiologic testing in one small series, and intraocular steroids can help control macular edema and may also have a role in managing AIR even in the absence of edema.

### What does IGRA testing add to the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis? A Bayesian latent class analysis [^c1fa5519]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
ATT use and treatment failure

QFT QuantiFERON -TB Gold In-Tube test, ATT Antitubercular therapy

The 58 (21.7%) patients with panuveitis features (with uveitis at more than one location) appeared differed significantly from those with uveitis in the following ways:

more of them had QFT values over the manufacturer's threshold of 0.35 (48/58 [82.8%] compared to 143/209 [68.4%], p = 0.048 by chi-squared test)
they are younger (median 40 compared to 44, p = 0.048 by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test)
more of them had choroiditis (15/58 [25.9%] compared to 19/209 [9.1%], p = 0.002 by chi-squared test)
they had higher ACE levels (median 34 compared to 30, p = 0.02 by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test)
fewer of them had bilateral symptoms (27/58 [46.6%] compared to 135/209 [64.6%], p = 0.02 by chi-squared test)

Exploratory analyses revealed that QFT values were significantly lower in patients of Caucasian ethnicity (p = 0.0007), in patients not receiving oral steroids (p = 0.03), patients with choroiditis (p = 0.04), and in the presence of chest X-ray suggestive of healed pulmonary disease (p = 0.04). Levels of ACE (Table 1) was higher in patients with choroidal involvement (mean 45.8, median 38.5) than those without (mean 36.3, median 31.0), with p = 0.01. In Table 2, we show the use of ATT and the proportion with treatment failure broken down by characteristics. The striking feature is that treatment failure is higher in those not treated with ATT than those treated, for all categories except the very lowest values of QFT, which suggests that there are some false negatives in the diagnosis. We cannot estimate the false positives with the information available.

### Lack of herpes virus DNA in choroidal tissues of a patient with serpiginous choroiditis [^9e83a485]. Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the role of herpes viruses in the etiology of serpiginous choroiditis.

Design

Interventional case report.

Participant

A 59-year-old male patient with long-term history of serpiginous choroiditis.

Intervention

The patient's affected eye was obtained during autopsy. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in the microdissected choroidal tissues.

Results

Histopathologic examination demonstrated active inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid. No viral DNA was amplified using pairs of herpes simplex virus (HSV) P1/P2 (for HSV-1, HSV-2, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV] and human herpes virus [HHV]-8), and varicella-zoster virus [VZV] P1/P2 (for VZV, HHV-6, HHV-7) in the infiltrating lymphocytes or choroidal tissues.

Conclusions

The current observation suggests a lack of a role for herpetic viral etiology in the etiopathogenesis of serpiginous choroiditis.

### Tuberculous optochiasmatic arachnoiditis [^3b26ccc4]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 24-year-old woman developed multiple cerebral tuberculomas during treatment for central nervous system tuberculosis, requiring a protracted course of antituberculous therapy. Four years later, while on a second course of antituberculous therapy for relapsed disease, she developed deteriorating vision and further cerebral tuberculomas with inflammation; this was attributed to optochiasmatic arachnoiditis. She was treated at different stage with intravenous corticosteroids, second-line antituberculous therapy, infliximab and thalidomide. Her visual deficits initially improved but subsequently deteriorated despite escalating the anti-inflammatory medication. She died following severe sepsis. Optochiasmatic arachnoiditis threatens to cause irreversible complete blindness, but its best treatment is uncertain with no controlled trial data. We discuss the challenges of treating paradoxical reactions to antituberculous therapy and of treating optochiasmatic arachnoiditis.

### Bilateral multifocal choroiditis with serous retinal detachment in a patient with Brucella infection: case report and review of the literature… [^698595f6]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. W. RICHARDGREENMD. Results of the physical examination were entirely normal. Results of the systemic workup, including serologic testing for syphilis, tuberculosis, and antinuclear antibody, were normal. Brucella infection was also considered because of the history of intake of raw unpasteurized goat's milk. Results of serologic testing for Brucella species using the agglutination method were positive at a titer of 1:

160. Brucella blood cultures were negative. The patient started therapy consisting of streptomycin sulfate, 1 g/d in an intramuscular injection for 2 weeks, and doxycycline hyclate, 100 mg orally twice daily for 6 weeks. After 1 week of treatment, mild anterior uveitis, expressed as fine keratic precipitates with 1+ flare and 1+ cells, developed in both eyes. One month after the patient's initial symptoms, visual acuity had improved to 20/30 OU and choroidal lesions had disappeared.

Fluorescein angiography demonstrated multiple peripapillary window defects without late leakage. The prednisone dose was tapered and stopped during a 2-month period. Three months after presentation, visual acuity remains 20/30 OU. All of the patients responded to systemic antibiotic therapy and experienced complete recovery from the uveitis. The initial clinical findings in our patient consisted of bilateral multifocal geographic choroiditis with serous retinal detachments and papillary congestion. After 1 week of systemic antibiotic therapy, choroiditis in the left eye expanded to the fovea with a corresponding severe drop in visual acuity. After systemic corticosteroid therapy was begun, visual acuity returned to 20/30 OU, with improvement of the choroiditis. This result supports the concept that the ocular manifestations of brucellosis have an immune component. It is difficult to isolate the organism in the chronic stages of the disease.

In the absence of an isolate of the infecting organism from blood or tissues, a serologic investigation is of paramount importance to the diagnosis and management. 1, 3 In the case reported herein, early anti-Brucella therapy and treatment with corticosteroids resulted in complete recovery and return of visual acuity.

### Intravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of inflammatory choroidal neovascularization [^1d89d9be]. Retina (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of individualized repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis) on visual acuity and central foveal thickness in patients with choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) associated with various ocular inflammatory clinical entities.

Methods

Our study was a retrospective, noncomparative, interventional, and observational case series. Sixteen eyes of 15 consecutive patients diagnosed with inflammatory CNV treated with repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab were evaluated. The underlying diagnoses were toxoplasmosis (n = 4), serpiginous choroidopathy (n = 2), punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 5), multifocal choroiditis (MFC, n = 3), and scleroderma (n = 2). All patients underwent monthly optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and fluorescein angiography/indocyanine green angiography every 1 month after every injection and then every 3 months. Optical coherence tomography scans and fluorescein angiography were performed by the same experienced physician. Repeated intravitreal injections were performed when persistent/recurrent fluid on OCT and/or signs of active CNV on angiography were present. Changes in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity and central foveal thickness were statistically analyzed.

Results

The mean follow-up time was 70.4 ± 24 weeks (17.6 months; range, 44–116 weeks [11–29 months]). The mean number of injections performed was 2.3, and the mean best-corrected visual acuity improved from 55 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, 0.9 ± 0.4 [mean ± SD]) at baseline to 70.3 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, 0.6 ± 0.4) at the end of the follow-up, a statistically significant change compared with baseline (P < 0.0001). The mean letter gain was 15.3 letters, and best-corrected visual acuity improved in 14 of 16 patients (88%) and remained stable in 2 patients (12.5%) without any patient demonstrating deterioration. The mean central foveal thickness (although not excessively increased at baseline) improved from 285 ± 20 μm at baseline to 233 ± 21 μm (statistically significant compared with baseline, P < 0.0001) at the end of the follow-up. At the end of the follow-up, all patients demonstrated CNV regression, and retinal pigment epithelial atrophy surrounding the regressed CNV was developed in 11 of the 16 eyes (68.8%). During the same period, no CNV recurrence was observed and no injection-related complications such as cataract, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, or exacerbation of uveitis were noted.

Conclusion

Overall, our findings suggest that intravitreal injections of ranibizumab have shown promising results in visual acuity improvement and a decrease in macular thickness in patients with inflammatory CNV. Of course, further studies are needed to confirm the exact benefit and standardize the optimal treatment regimen.

### Novel findings on optical coherence tomography angiography in patients with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis [^6ede939f]. Retina (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze and describe the imaging characteristics of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and to compare these findings with multimodal imaging.

Methods

In this prospective cross-sectional study, multimodal imaging was performed in subjects with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis using OCTA (Optovue RTVue XR Avanti), enhanced-depth imaging OCT (Heidelberg Spectralis), fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Distinct morphologic features of the retinochoroidal vasculature at the sites of choroiditis lesions were analyzed on OCTA imaging. Multimodal imaging analysis was performed to study the changes observed on OCTA.

Results

Eighteen eyes (18 subjects, 16 males) were included in the study. The en face OCTA images demonstrated discrete areas of flow void beneath the retinal pigment epithelium-Bruch membrane layer suggestive of choriocapillaris hypoperfusion that corresponded well with indocyanine green angiography, especially in the chronic phase. Additional information such as areas of preserved choriocapillaris, vascular tufts, and tangled vessels were observed using OCTA among lesions in advanced stages of healing. Compared with indocyanine green angiography, the areas of choriocapillaris atrophy appeared better defined on OCTA and correlated well with enhanced-depth imaging OCT.

Conclusion

The OCTA images provide high-resolution structural information of the retinochoroidal vasculature in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis. Morphologic information obtained from OCTA images correlates well with and supplements other imaging techniques such as indocyanine green angiography and enhanced-depth imaging OCT.

### Clinical reasoning: a 27-year-old man with progressive bilateral vision loss resistant to steroid therapy [^54d81f1d]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This case involves a 27-year-old man who presented with progressive bilateral visual impairment that initially improved with steroid therapy but subsequently worsened. The clinical problem centers on diagnosing optic nerve damage with meningeal involvement unresponsive to standard interventions. The patient's vision loss began insidiously in the right eye and later affected the left, with fundoscopy showing bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Although steroids provided temporary relief, the condition deteriorated, necessitating further investigation. MRI revealed dural thickening and enhancement near the optic canals, suggesting an infiltrative or compressive process. The diagnostic approach required considering inflammatory, compressive, and infiltrative etiologies, with a biopsy ultimately proving critical when initial treatments failed. This case underscores the importance of a stepwise diagnostic strategy and highlights the need to consider rare conditions in atypical presentations, guiding readers through the differential diagnosis.

### BTS clinical statement for the diagnosis and management of ocular tuberculosis [^63a123a3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Treatment: active

Standard regime antituberculous therapy (ATT) should be given for OTB (unless alternative drug sensitivities are available), in conjunction with a specialist team with experience treating OTB. Services should consider setting up regional Multi-Disciplinary Teams (MDTs) which includes specialists in uveitis and TB.
ATT should be given for at least 6 months. Teams can consider giving treatment for longer (9–12 months), especially if there is slow improvement in eye disease or disease is severe initially.
It is reasonable to replace ethambutol with a fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin). This decision should be made in conjunction with a specialist in OTB (or MDT). Consideration should be made of potential adverse effects of fluoroquinolones (QTc prolongation, tendon rupture and aortic aneurysm rupture).
Patients in whom AU could be a manifestation of OTB should be seen by an ophthalmologist experienced in the management of OTB to determine a management plan. This is because of the difficulty in determining the likelihood of the AU being caused by TB.
Patients with chronic granulomatous anterior uveitis typical of OTB and a high clinical or epidemiological suspicion of OTB, should be managed with ATT and topical corticosteroids regardless of their IGRA or TST result.
Consider ATT in patients with chronic anterior uveitis of unclear cause requiring more than two drops of corticosteroid per day and a positive IGRA or TST.
ATT may also be considered for positive IGRA or TST patients with recurrent anterior uveitis, without other cause, who suffer more than two episodes per year.
The use of systemic corticosteroids, local corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive therapy should be guided by the extent of the disease, evidence of structural damage and response to ATT.
It is reasonable to use intravitreal steroids in the management of OTB.
Patients with a high clinical or epidemiological suspicion of OTB, and occlusive retinal vasculitis typical of OTB should be managed with ATT and high-dose corticosteroids (1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent) regardless of their IGRA or TST positivity. Laser retinal photocoagulation of ischaemic retina should be considered if there are signs of neovascularisation.
Patients with a high clinical or epidemiological suspicion of OTB, and choroidal lesions typical of OTB should be managed with ATT and high-dose corticosteroids (1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent) regardless of their IGRA or TST positivity.
All other patients with posterior uveitis and a positive IGRA or TST should have other causes of uveitis excluded before being referred for ATT. The use of systemic corticosteroids, local corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive therapy should be guided by the extent of the disease, evidence of structural damage and response to ATT.

### Longitudinal follow-up of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis using optical coherence tomography angiography [^9fcf6e40]. Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To analyze and describe serial follow-up of choriocapillaris alterations in tubercular serpiginouslike choroiditis (SLC) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and to compare it with multimodal imaging.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study, patients with active tubercular SLC underwent OCTA using Optovue RTVue XR Avanti and other imaging techniques including enhanced-depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT) (Heidelberg Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography. Serial imaging was performed for a total follow-up of 3 months. Choriocapillaris alterations at the site of lesions were analyzed on OCTA imaging, and their mean lesion areas were calculated.

Results

Twenty-six eyes (26 patients; 20 males; mean age: 32.68 ± 10.56 years) were included. Fourteen eyes had active multifocal lesions (n = 39), whereas 12 eyes had active placoid lesions (n = 12). At baseline, OCTA showed hyporeflective flow deficit lesions corresponding to the hypofluorescent lesions on indocyanine green angiography in all eyes. In the multifocal type of SLC, the mean lesion area decreased in all eyes compared with baseline, and lesions with a lesion area less than 0.1 mm2 on OCTA showed near-complete resolution with minimal choriocapillaris atrophy. In comparison, all eyes with a placoid type of SLC showed no significant reduction in the lesion area and showed extensive choriocapillaris atrophy.

Conclusion

Optical coherence tomography angiography has the unique ability to demonstrate pathological flow impairment at the level of choriocapillaris in active tubercular SLC. Serial OCTA analysis reveals that large tubercular SLC lesions result in choriocapillaris atrophy as the lesions heal, whereas smaller multifocal lesions show resolution of choriocapillaris hypoperfusion with minimal atrophy.

### Successful treatment with infliximab in a patient with diffuse subretinal fibrosis syndrome [^51146b67]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of Diffuse Subretinal Fibrosis (DSF) syndrome refractory to immunosuppressive therapy who was successfully treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-alpha monoclonal antibodies infliximab.

Design

Interventional case report.

Methods

A 23-year-old male with bilateral choroiditis presented sudden dimness of vision associated to nasal scotoma in his right eye. Complete ophthalmic examination with appropriated clinical and laboratorial evaluations was carried out during all follow-up. Inform consent statement and Internal Ethics Board approval were also obtained for an open-label therapy schedule.

Results

Extensive temporal subretinal lesion in his right eye and DSF in the left eye were observed. The patient received intravenous infliximab infusion (5 mg/kg) schema. Four weeks after starting treatment his visual acuity improved with decrease in ocular inflammation.

Conclusions

This report describes a case of DSF syndrome that responded remarkably well to infliximab treatment suggesting that TNF-alpha could play an important pathogenetic role in this syndrome.

### Concurrent tuberculous chorioretinitis with choroidal neovascularization and tuberculous meningitis: a case report [^9869ed8c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Macular CNV has been identified to be associated with intraocular TB. It is important to recognize CNV as a potential sequela of TB-related chorioretinitis and reveal the underlying mechanism of CNV development. According to Agarwal et al. TB-associated CNV is typically adjacent to the healed choroidal granuloma or healed choroiditis scar lesions. The suggested underlying mechanism is that retinal pigment epithelium can act as reservoir for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and can be the likely site for delayed reactivation and development of posterior uveitis. Moreover, Kim et al. retrospectively reported four cases with active CNV secondary to intraocular TB, in which CNVs were developed 3 ~ 6 months after anti-TB medication. In this case, intraocular TB represented the first manifestation of an underlying systemic infection, with co-occurrence of CNV development and pulmonary symptoms. Generally, intraocular TB has diverse clinical manifestations, either by an active infection or an immunological reaction. The co-occurrence of CNV development and pulmonary symptoms might be related to an immune-mediated hypersensitivity response. This case was a 17-year-old girl with normally functioning immune system, might resulting in a latent or dormant infection in early stage. She had a history of ocular involvements at least 4 months in the interrogation. Given the situation of delayed seeking medical care in China, her history of ocular involvements might be much longer, which provide time for the development of CNV.

This study highlights a case presenting with active CNV secondary to tuberculous chorioretinopathy and tuberculous meningitis. This patient was treated with systemic anti-tuberculosis therapy, oral corticosteroids, and intravitreal anti-VEGF injection, and received a favorable clinical response. Combined applications of routine TB tests, fundus multimodal imaging and diagnostic therapy greatly contribute the clinician to establishing precise diagnosis and monitoring the therapeutic response. Systemic anti-tuberculosis medications and corticosteroid therapy frequently result in unsatisfactory optical response, and concomitant intravitreal anti-VEGF injection is an optimal strategy for tuberculous chorioretinitis with CNV.

Managing paradoxical TB-IRIS includes evidence from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial showing that prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) reduced a combined endpoint of days hospitalized plus outpatient therapeutic procedures, with more rapid symptom and radiographic improvement and no reduction in mortality, noting life-threatening neurological cases were excluded; for central nervous system involvement, corticosteroids (either intravenous dexamethasone or oral prednisone) are described as beneficial at presentation. If 4 weeks of prednisone is insufficient, a more gradual steroid taper over 2 to 3 months is recommended (BIII) and should be guided by repeated clinical assessment; corticosteroids should be avoided in patients with Kaposi sarcoma, and case reports describe responses to TNF-blockers or thalidomide in steroid-refractory, prolonged IRIS.

Indications, Rationale and Modalities of Pharmacotherapy

Unlike Eales disease, active TRV almost always requires treatment. The treatment is more urgent when the vasculitis is posterior, severe, and symptomatic (associated with macular/disc edema and vitritis). Mild, peripheral TRV in an asymptomatic patient with latent TB from a nonendemic area may not be started on ATT; the patient should however remain under vigilant follow-up of a pulmonologist. Inactive vasculitis, irrespective of the endemicity, should neither be investigated, nor treated (Figure 3);, the COTS experts did not have consensus on this issue as there is no ocular or systemic endpoint for ATT in this situation.

Figure 3
Inactive retinal vasculitis. This patient has 20/20 Snellen acuity with regressed retinal vasculitis with sheathed vessels. Note a chorioretinal atrophic patch with pigment clumps secondary to healed chorioretinitis inferotemporally. There are some collaterals around the temporal vascular arcades indicating compensated retinal ischemia. Such patients need only be observed and counseled for regular follow-ups. Ocular (angiography) or systemic (serologic/radiologic) investigations are not required.

Once the diagnosis of TRV is established based on phenotype (see above), positive immunologic AND radiologic investigations, the treatment with ATT is a given, since healed pulmonary TB is a risk factor for conversion of latent to active systemic TB. ATT is also essential to prevent recurrences of OTB. In the presence of active systemic TB, a full course of ATT is also a no-brainer (though active TB is rarely found to be associated with OTB). However, the COTS-2 survey did not reach consensus on how to administer ATT for systemically inactive (healed lesions on CXR/CT) or latent TB: full 6, 9 or 12-month therapy starting with 4 drugs, or ATT toned down for latent TB. The duration varied according to the severity of OTB, endemicity of TB, other high-risk features (like healed lung lesions, HIV) and initial response to ATT. The international guidelines suggest a 6-month trial as the default regimen in view of the paucibacillary latent infection in most cases.

Table 1
Patient demographics and disease characteristics at baseline (prior to commencement of TNFi)

Immunosuppressant medication, corticosteroid doses and corticosteroid 'rescue' treatments were recorded. Treatment decisions for immunomodulatory agents followed a paradigm contemporary for uveitis practice prior to current trial data. Patients on biologic therapy were maintained on a single immunomodulatory therapy in order to diminish the formation of human antichimeric antibodies. Typical immunomodulatory agents and doses were infliximab 3–5 mg/kg 4–8 weekly via intravenous administration, adalimumab 40 mg alternate weeks via subcutaneous route, mycophenolate mofetil 1–3 g/day and tacrolimus titrated to whole blood trough levels of 5−10 ng/L. If there was a failure to respond to TNFi, we adopted a strategy to optimise background immunosuppression to tolerated therapeutic levels, followed by in-class switching and lastly, out-of-class switching. Treatment cessation was immediate where serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred. Steroid rescue treatment was defined as a short escalation of corticosteroids given either intravenously as methylprednisolone (500 mg–1 g/day for 3 days), a tapering course of high-dose oral prednisolone (starting ≥ 40 mg, tapering to ≤ 7.5 mg/day), periorbital corticosteroid injection (triamcinolone 40 mg), intravitreal triamcinolone injection (4 mg) or a dexamethasone (Ozurdex) intravitreal implant. Data on steroid rescue events prior to biologic therapy were collected retrospectively from patients' clinical records.

Patients

Patients with non-infectious uveitis and scleritis receiving TNFi for 1 year, who were over the age of 18 years, had a negative or treated tuberculosis (TB) status, had been on no other biologic therapy, and had at least two recorded attendances in the biologics registry clinic were eligible for inclusion (figure 1). Informed consent was obtained from patients prior to participation.

### RPE disruption and hyper-transmission are early signs of secondary CNV with punctate inner choroidopathy in structure-OCT [^34181a16]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

Seventeen patients (18 eyes) with PIC who complained acute blurring of vision within 4 weeks from Xiamen Eye Center from April 2019 to April 2020 were included in the prospective study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Presence of one or several yellow, white or gray spots (diameter most ≤ 500μm) mostly limited to the posterior pole at the level of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and inner choroid with minimal vitreous reaction; (2) SD-OCT imaging revealed lesions at the level of the deep retina and choroid; (3) SD-OCTA showed no evidence of CNV. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Eye diseases such as retinal vascular occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, optic nerve diseases, and glaucoma that affect vision; (2) Any other type of CNV; (3) After any treatment such as anti-VEGF, glucocorticoid; (4) Other white dot syndromes, such as diffuse subretinal fibrosis, acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, serpiginous choroiditis. This study was conducted under the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics board of Xiamen University affiliated Xiamen Eye Center, Xiamen, China. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All patients provided informed consent after a thorough description of the nature and consequences of the study.

Disseminated tuberculosis — treatment approach and when to apply CNS guidance: Based on expert opinion, a standard daily 6-month regimen is adequate for tuberculosis at multiple sites including miliary disease, though controlled trial data are limited; some experts believe concurrent corticosteroids are indicated for severe respiratory failure or adrenal insufficiency. Patients may have indolent CNS involvement that warrants workup, and recommendations for tuberculous meningitis are followed when CNS involvement is present.
