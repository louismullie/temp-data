## Question

how to prevent skin chafing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to prevent skin chafing, with explicit step-by-step thinking and self-verification preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining chafing and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the key risk factors that amplify friction and moisture. Next, I will outline prevention pillars: moisture control, friction reduction, barrier protection, skin integrity, and environmental/behavioral strategies. After that, I need to consider special populations and settings. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized plan and note evidence gaps, making sure each claim aligns with the cited sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and mechanism. Chafing is essentially friction dermatitis, often termed intertrigo when it occurs in opposing skin surfaces, driven by repetitive mechanical rubbing plus moisture that macerates the stratum corneum and lowers its resistance to shear, predisposing to erythema, erosion, and secondary infection in moist folds where air circulation is limited [^1135UNeb].

> I need to check the major risk amplifiers. Moisture from sweat, incontinence, or occlusive clothing accelerates maceration and friction injury, while obesity, diabetes, and heat/humidity increase fold depth and trapped moisture; aging skin is thinner and more fragile, and certain athletic or occupational contexts impose sustained friction and occlusion, all of which raise chafing risk and downstream infection potential [^1135UNeb] [^113CokKr] [^112uGXf7].

> Next, I should review moisture control as the foundational pillar. Wait, let me verify the principle: keeping skin clean and dry reduces maceration and friction coefficients, so I should emphasize gentle cleansing with light pressure, thorough drying, and targeted moisture management rather than frequent full-body washing that can overdry; when skin is dry, lipophilic leave-on products can restore barrier function, and for incontinence-associated moisture, prompt product changes and breathable, nonocclusive designs are key [^114sHYPb] [^114dZjht] [^111cDJ97].

> Hold on, I should verify friction reduction strategies. Clothing choice matters: seamless, moisture-wicking synthetics or merino wool reduce both moisture retention and fabric-skin friction compared with coarse cotton; in high-friction zones like inner thighs, underarms, or nipples, protective dressings or barrier films can mechanically and chemically reduce shear, and in healthcare or sports settings, lubricants such as petrolatum or silicone-based products can be applied to vulnerable areas to lower the coefficient of friction during activity [^1175QVEM] [^113nzQ3T] [^115a3Atv].

> I will now examine barrier protection. Barrier creams containing zinc oxide or petrolatum create a semi-occlusive, water-repellent layer that separates skin surfaces and repels irritants; in diapered or incontinent skin, modern absorbent products with breathable back sheets and superabsorbent polymers reduce prolonged wetness and friction, and in athletes, silicone tapes or specialized anti-chafe sticks can be used proactively on high-risk sites [^115a3Atv] [^111cDJ97] [^114nXbzT].

> Let me consider skin integrity optimization. Gentle cleansing without harsh soaps, pat-dry technique, and individualized leave-on moisturizers support barrier resilience; I should confirm that very low certainty evidence exists for routine leave-on products in pressure injury prevention, so product selection should be cautious, pH-balanced, and tailored to baseline skin status, with vigilance for irritant reactions and avoidance of vigorous rubbing during application [^114sHYPb] [^11199jWw] [^114qKRAC].

> Next, I should review environmental and behavioral strategies. In hot or humid conditions, I need to ensure frequent cooling breaks, hydration, and clothing changes to limit sweat accumulation; in cold, paradoxically, wet skin from perspiration increases friction and frost risk, so layering and moisture management remain critical; for endurance athletes, pre-activity lubrication and mid-event adjustments can mitigate cumulative friction over hours of exertion [^114suPnY] [^113CokKr].

> But wait, what about special populations and settings. For infants and diapered skin, frequent diaper changes, barrier creams, and aeration reduce diaper dermatitis, which shares the same friction-plus-moisture pathophysiology; for older adults with fragile skin, I should double-check that structured skin care, moisture control, and protective dressings over bony prominences are recommended; for people with obesity or diabetes, proactive barrier use in folds and glycemic optimization reduce recurrence; in healthcare workers using PPE, incorporating dressings or barrier films and maintaining hand skin health help prevent frictional dermatitis [^112wz9va] [^115gFVmu] [^111EryPF] [^1175QVEM] [^115N3KWo].

> I should now synthesize a practical, prioritized prevention plan. Before activity or at the start of the day, cleanse and thoroughly dry vulnerable areas, then apply a thin layer of petrolatum or zinc oxide barrier; choose seamless, moisture-wicking clothing with a snug but not tight fit; during prolonged exertion or exposure, reapply barrier or lubricant and change damp clothing when feasible; after activity, gently cleanse, pat dry, and reapply a simple emollient to restore barrier function; if early erythema or burning appears, escalate to thicker barrier protection and temporary friction avoidance until healed to prevent progression [^115a3Atv] [^114sHYPb] [^1175QVEM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about product efficacy. I need to ensure we acknowledge evidence gaps: while barrier strategies are mechanistically sound and widely used, high-quality randomized trials specific to chafing prevention are limited; much of the direct evidence base addresses related entities like diaper dermatitis, intertrigo, and pressure injuries, so clinicians should individualize choices, monitor for contact dermatitis, and adjust based on response and setting [^113nzQ3T] [^1142PKFY] [^112u9Yhk].

> In summary, I should confirm that effective chafing prevention hinges on a layered approach: rigorous moisture control, deliberate friction reduction via textiles and lubricants, barrier protection in folds and high-shear zones, maintenance of skin barrier integrity with gentle care, and context-specific environmental and behavioral adaptations, all tailored to the patient's anatomy, activity, and comorbidities, with vigilance for early skin changes to interrupt the friction–moisture–inflammation cycle [^1135UNeb] [^115a3Atv] [^114sHYPb] [^1175QVEM].

To prevent skin chafing, **keep skin clean and dry** [^114sHYPb] and use **moisture-wicking clothing** to reduce friction and sweat buildup [^notfound]. Apply **barrier creams** (petrolatum, zinc oxide, dimethicone) to high-risk areas [^115a3Atv] and choose seamless, well-fitting garments; avoid rough fabrics and tight clothes [^114suPnY]. After activity, gently cleanse, pat dry, and apply a **moisturizer** to maintain barrier function [^115gFVmu]. If chafing occurs, use a protective dressing and avoid further friction until healed [^113nzQ3T].

---

## Skin care practices

- **Keep skin clean and dry**: Regularly cleanse the skin, especially after sweating or exposure to moisture, using mild soap and water. Pat the skin dry gently with a soft towel, avoiding vigorous rubbing [^114sHYPb].

- **Moisturize regularly**: Apply a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer daily to maintain skin hydration and barrier function. This is particularly important for individuals with dry or sensitive skin [^115gFVmu].

- **Use barrier creams**: Apply barrier creams containing petrolatum, zinc oxide, or dimethicone to areas prone to chafing (inner thighs, underarms, groin, nipples) to reduce friction and protect the skin [^115a3Atv].

---

## Clothing choices

- **Wear moisture-wicking fabrics**: Choose clothing made from synthetic materials such as polyester, nylon, or spandex, which effectively wick moisture away from the skin and reduce friction [^notfound].

- **Avoid rough fabrics**: Steer clear of coarse materials like wool or rough cotton, which can increase friction and irritation.

- **Ensure proper fit**: Wear well-fitting clothing that is neither too tight nor too loose. Tight clothing can cause excessive friction, while loose clothing may bunch up and create friction points [^notfound].

- **Use seamless garments**: Opt for seamless or flat-seam clothing to minimize friction points, especially during physical activities.

---

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

Environmental and lifestyle factors also influence **chafing risk**. Stay hydrated to maintain skin hydration and elasticity, and avoid **prolonged exposure to moisture** by changing out of wet or sweaty clothing promptly [^115gFVmu]. Maintain a healthy weight to reduce **skinfold friction** and moisture accumulation [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures during physical activities

During physical activities, apply lubricants such as **petroleum jelly**, anti-chafing balms, or **talcum powder** to reduce friction in prone areas. Plan regular breaks to allow the skin to dry and reapply lubricants as needed. Choose appropriate athletic wear designed to minimize friction and **moisture buildup** [^notfound].

---

## Treatment of existing chafing

If chafing has already occurred, **gentle cleansing** with mild soap and water, followed by thorough drying, is recommended. Apply healing ointments such as petrolatum or zinc oxide to promote healing and protect the skin. Avoid further friction by covering the affected area with a sterile dressing or bandage until healed [^1175QVEM].

---

Preventing skin chafing involves a combination of **skin care practices**, appropriate clothing choices, and lifestyle modifications. By keeping the skin clean and dry, using barrier creams, wearing moisture-wicking fabrics, and taking preventive measures during physical activities, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of chafing [^115a3Atv].

### Skin interaction with absorbent hygiene products [^111cDJ97]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Skin problems due to the use of absorbent hygiene products, such as diapers, incontinence pads, and feminine sanitary articles, are mostly due to climate or chafing discomfort. If these conditions are allowed to prevail, these may develop into an irritant contact dermatitis and eventually superficial skin infections. Skin humidity and aging skin are among the most significant predisposing and aggravating factors for dermatitis development. Improved product design features are believed to explain the decline in observed diaper dermatitis among infants. Where adult incontinence-related skin problems are concerned, it is very important to apply a holistic perspective to understand the influences due to the individual's incontinence level and skin condition, as well as the hygiene and skin care measures provided. Individuals with frail, sensitive skin or with skin diseases may preferably have to use high-quality products, equipped with superabsorbent polymers and water vapor-permeable back sheets, to minimize the risk of skin complications.

TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE

Various skin assessment and risk assessment tools initially developed for research purposes may hold promise to improve care and outcomes for patients with fragile skin. The utility of several methods will remain in research and product development and for the comparison of safety profiles of various devices. Some methods however could be considered to quantitatively assess the condition of a patient's skin before choosing an intervention to prevent skin damage. The suggestions made here will need to be validated to establish clinical relevance and determine the cost–benefit of this approach and its impact on clinical outcomes.

### Skin cancer: primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. part I [^117F4q8b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Understanding the natural history of skin cancer provides the framework for the creation of prevention and control strategies that aim to reduce the skin cancer burden. Based on the target (individual vs population), disease stage, and risk factors (modifiable vs nonmodifiable), strategies can be categorized into 4 levels-health promotion (also known as primordial prevention), primary prevention, secondary prevention, and tertiary prevention. This is the first of a 2-part review, which will cover the epidemiology, risk factors, primordial prevention, and primary prevention of melanoma and keratinocyte skin cancers. In particular, we highlight preventive strategies centered on mitigating the impact of modifiable risk factors and potential interventions for health promotion and primary prevention of skin cancer. Summaries of existing recommendations, challenges, opportunities, and future directions are also discussed.

### Generational dermatology: model for prevention and multi decade approach toward the evolving, aging patient [^112kacyz]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The proposed terminology Generational Dermatology encompasses prevention and involves medical, cosmetic, surgical and oncologic strategies over the decades to optimize skin performance throughout the course of a lifetime. Organ failure is the inability of the organ to perform its determined function as a part of normal physiology and it may be possible to take a Generational preventive approach toward reducing morbidities associated with the failure of our largest organ, the skin. Outside of skin cancer prevention efforts we have as a specialty primarily worked on the tertiary prevention realm. I advocate that we can increase our focus on the primary and secondary tiers where we as Dermatologists have the training and education to identify risk factors and detect early symptoms of skin disease. I appeal to the house of Dermatology to embrace this concept of Generational Dermatology as preventive medicine for the evolving aging patient. The practice of Generational Dermatology will decrease patient morbidity and bring down the cost of healthcare. Our global increased longevity increases the number of elderly worldwide. Longer lifespan means dermatologic needs will increase as the skin must perform its basic function longer. There are also new unknowns and skin issues which arise from large numbers of people in the 9th and 10th decades. Generational Dermatology is well suited to be a model for prevention as our patient's age and we can intervene at any decade. I believe the specialty will increasingly focus on how the skin can optimally perform for a longer period. Lastly, the practice of Generational Dermatology unifies the house of Dermatology as we need the innovations and input of every subspecialty to contribute to the health of the people we serve.

### The science of skin: measuring damage and assessing risk [^1118eY2G]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

A multitude of skin testing methods are available and widely used in research settings to evaluate skin for its degree of hydration, its physiological integrity and topography, its barrier properties, its inflammatory status, its microbiome composition, and its interactions with various materials (adhesion, friction, stress distribution). These methods offer the potential to provide information that may also be useful in clinical settings to help prevent or mitigate skin injury in patients at risk. Current clinical tools for risk assessment focus on the skin's environment and the overall health of the patient, but typically, no specific, reproducible skin measurements are included.

Quantitative measurements could potentially guide clinical practice by providing more objective information on actual risk, documenting the effectiveness of preventive interventions, and helping to develop effective care protocols. In addition, such methods could also be used for better characterization of wound healing, confirming functional wound closure with restoration of skin barrier function. As mentioned previously, the suggestions made here will need to be validated to establish clinical relevance and determine the cost–benefit of this approach and its impact on clinical outcomes.

In addition to addressing skin health, optimal product selection and the use of proper care techniques for product application and removal are paramount to provide the best care for patients.

### Skin sensitization: uncertainties, challenges, and opportunities for improved risk assessment [^117VLTra]. Contact Dermatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

At the ESCD congress held in Manchester in 2016, a session was organized to encourage more dialogue between clinicians with expertise in skin sensitization and toxicologists seeking to provide effective risk assessment to prevent human health issues. That session focused on the remaining uncertainties regarding the induction and regulation of skin sensitization in humans, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the refinement and improvement of risk assessment methodologies. This short article, prompted by those discussions, debates what the authors regard as being among the most important and most intriguing uncertainties about skin sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis in humans, and the most significant opportunities for improving risk assessment. The aim has been to provide a basis for mapping out the areas that might benefit from a closer alignment between the relevant clinical community and toxicologists charged with the responsibility of ensuring that skin sensitization risks are understood and managed.

### The science of skin: measuring damage and assessing risk [^114Xkjyn]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance: Healthy skin provides a barrier to contaminants. Breaches in skin integrity are often encountered in the patient health care journey, owing to intrinsic health issues or to various procedures and medical devices used. The time has come to move clinical practice beyond mere awareness of medical adhesive-related skin injury and toward improved care and outcomes. Recent Advances: Methods developed in research settings allow quantitative assessments of skin damage based on the measurement of baseline skin properties. These properties become altered by stress and over time. Assessment methods typically used by the cosmetic industry to compare product performance could offer new possibilities to improve clinical practice by providing better information on the status of patient skin. This review summarizes available skin assessment methods as well as specific patient risks for skin damage. Critical Issues: Patients in health care settings may be at risk for skin damage owing to predisposing medical conditions, health status, medications taken, and procedures or devices used in their treatment. Skin injuries come as an additional burden to these medical circumstances and could be prevented. Technology should be leveraged to improve care, help maintain patient skin health, and better characterize functional wound closure. Future Directions: Skin testing methods developed to evaluate cosmetic products or assess damage caused by occupational exposure can provide detailed, quantitative information on the integrity of skin. Such methods have the potential to guide prevention and treatment efforts to improve the care of patients suffering from skin integrity issues while in the health care system.

### Peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) [^111RGKEv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Do not decrease or increase your dose of PEGASYS unless your healthcare provider tells you to.

How do I give the injection of PEGASYS?

Position the point of the needle (the bevel) so it is facing up (see Figure O).
Figure O:

Pinch a fold of skin on your stomach or thigh firmly with your thumb and forefinger (see Figure P).
Figure P:

Hold the syringe like a pencil at a 45° to 90° angle to your skin. With a quick "dart-like" motion, push the needle into the skin as far as it will go (see Figure Q).
Figure Q:

After the needle is inserted, remove the hand used to pinch the skin and use it to hold the syringe barrel.
Pull the plunger of the syringe back slightly.
If blood comes into the syringe, the needle has entered a blood vessel.
Do not inject PEGASYS. Withdraw the needle and throw away the syringe and needle in the puncture-resistant container. See " How should I dispose of used syringes and needles? "
Then, repeat steps 1 through 16 with a new prefilled syringe and prepare a new injection site.
If no blood is present in the syringe, inject the medicine by gently pressing the plunger all the way down the syringe barrel, until the syringe is empty.
When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin. Wipe the area with an alcohol pad.
To prevent needle-stick injuries, before you dispose of the syringe and needle, push the green needle cover toward the needle (see Figure R). Then place the free end of the green cap on a flat surface and push down with a firm and quick motion until it clicks and covers over the needle (see Figure S).

### Population education in preventing skin cancer: from childhood to adulthood [^113qiPcj]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in populations of predominantly Caucasian origins. As the main cause of skin cancer is excessive sun exposure among a sun-sensitive population, most skin cancers are theoretically avoidable, and prevention is an important topic for public health purposes. The development of skin cancer may be limited by effective primary prevention campaigns, causing people to protect themselves from the sun. In order to be effective, the right people need to become aware of the risks and benefits; they also need to be convinced that they can take effective protective measures. Secondary skin cancer prevention aims to avoid skin cancer morbidity and mortality and is, therefore, mainly aimed at early detection of cutaneous melanomas. Around the world, elderly men are the worst off in terms of melanoma mortality statistics and would be an important target group for secondary prevention. Several prevention initiatives have been developed, including awareness campaigns and voluntary skin cancer screening days. So far, few of these initiatives have proven to be successful in changing population behavior and/or skin cancer related mortality. Most of these initiatives appealed more to (young) women rather than the elderly males who would benefit most. In this review, various aspects of primary and secondary skin cancer prevention are discussed, including the results of some of the primary and secondary prevention initiatives.

### Preventive skin care [^115Wsooc]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — adverse events with leave-on topical skin products: In a meta-analysis comparing different leave-on topical skin products to placebo topical products for preventing pressure injuries, adverse events occurred at a higher rate with a leave-on topical skin product but were not statistically significant (0.6% versus 0%, RR 4.38, 95% CI 0.50 to 38.30, p = 0.18), with low certainty that this represented a true effect; evidence not specific to PI prevention further suggests that vegetable and seed oils should not be used in people with skin barrier impairments because disruption to the stratum corneum can lead to skin irritation and other adverse events.

### Preventive skin care [^11199jWw]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — leave-on topical skin products recommendation: We make no recommendation on the routine use of leave-on topical skin products to prevent pressure injuries. (Very low certainty of evidence) The Guideline Governance Group noted the desirable and undesirable effects, and the very low certainty of the evidence, and due to the lack of evidence that fully elucidated any mechanism by which leave-on topical skin products could influence PI development, the Guideline Governance Group determined that no recommendation could be made about the use of leave-on topical skin products for preventing PIs.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^114S94T4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We planned to include the following summary of findings tables.

Summary of findings table 1: Skin care intervention versus no treatment or standard care only. This table includes primary estimates of treatment effects in addition to key sensitivity analyses for primary outcomes.
Summary of findings table 2: Skin care intervention A versus no treatment or standard care only. Intervention A = skin care interventions that aim to promote hydration or barrier function. This table would include subgroup analyses of low risk of eczema and food allergy versus high risk of eczema and food allergy, either by FLG mutation or by family history of allergic disease.
Summary of findings table 3: Skin care intervention B versus no treatment or standard care only. Intervention B = skin care interventions that aim to prevent damage. This table would include subgroup analyses of low risk of eczema and food allergy versus high risk of eczema and food allergy, either by FLG mutation or by family history of allergic disease.

It did not prove necessary to stratify comparisons by types of skin care interventions because we did not identify any eligible trials of skin care intervention type B. We therefore included only Table 1.

Outcomes for summary of findings tables

Primary outcomes

Eczema diagnosis
IgE‐mediated food allergy

Key secondary outcomes

Adverse events during the intervention period, such as slippage, skin infection, stinging, or allergic reaction to moisturiser
Time to onset of eczema
Parental report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen
Allergic sensitisation to a food allergen

We included outcomes for sensitivity analyses by method of outcome assessment and by risk of bias in the 'Comments' section of Table 1.

Certainty of the evidence

We applied the GRADE approach to our main comparisons listed above (Andrews 2013; Schünemann 2021). The outcomes included in our summary of findings table are the primary outcomes of eczema and food allergy, along with key secondary outcomes of adverse events, time to onset of eczema, parental report of immediate food allergy, and allergic sensitisation to a food allergen. Two review authors (MK, SC, VC, or RJB) independently assessed each outcome for risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias, downgrading the certainty of evidence when appropriate. For assessing a trial for which MK and RJB were investigators (Chalmers 2020), SC and VC independently performed GRADE assessment for that study. We graded each outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty.

### Dopamine signaling drives skin invasion by human-infective nematodes [^116pa7Qs]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Skin-penetrating nematodes are one of the most prevalent causes of disease worldwide. The World Health Organization has targeted these parasites for elimination by 2030, but the lack of preventative measures is a major obstacle to this goal. Infective larvae enter hosts through skin and blocking skin penetration could prevent infection. However, in order to prevent worm ingress via the skin, an understanding of the behavioral and neural mechanisms that drive skin penetration is required. Here, we describe the skin-penetration behavior of the human-infective threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis. We show that S. stercoralis engages in repeated cycles of pushing, puncturing, and crawling on the skin surface before penetrating. Pharmacological inhibition of dopamine signaling inhibits these behaviors in S. stercoralis and the human hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum, suggesting a critical role for dopamine signaling in driving skin penetration across distantly related nematodes. CRISPR-mediated disruption of dopamine biosynthesis and chemogenetic silencing of dopaminergic neurons also inhibit skin penetration. Finally, inactivation of the TRPN channel TRP-4, which is expressed in the dopaminergic neurons, blocks skin penetration. Our results suggest that drugs targeting TRP-4 and other nematode-specific components of the dopaminergic pathway could be developed into topical prophylactics that block skin penetration, thereby preventing infections.

### Behavioral counseling to prevent skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114WLV9x]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF behavioral counseling to prevent skin cancer — net benefit by age and skin type: In children, adolescents, and young adults with fair skin types, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of counseling to decrease ultraviolet (UV) exposure and reduce skin cancer risk is moderate for persons aged 6 months to 24 years. In adults older than 24 years, behavioral counseling interventions result in a small increase in sun protection behaviors, the harms of counseling are small, and the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit is small. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer and concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer.

### The science of skin: measuring damage and assessing risk [^114UWYa2]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Adequate care often involves balancing the need for adhesion versus minimizing skin damage. The strength of adhesion needed depends on the application: a dressing placed to minimize the risk of pressure ulcer development does not require the same adhesion as a device securing a central venous catheter or a tape securing a nasogastric tube. The problem of MARSI has been recognized for several years.MARSI are skin adverse reactions that can occur in anyone requiring a medical adhesive, and they can be avoided with preventive measures. The true incidence is not known because these occurrences are believed to be underreported. However, several studies in specific settings have been published. We have summarized this information to provide a general idea of the situation; studies are not always comparable however because of differences in reporting (Fig. 1). Table 1 provides the various types of skin damage.

Figure 1.
Examples of reported prevalence or incidence of MARSI in the literature, in percent of patients affected. Sources (from top to bottom): Wang et al; Kim and Shin; Schwartz Sellaeg et al; Zhao et al; Alcantara et al; Polatsch et al; Zhao et al; de Oliveira Marcatto et al; White et al; Konya et al; McLane et al; Farris et al; Jester et al; Gao et al; Ratliff; Koyano et al; Sanada et al.MARSI, medical adhesive-related skin injury.

Table 1.
Types of skin damage

With reported incidences as high as 37% of patients affected, the prevention of avoidable skin damage ought to become a higher priority. To improve care and prevent MARSI, it is equally important to provide a good skin care routine, carefully select adhesive products, and utilize appropriate application and removal techniques. Reducing the risk of contamination also plays an important role.

### Dressings and topical agents for preventing pressure ulcers [^113nzQ3T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

Our understanding of how prophylactic dressings and topical agents prevent pressure ulcers has improved (Gefen 2020; Marshall 2019). Previous hypotheses suggested these dressings and topical agents prevented pressure ulcers by reducing friction forces (Butcher 2009). Recent evidence confirms prophylactic dressings prevent pressure ulcers by either minimising friction forces exerted on the skin, preventing the skin from stretching or tearing, or absorbing skin surface moisture (Marshall 2019). It must be noted that commercially available prophylactic dressings have substantial differences in their design and composition, which determines the dressing's biomechanical performance in terms of tissue protection and durability (Gefen 2020; Grigatti 2021). Hence, dressing selection must align with both the patient and clinical needs (EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA 2019; Gefen 2019). Furthermore, international guidelines recommend the use of prophylactic dressings as an adjunct to offloading pressure and other prevention strategies, such as repositioning (EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA 2019; NICE 2014). In relation to topical agents, there is a lack of empirical evidence to confirm how they prevent pressure ulcers (EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA 2019). It is hypothesised that topical agents applied directly to the skin will moisturise and protect the skin by reducing dryness, a known risk factor for pressure ulcer development. Optimal skin conditioning is of paramount importance, especially for individuals with low sebum production, such as the elderly. This preparation is essential to fortify the skin against mechanical stress and promote improved circulation. Additionally, these interventions play a pivotal role in maintaining skin pH balance, reinforcing the skin's barrier integrity, and establishing a protective occlusive layer (Diaz‐Valenzuela 2019; EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA 2019; Verdú 2012).

Why it is important to do this review

The use of dressings and topical agents for preventing pressure ulcers is discussed in the literature and in international pressure ulcer prevention guidelines. Prior to the publication of the original version of this review (Moore 2013), the level of evidence to support these recommendations had not been systematically assessed (Butcher 2009). The use of adjunct therapies (for example, dressings, creams, or lotions) as part of prevention strategies adds to the overall costs. Therefore, it is important to explore whether the use of these therapies provides potential benefit to patients (Moore 2018). This is the third update of this review.

### Behavioral counseling to prevent skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115fM97C]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) behavioral counseling to prevent skin cancer — recommendations: The USPSTF recommends counseling young adults, adolescents, children, and parents of young children about minimizing exposure to UV radiation for persons aged 6 months to 24 years with fair skin types to reduce their risk of skin cancer (B recommendation). For adults older than 24 years with fair skin types, the USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer counseling about minimizing UV exposure, noting that existing evidence indicates that the net benefit of counseling all adults older than 24 years is small; therefore, clinicians should consider the presence of risk factors for skin cancer (C recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of counseling adults about skin self-examination to prevent skin cancer (I statement), and this recommendation applies to asymptomatic persons without a history of skin cancer.

### The science of skin: measuring damage and assessing risk [^114fnPs1]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Once the skin has regained its physiological balance, the selection of suitable adhesive medical devices together with an adapted care technique as part of the daily routine is the best prerequisite to providing the patient with the best possible care. Application technique should always follow the manufacturer's instructions and be performed on clean and dry skin, without tension, stretching, gaps, or wrinkles; removal should be "low and slow" (no fast, vertical pulling) and may be aided by the use of medical adhesive removers. Proper care techniques include reducing the risk of cross-contamination from products that have been traditionally carried around and reused, such as medical tapes. Single-patient, single-use products are safer with respect to cross-contamination. This is important because if an injury of the skin barrier happens at the same time as contamination in a hospital setting, there is a higher risk of infection.

These considerations become increasingly important when treating older patients. As the skin ages, the dermal–epidermal junction flattens, with the rete peg-related roughness index decreasing by > 35%. The interdigitation index, an expression of the shape of the border between the epidermis and the dermis, decreases by ∼20% in older subjects compared with a younger cohort. Skin stiffness also decreases with age. These changes make the skin more prone to trauma and shear injuries such as skin tears. Finally, championing skin integrity using a model of education, auditing, and feedback can increase the uptake of evidence-based practice by staff and significantly decrease the proportion of residents with a wound of any type in residential aged care facilities.

Methodologies already exist to quantitatively assess skin aging and skin damage. These methods serve as tools to compare products in controlled research settings and provide a better understanding of interactions between adhesives and skin. In addition to current clinical strategies, some of these methods could potentially be used preventatively in at-risk patients to customize their care. Individualized patient risk assessment is another important factor to help prevent MARSI. In this article, we will review the available skin assessment methods and patient risk assessment tools and propose to use some of these methods to help move clinical practice beyond MARSI awareness toward improved care and outcomes.

The literature on this topic sometimes overlaps with the wound healing literature because severe MARSI can cause wounds that are difficult to heal and can become infected. Moreover, MARSI can also occur on the fragile periwound skin around chronic wounds. A full review of wound healing is however out of scope here.

### Indirect consequences of coronavirus disease 2019: skin lesions caused by the frequent hand sanitation and use of personal protective equipment and strategies for their prevention [^1175QVEM]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enforced the use of hand sanitation and of personal protective equipment, such as masks and visors, especially by health-care professionals, but also by the general public. However, frequent hand sanitation and the prolonged and continuous use of personal protective equipment are responsible for constant frictional and pressure forces on skin causing lesions, the most reported being acne, facial itching, dryness, and rash. Thus, it is important to find measures to prevent skin lesions, in order to improve the quality of life of health-care professionals and of the general public. This article gathers the current information regarding measures to prevent human to human transmission of COVID-19, reviews the most common skin lesions caused by the use of hand sanitizers and different types of personal protective equipment, and the possible preventive measures that can be used on a daily basis to minimize the risk of developing skin-related pathologies. Daily skin care routines and the incorporation of a dressing between the skin and the personal protective equipment to serve as a protective barrier are some of the applied measures. Moisturizers and dressings improve the skin's ability to respond to constant aggressions. Lastly, the need for additional studies to evaluate the lubrication properties of different types of dressings is discussed. The understanding of what kind of dressing is more suitable to prevent pressure injuries is crucial to promote healthy skin and wellbeing during pandemic times.

### Skin-to-skin contact for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kWpH1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hypoglycaemia affects up to 5–15% of infants, and is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Therefore, prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia is crucial to improve health outcomes for at-risk infants, including those born preterm, small for gestational age, large for gestational age or to mothers with diabetes.

Skin-to-skin contact involves the naked infant being placed prone on the bare chest of the mother soon after birth. The UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative Guidelines suggest the duration of skin-to-skin contact should be a minimum of one hour or until the first feed is complete. Sometimes, the infant is placed in skin-to-skin contact with the father or another caregiver. The practice is also a component of Kangaroo Care and is now recognised to have many benefits for both caregivers and infants, including promoting physiological stability in infants, promoting early and exclusive breastfeeding and parent-infant bonding. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) specifically refers to extended skin-to-skin contact (at least 8 h per day) for preterm and low birthweight infants (< 2.5 kg), in combination with exclusive breastfeeding support. In these infants, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend immediate initiation of KMC after birth. Uptake of KMC in low-resource settings has helped improve health outcomes, especially when incubators are unavailable.

There are several mechanisms through which skin-to-skin contact may potentially reduce the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia, including reducing the infant's energy expenditure by promoting thermoregulation, increasing quiet sleep time and reducing crying. Skin-to-skin contact also promotes early breastfeeding initiation which provides crucial nutrition to the infant.

Although skin-to-skin contact is recommended for inclusion in neonatal hypoglycaemia prevention guidelines by the UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative, there is limited data about the efficacy of skin-to-skin contact for preventing neonatal hypoglycaemia. We undertook a systematic review to examine whether skin-to-skin contact is effective in preventing neonatal hypoglycaemia compared to standard care or other treatments, with the aim of informing future guideline development and clinical decision-making.

### The science of skin: measuring damage and assessing risk [^112uGXf7]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE

Healthy skin serves as a barrier to protect the body from outside contaminants and microorganisms. Preserving and protecting skin health is an important component of quality care for patient satisfaction, and it is also better economically than the treatment of lost skin integrity. Unfortunately, there are many circumstances in health care settings where skin is exposed to various medical devices (tapes, dressings, securement devices, drapes) and/or conditions (friction, pressure) that put it at risk for damage. In addition, as patients age, their skin becomes more fragile, slower to heal, and more susceptible to injury from various trauma and exposure to moisture. Once the skin is damaged, it becomes more susceptible to infection because of reduced immunosurveillance.

### Disease risk scores for skin cancers [^116j7ks4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Cancer screening and early diagnosis are recognized as key public health strategies for reducing cancer burden. Each year, more than 14 million people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer, and 8.8 million will die from cancer, representing one in six deaths globally. It has been estimated that 50–60% of cancers could be prevented or successfully treated by efficient cancer prevention and early detection programs. Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, and it is also among the more preventable forms of cancer. In the United States, one in five Americans are likely to develop skin cancer during their lifetime. Even melanoma, the more aggressive form among the three main skin cancers, which include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), has a 5-year survival rate of 98%, if diagnosed at an early stage. Despite being preventable, more than 15,000 Americans die every year from skin cancer.

Public health efforts for prevention have focused on education regarding the danger of sun exposure and increasing adoption of sun-protective habits. For early skin cancer detection, medical organizations have recommended full body skin examination, a quick, inexpensive, and noninvasive method. Unfortunately, there is no convincing evidence that visual skin examination is an effective method to detect skin cancer in the general population. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have identified many additional risk factors, including skin pigmentation, skin susceptibility to sun exposure, family history of skin cancer, and genetics. There is thus a considerable interest in the development of new cost-effective screening programs that integrate all risk factors, environmental and genetics, and accurately identify asymptomatic individuals with high risk of developing skin cancer. The ultimate goals of screening would be to identify individuals at high risk, construct personalized skin cancer monitoring plans for these individuals, detail how early and frequently skin cancer detection programs should be implemented, and to anticipate the type and intensity of potential treatments.

### The skin as a target for prevention of the atopic March [^116Mq6SV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Allergic diseases have increased dramatically in the developed world during the past few decades, yet the understanding of risk factors and effective prevention approaches remain limited. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the hypothesis that skin-barrier impairment and early-life atopic dermatitis (AD) could play a causal role in the development of sensitization and subsequent food allergies and allergic airways disease (allergic asthma and rhinitis). We further discuss the potential to target the skin barrier as a means to lower the incidence of allergic disease.

Data Sources

Review of published literature.

Study Selections

Narrative.

Results

There is a strong link between AD and sensitization, food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis, particularly AD that is severe and commences in the first 6 months of life. There also is emerging evidence that regular use of prophylactic emollients can significantly decrease the expression of AD, at least while treatment continues. Studies are exploring whether decreased AD expression might modulate the allergic response at a more fundamental level and potentially alter the association between early-life AD and subsequent development of food allergy and allergic airways disease.

Conclusion

Although at this point there is only indirect evidence that early-life emollient use might prevent AD and food allergy, early studies are encouraging. The results of high-quality prevention trials that are in progress are eagerly anticipated. If found to be effective, then neonatal emollient use could be a simple public health measure to lower the incidence of AD, food allergies, and allergic airways disease in future generations.

### Intertriginous eruption [^1135UNeb]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Intertrigo is a superficial inflammatory skin disorder involving any area of the body where two opposing skin surfaces can touch and rub or chaff. The word "intertrigo" comes from the Latin inter (between) and terere (to rub) and reflects the rubbing together of skin against skin to create maceration and irritation, hence, friction dermatitis or chaffing. It is a common disorder that can affect any individual from infancy to old age. It is primarily caused by skin-on-skin friction and is facilitated by moisture trapped in deep skin folds where air circulation is limited. The condition is particularly common in obese patients who have diabetes and who are exposed to heat and humidity. The moist, damaged skin associated with intertrigo is a fertile breeding ground for various microorganisms, and secondary cutaneous infections are commonly observed in these areas. The present chapter does not deal with "ordinary" intertrigo, but rather with other skin diseases that have affinity to the intertriginous areas. Diseases mentioned are: acrodermatitis enteropathica, the baboon syndrome or intertriginous drug eruption, Darier disease, Hailey-Hailey, granular parakeratosis, Kawasaki syndrome, necrolytic migratory erythema, streptococcal intertrigo and others.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^1162eTD9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

First Cleansing

The previous recommendations 3 were modified in light of expert opinion (Table 2) rather than new direct evidence; all first‐cleansing recommendations were regarded to be founded on low‐quality evidence, a consequence in part of the considerable ethical difficulties inherent in conducting controlled studies in this group.

Table 2
Recommendations on the First Cleansing of (Full‐Term) Newborns

The use of water for the first wiping of infants was removed from the first recommendation because this does not reflect usual practice and may be counterproductive; one of the principal reasons for wiping is to dry the baby for temperature stabilization. Furthermore retaining the vernix caseosa in the immediate postbirth period was thought to offer benefits in terms of skin protection; it is thought that the vernix caseosa provides physical protection from amniotic fluid and enzymes and lowers skin surface pH, provides lipids, and exerts a moisturizing effect 5. Therefore the first recommendation was reworded to state that a dry towel should preferably be used. Vigorous rubbing of the baby should be avoided, and in cases of significant soiling, water can be used.

That the first bath should be conducted only once the newborn's temperature has stabilized was a strong recommendation, Bathing "too early" remains commonplace in some locations 6 and should be discouraged because it may unnecessarily interrupt breastfeeding and skin‐to‐skin contact 6 and increase the risk of hypothermia and respiratory distress 7, 8.

The final recommendation was altered to state that health care workers should ideally use gloves for the first bath. This strong guidance is predicated on the assumption that maternal blood may pose a threat to health care professionals and that health care professionals not wearing gloves may increase the risk of microbial contamination to babies. Gloves were regarded as ideal but not mandatory because the first bath may occur many days after birth, at which point the risk of contamination will have decreased; there is also a limited supply of gloves in some health care settings.

### Feast for thought: a comprehensive review of food allergy 2021–2023 [^1127fytt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Skin interventions in infancy

The dual allergen exposure hypothesis proposes that FA risk results from the balance between dose, timing, and route of exposure to food allergens in infancy, with high-dose exposure through the oral route being tolerogenic and low-dose exposure through the skin, particularly inflamed skin affected with eczema, being proallergenic. This hypothesis was supported by the LEAP study findings a few years ago, and has motivated trials of skin interventions to prevent sensitization and development of FA. However, the findings have been somewhat surprising, with the BEEP study showing negative results for the preventative effects of emollients on FA risk and the PreventADALL study showing that emollients and early food introduction did not prevent eczema at age 12 months but did prevent FA at age 36 months. In the Enquiring about Tolerance (EAT) study, regular application of moisturizers to the skin of young infants was associated with increased transcutaneous sensitization and FA. Specifically, moisturization frequency showed a dose-response relationship with the development of FA in children with and without visible eczema at enrollment. Two possible explanations have emerged for these findings: either moisturizers facilitate the penetration of food allergens across the skin barrier and/or allergenic proteins are transferred to the babies' skin by parents' hands. A Cochrane review concluded that skin care interventions in infancy did not prevent eczema and may increase the risk of skin infection and FA.

Given that eczema is a risk factor for FA, the question of whether early proactive treatment or reactive treatment of eczema is best for FA prevention has been addressed. For example, in the Prevention of Allergy via cutaneous Intervention (PACI) study, infants were randomized to proactively apply emollients and topical corticosteroids to both lesional and nonlesional skin (enhanced treatment) or to use topical corticosteroids on lesional skin reactively when needed (conventional treatment). The incidence of EA was significantly reduced with use of enhanced treatment (31.4%) versus conventional treatment (41.9%). However, the enhanced treatment lowered body weight and height; thus, lower potency topical corticosteroids or other topical therapies should be considered. Along a similar line, the Stopping Eczema and Allergy (SEAL) study aims to compare the effect of proactive sequential skin care or moisturizer with proactive use of fluticasone propionate cream to reduce the occurrence, exacerbation, and severity of atopic dermatitis, and therefore, to prevent FA (NCT03742414).

### Preventive skin care [^1142PKFY]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — evidence gaps and research needs include that there is limited evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of preventive dressings used over time and on their incorporation into prevention plans over longer durations (e.g., more than six to eight weeks). There is limited recent evidence on low friction fabrics, including their use with topical skin products and preventive dressings, and more exploration of potential benefits, risks, and incorporation into care pathways is required. There is an overall paucity of research co-designed with consumers or that focusses on patient reported outcome measures, and a paucity of evidence for neonates and children. For leave-on topical products, there is limited evidence based on prespecified mechanisms of action; explanative proof-of-concept studies are warranted. The Guideline Governance Group noted there was no comparative evidence addressing the effectiveness of a hydrocolloid dressing used for preventing PIs versus no preventive dressing, or the effectiveness of a multilayered soft silicone foam dressing versus any other preventive dressing for anatomical locations other than the heel and sacrum. The Guideline Governance Group noted difficulties in evaluating leave-on topical skin products, citing discrepancies in product description/classification, no strong evidence on the mechanism by which a leave-on topical skin product prevents PI, and the need for future research, a transparent product classification system, and well-conducted clinical studies using clinically relevant head-to-head comparisons of major and widespread topical products.

### The prevention and management of acute skin reactions related to radiation therapy: a systematic review and practice guideline [^113f2K6k]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

To develop a practice guideline report on the questions: What are the optimal methods to prevent acute skin reactions (occurring within the first 6 months of irradiation) related to radiation therapy? What are the optimal methods to manage acute skin reactions related to radiation therapy?

Materials and Methods

Cancer Care Ontario's Supportive Care Guidelines Group (SCGG) conducted a systematic review of literature on this topic. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated to guide clinical decision making, and a formal external review process was conducted to validate the relevance of these opinions for Ontario practitioners.

Main Results

Twenty-eight trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Of the twenty-three trials that evaluated preventative methods, washing was the only practice which significantly prevented skin reaction. Some evidence suggested topical steroid creams and calendula ointment might be effective. None of the five trials evaluating skin reaction management detected a positive effect using steroid cream, sucralfate cream, or dressings.

Conclusions

Skin washing, including gentle washing with water alone with or without mild soap, should be permitted in patients receiving radiation therapy to prevent acute skin reaction. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute specific topical or oral agents for the prevention or management of acute skin reaction. In the expert opinion from the SCGG, the use of a plain, non-scented, lanolin-free hydrophilic cream may be helpful in preventing radiation skin reactions. In addition, a low dose (i.e., 1%) corticosteroid cream may be beneficial in the reduction of itching and irritation.

### Emollient enhancement of the skin barrier from birth offers effective atopic dermatitis prevention [^112ao8JS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that has reached epidemic proportions in children worldwide and is increasing in prevalence. Children with atopic dermatitis experience intractable itch along with inflamed, cracked, and often infected skin lesions. The onset of atopic dermatitis in childhood often heralds the development of subsequent allergic disorders, such as food allergy, asthma, and allergic rhinitis (the atopic march), as well as neurodevelopmental disorders. Development of an effective prevention strategy for atopic dermatitis and associated allergic disease would represent a major public health breakthrough.

Atopic dermatitis has been historically classified as an allergic disease, given its association with IgE-mediated diseases, such as food allergy. Prevention trials to date have primarily focused on allergen avoidance. Unfortunately, the results of these studies have been largely disappointing or inconsistent, and no single accepted prevention strategy has emerged.

Recent advances in cutaneous biology suggest epidermal defects might be a key initiator of atopic dermatitis and possibly allergic sensitization. Skin barrier dysfunction is now recognized as central to the initiation and progression of atopic dermatitis. These new findings create an opportunity for the development of novel prevention strategies focusing on the skin barrier. We hypothesize that enhancement of a defective skin barrier early in life might prevent or delay the onset of atopic dermatitis.

Emollients provide a safe and effective method of skin barrier enhancement because they provide the skin with a source of exogenous lipids, improving its barrier properties. The results of a previous case-control study and open-label trial suggest the use of bland emollients from birth might protect against the onset of skin inflammation in neonates. The objective for this study was to test the hypothesis that emollient therapy from birth represents a safe, feasible, and efficacious approach to the prevention of atopic dermatitis (Fig 1).

### Beds, overlays and mattresses for preventing and treating pressure ulcers: an overview of cochrane reviews and network meta-analysis [^114SjrLz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

Support surfaces used with the aim of preventing and treating pressure ulcers aim to redistribute pressure beneath the skin of the body, in order to increase blood flow to tissues and relieve skin and soft tissue distortion (Wounds International 2010). Powered support surfaces are operated by electricity, unlike non‐powered surfaces. Active support surfaces achieve pressure redistribution by frequently changing the points of contact between the surface and body, reducing the duration of the pressure applied to specific anatomical sites (Clark 2011; NPIAP S3I 2019). This contrasts with reactive support surfaces' mode of action, which is passive and includes immersion (i.e. 'sinking' of the body into a support surface) and envelopment (i.e. conforming of a support surface to the irregularities in the body). Reactive support surfaces distribute the pressure over a greater area, thereby reducing the magnitude of the pressure at specific sites (Clark 2011). Additionally, support surfaces with low‐air‐loss features are designed to improve the skin microclimate with the aim of maintaining skin and tissue integrity, particularly in people with incontinence (Wounds International 2010).

### Photoaging: prevention and topical treatments [^116Qy7P6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

A rapidly increasing number of people visit dermatologists for the prevention and treatment of aging skin. Sun avoidance and sunscreen use are widely accepted strategies of primary prevention against photoaging. Convincing evidence shows that topical application of retinoids has an effect on reversing, at least partially, mild to moderate photodamage. Antioxidants and alpha-hydroxy acids can alter the skin structure and function. Enzymes that repair DNA damage or oligonucleotides that enhance the endogenous capacity for DNA damage repair may prove to be future preventive/therapeutic interventions for aging skin.

### Counseling to prevent skin cancer: recommendations and rationale of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^114Yp6tL]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2003). Low credibility.

This statement summarizes the current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on counseling to prevent skin cancer and the supporting scientific evidence, and updates the 1996 recommendation contained in the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, Second Edition (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Screening for skin cancer. In: Guide to clinical preventive services, 2nd ed. Washington DC: US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 1996:141–52). The USPSTF finds insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine counseling by primary care clinicians to prevent skin cancer. Although counseling parents may increase children's use of sunscreen, the USPSTF found little evidence to determine the effects of counseling on the sun protection behaviors of adults. These behaviors include wearing protective clothing, reducing excessive sun exposure, avoiding sun lamps and tanning beds, or practicing skin self-examination. The USPSTF, an independent panel of private sector experts in primary care and prevention, systematically reviews the evidence of effectiveness of a wide range of clinical preventive services, including screening tests, counseling, and chemoprevention. Members of the USPSTF represent the fields of family medicine, gerontology, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, nursing, and prevention research.

### Preventive skin care [^115gFVmu]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Preventive skin care — topical skin care for individuals at risk of a pressure injury (PI): It is good practice to evaluate the skin regularly and to implement a structured skin care regimen (Good practice statement). Promoting skin integrity is the goal of preventive pressure injury (PI) care. Strategies that are used to promote skin health include structured skin care regimens, promoting optimal nutrition, hydration, and mobilization, and appropriate treatment and prevention of other skin conditions (examples include but are not limited to intertriginous dermatitis and incontinence-associated dermatitis). Targeted skin care maintains or enhances skin integrity. Structured skin care regimens include gentle skin cleansing and drying and, when indicated, application of products to hydrate/moisturize the skin, protect the skin from moisture and/or to relieve signs and symptoms such as skin dryness (i.e., skin characterized by dull appearance, presence of dry desquamation or scales, and/or pruritus). Skin care regimens may increase skin tolerance to mechanical stress by supporting skin resilience and reducing risks such as maceration and inflammation.

### Moisturizers, emollients, or barrier preparations for the prevention of pressure injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112u9Yhk]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance: Pressure injuries are prevalent, yet preventable global health care problem estimated to affect 14% of hospital patients and up to 46% of aged care residents. One common prevention strategy is improving skin integrity through emollient therapy to optimize hydration and avoid skin breakdown. Therefore, this study aimed to review the literature and determine effectiveness of inert emollients, moisturizers, and barrier preparations compared with standard care, to prevent pressure injury in aged care or hospital settings. Recent Advances: Search terms were derived with database searches, including ProQuest, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, and the Cochrane library. The Robins1 and Risk of Bias 2 (Rob2) quality appraisal tools were used. A meta-analysis of the effects of interventions was conducted (random effects). Four studies met the inclusion criteria, with heterogeneous quality. Pooling of nonrandomized studies found that the application of emollients, moisturizers or barrier preparations did not significantly reduce incidence of pressure injury compared with standard care (relative risk 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.15–1.63, Z = 1.15, p = 0.25). Critical Issues: This review suggests that the use of inert moisturizers, emollients, or barrier preparations for preventing pressure injuries was not effective to prevent pressure injury in aged care or hospital settings. However, there was a distinct lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with only one meeting the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, most of the included studies did not report on the frequency of application of the product, making it difficult to determine if application was in line with current international guidelines. One included study, which utilized a combination of neutral body wash and emollient demonstrated a significant reduction in the development of stage one and two pressure injuries. This combination of care may further support skin integrity and should be further examined in future trials. Future Directions: Future studies should ideally be RCTs, which control for skin cleansing, and implement an inert moisturizer emollient or barrier preparation as part of a pressure injury reduction bundle of care. Standardization of the application of the product, the volume of product applied at each application, and the quality of the product should also be considered.

### Diaper dermatitis: etiology, manifestations, prevention, and management [^112wz9va]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pediatricians and parents report diaper dermatitis (DD) to be one of the most common skin diseases that affects almost every child at some point during the early months and years of life. Diapered skin is exposed to friction and excessive hydration, has a higher pH than nondiapered skin, and is repeatedly soiled with feces that contains enzymes with high irritation potential for the skin. The combination of these factors frequently results in skin damage, leading to visible erythematous lesions that can be irritating and painful to the child. Behavioral changes such as increased crying and agitation and changes in eating and sleeping patterns indicate emotional distress. Appropriate skin care can help to prevent the occurrence of DD and to speed up the healing of affected skin. This includes frequent diaper changes and aeration, gentle cleansing, and the use of a barrier cream. Mild to moderate cases usually resolve after a few days of following this routine, but the use of harsh cleaning products can exacerbate DD.

### Prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis [^114nXbzT]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is one of the most common skin conditions that infants suffer from and their caregivers manage in the first months post-birth. As such, questions of effective prevention and treatment of the condition often arise. Nonmedical skincare practices that support healthy skin barrier function can prevent DD manifestation or alleviate the condition in many cases. The usage of barrier emollients and improved diaper technology contributes to keeping moisture and irritants away from an infant's delicate skin. This paper addresses facts behind commonly asked questions from caregivers regarding DD and discusses effective measures to prevent and treat the condition.

### Efficacy, safety, and applications of skin protectants [^1178KmmB]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The skin barrier is essential for protection against allergens, irritants, and pathogens and is intimately involved in a variety of inflammatory conditions. As such, approaches to treating these inflammatory skin conditions could involve the repair and protection of the skin barrier. This form of treatment can be delivered in the form of skin protectants, though their protective value remains questionable. Evidence suggests that skin protectants could form an additional layer of protection against harmful substances that could penetrate the skin barrier. However, although several studies support the efficacy of skin protectants, others suggest potentially aggravating effects instead. The range of active ingredients included in skin protectant formulas varies widely, which could account for these observed differences. While the use of skin protectants could prove beneficial in populations at higher risk of exposure to irritants, their effectiveness may be hindered by a lack of proper adherence. The findings gathered from the existing literature on skin protectants appear promising, though further investigation must be conducted to better understand their protective effects against conventional barrier repair approaches.

Skin is an efficient protective barrier armed with an intricate network of antioxidants. External environmental stress diminishes and sometimes overwhelms these innate protective mechanisms; aging slows their efficacy. Topical antioxidants enhance natural endogenous defenses to create an indwelling reservoir for sustained protection with far higher concentrations than possible with oral intake. The challenge is creating formulations of these labile molecules that are stable, active, and can be effectively absorbed transdermally to deliver high concentrations.

Regarding preventative measures for frostbite, more specifically with respect to protection from cold, WMS 2024 guidelines recommend to advise the following measures to minimize exposure of tissue to cold:

- avoiding environmental conditions predisposing to frostbite, speciﬁcally below 0 °C (some risk 0 to -15 °C and increasing risk below -15 °C, even with low wind speeds)

- protecting skin from moisture, wind, and cold

- avoiding perspiration or wet extremities

- increasing insulation and skin protection (eg, by adding clothing layers, changing from gloves to mitts)

- ensuring beneﬁcial behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions (not being under the inﬂuence of illicit drugs, alcohol, or extreme hypoxemia)

- using chemical hand and foot warmers and electric foot warmers to maintain peripheral warmth

- checking oneself and the group regularly for extremity numbness or pain and warming the digits and/or extremities as soon as possible if there is concern that frostbite may be developing

- recognizing frostnip or superﬁcial frostbite before it becomes more serious

- minimizing duration of cold exposure

- warming digits or extremities with paresthesia as soon as possible, as the time that a digit or extremity can remain numb before developing frostbite is unknown

- warming an extremity at risk for frostbite (with numbness, poor dexterity, or pale color) with adjacent body heat from the patient or a companion, using the axilla or abdomen.

### Constant vigilance! managing threats to the skin barrier [^112zCkYj]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Skin barrier defects are one of the primary causes of atopic dermatitis (AD). The basis of skin barrier defects in AD is due to a deficiency in various barrier proteins including filaggrin, involucrin, claudins, and lipids such as ceramide, fatty acids, and cholesterol. This review updates a more detailed lipid dysregulation in the skin barrier of AD based on recent lipidomic analysis. The clinical implications, treatments, prevention, and predictive capability of skin barrier defects are also reviewed.

Data Sources

Published literature obtained through PubMed searches.

Study Selections

Studies relevant to the mechanisms, clinical implications, treatments, prevention, and predictors of AD development.

Results

Skin barrier defects contribute to transepidermal water loss, infections, IgE sensitizations, and cutaneous inflammation in AD. Preventive treatments include daily hydration and application of moisturizers. Because skin barrier defects precede the development of AD, they provide an opportunity for prediction and intervention.

Conclusion

Skin barrier defects play an important role in the comorbidities of AD including infectious complications, disease flare, and allergic diathesis. Current research focuses on prevention and prediction of AD development.

If the skin is kept at an elevated temperature by ambient conditions or clothing it cannot dissipate heat normally, which can progress such that the skin may begin to heat, not cool, the body; heat stroke occurs when core temperature rises above a critical level with cellular and systemic responses, and the severity of injury is determined by the level and duration of thermal stress.

### Foam surfaces for preventing pressure ulcers [^117FmSzJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure injuries) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Foam surfaces (beds, mattresses or overlays) are widely used with the aim of preventing pressure ulcers.

Objectives

To assess the effects of foam beds, mattresses or overlays compared with any support surface on the incidence of pressure ulcers in any population in any setting.

Search Methods

In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to foam beds, mattresses or overlays. Comparators were any beds, mattresses or overlays.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. If a foam surface was compared with surfaces that were not clearly specified, then the included study was recorded and described but not considered further in any data analyses.

Main Results

We included 29 studies (9566 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 101 participants). The average age of participants ranged from 47.0 to 85.3 years (median: 76.0 years). Participants were mainly from acute care settings. We analysed data for seven comparisons in the review: foam surfaces compared with: (1) alternating pressure air surfaces, (2) reactive air surfaces, (3) reactive fibre surfaces, (4) reactive gel surfaces, (5) reactive foam and gel surfaces, (6) reactive water surfaces, and (7) another type of foam surface. Of the 29 included studies, 17 (58.6%) presented findings which were considered at high overall risk of bias.

Primary Outcome

pressure ulcer incidence Low-certainty evidence suggests that foam surfaces may increase the risk of developing new pressure ulcers compared with (1) alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 2.95; I² = 63%; 4 studies, 2247 participants), and (2) reactive air surfaces (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.54; I² = 25%; 4 studies, 229 participants). We are uncertain regarding the difference in pressure ulcer incidence in people treated with foam surfaces and the following surfaces: (1) reactive fibre surfaces (1 study, 68 participants); (2) reactive gel surfaces (1 study, 135 participants); (3) reactive gel and foam surfaces (1 study, 91 participants); and (4) another type of foam surface (6 studies, 733 participants). These had very low-certainty evidence. Included studies have data on time to pressure ulcer development for two comparisons. When time to ulcer development is considered using hazard ratios, the difference in the risk of having new pressure ulcers, over 90 days' follow-up, between foam surfaces and alternating pressure air surfaces is uncertain (2 studies, 2105 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two further studies comparing different types of foam surfaces also reported time-to-event data, suggesting that viscoelastic foam surfaces with a density of 40 to 60 kg/m 3 may decrease the risk of having new pressure ulcers over 11.5 days' follow-up compared with foam surfaces with a density of 33 kg/m 3 (1 study, 62 participants); and solid foam surfaces may decrease the risk of having new pressure ulcers over one month's follow-up compared with convoluted foam surfaces (1 study, 84 participants). Both had low-certainty evidence. There was no analysable data for the comparison of foam surfaces with reactive water surfaces (one study with 117 participants). Secondary outcomes Support-surface-associated patient comfort: the review contains data for three comparisons for this outcome. It is uncertain if there is a difference in patient comfort measure between foam surfaces and alternating pressure air surfaces (1 study, 76 participants; very low-certainty evidence); foam surfaces and reactive air surfaces (1 study, 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and different types of foam surfaces (4 studies, 669 participants; very low-certainty evidence). All reported adverse events: the review contains data for two comparisons for this outcome. We are uncertain about differences in adverse effects between foam surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (3 studies, 2181 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and between foam surfaces and reactive air surfaces (1 study, 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Health-related quality of life: only one study reported data on this outcome. It is uncertain if there is a difference (low-certainty evidence) between foam surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces in health-related quality of life measured with two different questionnaires, the EQ-5D-5L (267 participants) and the PU-QoL-UI (233 participants). Cost-effectiveness: one study reported trial-based cost-effectiveness evaluations. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost-effective than foam surfaces in preventing pressure ulcer incidence (2029 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests uncertainty about the differences in pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort, adverse events and health-related quality of life between using foam surfaces and other surfaces (reactive fibre surfaces, reactive gel surfaces, reactive foam and gel surfaces, or reactive water surfaces). Foam surfaces may increase pressure ulcer incidence compared with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and reactive air surfaces. Alternating pressure (active) air surfaces are probably more cost-effective than foam surfaces in preventing new pressure ulcers. Future research in this area should consider evaluation of the most important support surfaces from the perspective of decision-makers. Time-to-event outcomes, careful assessment of adverse events and trial-level cost-effectiveness evaluation should be considered in future studies. Trials should be designed to minimise the risk of detection bias; for example, by using digital photography and by blinding adjudicators of the photographs to group allocation. Further review using network meta-analysis will add to the findings reported here.

### Skin cancer prevention educational resources: just a click away? [^114wLw1N]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The general public and health professionals are increasingly choosing the Internet to access skin cancer prevention information.

Objectives

To identify the optimal mechanism for finding skin cancer educational resources through the Internet and to characterize the resources currently available on-line.

Methods

A survey of experts involved in skin cancer prevention, followed by standardized searches through popular general Internet search engines using a list of 10 terms relevant to skin cancer prevention resources.

Results

Internet search was the preferred modality for identifying skin cancer educational resources of all survey participants. The five most-trusted Internet sites identified by the survey participants ranked within the top 10 most findable web sites using general search engines. Ninety-six of 1,000 web pages retrieved using general web-search engines provided information regarding specific skin cancer prevention resources. Seven databases were identified that catalogued educational resources from multiple sources. Peer-reviewed analysis of the outcomes associated with the educational resources was available for only four of 489 resources identified (2.7%).

Conclusions

Information on skin cancer educational resources available on the Internet is abundant but redundant, and direct access to these resources remains difficult. No sites were identified that comprehensively catalogued and characterized the resources available from the leading providers.

### Prevention of umbilical sagging after medium definition liposuction [^116bYXX8]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In 2006, Illouz classified body sites based on the risk of poor cosmetic outcomes after liposuction. The supra umbilical abdominal region was classified as an unforgiving site; even small mistakes during the procedure could cause unfavorable outcomes. The abdominal skin of the upper abdomen immediately above the umbilicus frequently shows excess skin in the upper abdomen, making the umbilicus look "sad". The skin can roll over the umbilicus, creating a horizontally shaped or sagging umbilicus.

Traditionally, the methods employed to prevent sagging of the umbilicus have been patient selection (no loose skin prior to liposuction), small amounts of fat removal from the upper abdomen, the utilization of noninvasive skin-tightening devices, and direct skin removal. Medium definition liposuction associated with umbilical fixation and the utilization of appropriate postoperative dressing and compression was the method we chose to prevent sagging of the umbilicus. Proper patient selection is key for consistent results of medium definition abdominal etching liposuction. Patients with a regular exercise routine, tight abdominal skin, muscular hypertrophy, and a low BFI are ideal candidates for medium definition liposuction. Therefore, even postpartum and older patients may be candidates if they fit the inclusion criteria. The more fat that is removed, the larger the imbalance between continent (skin) and content (fat). The challenge is to obtain the optimal proportion between fat removal and skin tightening. The dorsum and lateral waist, for example, seem to have better skin recoil than the anterior abdominal skin.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^113ughcA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Skin infections

Individual participant data on skin infections were available from six studies (Chalmers 2020; Cooke 2015; Lowe 2018a; McClanahan 2019; Simpson 2014; Skjerven 2020), including a total of 4209 randomised participants. Pooled IPD available from 2728 participants in these studies were in favour of standard care (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; Analysis 1.45), with I² = 0 (P = 0.95).

One additional trial that randomised 70 participants (35 to each group) reported weekly infection rates over four weeks of 0 (0%), 3 (8.6%), 7 (20%), and 5 (14.3%) in the control group versus 0 (0%), 0 (0%), 1 (2.9%), and 0 (0%) in the skin care group (Amer 2017).

### Wound, pressure ulcer, and burn guidelines (2023)-4: guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease / vasculitis-associated skin ulcers, third edition [^115Ysoc8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Scientific basis

To investigate drugs effective in preventing and treating skin ulcers in patients with SSc, randomized controlled trials (RCT) on "the prevention of new skin ulcers" and "healing of skin ulcers that had existed" were extracted, and 26 reports corresponded to them. Of these, bosentan and PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil), of which quantitative systematic reviews had been performed, were adopted for this CQ.

Two RCTsshowed that an endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, prevented the onset of new skin ulcers. In addition, a meta‐analysisreported its preventive effects on the onset of new skin ulcers. Thus, the recommendation level for prevention is strong. On the other hand, these RCTs did not show any significant difference in the curative effects on skin ulcers. There was no other drug with a high level of evidence on skin ulcer healing. We decided to propose treatment with bosentan through a review at a panel meeting, considering the publication of many case series studies of bosentan, and widespread clinical use of this drug for the treatment of refractory SSc‐associated skin ulcers in Japan. As there is no evidence exceeding the case series studies, the strength of total evidence is D (very weak), and the recommendation level is weak.

Concerning PDE5 inhibitors, there is one RCT of sildenafilshowing a tendency to prevent the onset of new skin ulcers. Furthermore, one RCT of tadalafilshowed that the number of patients with new ulcer onset was smaller than in the placebo group. Based on these results, the recommendation level for prevention is weak. With respect to therapeutic effects, one RCT of sildenafil demonstrated its therapeutic effects, and one RCT of tadalafil also showed its therapeutic effects on skin ulcers. The present guidelines drafting committee uniquely performed a meta‐analysis of these reports. Significant therapeutic effects on skin ulcers were observed. Considering a bias for these, the recommendation level for treatment is weak.

Regarding preventative measures for frostbite, more specifically with respect to maintaining peripheral perfusion, WMS 2024 guidelines recommend to advise the following preventative measures to ensure local tissue perfusion:

- maintaining adequate core temperature and body hydration

- minimizing the effects of known diseases, medications, and substances that might decrease perfusion (including awareness and symptoms of alcohol and drug use)

- covering all skin and the scalp to insulate from the cold

- minimizing blood ﬂow restriction, such as occurs with constrictive clothing, footwear, or immobility

- ensuring adequate nutrition

- using supplemental oxygen in severely hypoxic conditions (such as > 7,500 m).

### Lugdunin amplifies innate immune responses in the skin in synergy with host-and microbiota-derived factors [^114fN9E6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is most frequently found in humans in the inguinal and perineal areas, the axilla, as well as in the nail bed and the nose, where it is considered a part of the normal human skin flora. Staphylococcus lugdunensis can co-exist with other commensals on human skin such as S. epidermidis, but intriguingly, nasal colonization by S. aureus or S. lugdunensis, was shown to be mutually exclusive as a result of lugdunin production. In fact, humans who are colonized by S. lugdunensis in the nose have a 6-fold lower risk of S. aureus carriage than individuals who are not colonized. However, the total number of S. lugdunensis in the noses of carriers is considerably low compared to the number of other commensals. Therefore, we speculated that apart from its antimicrobial activity, lugdunin might exhibit additional properties that contribute to the prevention of S. aureus colonization. Here we show that the protective potential of lugdunin can be further increased both by combined action with factors produced by other commensals that promote the host innate defense by inducing the expression of AMPs and by recruiting phagocytic immune cells, as well as by synergistic antimicrobial action with the host AMPs LL-37 and dermcidin-derived peptides. These results may explain why such low numbers of S. lugdunensis can completely prevent S. aureus from colonizing epithelial tissues.

### Skin cancers and their risk factors in older persons: a population-based study [^116rBDvg]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

As a conclusion, we found that many older participants were diagnosed with the first or subsequent skin cancer during the TBSE. These findings support the importance of skin evaluation of those with advanced age. More power should be focused on prevention of skin cancers. To answer this gap, European Skin Cancer Foundation has already launched prevention strategies like SunPass Kindergarten, and e.g.in Finland North-Savo Skin Cancer Program (NOSCAP) has focused both in primary (to find those in highest risk of skin cancer) and secondary prevention of skin cancers. Physicians treating older persons are encouraged to perform a skin examination to detect skin cancers and their precursors. Previous history of skin cancer - which is easy to elicit from the patient - can act as a clue to the patient being at higher risk of new skin cancers. Because we found that skin cancer and precursors particularly affected men, we especially call for caution when treating older men. However, what comes to treatment of skin tumors of older person a patient's personal situation must always be taken into consideration when planning treatment options. For frail patients with a limited life-expectancy, watchful-waiting can sometimes be a right option.

### Onychomycosis to fungal superinfection: prevention strategies and considerations [^114tHTyi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common fungal skin infection, and it is frequently seen in the setting of other concomitant fungal infections, the most common being tinea pedis. Infected nails become a reservoir of fungal organisms that may infect the skin, and vice versa. Early, effective treatment of the nails is necessary for preventing not only permanent structural damage but also the spread and superinfection of the surrounding skin and soft tissue. Moreover, treatment of the skin is important for preventing re-infection of the nails.
