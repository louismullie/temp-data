## Question

What is the most common type of Chiari malformation presenting with symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which type of Chiari malformation most commonly presents with symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classification of Chiari malformations and which subtype is most prevalent. Then, I should verify which subtype most often becomes symptomatic and why. Next, I will examine the most common presenting symptom and its characteristics. Finally, I will consider age-related differences in presentation and synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the classification and baseline epidemiology. Chiari malformations are categorized into types I through IV, with type I defined by cerebellar tonsillar descent below the foramen magnum, typically using a threshold of about 5 mm on MRI, and it is the most common subtype in adults and children, with imaging prevalence estimates around 1–3.6% in some series, though many cases are incidental and asymptomatic [^111MeVLb] [^112kRCZu] [^114kPx1i] [^114vdcTU].

> Wait, let me verify which type most often becomes symptomatic. Type I is the predominant symptomatic phenotype in clinical practice, whereas type II is classically associated with myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus and tends to present in infancy, so symptomatic presentations of type II are concentrated in a different, younger population and context compared with type I in older children and adults [^114SUHWc] [^115qHEmU]. Hold on, I should also note that while type I is common radiographically, only a subset develop clinically meaningful symptoms, which aligns with the observation that many incidentally detected cases remain asymptomatic over time [^114vdcTU] [^1174WCUo].

> I will now examine the most common symptom. Headache is consistently the leading presenting complaint in symptomatic Chiari I, with pooled data showing approximately 78% of patients reporting headache, and pediatric series similarly citing headache in roughly 55–60% of cases, often with Valsalva-exacerbated suboccipital pain that improves after appropriate decompression when the headache phenotype is typical for Chiari physiology [^111oafQE] [^1148uoZd] [^11612r74] [^112mCXSm]. Let me consider the pathophysiology briefly: impaired CSF flow and crowding at the foramen magnum are plausible mechanisms for cough or strain-triggered occipital/cervical pain, which fits the clinical pattern seen in many patients [^112mCXSm].

> Next, I should review the broader symptomatic profile to avoid overgeneralizing. Beyond headache, patients may have neck pain, sensory disturbances, limb weakness or ataxia, lower cranial nerve signs such as dysphagia, and autonomic or respiratory symptoms including sleep apnea; syringomyelia coexists in about 50–70% of surgical cohorts and can drive myelopathic or dissociated sensory findings, while scoliosis is more frequent in pediatric surgical series, reflecting age-related associations rather than universal features [^112GgjqN] [^112pqjwk] [^116cDYZE] [^112mCXSm]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought scoliosis might be a core symptom, but I should correct that framing: scoliosis is a common associated radiographic/clinical finding in pediatric CM-I cohorts, especially with syrinx, rather than a defining symptom of CM-I itself [^116cDYZE] [^112pqjwk].

> Let me think about age-related differences in presentation. In very young children, oropharyngeal dysfunction predominates, whereas in older children and adolescents, headache, scoliosis, and syringomyelia become more prominent; adults more often report headache, ocular findings, and bulbar symptoms, and they may have a lower rate of postoperative symptom relief compared with children, underscoring that pediatric and adult CM-I may represent related but distinct clinical entities with different natural histories and outcomes after decompression [^114FPAeN] [^116cDYZE]. I should double-check that these distinctions are supported by multicenter data rather than isolated series, and indeed the multicenter comparison confirms higher female predominance, more syrinx and scoliosis in pediatrics, and more headache and bulbar symptoms in adults [^116cDYZE].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final synthesis. The most common type of Chiari malformation that presents with symptoms is Chiari malformation type I, and the most common symptom is headache, frequently Valsalva-provoked and suboccipital, with additional features including neck pain, sensory disturbances, limb weakness or ataxia, lower cranial nerve dysfunction, and autonomic or respiratory symptoms, often modulated by the presence of syringomyelia and age at presentation [^114SUHWc] [^111oafQE] [^112mCXSm] [^112GgjqN] [^116cDYZE].

---

The most common type of Chiari malformation that presents with symptoms is **Chiari malformation type I (CM-I)** [^114SUHWc], characterized by cerebellar tonsillar descent below the foramen magnum [^111MeVLb]. CM-I typically presents with **suboccipital headache** [^112mCXSm] worsened by Valsalva maneuvers [^112mCXSm], often accompanied by neck pain, dizziness, balance problems, and sensory disturbances [^notfound]; syringomyelia is present in about 50–70% of cases and can cause progressive myelopathy [^115Uirj2]. Type II (CM-II) is less common and usually presents in infancy with myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, and brainstem dysfunction [^114SUHWc]. Types III and IV are rare and severe, presenting with high neonatal mortality and profound neurological deficits [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features of Chiari malformation type I

CM-I is the most common symptomatic Chiari malformation, with a prevalence of approximately 0.24–2.6% in the general population [^111MeVLb]. Symptoms typically arise from **cerebellar tonsillar herniation** through the foramen magnum, leading to compression of the brainstem and spinal cord, as well as disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow [^113CbLR3].

---

### Common symptoms of CM-I

- **Headache**: The most common symptom, typically suboccipital and exacerbated by Valsalva maneuvers (coughing, sneezing, straining) [^111oafQE] [^112mCXSm].

- **Neck pain**: Often accompanies headaches and may radiate to the shoulders or upper back [^notfound].

- **Dizziness and balance problems**: Due to cerebellar involvement, patients may experience ataxia and coordination difficulties [^1148uoZd].

- **Sensory disturbances**: Numbness, tingling, or paresthesia in the hands and feet are common, often associated with syringomyelia [^112mCXSm].

- **Motor weakness**: Progressive weakness, particularly in the upper extremities, may occur due to spinal cord compression or syringomyelia [^112mCXSm].

- **Syringomyelia**: Present in approximately 50–70% of CM-I cases, leading to progressive myelopathy, sensory loss, and motor weakness [^115Uirj2] [^112pqjwk].

---

### Less common symptoms of CM-I

Less common symptoms include **cranial nerve dysfunction** — such as dysphagia, dysarthria, and vocal cord paralysis — and **autonomic dysfunction**, including respiratory irregularities, central sleep apnea, and bladder or bowel dysfunction [^1154mDMr] [^112mCXSm].

---

## Clinical features of Chiari malformation type II

CM-II is less common than CM-I and is typically associated with myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus [^114SUHWc]. It presents in infancy or early childhood with **severe neurological deficits** [^115qHEmU].

---

### Common symptoms of CM-II

- **Brainstem dysfunction**: Respiratory irregularities, central sleep apnea, and lower cranial nerve palsies [^notfound].

- **Hydrocephalus**: Enlarged head circumference, developmental delays, and visual disturbances [^114SUHWc].

- **Myelomeningocele**: Severe spinal cord defects leading to paralysis and bladder/bowel dysfunction [^115qHEmU].

---

## Clinical features of Chiari malformation types III and IV

Types III and IV are extremely rare and severe, often incompatible with life or associated with high neonatal mortality. Type III involves **cerebellar and brainstem herniation into the cervical region**, causing severe neurological deficits, while type IV is characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia and severe neurological impairment [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the **gold standard** for diagnosing Chiari malformations, providing detailed visualization of cerebellar tonsillar herniation, CSF flow obstruction, and associated abnormalities such as syringomyelia and hydrocephalus [^114SUHWc] [^114uQAmh]. Advanced imaging techniques, such as cine MRI, may help assess CSF flow dynamics and guide surgical planning, although their predictive value remains limited [^111W7vxy] [^1115xDhJ].

---

## Management strategies

Management of symptomatic Chiari malformations depends on the severity of symptoms, presence of syringomyelia, and neurological deficits. Conservative management includes **regular monitoring, pain management, and activity modifications** [^notfound]. Surgical intervention — posterior fossa decompression with or without duraplasty — is indicated for patients with significant neurological deficits, progressive symptoms, or syringomyelia [^115WTgUN] [^112kRCZu].

---

Chiari malformation type I is the **most common symptomatic type**, presenting with headaches, neck pain, dizziness, sensory disturbances, and motor weakness, often associated with syringomyelia [^111oafQE] [^115Uirj2]. Types II, III, and IV are less common and present with more severe neurological deficits, often requiring surgical intervention [^115qHEmU].

### Prevalence and treatment of typical and atypical headaches in patients with Chiari I malformation: a meta-analysis and literature review [^111oafQE]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the incidence of typical and atypical headaches and outcomes following various treatments in patients with Chiari I malformation.

Background

Headache is the most common symptom of Chiari malformation, which can be divided into typical and atypical subgroups to facilitate management. Much controversy surrounds the etiology, prevalence and optimal therapeutic approach for both types of headaches.

Method

We identified relevant studies published before 30 July 2022, with an electronic search of numerous literature databases. The results of this study were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.

Result

A total of 1913 Chiari malformation type I CIM patients were identified, 78% of whom presented with headache, within this group cephalgia was typical in 48% and atypical in 29% of patients, and migraine was the most common type of atypical headache. The ratio of typical/atypical headaches with international classification of headache disorders diagnosis was 1.53, and without international classification of headache disorders diagnosis was 1.56, respectively. The pooled improvement rates of typical headaches following conservative treatment, extradural decompression and intradural decompression were 69%, 88%, and 92%, respectively. The corresponding improvement rates for atypical headaches were 70%, 57.47%, and 69%, respectively. The complication rate in extradural decompression group was significantly lower than in intradural decompression group (RR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.06–1.59, I² = 50%, P = 0.14). Low reoperation rates were observed for refractory headaches in extradural decompression and intradural decompression groups (1%).

Conclusion

The International Classification of Headache Disorders can assist in screening atypical headaches. extradural decompression is preferred for typical headaches, while conservative therapy is optimal for atypical headaches. A definite correlation exists between atypical headaches and Chiari Malformation Type I patients with higher prevalence than in the general population. Importantly, decompression is effective in relieving headaches in this particular patient population.

### Chiari malformation: diagnosis, classifications, natural history, and conservative management. world federation of neurosurgical societies spine committee recommendations [^114SUHWc]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/EMBASE/MEDLINE databases. Inclusion criteria included publications between January 2011 and December 2022 on Chiari malformation (CM) diagnosis classification, natural history, and conservative management.

Objective

This study aims to offer an update on diagnosis classifications, natural history, and conservative management in CM.

Background

CM type 1 involves cerebellar tonsil herniation leading to neurological symptoms. There is controversy regarding its pathophysiology and optimal management, especially for asymptomatic cases. Previous research has focused on surgical outcomes with limited consensus on conservative strategies. Standardized guidelines are needed to enhance clinical decision-making.

Materials and Methods

The screening process involved reviewing abstracts, assessing full-text articles, and reviewing references. Eligibility criteria ensured the selection of relevant studies. Data extraction involved recording various variables. Results were discussed and voted on in 2 consensus meetings of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Spine Committee, reaching a consensus using the Delphi method.

Results

A total of 164 abstracts were screened. Ninety-nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Headache, brainstem, and/or cerebellar/brainstem symptoms/signs were confirmed as the main typical neurological hallmarks of CM. Still, an accurate clinical assessment appeared to be the most reliable evaluation model available. Considering classification, the most common form in adults is type 1, whereas type 2 is associated with myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus from childhood. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard to show the extent of tonsillar herniation, overcrowded posterior fossa, or the absence of cisterna magna. Focusing on natural history, for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic radiologically positive patients conservative management is appropriate. Somatosensory, motor, brainstem auditory evoked potentials and polysomnography could be helpful to guide eventual surgical indication.

Conclusion

Further, higher-quality studies are recommended to establish more substantial evidence and recommendations.

### Chiari type II malformation: past, present, and future [^115qHEmU]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Object

The Chiari Type II malformation (CM II) is a unique hindbrain herniation found only in patients with myelomeningocele and is the leading cause of death in these individuals younger than 2 years of age. Several theories exist as to its embryological evolution and recently new theories are emerging as to its treatment and possible prevention. A thorough understanding of the embryology, anatomy, symptomatology, and surgical treatment is necessary to care optimally for children with myelomeningocele and prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

Methods

A review of the literature was used to summarize the clinically pertinent features of the CM II, with particular attention to pitfalls in diagnosis and surgical treatment.

Conclusions

Any child with CM II can present as a neurosurgical emergency. Expeditious and knowledgeable evaluation and prompt surgical decompression of the hindbrain can prevent serious morbidity and mortality in the patient with myelomeningocele, especially those younger than 2 years old. Symptomatic CM II in the older child often presents with more subtle findings but rarely in acute crisis. Understanding of CM II continues to change as innovative techniques are applied to this challenging patient population.

### Evaluation and management of the Chiari malformation type 1 for the primary care pediatrician [^112ZBzKM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of CMI is undergoing reexamination that includes redefinition of the anatomic Chiari malformation and refinement and redefinition of the clinical syndrome. Children with SMI present with head pain of some kind, a neurologic deficit, or with signs of spinal cord dysfunction from syrinx. Some will present with no clinical syndrome at all. Presence of anatomic Chiari malformation or compelling clinical Chiari syndrome should lead to evaluation by a neurologist or neurosurgeon experienced with the syndromes and their treatment. Treatment options are varied but usually result in resolution of symptoms. When symptoms persist after surgery, management is complex and not uniformly successful, even in the most experienced hands.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines for patients with Chiari malformation: diagnosis [^111qU7mw]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chiari I malformation (CIM) is characterized by descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, potentially causing symptoms from compression or obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis and treatment of CIM is varied, and guidelines produced through systematic review may be helpful for clinicians.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of the medical literature to answer specific questions on the diagnosis and treatment of CIM.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were queried between 1946 and January 23, 2021, using the search strategies provided in Appendix I of the full guidelines.

Results

The literature search yielded 567 abstracts, of which 151 were selected for full-text review, 109 were then rejected for not meeting the inclusion criteria or for being off-topic, and 42 were included in this systematic review.

Conclusion

Three Grade C recommendations were made based on Level III evidence. The full guidelines can be seen online at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/1-imaging.

### Chiari malformation in children [^114vdcTU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is often found incidentally. However, patients with symptoms or signs referable to CM1 or an associated syrinx will likely benefit from surgical intervention. Patients who are not symptomatic from CM1 at presentation are unlikely to become symptomatic at follow-up.

### An unusual presentation of Chiari I malformation [^111oXFYR]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The most typical symptom of Chiari malformation type I in children is headache. The authors describe a 14-year-old girl who presented with a 3-year history of gait decline and no headache, which is very unusual. After surgery to correct the Chiari I malformation, the patient's gait improved; however, she went on to develop decreased hand use with joint deformities. She was diagnosed with a probable connective tissue disorder. Patients with connective tissue disorders are at increased risk for developing Chiari I malformation. The authors discuss the possible reasons for the unusual presentation of the Chiari I malformation and possible mechanisms. The unusual presentation of Chiari I delayed this young patient's diagnosis and treatment.

### The Chiari I malformation [^115evbBp]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

As with many pathologies, the course of our understanding of the Chiari I malformation (CIM) has developed extensively over time. The early descriptions of the Chiari malformations by Hans Chiari in 1891 opened the door for future classification and research on this topic. However, even over a long timeframe, our understanding of the pathophysiology and, more importantly, treatment, remained in its infancy. As recently as the 1970s, CIM was not discussed in popular neurology textbooks. Syringomyelia is listed as a degenerative disorder with no satisfactory treatment. Radiation therapy was considered an option in treatment, and surgery was thought to play no role. During the last 40 years, equivalent to the duration of a neurosurgical career, our understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of CIM, coupled with modern MRI, has improved the treatment paradigm for this patient population. More importantly, it has given us evidence confirming that CIM is a disorder responsive to surgical intervention, giving patients once thought to be destined for lifelong disability a comparatively normal life after treatment. The purpose of this article is to offer a review of CIM and its important associated entities. The authors will discuss the evolution in understanding of the Chiari malformation and, importantly, distinguish between symptomatic CIM and asymptomatic tonsillar ectopia, based on imaging and presenting symptomatology. They will discuss techniques for surgical intervention, expected outcomes, and complications after surgery. Proper patient selection for surgery based on appropriate symptomatology is tantamount to achieving good surgical outcomes in this population, separating those who can be helped by surgery from those who are unlikely to improve. While our knowledge of the Chiari malformations continues to improve through the efforts of clinical and basic science researchers, surgeons, and patients, our current understanding of these entities represents a monumental improvement in patient care over a relatively short time period.

### Chiari type I malformation in a pediatric population [^1148uoZd]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The natural history of Chiari I malformation in children remains unclear. A population-based retrospective cohort study was therefore conducted. Radiology reports from all head and spine magnetic resonance imaging scans (n = 5248) performed among 741,815 children under age 20 within Kaiser Northern California, 1997–1998, were searched for Chiari I. Medical records and imaging studies were reviewed to determine clinical and radiographic predictors of significant neurologic symptoms, defined as moderate to severe headache, neck pain, vertigo, or ataxia. The 51 patients identified with Chiari I represented 1% of the children who had head or spine magnetic resonance imaging scans performed during the study period. Headache (55%) and neck pain (12%) were the most common symptoms. Syringomyelia was present in 6 patients (12%) at initial diagnosis; no new syrinxes developed during follow-up. Older age at time of diagnosis was associated with increased risk of headache (odds ratio OR = 1.3, 95% confidence interval CI = 1.1–1.5) and significant neurologic symptoms (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.04–1.4). Chiari I, an underrecognized cause of headaches in children, is also frequently discovered incidentally in children without symptoms. Larger and longer-term studies are needed to determine the prognosis and optimal treatment of pediatric Chiari I.

### The perplexity surrounding Chiari malformations-are we any wiser now? [^114kPx1i]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chiari malformations are a diverse group of abnormalities of the brain, craniovertebral junction, and the spine. Chiari 0, I, and 1.5 malformations, likely a spectrum of the same malformation with increasing severity, are due to the inadequacy of the para-axial mesoderm, which leads to insufficient development of occipital somites. Chiari II malformation is possibly due to nonclosure of the caudal end of the neuropore, with similar pathogenesis in the rostral end, which causes a Chiari III malformation. There have been significant developments in the understanding of this complex entity owing to insights into the pathogenesis and advancements in imaging modalities and neurosurgical techniques. This article aims to review the different types and pathophysiology of the Chiari malformations, along with a description of the various associated abnormalities. We also highlight the role of ante- and postnatal imaging, with a focus on the newer techniques in the presurgical evaluation, with a brief mention of the surgical procedures and the associated postsurgical complications.

### Prevalence and impact of underlying diagnosis and comorbidities on Chiari 1 malformation [^112BcoQ5]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chiari malformation type 1 affects approximately one in 1,000 people symptomatically, although one in 100 meet radiological criteria, making it a common neurological disorder. The diagnosis of underlying conditions has become more sophisticated, and new radiological markers of disease have been described. We sought to determine the prevalence and impact of additional comorbidities and underlying diagnoses in patients with Chiari malformation type 1 on symptomatology and surgical treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of 612 pediatric patients with a Chiari malformation type 1 diagnosis and imaging data evaluated between 2008 and 2018 was performed. Because of extensive clinical heterogeneity, patients were separated into four categories based on their primary comorbidities (nonsyndromic, central nervous system, skeletal, and multiple congenital anomalies) to identify associations with age of onset, radiographic measurements, syringomyelia, and surgical treatment.

Results

The largest group had nonsyndromic Chiari malformation type 1 (70%) and the latest age at diagnosis of any group. In the syndromic group, 6% were diagnosed with a known genetic abnormality, with overgrowth syndromes being the most common. Patients with multiple congenital anomalies had the earliest Chiari malformation type 1 onset, the most severe tonsillar ectopia and obex position, and were overrepresented among surgical cases. Although there were no statistically significant differences between groups and rates of syrinx, we observed differences in individual diagnoses.

Conclusion

The underlying diagnoses and presence of comorbidities in patients with Chiari malformation type 1 impacts rates of syringomyelia and surgery. Although most Chiari malformation type 1 cases are nonsyndromic, clinical evaluation of growth parameters, scoliosis, and joint hypermobility should be routine for all patients as they are useful to determine syringomyelia risk and may impact treatment.

### Pediatric and adult Chiari malformation type I surgical series 1965–2013: a review of demographics, operative treatment, and outcomes [^112GgjqN]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Object

Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is a hindbrain disorder associated with elongation of the cerebellar tonsils, which descend below the foramen magnum into the spinal canal. It occurs in children and adults. Clinical symptoms mainly develop from alterations in CSF flow at the foramen magnum and the common subsequent development of syringomyelia.

Methods

The authors reviewed English-language reports of pediatric, adult, and combined (adult and pediatric) surgical series of patients with CM-I published from 1965 through August 31, 2013, to investigate the following: 1) geographical distribution of reports; 2) demographics of patients; 3) follow-up lengths; 4) study durations; 5) spectrum and frequency of surgical techniques; 6) outcomes for neurological status, syrinx, and headache; 7) frequency and scope of complications; 8) mortality rates; and 9) differences between pediatric and adult populations. Research and inclusion criteria were defined, and all series that contained at least 4 cases and all publications with sufficient data for analysis were included.

Results

The authors identified 145 operative series of patients with CM-I, primarily from the United States and Europe, and divided patient ages into 1 of 3 categories: adult (> 18 years of age; 27% of the cases), pediatric (≤ 18 years of age; 30%), or unknown (43%). Most series (76%) were published in the previous 21 years. The median number of patients in the series was 31. The mean duration of the studies was 10 years, and the mean follow-up time was 43 months. The peak ages of presentation in the pediatric studies were 8 years, followed by 9 years, and in the adult series, 41 years, followed by 46 years. The incidence of syringomyelia was 65%. Most of the studies (99%) reported the use of posterior fossa/foramen magnum decompression. In 92%, the dura was opened, and in 65% of these cases, the arachnoid was opened and dissected; tonsillar resection was performed in 27% of these patients. Postoperatively, syringomyelia improved or resolved in 78% of the patients. Most series (80%) reported postoperative neurological outcomes as follows: 75% improved, 17% showed no change, and 9% experienced worsening. Postoperative headaches improved or resolved in 81% of the patients, with a statistical difference in favor of the pediatric series. Postoperative complications were reported for 41% of the series, most commonly with CSF leak, pseudomeningocele, aseptic meningitis, wound infection, meningitis, and neurological deficit, with a mean complication rate of 4.5%. Complications were reported for 37% of pediatric, 20% of adult, and 43% of combined series. Mortality was reported for 11% of the series. No difference in mortality rates was seen between the pediatric and adult series.

Conclusions

Before undergoing surgical treatment for CM-I, symptomatic patients and their families should be given clear information about the success of treatment and potential complications. Furthermore, surgeons may benefit from comparing published data with their own. In the future, operative CM-I reports should provide all details of each case for the purpose of comparison.

### An unusual cause of neck pain: acquired Chiari malformation leading to brainstem herniation and death [^111C6hhB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chiari malformations are structural defects in which portions of the cerebellum are located below the foramen magnum. Of the four types of Chiari malformation, emergency physicians are most likely to encounter Type I (Chiari I). Chiari I malformations may be congenital or acquired. Congenital Chiari I malformations are most frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED) setting due to an exacerbation of subacute or chronic Chiari-related symptoms. However, acute Chiari-associated symptoms from an occult congenital or a secondary (acquired) Chiari malformation may occur.

Objective

To present a literature-guided approach to the identification and initial management of patients with Chiari I malformations in the ED setting.

Case Report

We present the case of a 30-year-old man who presented to the ED with isolated cervical region pain, and who subsequently died as a result of acute brainstem herniation from an acquired Chiari I malformation.

Conclusions

Although rare, acute Chiari I malformation may present to the ED. The new finding of a Chiari I malformation should be presumed acquired until proved otherwise, and should trigger an evaluation for central nervous system lesions or hydrocephalus. Brain imaging to exclude increased intracranial pressure and, in certain cases, specialty consultation, are important considerations.

### Definition of the adult Chiari malformation: a brief historical overview [^116CpVaa]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

With the widespread use of newer neuroimaging techniques and modalities, significant tonsillar herniation is being diagnosed in more than 0.5% of patients, some of whom are asymptomatic. This puts the definition of the adult Chiari malformation to the test. The author provides a historical review of the evolution of the definition of the adult Chiari malformation in the neurosurgery, radiology, and pathology literature.

### Chiari in the family: inheritance of the Chiari I malformation [^113EqNEc]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

This report presents three families with Chiari malformation type I that became symptomatic during childhood: a mother and son; a set of monozygotic twins; and two half-siblings and their two maternal cousins. These children presented with various symptoms, including headache, stiff neck, and swallowing difficulty. A review of the relevant literature is presented, with an emphasis on familial examples and proposed inheritance. Less common presentations of Chiari malformation type I are discussed, as well as the possible pathogenesis of Chiari malformation type I and associated syringomyelia.

### Urgent surgical intervention in pediatric patients with Chiari malformation type I. report of two cases [^112b4pju]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) most commonly present with chronic symptoms. A search of the current medical literature revealed scant information regarding acute presentations of CM-I in either pediatric or adult patients. The authors report on two children who presented with rapidly worsening neurological symptoms attributable to a previously undiagnosed CM-I. One patient became profoundly hypopneic with dysphagia and right hemiparesis over a less than 48-hour period. The second patient presented with a few days of worsening right hemiparesis, gait disturbance, and anisocoria. In addition to a CM-I, magnetic resonance imaging in the second patient revealed a holocord syrinx. Following urgent posterior fossa decompression, both patients rapidly improved in the 24 hours immediately following surgery and continued to improve in the subsequent weeks. Few reports detail acute symptoms due to CM-I and those that do exist almost exclusively involve adult patients. Although seemingly rare, the clinician should consider CM-I in the differential diagnosis in pediatric patients presenting with acute brainstem or long tract signs.

10. CHIARI I MALFORMATION

Basic Questions

What is the prevalence of Chiari I malformation in the different types of syndromic craniosynostosis?
What screening method (type and frequency) is indicated to timely detect Chiari I malformation?
How to prevent or treat this associated pathology?

Introduction

The risk of Chiari I malformation widely varies between the different types of syndromic craniosynostosis. The prevalence, causes, consequences, and need of preventive treatment are largely unclear — and even the definition is not unambiguous. Chiari I malformation is best demonstrated using MRI-scanning. The optimal frequency of scanning for the different types of craniosynostosis, however, is not known, and it is not clear what treatment is indicated — and when.

### Surgical treatment of Chiari I malformation: indications and approaches [^112PpnEX]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

Chiari I malformation is a well-described entity characterized by hindbrain herniation through the foramen magnum. Although the exact origin of congenital Chiari I malformation is unknown, it appears to be caused by a mismatch between the volume of the posterior fossa neural elements and the posterior fossa cranial content. Several theories have been proposed to describe the resultant pathophysiology of this mismatch. It is clear, however, that abnormal cerebrospinal fluid flow and velocity play a role in the symptoms and signs associated with this disorder. The authors will review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options for patients with Chiari I malformation.

### Multicenter comparison of Chiari malformation type I presentation in children versus adults [^116cDYZE]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Treatment for Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) often includes surgical intervention in both pediatric and adult patients. The authors sought to investigate fundamental differences between these populations by analyzing data from pediatric and adult patients who required CM-I decompression.

Methods

To better understand the presentation and surgical outcomes of both groups of patients, retrospective data from 170 adults and 153 pediatric patients (2000–2019) at six institutions were analyzed.

Results

The adult CM-I patient population requiring surgical intervention had a greater proportion of female patients than the pediatric population (p < 0.0001). Radiographic findings at initial clinical presentation showed a significantly greater incidence of syringomyelia (p < 0.0001) and scoliosis (p < 0.0001) in pediatric patients compared with adult patients with CM-I. However, presenting signs and symptoms such as headaches (p < 0.0001), ocular findings (p = 0.0147), and bulbar symptoms (p = 0.0057) were more common in the adult group. After suboccipital decompression procedures, 94.4% of pediatric patients reported symptomatic relief compared with 75% of adults with CM-I (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Here, the authors present the first retrospective evaluation comparing adult and pediatric patients who underwent CM-I decompression. Their analysis reveals that pediatric and adult patients significantly differ in terms of demographics, radiographic findings, presentation of symptoms, surgical indications, and outcomes. These findings may indicate different clinical conditions or a distinct progression of the natural history of this complex disease process within each population, which will require prospective studies to better elucidate.

### Clinical phenotypes among patients with familial forms of Chiari malformation type 1 [^113HgWvz]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is the most common neurological disorder of the craniocervical junction. CM1 is characterized by cerebellar tonsillar herniation below the foramen magnum, causing CSF obstruction and neural compression. Patients with CM1 suffer from highly variable symptoms, progression, comorbidities, and outcomes, partly due to poor understanding of CM1 pathogenesis. In this paper, the authors present the only familial CM1 cohort study to statistically assess intrafamilial clinical phenotypes to date.

Methods

Comprehensive medical, surgical, and family histories and neuroimaging were collected from families with multiple CM1-affected family members. Univariate analysis was performed for each symptom, comorbidity, or surgery to compare observed versus expected frequencies of affected patients with another CM1-affected family member with the same clinical characteristic.

Results

Twenty-four new familial CM1 cases (totaling 57 patients with CM1) are presented. Intrafamilial similarities were identified for age of onset, symptoms such as headaches (p = 0.007) and neck pain (p = 0.018), neurological comorbidities such as syringomyelia (p = 0.003) and hydrocephalus (p = 0.0001), neurodevelopmental conditions such as dyslexia (p < 0.0001), and connective tissue disorders (CTDs) such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

These results suggest that CM1 and its associated clinical phenotypes, including age of onset, clinical symptoms, neurological comorbidities, neurodevelopmental conditions, and CTDs, are genetically influenced. Whole-exome sequencing of CM1 patient-parent trios has the potential to identify the genetic determinants of CM1, with implications for neurosurgical management.

### Review article: Chiari type I malformation with or without syringomyelia: prevalence and genetics [^115Rj9VP]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2003). Low credibility.

Chiari type I malformation has traditionally been defined as a downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils of ≥ 5 mm through the foramen magnum and it is likely associated with a volumetrically reduced posterior fossa. Syringomyelia is commonly associated with Chiari type I malformation. We estimate the prevalence of these two conditions and determine that they are more common than previously expected. We identify the genetic syndromes associated with some cases of Chiari type I malformation, and we provide evidence in favor of a genetic hypothesis for at least a subset of the nonsyndromic cases.

### The impact of surgical and medical treatment on headaches in pediatric patients with Chiari malformation type I [^112GoERS]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study seeks to report the incidence and type of headache in pediatric patients with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) at a single institution as well as headache outcomes based on management strategy (surgical vs medical).

Methods

A single-institution retrospective review from January 2003 to May 2020 identified all consecutive pediatric patients who were diagnosed with CM-I and who experienced headaches. Headaches were classified as typical, some features, and atypical CM-I headaches based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria. Short- (< 6 months) and long-term (> 6 months) headache outcomes were classified as improvement or no improvement based on specific phrases in patient charts.

Results

A total of 112 patients met inclusion criteria. Forty patients (35.7%) experienced typical CM-I headache, 42 (37.5%) experienced some features of a CM-I headache, and 30 (26.8%) experienced atypical CM-I headache. Of the 112 total patients, 48 (42.9%) received surgical treatment for CM-I and 64 (57.1%) were managed medically. The decision to perform surgery was made at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon in discussion with the family, and was influenced by the severity of symptoms, the presence of other neurological findings on examination, and the presence of an associated syrinx. There was no statistically significant difference in headache improvement between surgical and medical treatment regardless of headache classification. Non-White race and the presence of a syrinx were statistically significant predictors of short-term headache improvement, and female gender was a statistically significant negative predictor of long-term headache improvement.

Conclusions

In this observational cohort of pediatric patients with CM-I, the authors found no difference in headache outcomes based on management strategy, regardless of the nature of the headache symptoms on presentation.

### Associated disorders of Chiari type I malformations: a review [^111fBNUZ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

A single pathophysiological mechanism of Chiari Type I malformations (CM-I) has been a topic of debate. To help better understand CM-I, the authors review disorders known to be associated with CM-I. The primary methodology found among most of them is deformation of the posterior cranial fossa, usually with subsequent decrease in volume. Other mechanisms exist as well, which can be categorized as either congenital or acquired. In understanding the relationship of such disorders with CM-I, we may gain further insight into the process by which cerebellar tonsillar herniation occurs. Some of these pathologies appear to be true associations, but many appear to be spurious.

Introduction

Chiari malformations are a group of disorders characterized by anatomical abnormalities of the craniocervical junction (CCJ) with involvement of the cerebellum and brainstem. Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is the most common Chiari malformation. The precise frequency of CM1 is not known; however, since the advent of MRI, CM1 has been increasingly detected with some studies estimating a prevalence of 1–3.6%. The precise natural history of CM1 has not been established and management is generally indicated for patients with severe symptoms, progressive neurological deficits, or those affected by significant syringomyelia with the goal of alleviating symptoms and preventing neurological deterioration. Diagnosis of CM1 rests on identification of displacement of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum. Currently, it is most widely accepted that a herniation of 5 mm or more is the minimum criterion for diagnosis of CM1. More recently, there has also been recognition of intermediate Chiari subtypes with clinical entities such as the Chiari 0 malformation that is not associated with any cerebellar tonsillar herniation, challenging the widely used 5 mm cutoff for CM1. There are other radiological findings that are known to be associated with CM1 such as syringomyelia, hydrocephalus, and skeletal anomalies such as platybasia and a hypoplastic posterior cranial fossa. As there are no other tissue or blood biomarkers for CM1, diagnosis currently relies on neuroimaging primarily through MRI and identification of the known associated neuroanatomical anomalies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been applied to assist and improve the diagnosis of a number of pathologies across a range of anatomical regions with promising results, especially with regards to pathologies of neurosurgical interest. In particular, the use of machine learning techniques in the application of image-recognition tasks in radiology is a promising emerging technology with the potential to drastically improve the efficiency and ability of radiology in the clinical setting. In recent years, deep learning, an AI technique utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN), has been shown to yield high sensitivity in automated detection of pathology on medical imaging with a similar (or even higher) performance to medical experts. A supervised learning approach is typically used to train CNNs where end-to-end labelled data is input into the network including cases with a known diagnosis.

### Outcomes in pediatric patients with Chiari malformation type I followed up without surgery [^1174WCUo]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Object

The natural history of untreated Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) is poorly defined. The object of this study was to investigate outcomes in pediatric patients with CM-I who were followed up without surgical intervention.

Methods

The authors retrospectively reviewed 124 cases involving patients with CM-I who presented between July 1999 and July 2008 and were followed up without surgery. The patients ranged in age from 0.9 to 19.8 years (mean 7 years). The duration of follow-up ranged from 1.0 to 8.6 years (mean 2.83 years). Imaging findings, symptoms, and findings on neurological examinations were noted at presentation and for the duration of follow-up.

Results

The mean extent of tonsillar herniation at presentation was 8.35 mm (range 5–22 mm). Seven patients had a syrinx at presentation. The syrinx size did not change in these patients on follow-up imaging studies. No new syrinxes developed in the remaining patients who underwent subsequent imaging. The total number of patients with presenting symptoms was 81. Of those 81 patients, 67 demonstrated symptoms that were not typical of CM-I. Of the 14 patients with symptoms attributed to CM-I, 9 had symptoms that were not severe or frequent enough to warrant surgery, and surgery was recommended in the remaining 5 patients. Chiari malformation Type I was also diagnosed in 43 asymptomatic patients who had imaging studies performed for various reasons. No new neurological deficits were noted in any patient for the duration of follow-up.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with CM-I who are followed up without surgery do not progress clinically or radiologically. Longer follow-up of this cohort will be required to determine if symptoms or new neurological findings develop over the course of many years.

### Efficacy of neurosurgical intervention in syrinx resolution in patients presenting with Chiari malformation type I and syringomyelia: a systematic review and radiological meta-analysis [^115Uirj2]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chiari malformation encompasses a spectrum of congenital hindbrain abnormalities affecting the cerebellum, skull base, brainstem, and cervical spinal cord. Chiari Malformation Type 1 (CM1) is the most common subtype, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1% in the paediatric population. It is characterised by downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, leading to compression of neural structures and disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. This anatomical disturbance is frequently associated with syringomyelia — a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within the spinal cord, which occurs in 50–75% of Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) cases.

Individuals diagnosed with CM1 with syringomyelia may present with occipital or cervical pain, coordination difficulties, facial muscle weakness, and autonomic dysfunction. Diagnosis is primarily established through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sometimes supplemented with CSF flow studies to assess dynamic obstruction.

Management of CM1 with syringomyelia includes both conservative and surgical approaches. Surgical intervention aims to restore normal CSF dynamics and reduce the size of the syrinx. The most widely used surgical procedure is posterior fossa decompression. However, there are several variations of this technique, including posterior fossa decompression with osseous-only decompression (PFD), posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD), and posterior fossa decompression with tonsillar manipulation (PFDRT). The optimal surgical technique used has been a longstanding and heavily debated topic within the literature, with some favouring PFD because it has fewer complications, while others favour PFDD or PFDRT because they report better clinical outcomes. Other techniques used for treating syringomyelia in CM1 include fourth ventricle stents and shunts, though their comparative effectiveness remains unclear.

### Chiari I deformity: beyond 5 mm below the foramen magnum [^114dh64v]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Although originally described as a consecutive series of pathologic changes, Chiari syndrome represents a spectrum of disease divided into two subsets: development deformities of the paraxial mesoderm manifesting after birth (types 0–1.5) and true congenital malformations due to failure of neural tube closure present in utero (types 2–5). Heterogeneity among patients with a Chiari deformity and incomplete understanding of its pathophysiologic characteristics have led to inconsistency in radiologic reporting and difficulty in defining appropriate management strategies tailored to an individual patient's condition. The radiologist is tasked with going beyond the criteria for cerebellar tonsillar herniation to define an individual patient's disease state, determine candidacy for surgery, and assist in selecting the proper surgical approach. In addition, the radiologist must be able to identify conditions that result in cerebellar tonsillar herniation that are not related to Chiari deformity to avoid inappropriate surgery. Last, the radiologist must be able to interpret postoperative imaging examinations to assess for adequacy of treatment and complications. The authors summarize recent literature regarding the pathophysiologic basis of Chiari 1 and related deformities and detail the ideal morphologic and physiologic imaging assessment, focusing on Chiari 1 and related deformities (Chiari 0, 0.5, and 1.5). Also discussed are surgical techniques and "pearls" of postsurgical imaging, including complications that must be recognized. This review provides clarity to a commonly encountered but less understood condition to optimize outcomes for patients with Chiari 1 and related deformities. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Revision surgery for Chiari malformation decompression [^114yvNqd]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Chiari malformations comprise four different hindbrain anomalies originally described by Hans Chiari, a professor of pathology at the German University in Prague. There are four basic Chiari malformations. The reasons for revision of Chiari malformation decompression may be for conservative or inadequate initial decompression or the development of postoperative complications. Another reason involves cases of both hindbrain herniation and syringomyelia in patients who have undergone adequate posterior fossa decompression without resolution of symptoms, signs, or radiological appearance of their syrinx cavity. Additionally, symptom recurrence has been reported in association with various types of dural grafts. Reoperation or revision surgery for patients with Chiari malformations is common and may not be due to technical error or inadequate decompression. The types of revision surgeries, their indications, and initial presentations will be reviewed.

### Chiari type 1 malformation in a pseudotumour cerebri patient: is it an acquired or congenital Chiari malformation? [^112xasUq]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1) is a developmental abnormality of the cerebellar tonsils. Patients with CM1 commonly present with headache. Papilloedema is rarely seen in CM1. However, a 52-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a headache and her ophthalmological examination revealed bilateral papilloedema. Her cranial MRI was compatible with borderline CM1. Bilateral papilloedema and headache suggested idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) as the preliminary diagnosis. IIH is a rare case in CM1. This article argues about this association and discusses as to whether it is an acquired or congenital Chiari malformation.

CHAPTER 10. CHIARI

Question 10.1 What is the management of Chiari in craniosynostosis?

The risk of Chiari I malformation (partial sagging of the lower part of the cerebellum in the foramen magnum) varies greatly per type of syndromic craniosynostosis and is hardly or not at all seen in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The occurrence, causes, consequences, and need for treatment are often unclear. Chiari I malformation is best imaged with an MRI scan, but as to how often it should be done for the different types of craniosynostosis, and when a specific treatment is indicated, is unclear.

(1) How common is Chiari in children with craniosynostosis, and what is needed to diagnose it?
Chiari occurs in children with isolated nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. This is in 3% to 8% with sagittal suture synostosis, 0% in metopic suture synostosis, 6% to 18% with coronal suture synostosis, and 25% to 60% with lambdoid suture synostosis. It is possible that the presence of Chiari rarely causes any symptoms in these children. It is preferably diagnosed by MRI.
Chiari may occur in Crouzon and Pfeiffer in 70% to 82% of cases, and in 2% to 29% in Apert. In multisuture craniosynostosis, where the lambdoid sutures are also fused, Chiari is found in 57% to 71% and without fused lambdoid sutures, in 7% to 11%. It is unknown how common this is with Saethre-Chotzen and Muenke syndrome. It is possible that Chiari may often be present without complaints and symptoms in multisuture and syndromic craniosynostosis. It can often only be determined with the help of an x-ray and preferably MRI.

### Chiari malformation type I in children younger than age 6 years: presentation and surgical outcome [^114FPAeN]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Object

The authors conducted a study to evaluate the unique presenting signs and symptoms of Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) in children younger than 6 years of age and highlight the benefits of early surgical treatment in this patient population.

Methods

The authors reviewed the medical records of patients who presented to the neurosurgery department before their 6th birthday and subsequently underwent surgery for CM-I. They identified 39 patients who had been evaluated between 1984 and 2007 and examined the medical records for presentation, surgical intervention, and outcome.

Results

Children aged 0–2 years commonly presented with oropharyngeal dysfunction (77.8%). Children aged 3–5 years more frequently presented with syringomyelia (85.7%), scoliosis (38.1%), and/or headache (57.1%). All patients underwent posterior fossa craniectomy. Additionally, in many patients cervical laminectomy and/or duraplasty was performed. A few patients required transoral decompression and occipitocervical fusion. In most cases, surgery led to resolution or dramatic improvement of initial symptoms.

Conclusions

Early recognition and surgical treatment of CM-I in young children leads to good outcomes in the majority of patients. Additional therapies for oropharyngeal dysfunction, syringomyelia, and scoliosis can frequently be avoided.

### Headache outcomes in children undergoing foramen magnum decompression for Chiari I malformation [^11612r74]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

A common symptom of Chiari I malformation (CIM) is headache, which is diagnosed using non-validated criteria from the International Headache Society (IHS). CIM-associated headaches should resolve following neurosurgical treatment of the malformation by foramen magnum decompression (FMD). We aimed to validate the IHS criteria and determine (1) the efficacy of FMD in treating headache and (2) whether duraplasty confers an advantage over simple bony decompression in the treatment of this symptom.

Methods

A retrospective review of CIM cases treated with FMD at Great Ormond Street Hospital from 1989 to 2014 was carried out. Clinical headache characteristics were compared against IHS criteria and correlated with outcome following FMD.

Results

Headache was a presenting symptom in 57/102 (55.9%) of patients. Of these, 42/57 (73.7%) could be classified as Chiari I-type headache. Following FMD, 42/57 (73.7%) of all presenting headaches showed a sustained improvement (> 3months) compared with 32/39 (82.1%) of Chiari I-type headaches. Duraplasty led to a sustained improvement in headache in 32/38 (84.2%) cases compared with 9/16 (56.3%) cases treated with bone-only decompression.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that 80% of headaches classified as Chiari I-type will show a sustained improvement following FMD, and, as such, the IHS criteria are clinically useful in evaluating symptoms attributable to CIM. For all headaches associated with CIM, duraplasty may confer a benefit in terms of long-term improvement, compared with bone-only decompression.

### Chiari malformation and syringomyelia [^113CbLR3]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Chiari malformation was first described over a century ago, and consists of posterior fossa anomalies that generally share the feature of cerebellar tonsillar descent through the foramen magnum. Our understanding of this disorder was initially based on autopsy studies, and has been greatly enhanced by the advent of MRI. The surgical management of Chiari anomalies has also evolved in a parallel fashion. Although the exact surgical technique varies among individual surgeons, the goals of surgery remain constant and consist of relieving brainstem compression and cranial nerve distortion, restoring the normal flow of CSF across the foramen magnum, and reducing the size of any associated syrinx cavity. Syrinx cavities are most commonly associated with Chiari anomalies, yet primary spinal syringomyelia (PSS) can be caused by traumatic, infectious, degenerative, and other etiologies that cause at least a partial CSF flow obstruction in the spinal subarachnoid space. As with syringomyelia associated with Chiari anomalies, the main goal of PSS surgery is to reestablish CSF flow across the area of obstruction. In addition to MRI, myelography with CT can be very helpful in the evaluation and management of these patients by identifying focal regions of CSF obstruction that may be amenable to surgical intervention. Future directions for the treatment of Chiari anomalies and syringomyelia include the application of advanced imaging techniques, more widespread use of genetic evaluation, large-scale outcome studies, and the further refinement of surgical technique.

### Patients with Chiari malformation type I presenting with acute neurological deficits: case series [^112SahWo]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Object

A subset of patients with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) presented with acute onset of a neurological deficit. In this study the authors summarize their experience with these patients' clinical presentation, imaging results, timing of surgery, and outcome following decompression.

Methods

The authors reviewed clinical records, imaging studies, and operative notes from all patients undergoing posterior fossa decompression for CM-I at St. Louis Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2008. Of the 189 patients who underwent surgery, 6 were identified with the acute onset of a neurological deficit at presentation.

Results

All 6 children (age range 3–14 years, 3 boys and 3 girls) had either syringomyelia (5 patients) or T2 signal changes in the spinal cord (1 patient) and CM-I on initial MR imaging. Three patients presented after minor trauma (1 with paraparesis, 2 with sensory deficits). Three patients presented without a clear history of trauma (1 with abrupt onset of spontaneous dysphagia and ataxia, 2 with sensory deficits). Decompression was performed at a mean 7.7 ± 4.9 days after symptom onset (7.0 ± 1.6 days after neurosurgical evaluation). In 1 patient, symptoms had resolved by the time of surgery; in the remainder of the patients, clear improvements were noted within 2 weeks of surgery, with complete resolution of symptoms by 12 months postoperatively. Follow-up MR images were obtained in 4 patients, demonstrating improvement in the extent of the syrinx in each patient.

Conclusions

Children with CM-I and syringomyelia can develop acute spinal cord or bulbar deficits with relatively minor head or neck injuries. The prognosis for symptomatic improvement in the observed deficit is good, with each patient in our series showing resolution of deficits over time. However, based on this relatively limited experience, the authors suggest that patients who present with an acute neurological deficit and are found to have CM-I be managed with early posterior fossa decompression. Patients with CM-I and syringomyelia may be at higher risk of acute neurological deficit than those without a syrinx.

### Complete spontaneous resolution of childhood Chiari I malformation and associated syringomyelia [^112Lr7wG]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Chiari I malformation and associated syringomyelia is often made in childhood. Since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging, these abnormalities are increasingly detected incidentally. Despite incomplete understanding of the natural history of asymptomatic Chiari I malformations, the current recommendation is to consider prophylactic surgical intervention in those with an associated syringomyelia. This case report presents a complete spontaneous resolution of a Chiari I malformation and syringomyelia in a child. It illustrates the possibility that asymptomatic children with Chiari I malformations and syringomyelia may be followed conservatively.

### Institutional experience with 500 cases of surgically treated pediatric Chiari malformation type I [^115Pzo9E]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Object

The diagnosis and treatment of Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) has evolved over the last few decades. The authors present their surgical experience of over 2 decades of treating children with this form of hindbrain herniation.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective review of their institutional experience with the surgical treatment of the pediatric CM-I from 1989 to 2010.

Results

The 2 most common presentations were headache/neck pain (40%) and scoliosis (18%). Common associated diagnoses included neurofibromatosis Type 1 (5%) and idiopathic growth hormone deficiency (4.2%). Spine anomalies included scoliosis (18%), retroversion of the odontoid process (24%), Klippel-Feil anomaly (3%), and atlantooccipital fusion (8%). Approximately 3% of patients had a known family member with CM-I. Hydrocephalus was present in 48 patients (9.6%). Syringomyelia was present in 285 patients (57%), and at operation, 12% of patients with syringomyelia were found to have an arachnoid veil occluding the fourth ventricular outlet. Fifteen patients (3%) have undergone reoperation for continued symptoms or persistent large syringomyelia. The most likely symptoms and signs to resolve following surgery were Valsalva-induced headache and syringomyelia. The average hospital stay and "return to school" time were 3 and 12 days, respectively. The follow-up for this group ranged from 2 months to 15 years (mean 5 years). Complications occurred in 2.4% of cases; there was no mortality. No patient required acute return to the operating room, and no blood transfusions were performed.

Conclusions

The authors believe this to be the largest reported series of surgically treated pediatric CM-I patients and hope that their experience will be of use to others who treat this surgical entity.

### Clinical, radiological, and genetic similarities between patients with Chiari type I and type 0 malformations [^112fP28o]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Object

Although Chiari Type I (CM-I) and Type 0 (CM-0) malformations have been previously characterized clinically and radiologically, there have been no studies focusing on the possible genetic link between these disorders. The goal of this study was to identify families in whom CM-0 and CM-I co-occurred and to further assess the similarities between these disorders.

Methods

Families were ascertained through a proband with CM-I. Detailed family histories were obtained to identify first-degree relatives diagnosed with CM-0. Several criteria were used to exclude individuals with acquired forms of CM-I and/or syringomyelia. Individuals were excluded with syndromic, traumatic, infectious, or tumor-related syringomyelia, as well as CM-I due to a supratentorial mass, hydrocephalus, history of cervical or cranial surgery unrelated to CM-I, or development of symptoms following placement of a lumbar shunt. Medical records and MR images were used to characterize CM-I and CM-0 individuals clinically and radiologically.

Results

Five families were identified in which the CM-I proband had a first-degree relative with CM-0. Further assessment of affected individuals showed similar clinical and radiological features between CM-0 and CM-I individuals, although CM-I patients in general had more severe symptoms and skull base abnormalities than their CM-0 relatives. Overall, both groups showed improvement in symptoms and/or syrinx size following craniocervical decompression surgery.

Conclusions

There is accumulating evidence suggesting that CM-0 and CM-I may be caused by a common underlying developmental mechanism. The data in this study are consistent with this hypothesis, showing similar clinical and radiological features between CM-0 and CM-I individuals, as well as the occurrence of both disorders within families. Familial clustering of CM-0 and CM-I suggests that these disorders may share an underlying genetic basis, although additional epigenetic and/or environmental factors are likely to play an important role in the development of CM-0 versus CM-I.

### Chiari I malformation with syrinx [^117AdETu]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The Chiari I congenital malformation is characterized by caudal displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the cervical canal. Although this malformation is often asymptomatic, coexisting syringomyelia can result in neurologic symptoms. We report a case of progressive ataxia with brainstem dysfunction in an adolescent female manifesting a severe Chiari I malformation with syrinx. Chiari decompression 4 years after initial presentation led to rapid improvement in most of her long-term symptoms. This case demonstrates the importance of consideration of Chiari I with syringomyelia in the differential diagnosis of progressive ataxia and brainstem symptoms.

### Spontaneous resolution of a Chiari malformation with syringomyelia [^113L7Zsk]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The Chiari I malformation (CM-I) is characterised by overcrowding of the posterior fossa and descent of the cerebellar tonsils and is associated with syringomyelia. With the increasing availability of magnetic resonance imaging, CM-I is placing a growing burden on neurosurgical services. However, its natural history remains poorly understood, and the timing and nature of surgical intervention is controversial. We present a case of a significant, symptomatic CM-I with associated syrinx which underwent complete spontaneous resolution over a 4-year period. Spontaneous regression of Chiari malformation and syringomyelia is exceedingly rare; a literature review reveals 15 other cases and only one case which underwent complete resolution. The present case and literature review suggest a more benign natural history of CM-I and support a more conservative approach to its management. Further studies are required to determine whether any factors can predict resolution for certain patient cohorts.

### Imaging characteristics associated with surgery in Chiari malformation type I [^113X8cCo]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

In Chiari malformation type I (CM-I), a variety of imaging findings have been purported to be important; however, results have been inconclusive, inconsistent, or not replicated in independent studies. The purpose of this study was to report imaging characteristics for a large cohort of patients with CM-I and identify the imaging findings associated with surgical decompression.

Methods

Patients were identified using ICD-9 codes for CM-I for the period from 1996 to 2017. After review of the medical records, patients were excluded if they 1) did not have a diagnosis of CM-I, 2) were not evaluated by a neurosurgeon, or 3) did not have available preoperative MRI. Retrospective chart review was performed to collect demographic and clinical data. Imaging parameters were measured according to the Chiari I Malformation Common Data Elements.

Results

A total of 731 patients were included for analysis, having a mean follow-up duration of 25.5 months. The mean age at presentation was 8.5 years. The mean tonsil position was 11.4 mm below the foramen magnum, and 62.8% of patients had a pegged tonsil shape. Two hundred patients (27.4%) underwent surgery for life-dominating tussive headache, lower cranial nerve dysfunction, syrinx, and/or brainstem dysfunction. Surgical treatment was associated with a syrinx (OR 20.4, 95% CI 12.3–33.3, p < 0.0001), CM-1.5 (OR 1.797, 95% CI 1.08–2.98, p = 0.023), lower tonsil position (OR 1.130, 95% CI 1.08–1.18, p < 0.0001), and congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae (OR 5.473, 95% CI 1.08–27.8, p = 0.040). Among patients with benign CM-I, tonsil position was statistically significantly associated with future surgery.

Conclusions

Comprehensive imaging characteristics for a large cohort of patients with CM-I are reported. Analysis showed that a lower tonsillar position, a syrinx, and CM-1.5 were associated with undergoing posterior fossa decompression. This study demonstrates the importance of considering imaging findings in the context of patient symptomatology.

### Abnormal movements associated with oropharyngeal dysfunction in a child with Chiari I malformation [^112SAGN9]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chiari I malformations (CM I) are rare hindbrain herniations that may be present in children or adults. CM I is characterized by an abnormal position of the cerebellar tonsils, which herniate outside the cranial cavity into the upper cervical canal: this is associated with an obliteration of the subarachnoid spaces at the level of the foramen magnum. Anomalies associated with CM I include syringomyelia. CM I can be easily identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cranio-vertebral junction. Tonsillar herniation of 5 mm below the foramen magnum is the most common cut off for radiological diagnosis of CM I. More recently, because of the ease of diagnosis and increased clinical awareness, pediatric cases are increasingly reported. Many studies have reported symptoms such as headaches, scoliosis or neurological troubles which were attributed to compression of neural structures. Dysphagia and other oropharyngeal dysfunctions have also been reported but, to our knowledge, no clinical presentation similar to ours has ever been reported.

The purpose of this communication is to draw attention to a unique and atypical clinical presentation of a child with CM I.

A: The most common type of Chiari malformation is adult Chiari malformation type 1, in which the cerebellar tonsils protrude below the lower margin of the foramen magnum. As the cerebellar tonsils protrude below the foramen magnum, obstruction of the foramina of Luschka and Magendie of the lower medulla and compression of the upper cervical spine may occur, impeding the flow of CSF from the fourth ventricle to the upper spinal subarachnoid space. A: Symptoms attributable to descent of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum vary. The most common symptom is headache, which is most likely due to transiently raised intracranial pressure from partial blockage of CSF flow. The headache is usually suboccipital and dull or throbbing, but it can be located anywhere in the cranium and have other characteristics, including migraine and tensionlike discomfort.

Chiari headaches are characteristically exacerbated by Valsalva-like activities such as coughing, laughing, sneezing, straining, lifting heavy objects, and changing body or head positions. An additional symptom, which is independent of but often associated with headaches, is paresthesia in one or both hands, often involving all the fingers. Other less common but characteristic signs and symptoms include sleep apnea; tinnitus, which may be pulsatile; hypoacusis or hyperacusis; and difficulty swallowing. The spinal cord syrinx may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Patients with a syrinx may present with complex symptoms that are independent of those directly caused by the tonsillar herniation — typically numbness or decreased pain or temperature sensitivity in the hands and over the shoulders, hand weakness and atrophy, and arm, leg, neck, or back pain, as well as bladder or bowel incontinence. A: Surgical procedures to decompress the posterior fossa vary in complexity and extent.

Patients often experience immediate relief of limb paresthesia and tinnitus after surgical decompression of CM1. Most of the other symptoms are diminished or eliminated within several weeks to months. Asymptomatic patients, in whom CM1 may have been detected incidentally on imaging performed for various reasons, do not require surgery if there is no syrinx.

### Chiari malformation type I may be more common than thought… [^114mgs6e]. publications.aap.org (2005). Low credibility.

"Headaches are common in children; however, congenital malformations of the brain generally are not very common. " This is the common wisdom espoused in much of medical education. The availability of brain imaging, however, has led to an appreciation that many of the things we thought were unusual may in fact be much more commonplace. One entity that fits this categorization is the Chiari malformation type I. Elizabeth was a delightful 6-year-old who began complaining to her mother of occipital headaches, particularly when she exerted on the playground and sometimes when she coughed and sneezed. After several months, she complained of a tingling sensation in her shoulders and arms, particularly when she had head pain. Her mother was not too concerned, since the headaches seemed to last for only a few minutes and did not affect her activities. However, as she entered second grade at age 7, Elizabeth began.

### Hiccups… [^111LndAi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Hiccups usually present as a common annoyance lasting for short periods. Rarely, they may be the harbinger of a serious disease. We present the case of a 19-year-old man in which intractable hiccups was the first and most prominent symptom of a serious underlying neurologic disorder. The patient had been examined by his pediatrician, and despite multiple medical regiments and physical maneuvers, his symptoms persisted. A thorough head and neck examination revealed a right-sided vocal cord paralysis. This finding prompted obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging scan, which demonstrated a type I Arnold-Chiari malformation associated with a large cervicothoracic syringomyelia. The patient was referred to the neurosurgical service and subsequently underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. There was considerable initial improvement in his neurologic status and cessation of the hiccups. However, the symptoms recurred within 1 month.

The case report as well as a brief review of the relevant pathophysiologic and etiologic considerations and several treatment modalities for hiccups is presented. Loft LM, Ward RF. Hiccups: A Case Presentation and Etiologic Review. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1992; 118: 1115–1119.

### The Chiari malformation, type 1, in early childhood… [^1122nxh6]. publications.aap.org (2003). Low credibility.

The Chiari malformation type 1 is defined as abnormal protrusion of the tonsils of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum down into the cervical spinal canal. The quantitative threshold for diagnosis of CM1 is somewhat arbitrary, but the most widely accepted definition is descent of the tonsils > 5 mm below the plane of the foramen. 1 The developmental lesion responsible for CM1 is believed, in most instances, to be insufficient growth of the osseous boundaries of the posterior cranial fossa: there is simply not enough room within the posterior fossa to accommodate the neural structures that belong there. 2, 3 Symptoms and neurological signs may develop either on the basis of mechanical compression of the brainstem at the foramen magnum or on the basis of disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, leading to syringomyelia. 3, 4 The potential clinical manifestations of CM1 are legion.

In the current era of widely available magnetic resonance imaging, CM1 has become a common incidental finding on brain or cervical spine studies obtained for minor complaints. 1 The natural history and potential clinical significance of asymptomatic CM1 remains largely unknown. The not inconsequential prevalence of asymptomatic CM1 in the general population and the polymorphous clinical presentations of this condition can make for occasional difficult questions about indications for surgical treatment. The authors from the University of Iowa have performed a retrospective review of a single surgeon's experience with CM1 in children under the age of 6 during the era of MRI. There were 31 patients with CM1; 16 were under 3 years of age. Impaired oropharyngeal function was the predominant presentation among the infants, and scoliosis was the predominant presentation in the preschool age group.

Headache and neck pain, sensory disturbance, and weakness were also presenting complaints. Only 1 patient was judged to be asymptomatic. Only 4 patients had normal neurological examinations. Sixteen patients had syringomyelia, and all 8 patients with scoliosis had syringomyelia. Other physical findings included abnormal tendon reflexes, abnormal gag reflex, and vocal cord dysfunction.
