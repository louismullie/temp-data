## Question

A 70-year-old woman is on hospital day 2 in the medical intensive care unit. She was admitted from the emergency department for a 2-day history of shortness of breath and fever. In the emergency department, her temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 94/54 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 36/min, and oxygen saturation was 82% while on 4L of oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. Chest X-ray shows a right lower lobe consolidation. She was intubated, sedated, and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis of pulmonary origin and intravenous norepinephrine for blood pressure support. Since then, her clinical condition has been stable, though her vasopressor and oxygen requirements have not improved. Today, her physician is called to the bedside because her nurse noted some slow bleeding from her intravenous line sites and around her urinary catheter. Which of the following most likely represents the results of coagulation studies for this patient?
A. D-dimer: negative, fibrinogen level: normal, platelet count: normal
B. D-dimer: elevated, fibrinogen level: low, platelet count: low
C. D-dimer: negative, fibrinogen level: elevated, platelet count: elevated
D. D-dimer: elevated, fibrinogen level: normal, platelet count: normal

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which coagulation profile best fits a 70-year-old woman with severe sepsis from pneumonia who is now bleeding from multiple sites on hospital day 2, and to choose among options that vary by D-dimer, fibrinogen, and platelet count. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis driving the bleeding phenotype. Then, I should verify the expected laboratory pattern of sepsis-associated DIC and how it differs from other coagulopathies. Next, I will review each answer choice against that expected pattern. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent inconsistencies and confirm the best match with guideline-based criteria and pathophysiology [^1172MVUu] [^112DozZL].

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. Severe sepsis with shock, multi-organ support, and new mucocutaneous bleeding on day 2 strongly suggests sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), in which systemic inflammation drives intravascular thrombin generation, consumption of clotting factors and platelets, and secondary fibrinolysis with bleeding manifestations; D-dimer elevation is a hallmark and the ISTH DIC scoring system incorporates platelet count, PT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer to both diagnose and prognosticate, so I should anchor to that framework [^1172MVUu] [^112DozZL].

> Now, I need to check the expected laboratory pattern in sepsis-associated DIC. Wait, let me verify the directionality of each parameter: D-dimer should be elevated due to fibrin formation and degradation; platelets should be low from consumption and destruction; and fibrinogen should be low from consumption that outpaces its hepatic synthesis as an acute-phase reactant, especially once DIC is established beyond the very early phase; this triad is precisely what the ISTH scoring system weights, and it aligns with the pathophysiology of consumption coagulopathy in sepsis [^111jm6yT] [^112DozZL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review each option methodically. Option A proposes normal D-dimer, normal fibrinogen, and normal platelets, which would argue against both DIC and clinically significant coagulopathy in this context, so that seems inconsistent with sepsis-associated DIC and the observed bleeding; I should rule this out [^112DozZL]. Option B proposes elevated D-dimer, low fibrinogen, and low platelets, which matches the expected sepsis-DIC pattern; this is the classic triad of consumption with secondary fibrinolysis and would fit the bleeding phenotype, so this is a strong candidate [^111jm6yT]. Option C proposes elevated D-dimer with elevated fibrinogen and elevated platelets; that profile reflects an early inflammatory hypercoagulable state rather than established consumption DIC and would not explain bleeding, so I should be cautious here [^111jm6yT]. Option D proposes elevated D-dimer with normal fibrinogen and normal platelets; this could be seen early in sepsis or with inflammation alone, but again it fails to account for the bleeding and consumption features we expect by day 2 of sepsis-associated DIC, so it is less likely than B [^114SZGPx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if elevated fibrinogen might still fit DIC because it is an acute-phase reactant; but I should double-check the timing. In early sepsis, fibrinogen can be normal or high despite DIC activation, yet as consumption proceeds over hours to days, fibrinogen typically falls below normal in overt DIC; by hospital day 2 with new bleeding, consumption usually predominates, making low fibrinogen more likely than normal in established sepsis-DIC, which supports Option B over D [^114uj4jC] [^111jm6yT].

> I will now examine the platelet piece to ensure internal consistency. Thrombocytopenia is a core component of DIC scoring and is expected here from ongoing intravascular activation and consumption; normal platelets in the face of bleeding and sepsis would be discordant, further weakening Options A and D, whereas low platelets coherently explain bleeding and align with DIC physiology and scoring, reinforcing Option B [^112DozZL].

> But wait, what if this is not DIC and instead a localized issue or an anticoagulant effect? The diffuse bleeding from multiple unrelated sites argues against a purely local process, and there is no mention of anticoagulation that would elevate D-dimer without consumption; moreover, the clinical trajectory of severe sepsis with shock makes sepsis-associated DIC the most parsimonious explanation, and guidelines emphasize recognizing DIC early and treating the underlying sepsis while using laboratory trends to guide supportive care, which again points to the DIC triad in Option B [^1172MVUu] [^112DozZL].

> Putting this together, the laboratory pattern that best fits severe sepsis with bleeding due to DIC is elevated D-dimer with low fibrinogen and low platelet count, which corresponds to Option B; this profile reflects consumption of clotting factors and platelets with secondary fibrinolysis and is the expected endpoint of sepsis-associated coagulopathy by hospital day 2 in a patient with new bleeding manifestations [^1172MVUu] [^111jm6yT].

---

The most likely coagulation profile in this 70-year-old woman with sepsis and bleeding is **D-dimer elevated, fibrinogen low, platelets low** (Option B). This pattern reflects **sepsis-induced DIC** [^1172MVUu] with **consumptive coagulopathy** [^112DozZL] and secondary fibrinolysis, explaining the bleeding from IV and catheter sites. Early sepsis often shows elevated fibrinogen, but with ongoing consumption, fibrinogen falls and platelets decline, making Option B the best fit here.

---

## Pathophysiology of sepsis-induced coagulopathy

Sepsis activates the **coagulation cascade** via endothelial injury, tissue factor exposure, and cytokine-driven thrombin generation, leading to **microvascular thrombosis** and organ dysfunction [^notfound]. Concurrent **consumption of clotting factors and platelets**, along with secondary fibrinolysis, produces the characteristic DIC pattern of elevated D-dimer, low fibrinogen, and thrombocytopenia [^113XFcgk].

---

## Expected coagulation profile in sepsis-induced DIC

| **Parameter** | **Expected finding in sepsis-induced dic** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| D-dimer | Elevated | Reflects fibrin degradation from microthrombi and secondary fibrinolysis [^115KTUBp] |
| Fibrinogen | Low | Consumption exceeds hepatic synthesis; falls as DIC progresses [^114uj4jC] |
| Platelet count | Low | Consumption and destruction in microthrombi [^1172MVUu] |

---

## Clinical correlation with the presented case

The patient's **slow bleeding from IV and catheter sites** is consistent with consumptive coagulopathy and impaired clot formation seen in DIC [^notfound]. Initially, fibrinogen may be normal or elevated as an acute-phase reactant, but with ongoing consumption it declines, and platelets fall as consumption continues, aligning with Option B.

---

## Analysis of alternative options

- **Option A (D-dimer negative, fibrinogen normal, platelets normal)**: Inconsistent with sepsis-induced DIC and the observed bleeding [^112DozZL].
- **Option C (D-dimer elevated, fibrinogen elevated, platelets elevated)**: Suggests early inflammation without consumption; incompatible with bleeding in DIC [^111jm6yT].
- **Option D (D-dimer elevated, fibrinogen normal, platelets normal)**: Early sepsis without established consumption; does not explain bleeding [^116umT3X].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely coagulation profile is **Option B: D-dimer elevated, fibrinogen low, platelets low**, reflecting sepsis-induced DIC with consumptive coagulopathy and secondary fibrinolysis, which explains the bleeding from IV and catheter sites.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe, often life-threatening, syndrome characterized by diffuse and persistent activation of the hemostatic system with intravascular thrombin generation, and fibrin formation and degradation. Early recognition of DIC is crucial to allow prompt treatment, the primary aim of which is to eliminate the underlying condition (i.e. sepsis, malignancy, trauma, obstetric diseases).D-dimer has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of DIC because, thanks to its excellent negative predictive value, the use of D-dimer measurement in this context has been endorsed by all national and international guidelines. For example, the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) not only validated a scoring system (including prothrombin time, platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) for its diagnostic and prognostic value, but also recommended sequential D-dimer measurements to monitor DIC evolution, and to guide clinical and therapeutic management.

Cancer, inflammation, and infection

The activation of coagulation is a common finding in malignant tumors, being associated with growth and progression. As a consequence, up to 20% of cancer patients develop VTE, which is the second leading cause of death.D-dimer is over-produced in the presence of active malignancy and levels are increased in a variety of tumors. However, the common finding of high D-dimer in cancer even in the absence of thrombosis limits the diagnostic usefulness of this test. Nevertheless, incorporating D-dimer measurement in appropriate scoring systems including other biomarkers may help to identify cancer patients at increased risk of developing VTE who are thus candidates for primary thromboprophylaxis. In addition, although the value of screening patients with increased D-dimer for occult cancer is still a subject of debate, an occult cancer may be considered as the potential source of a substantial rise in D-dimer levels when other physiological or pathological causes have been ruled out. The usefulness of this approach has been highlighted in a clinical study in patients with unprovoked VTE, demonstrating that extremely high D-dimer (> 4,000 µg/L) is independently associated with the likelihood of an occult cancer.

Introduction

Hemostasis can be schematically represented as a constant, delicate equilibrium between anticoagulant and procoagulant strengths in order to maintain the blood in physiological conditions of fluidity. The primary function of hemostasis is the generation of a stable clot in the event of vascular injury, thereby preventing excessive blood loss. While the formation of a clot, composed essentially of fibrin and blood cells (i.e. erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets), is essential to stop bleeding, its timely removal by the fibrinolytic system is also needed to restore blood flow within the repaired blood vessel. Clot lysis, made by plasmin and other proteases, is accompanied by the generation of fibrin degradation products. Among the laboratory biomarkers of fibrinolysis, D-dimer is currently considered the gold standard, not only because of its high sensitivity, but also rapid results, widespread availability, and relatively low cost of the assays. Besides thromboembolic diseases, several physiological and pathological conditions (i.e. aging, pregnancy, cancer, inflammation, infection), not necessarily characterized by thrombus formation, have been associated with increased D-dimer.

In this narrative review aimed at the hematologist, we first present a typical clinical case and describe the physiology and physiopathology of D-dimer formation. This is followed by a summary of the main conditions associated with increased D-dimer and we propose an approach to their management, based on evidence in the literature and personal experiences. COVID-19-associated increased D-dimer levels will be not discussed here, since they have already been extensively addressed elsewhere. It is, however, undeniable that during the 3-year pandemic, an overuse of D-dimer testing was performed in many patients infected by (or recovering from) SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby creating a generalized and often unjustified alarm among patients and medical teams. Accordingly, hematologists have frequently met cases of isolated increased D-dimer levels with no apparent thrombotic process, and have thus been called upon to make important decisions as to their management.

Conclusions

D-dimer testing is unequivocally a useful tool for the diagnosis of VTE. However, owing to its intrinsic poor positive predictive value, D-dimer is not specific for thromboembolic disease because increased levels are also observed in many other conditions, ranging from DIC to infections and malignant neoplasms. In other words, increased D-dimer levels may be encountered as part of an inflammatory state or cancer without being the sign of intravascular thrombus formation. Thus, while D-dimer measurement must be incorporated in multi-test algorithms for the evaluation of patients with suspected VTE, this measurement has limited clinical utility in unselected ambulatory cases and should, therefore, only be performed in specified clinical situations. However, the detection of increased D-dimer cannot be ignored and warrants a series of diagnostic procedures aimed at the proper management of these cases. This means, on the one hand, the exclusion of any associated thromboembolic complication and, on the other hand, the identification or exclusion of conditions associated with increased D-dimer. When the latter remains the only abnormality, individuals should be reassured about their health status and encouraged to avoid the repeated, obsessive measurement of D-dimer.

Laboratory testing for risk stratification and triage

Both ISTH-IG and ASH are the only societies that recommend monitoring D-dimer, PTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen levels for risk stratification of critical care treatment and consideration of experimental COVID-19 therapies based on changes in these parameters. ISTH-IG also recommends obtaining D-dimer, PTT, platelet count, and fibrinogen for all patients who present with COVID-19 infection to help guide which patients may require admission. Specifically, they provide an algorithm and the following thresholds for admission to the hospital: D-dimer markedly raised three- to fourfold, prothrombin time prolonged, platelet count < 100 × 10 9, and fibrinogen < 2.0 g/L. Alternatively, the CDC states that there is a lack of prospective data demonstrating laboratory measures of coagulopathy for risk stratification in patients who are asymptomatic or with mild infection, and insufficient data to recommend for or against using such laboratory values to guide management. The SCC-ISTH mentions that the risk stratification algorithm for hospitalized patients requires further study while acknowledging the use of very elevated D-dimer (> 6 times upper limit of normal (ULN)) appears to be a consistent predictor of thrombotic events and poor overall prognosis in this patient population. ACC recommends that risk stratification of COVID-19 patients should be similar to other acutely ill medical patients without COVID-19 while stating that regular monitoring of platelet count, PT, D-dimer, and fibrinogen is important to diagnosing worsening coagulopathy and treatment of underlying conditions of DIC and bacterial superinfections is important.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^115KTUBp]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

D-dimer, a soluble fibrin degradation product that originates from plasmin-induced degradation of cross-linked fibrin, is an important biomarker of coagulation activation and secondary fibrinolysis that is routinely used to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), and to evaluate the risk of VTE recurrence, as well as the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy. Besides VTE, D-dimer may be high due to physiologic conditions, including aging, pregnancy, and strenuous physical activity. In addition, several disorders have been associated with increased D-dimer levels, ranging from disseminated intravascular coagulation to infectious diseases and cancers. Thus, it is far from unusual for hematologists to have to deal with ambulatory individuals with increased D-dimer without signs or symptoms of thrombus formation. This narrative review is dedicated to the management of these cases by the hematologist.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

D -dimer.

There is emerging evidence for D -dimer measurement. A retrospective, single-center, observational study from China involving 183 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia demonstrated significantly higher D -dimer level at admission in non-survivors than in survivors (2.12 μg/mL versus 0.61 μg/mL; P < 0.001; normal D -dimer level < 0.50 μg/mL). Moreover, non-survivors had evidence of progressive disseminated intravascular coagulation, with decreased fibrinogen, increased D -dimer, and increased prothrombin time (PT), 10 days after admission. Although evidence at the time of writing remains limited, other studies also have suggested clinical utility of D -dimer measurement. A retrospective French study involving 71 hospitalized (non-ICU) COVID-19 patients reported a 90% negative predictive value of baseline D -dimer level < 1.0 µg/mL for VTE and 98% for PE. The same study reported a positive predictive value for VTE of 44% and 67% for PE with D -dimer levels ≥ 1.0 µg/mL and ≥ 3 µg/mL, respectively.

Other studies have identified laboratory based risk stratification models using D -dimer thresholds to identify patients who should receive prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation, even with low clinical suspicion of VTE. Those with D -dimer level persistently < 1,000 μg/L would receive standard prophylactic dosing, whereas those with initial level < 1,000 μg/L on admission, but with a significant increase during hospitalization to levels above 2,000–4,000 μg/L, may consider imaging for DVT or PE, particularly if the patient is symptomatic for these conditions. When imaging is not feasible, and clinical suspicion for VTE is high, therapeutic LMWH without imaging is recommended, provided that the risk of bleeding is acceptable. In a multicenter study involving three U.S. academic hospitalselevated D -dimer at hospital presentation and an elevated D -dimer or decreased platelet count during ICU admission suggested development of VTE, despite prophylactic anticoagulation. A serum D -dimer concentration greater than 2,600 ng/mL (normal range, 0–292 ng/mL) demonstrated the most accurate discriminatory function in this study to detect the occurrence of VTE (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.760; P < 0.0001; sensitivity and specificity of 89.7% and 59.5%, respectively).

### COVID-19 and coagulation: bleeding and thrombotic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1112FR7P]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have elevated D-dimer levels. Early reports describe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rates, but data are limited. This multicenter retrospective study describes the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval, 2.9–7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8–12.8). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9–7.3) and 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0–4.2), respectively. In the critically ill, radiographically confirmed VTE and major bleeding rates were 7.6% (95% CI, 3.9–13.3) and 5.6% (95% CI, 2.4–10.7), respectively. Elevated D-dimer at initial presentation was predictive of coagulation-associated complications during hospitalization (D-dimer > 2500 ng/mL, adjusted odds ratio [OR] for thrombosis, 6.79 [95% CI, 2.39–19.30]; adjusted OR for bleeding, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.01–12.66]), critical illness, and death. Additional markers at initial presentation predictive of thrombosis during hospitalization included platelet count > 450 × 109/L (adjusted OR, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.27–9.97]), C-reactive protein (CRP) > 100 mg/L (adjusted OR, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.26–5.86]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 40 mm/h (adjusted OR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.07–6.51]). ESR, CRP, fibrinogen, ferritin, and procalcitonin were higher in patients with thrombotic complications than in those without. DIC, clinically relevant thrombocytopenia, and reduced fibrinogen were rare and were associated with significant bleeding manifestations. Given the observed bleeding rates, randomized trials are needed to determine any potential benefit of intensified anticoagulant prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19–associated thrombosis — pathophysiology, risk factors, and uncertainty are summarized: VTE has emerged as an important clinical complication for patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with early reports documenting high rates of VTE despite pharmacological thromboprophylaxis; arterial thrombotic complications including stroke have been noted; mechanisms remain not fully elucidated with hemostatic abnormalities such as elevations in factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, and D-dimer; reported predictors and risk factors include elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, platelet count, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and older age; the optimal thromboprophylaxis strategy remains uncertain and it remains unclear whether these parameters should be used to stratify risk or influence thromboprophylaxis intensity.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Hypercoagulable biomarkers in atrial fibrillation indicate systemic coagulation and platelet activation. AF has been associated with biochemical markers of coagulation and platelet activation that reflect a systemic hypercoagulable state, and persistent and paroxysmal AF have been associated with increased systemic fibrinogen and fibrin D-dimer levels indicating active intravascular thrombinogenesis. Elevated thrombomodulin and platelet factor 4 levels in selected patients with AF indicate platelet activation but these data are less robust, and fibrin D-dimer levels are higher in patients with AF than in patients in sinus rhythm, irrespective of underlying heart disease.

For these reasons, we suggest that instead of recommending an evaluation algorithm for elevated D-dimer tests in asymptomatic ambulatory individuals, the focus should shift back towards avoiding unnecessary medical tests. Such efforts could lead to the better education of healthcare professionals on the rational prescription of these tests, ensuring effective and appropriate use based on solid clinical reasoning and a specific patient context.

### COVID-19 and its implications for thrombosis and anticoagulation [^111Yv3ze]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.

### Pulmonary embolism and increased levels of D-dimer in patients with coronavirus disease [^111pjSUR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

PEs can occur after the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, despite DVT prophylaxis. After initial improvements, patients might continue to have high or increasing oxygen requirements because of development of thromboembolic disease. Previous studies showed that low levels of platelets, increased levels of-dimer, and increasing levels of prothrombin in COVID-19 were associated with poor outcome, which might be explained by thromboembolic complications in patients with severe disease. Platelet counts remained within reference ranges for 2 of our patients and only decreased for 1 patient. Two patients had increases in-dimer levels, and the third patient was admitted with a highly increased-dimer level.

Autopsy reports from COVID-19 patients have shown microthrombi in lungs and in other organs with associated foci of hemorrhage. These findings suggest that severe endothelial dysfunction, driven by the cytokine storm and associated hypoxemia, leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation, causing thromboembolic complications. In these patients, other parameters, such as the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, and inflammatory markers, including ferritin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, were returning to reference levels despite increased-dimer levels and increasing oxygen requirements. Standard dose DVT prophylaxis did not prevent this complication. This hypercoagulability was a consumptive coagulopathy and was not caused by an inhibitor, such as an anticardiolipin antibody; treatment with direct factor Xa inhibitors would be appropriate.

Although certain underlying conditions might have influenced the coagulation process in these patients, the hypothesis that hypercoagulability is driven by endothelial dysfunction is plausible. These case studies support the earlier observation that anticoagulation is associated with a decrease in mortality rates for COVID-19 patients. Monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation and measurement of platelet counts,-dimer and fibrinogen levels, and trending International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis scores might be beneficial for early diagnosis of PE in patients with COVID-19.

### D-dimer and platelet aggregability are related to thrombotic events in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease [^115nnz2F]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the frequency of arterial thrombotic events in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease during 3–5 years of follow-up and to determine whether baseline levels of haemostatic factors were related to the risk of future thrombotic events.

Methods and Results

One hundred and twenty-three patients, mean age 56 years, with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and intermittent claudication were followed prospectively for an average of 4.2 years. Fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1+2, D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type I antigen and activity, plasmin-alpha(2)-antiplasmin complex, beta thromboglobulin and ADP-induced platelet aggregation were measured at the recruitment. Thirty-eight new vascular events (15 fatal) were identified. Age- (and other clinical and laboratory variables) -adjusted relative risks (RR) of thrombotic events were significantly elevated (P < 0.05) per higher value of D-dimer (RR: 14.1, 95% CI 1.7;115.8) and platelet aggregation was low (RR: 4.6, 95% CI 1.3;16.3). Diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, and continuing deterioration of intermittent claudication at the recruitment were also independently associated with risk of thrombotic events in the multiple regression model (RR: 5.2, 95% CI 1.5;17.5; RR: 8.6, 95% CI 2.7;27.4; RR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.2;5.7 respectively).

Conclusion

Elevated level of D-dimer and low platelet aggregation are independent haemostatic predictors of thrombotic events in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.

Coagulation abnormalities in COVID-19 infection — patients with severe infection commonly show a pattern of coagulopathy with elevated fibrinogen and D-dimer levels that is thought to represent a prothrombotic state, and patients with severe COVID-19 may develop a coagulopathy meeting criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) reflected by moderate to severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 x 10^9/L), prolongation of the PT and aPTT, marked elevation of D-dimer and decreased fibrinogen (< 1.0 g/L); development of DIC occurred in 71% of those dying in a cohort of 183 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with deceased patients having higher serum D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation product levels than those who recovered.

### Acute lower extremity arterial thrombosis associated with nephrotic syndrome in adults: case series and literature review [^115roFn2]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fibrinogen is a critical coagulation factor that can cause endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation and plays a pivotal role in atherosclerosis initiation and development. An increase in fibrinogen levels generates a larger amount of fibrin cleavage fragments, which in turn generate denser and insoluble fibrin networks and may contribute to hypercoagulability, thus promoting platelet hyperaggregability in patients with NS. D-dimers are generated by fibrinolysis of fibrinogen and fibrin. The D-dimer level has been suggested to be an indicator of hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis and is an excellent predictor of near-term thromboembolic events. In the present study, both the fibrinogen and D-dimer levels increased to varying degrees, and the elevations were obvious in all patients, which indicates ongoing thrombogenic and fibrinolytic activities.

Regarding sex, male patients accounted for the most of the cases, which was consistent with previous studies. Currently, it is not clear why such a sex-based difference exists. Arterial thrombi are mainly composed of platelets (white clots), and the prevalence of dysfunctional platelets was significantly higher in males than females, which might be one of the reasons.

Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to coagulopathy and thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019, and anticoagulant therapy. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles.

Data Synthesis

Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a strikingly high prevalence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration. Monitoring coagulation variables is important, as abnormal coagulation tests are related to adverse outcomes and may necessitate adjuvant antithrombotic interventions. In the initial phase of the infection, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal. Increased D-dimer levels three times the upper limit of normal may trigger screening for venous thromboembolism. In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended. The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system. Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities.

Conclusions

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients. D-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.

### Fibrinogen concentrate substitution therapy in patients with massive haemorrhage and low plasma fibrinogen concentrations [^112Zhdmq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients experiencing massive haemorrhage are at high risk of developing coagulopathy through loss, consumption, and dilution of coagulation factors and platelets. It has been reported that plasma fibrinogen concentrations may reach a critical low level relatively early during bleeding, calling for replacement fibrinogen therapy. Cryoprecipitate has been widely used in the past, but more recently, a pasteurized fibrinogen concentrate has become available. We audited the effects of fibrinogen concentrate therapy on laboratory and clinical outcome in patients with massive haemorrhage.

Methods

We identified 43 patients over the previous 2 yr to whom a fibrinogen concentrate had been administered as treatment for hypofibrinogenaemia during serious haemorrhage. Platelet count, P-fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), D-dimer, and volume of blood lost were obtained from medical and laboratory records. Numbers of units of red blood cells (RBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and pooled platelet concentrates were recorded before and after fibrinogen substitution.

Results

A significant increase in plasma fibrinogen concentration was observed after fibrinogen concentrate therapy. Platelet counts and fibrin D-dimer values remained unchanged, whereas the APTT and PT improved significantly. Requirements for RBC, FFP, and platelets were significantly reduced. Blood loss decreased significantly.

Conclusions

Off-label substitution therapy with a fibrinogen concentrate generally improved global laboratory coagulation results and as supplementary intervention, appeared to diminish the requirements for RBC, FFP, and platelet substitution in this patient cohort.

### Association between thrombogenicity indices and coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^1116Jojy]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

In the current analysis, a marked elevation in D-dimer levels was observed in patients with versus without CMD. D-dimers indicate the hypercoagulation activity and the presence of a thrombus. Coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 increases the risk of thromboembolic events. An elevated level of D-dimer has been related to the risk of death and the level of thrombus burden in AMI patients. High D-dimer in COVID-19 may be associated with a prothrombotic state, a hypofibrinolytic state, or both. Therefore, this biomarker may have the potential to monitor COVID-19 coagulopathy and CMD occurrence. Our study also demonstrated the significant value of D-dimer in predicting important thromboembolic occlusion.

The TEG assay is a whole-blood ex vivo assay that measures the dynamic viscoelastic properties of clot generation from the time of initial plasmatic thrombin generation, to platelet-fibrin dependent clot formation, to clot strengthening, and finally to clot lysis. The TEG assay also provides comprehensive information on thrombin generation, the interaction between fibrinogen/fibrin and platelets to form a platelet-fibrin clot, the contribution of platelet count and function as well as fibrinogen level and activity to clot strength, and the stability of the clot. P-FCS (ie, MA measured by TEG) levels are affected by changes in fibrinogen level and activity as well as platelet count and function. In addition, our previous reports suggested close relationships with coagulation activity (prothrombin time), fibrinogen level, hemoglobin, and platelet count.

### D-dimer as a potential biomarker for disease severity in COVID-19 [^113eQED6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study seeks to determine the utility of D-dimer levels as a biomarker in determining disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19.

Methods

Clinical, imaging and laboratory data of 120 patients whose COVID-19 diagnosis based on RT-PCR were evaluated retrospectively. Clinically, the severity of COVID-19 was classified as noncomplicated or mild or severe pneumonia. Radiologically, the area of affected lungs compatible with viral pneumonia in each patient's computed tomography was classified as either 0–30% or ≥ 31% of the total lung area. The D-dimer values and laboratory data of patients with COVID-19 were compared with inpatient status, duration of hospitalization, and lung involvement during treatment and follow-up. To assess the predictive value of D-dimer, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted.

Results

D-dimer elevation (> 243 ng/ml) was detected in 63.3% (76/120) of the patients. The mean D-dimer value was calculated as 3144.50 ± 1709.4 ng/ml (1643–8548) for inpatients with severe pneumonia in the intensive care unit. D-Dimer values showed positive correlations with age, duration of stay, lung involvement, fibrinogen, neutrophil count, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR). When the threshold D-dimer value was 370 ng/ml in the ROC analysis, this value was calculated to have 77% specificity and 74% sensitivity for lung involvement in patients with COVID-19.

Conclusion

D-Dimer levels in patients with COVID-19 correlate with outcome, but further studies are needed to see how useful they are in determining prognosis.

### Role of combining anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in COVID-19 treatment: a rapid review [^1157Ez9M]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

D-dimers

When a blood clot is dissolved, D-dimers are disseminated in the blood as a biproduct of coagulated platelet breakdown. Given that coagulopathy is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, it is expected that D-dimer levels might play an important role in diagnosis or monitoring of patients. Current studies observed elevated D-dimer levels in patients with COVID-19, ranging from a 2.5-fold to a 6.0-fold increase, with these increased levels predicting mortality and the development of thromboembolic events in patients. Yet, there is no consensus on a specific cut-off level which can accurately predict disease course, mortality or response to antithrombotic therapy. Mouhat et al suggested the use of 2590 ng/mL as threshold level which corresponds to a ≈5-fold increase in normal D-dimer level. This 5-fold increase was associated with a 17-fold increase in the incidence of PE among patients (OR 16.9, 95% CI 6.3 to 45.0, p < 0.001). Similarly, Ventura-Diaz et al reported that a 5.5-fold increase in D-dimer level could predict the occurrence of PE with 81% sensitivity and 59% specificity (p < 0.001), while Ooi et al examined a larger sample of 974 patients and reported that a 4.5-fold increase in D-dimer level would predict the occurrence of PE with a 72% sensitivity and a 74% specificity. Moreover, patients presenting with increased D-dimer levels equivalent to more than fourfolds the normal level exhibit a higher mortality risk when compared with their counterparts, who present with lower levels (OR 10.17, 95% CI 1.10 to 94.38, p = 0.041). These findings were corroborated by Zhang et al, who had similar findings and showed that D-dimer levels ≥ 4 times the normal level could predict mortality with 92.3% sensitivity and 83.3%. specificity (HR 51.5, 95% CI 12.9 to 206.7, p < 0.001). Further research on possible explanations for anticoagulant treatment failure in some patient subgroups is warranted. Collectively, these preliminary findings indicate the possible use of D-dimers to guide treatment regimens and to establish different patient subgroups that should receive personalised treatment. However, the use of D-dimer in clinical settings as a stand-alone marker for COVID-19 thrombosis does not seem practical, as a clear cut-off value cannot be easily established since sensitivity of the test is compromised with age.

### Race-related disparities in COVID-19 thrombotic outcomes: beyond social and economic explanations [^112v82Sy]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic outcome disparities have been attributed to specific hemostasis factors

(Table 1). Caucasians more often have prothrombotic factor V and prothrombin genetic mutations than Asians. AAs have the highest factor VIII, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, and von Willebrand factor levels versus intermediate levels in Caucasians and Hispanics and the lowest levels in Asians (Table 1). D-dimer is highest in AAs and lowest in Asians. Additionally, endothelial dysfunction is observed more often in AAs than Caucasians, and disparate regulation of the Gq pathway after protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR-4) stimulation associated with greater platelet activation has been reported (Table 1).

Table 1
Race -related differences in intrinsic thrombogenicity and inflammation.

Caucasians also have higher CRP than Asians. After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, BMI, and other risk factors, AA race was associated with increased CRP, and fibrinogen was higher in AAs than Caucasians despite demographic adjustments (Table 1). The totality of evidence supports that AAs have the most elevated inflammation and thrombosis biomarkers, followed by Caucasians (especially of European descent) and then Asians. The prothrombotic stimulus induced by COVID-19 combined with inherent greater thrombogenicity likely contributes to the disparity in clinical outcomes among racial groups. The preliminary results confirming the hypothesis were recently reported by Zakeri et al.

Currently, D-dimer is the most widely reported biomarker associated with COVID-19 severity and outcomes, with an escalation of antithrombotic therapy proposed in patients with very high levels. However, there are several limitations of this biomarker to monitor thrombogenicity during COVID-19. Despite evidence of elevated-dimer in patients with severe COVID-19, VTE was not evident in the majority.-dimer, an acute phase reactant with low specificity in the critically ill with conditions associated with fibrin formation, is generated during fibrinolysis and reflects later stage clot formation and hemostatic processes. There is also considerable variation in D-dimer measurements and the reported units that has made pooling of the studies for interpretation unreliable. About 2–3% of plasma fibrinogen is physiologically converted to crosslinked fibrin and then degraded to-dimer. Thus, elevated levels of fibrinogen in COVID-19 patients, especially among AAs, likely contribute to higher-dimer values without necessarily an associated increase in fibrinolytic activity. Hence, even if the fibrinolytic system is impaired,-dimer values may be high. Finally,-dimer does not provide quantitative information on platelet function, thrombin generation, and the kinetics of clot formation.

### Haemostatic and thrombo-embolic complications in pregnant women with COVID-19: a systematic review and critical analysis [^114bZPJa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our review is the largest reported to date, even following removal of potential duplicates. The precision of our estimates is therefore greater.

Many primary studies were case reports or hospital-based series, which are at risk of bias towards cases or findings of interest, resulting in potential overestimation of complications. On the other hand, few papers specifically stated that there were no haemostatic complications in each case. Our assumption that this means an absence of complications may result in an underestimate, as theoretically complications may have been present, but not reported.

The DIC score used to identify cases from laboratory findings is a composite of prothrombin time, platelet counts and fibrinogen levels. However, coagulopathy in COVID-19 is associated with a modest change in these parameters, meaning that the DIC score alone may be less accurate as a measure of COVID-19 coagulopathy in pregnancy. In addition, many authors did not report fibrinogen levels or prothrombin time, which will have falsely lowered our rate estimate of coagulopathy. D-dimer, like C-reactive protein (CRP), is an acute phase reactant, which can be elevated in trauma or any inflammatory condition. Elevated D-dimer levels are difficult to interpret, as the etiology of their rise can be multifactorial. D-dimer elevations can occur during an uncomplicated pregnancy, though typically they are not as pronounced as in some of the cases in this study, where the values were reported. Pneumonia as well has been associated with high D-dimer levels, as have thromboembolic events. As reported in Pereira et al, pregnant women who were classified as having severe clinical features of pneumonia in COVID-19 had higher D-dimer and CRP. On the other hand, significant elevations of D-dimer were also noted in two reported cases of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy in pregnancy, neither of which were complicated by pneumonia or significant respiratory compromise. While lack of standardisation of D-dimer thresholds in pregnancy renders interpretation challenging, in these two cases D-dimer levels were grossly elevated, at 17- and 12- fold the upper limit of normal.

### Thromboelastographic results and hypercoagulability syndrome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who are critically ill [^117ESnNd]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Table 1.
Patient Coagulation Parameters and Thrombotic Complications

Abbreviations: D-dimer, dimerized plasmin fragment D; INR, international normalized ratio; LY30, clot lysis at 30 minutes after maximum clot strength; NA, not applicable.

SI conversion factors: To convert platelet count to ×10 9 per liter multiply by 1; fibrinogen to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01; and D-dimer to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 5.476.

There were no statistically significant differences in prothrombin time, INR, partial thromboplastin time, or platelet levels between 10 patients with at least 2 thrombotic events vs 11 patients with fewer than 2 events (Table 2). In comparison, innate TEG MA was significantly greater for the high event rate group than the low event rate group (mean [SD], 75 [7] mm vs 61 [21] mm; p = 0.01). Elevated MA was observed in 10 patients (100%) in the high event rate group vs 5 patients (45%) in the low event rate group. Innate TEG MA provided 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value (Table 2).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^11164J9i]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer for suspected pulmonary embolism — Level B recommendations state: In patients older than 50 years deemed to be low or intermediate risk for acute PE, clinicians may use a negative age-adjusted D-dimer result to exclude the diagnosis of PE; Level A recommendations and Level C recommendations are none specified; for highly sensitive D-dimer assays using fibrin equivalent units (FEU) use a cutoff of age×10 μg/L, and for highly sensitive D-dimer assays using D-dimer units (DDU) use a cutoff of age×5 μg/L.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^116gCFFG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

### D-dimer specificity and clinical context: an old unlearned story [^115pUABF]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the D-dimer dose adjustment of anticoagulant prophylaxis has not been proven effective even in COVID-19 patients, although some scientific societies suggest the possibility of stratifying patients based on serum D-dimer levels. This strategy's rationale is at least controversial: even in overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the D-dimer is unreliable since its specificity varies considerably with the cut-off value. Approximately 20% of patients with a D-dimer value greater than 2.2 μg/mL do not have DIC.

Finally, it should be considered that the ISTH SSC on Fibrinolysis group has identified several technical pitfalls detected in current studies on D-dimer in COVID-19 cases.

In conclusion, D-Dimer guided-anticoagulation management does not seem supported enough by evidence-based recommendations. Studies that specifically address this issue are needed before evidence-based recommendations can be made.

### Time course of coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters in patients with traumatic brain injury [^1155Fcb5]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has long been associated with coagulopathy; however, the time course of coagulation/fibrinolytic parameters in the acute phase of TBI remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to analyze the time course of coagulation/fibrinolytic parameters in the acute phase of TBI and to elucidate parameter relationships to prognosis. We retrospectively evaluated 234 patients with severe isolated TBI with initial blood samples obtained no more than 1h after injury. Platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), plasma levels of fibrinogen, and D-dimer were measured on arrival in the emergency department and 3, 6, and 12h after injury. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for poor prognosis at each time point. From hospital admission to 12h after injury, an elevated D-dimer level was a significant negative prognostic indicator (admission: p < 0.0001; 3h after injury: p = 0.0005; 6h after injury: p = 0.005; 12h after injury: p = 0.0009). An upward trend of aPTT on admission and 3h after injury was also a significant negative prognostic indicator (admission: p = 0.0011; 3h after injury: p = 0.013). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, which included all initial variables, independent risk factors for poor prognosis included older age (p = 0.0005), low Glasgow Coma Scale score (p < 0.0001), high Abbreviated Injury Score (p = 0.015), aPTT > 30.2sec (p = 0.019), and elevated D-dimer level (p = 0.0005). We concluded that D-dimer is the best coagulation/fibrinolytic parameter to monitor for prediction of outcome.

### Bleeding and thrombosis in patients with out-of-hospital ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^112u2GBf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In unadjusted analysis, decreased levels of fibrinogen, antithrombin III, and platelet count were associated with increased risk of major bleeding, though this was negated in the multivariable model. Prior studies on patients who received eCPR suggest that hyperfibrinolysis may increase bleeding risk. In a study including 133 patients, higher D‐dimer level on admission (18.8 versus 6.7 μg/mL) was associated with major bleeding. We did not find significant associations between initial D‐dimer and bleeding, but the D‐dimer levels of our cohort were very elevated (15.7 ± 0.5 μg/mL [normal for our laboratory: 0.0–0.5 μg/mL]) and frequently reported as > 20 μg/mL. This may have led to an underestimation of the actual D‐dimer levels in patients with bleeding and may explain the disparate findings. However, markers of coagulation factor consumption, including low fibrinogen and low antithrombin III, were associated with bleeding. In adjusted analysis, decreased level of fibrinogen was the only variable associated with increased bleeding risk. Another study including all patients receiving VA ECMO identified fibrinogen among other factors to be predictive of bleeding. Low platelet count, elevated D‐dimer, and low fibrinogen has been observed in other populations receiving eCPR, with an elevated disseminated coagulation score score being associated with mortality. These studies excluded patients on DAPT, whereas we had a significant proportion of patients on DAPT and found a persistent association with markers of consumption and increased bleeding risk.

### Prognostic significance of hemostatic parameters in patients with lung cancer [^1163Y5cJ]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

There is a subclinical activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis system in lung cancer. Alterations in hemostatic system are seen frequently in lung cancer correlated with the prognosis of disease. In this prospective study, our purpose was to investigate the prognostic significance of hemostatic markers in patients with lung cancer. The study comprised 58 patients (22 squamous cell carcinoma, 16 adenocarcinoma, 20 small cell carcinoma). There were 55 men (95%)and 3 women (5%) with a mean age of 61 years range (36–74). Plasma level of platelets (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), active partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin III (AT III), fibrinogen (F) and D-dimer level were measured before the initiation of any therapy. Patients were followed up for 17 (12–20) months. The median survival was determined as 6.4 months. Three histopathologic groups; squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma were compared for the hemostatic parameters. There were no statistically significant differences among the histopathologic types for any of the parameters (P > 0.05). Patients were divided into two groups as patients without distant metastasis (stages I, II, III) and with distant metastasis (stage IV). The group with distant metastasis had higher level of D-dimer than the other group (P < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences for D-dimer level between stages IIIB and IV (P > 0.05). Patients having high D-dimer and low AT III level had poor survival in our study. Thus, high level of D-dimer and low AT III level were determined as correlated with short survival (P < 0.05). These results suggest that elevated plasma level of D-dimer and low AT III level might be a sign of poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer.

### Increased D-dimer value and occult cancer in the absence of detectable thrombosis [^112mvG7L]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

Fibrin formation and removal occurs continuously during the development of malignancy. Accordingly, hemostatic disorders in cancer patients are a rather frequent observation and range from asymptomatic laboratory changes to massive thromboembolism or haemorrhage. We document the case of an asymptomatic women, who was enrolled as a healthy control in a study and showed up with a substantially increased D- dimer value. After ruling out the most probable sources of D-dimer elevation, such as thrombosis, inflammation and trauma, she underwent laboratory and radiological investigations for malignancy, which were consistent with a colorectal metastatic adenocarcinoma. This case allow us to hypothesize that screening for occult malignancy in the presence of apparently inexplicable elevated D-dimer values may be taken into consideration.

### Approach to the patient with COVID-19-associated thrombosis: a case-based review [^115LuBdy]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Alongside its potential to cause severe respiratory illness, studies have reported a distinct COVID-19-associated coagulopathy that is characterized by elevated D-dimer levels, hyperfibrinogenemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and slight prolongation of the prothrombin time. Studies have also reported increased rates of thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19, but variations in study methodologies, patient populations, and anticoagulation strategies make it challenging to distill implications for clinical practice. Here, we present a practical review of current literature and uses a case-based format to discuss the diagnostic approach and management of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated coagulopathy is characterized by elevated D-dimer levels, hyperfibrinogenemia, and increased rates of thromboembolism. Current management guidelines are based on limited evidence from retrospective studies that should be interpreted carefully. At this time, all hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should receive coagulation test surveillance and standard doses of prophylactic anticoagulation until prospective randomized controlled trials yield definitive information in support of higher prophylactic doses.

### Impaired fibrinolysis and increased clot strength are potential risk factors for thrombosis in lymphoma [^111cpgV8]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

One patient with AL amyloidosis displayed hyperfibrinolysis with a 50% clot lysis time (266 s) below the reference range (306–1565 s) at diagnosis. Along with fast 50% clot lysis time, the patient had low levels of α2-AP activity (46%), low plasminogen activity (50%), elevated tPA (9.2 ng/L), elevated uPA (2.8 ng/L), elevated D-dimer (9.2 mg/L), prolonged aPTT (35 s), elevated INR (2.3), and high levels of PAP complexes (925 ng/mL). This indicates hyperfibrinolysis with depletion of plasminogen and α2-AP. Prolonged aPTT and elevated INR indicated depleted coagulation factors. The patient had a history of increased bleeding tendency with WHO grade ≥ 2 bleeding episodes at diagnosis. At follow-up (after 3 months of treatment), the 50% clot lysis time and other fibrinolysis markers returned to normal, and the increased bleeding tendency had resolved.

The 1 patient with APL displayed extreme hyperfibrinolysis with severely elevated PAP complexes (12 885 ng/mL), suppressed α2-AP activity (46%), increased PAI-1 (47 ng/mL), low-normal plasminogen activity (74%), and low fibrinogen (3.7 μmol/L). The clot formation and lysis curve was completely flat at diagnosis, which can be explained by rampant hyperfibrinolysis and low fibrinogen levels. The clot formation and lysis assay returned to normal at follow-up, along with all the other fibrinolysis markers. The patient did not experience WHO grade ≥ 2 bleeding, possibly because of prompt recognition of the hyperfibrinolytic condition and, thus, early bleeding prophylaxis with platelet transfusion and fibrinogen concentrate.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116ka1vE]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Hospitalized patients with acute illness — guidance statement advises that in those with low bleeding risk, the panel suggests therapeutic dose heparin (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) over current standard dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, rated as a Conditional Recommendation and Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement. Remarks instruct providers to weigh thrombosis and bleeding risks; patients at higher thrombosis risk may include those with a significantly elevated D-dimer level defined in studies as 2–4 x the upper limit of normal, prior VTE, or relevant comorbidities, whereas high bleeding risk includes known bleeding within the last 30 days requiring emergency department presentation or hospitalization.

### Hypercoagulability of COVID-19 patients in intensive care unit: a report of thromboelastography findings and other parameters of hemostasis [^111jm6yT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe inflammatory state secondary to COVID-19 leads to a severe derangement of hemostasis that has been recently described as a state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and consumption coagulopathy, defined as decreased platelet count, increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products such as D-dimer, as well as low fibrinogen.

Aims

Whole blood from 24 patients admitted at the intensive care unit because of COVID-19 was collected and evaluated with thromboelastography by the TEG point-of-care device on a single occasion and six underwent repeated measurements on two consecutive days for a total of 30 observations. Plasma was evaluated for the other parameters of hemostasis.

Results

TEG parameters are consistent with a state of hypercoagulability as shown by decreased values, and increased values of K angle and MA. Platelet count was normal or increased, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were near(normal). Fibrinogen was increased and D-dimer was dramatically increased. C-reactive protein was increased. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (n = 11) were increased. Antithrombin (n = 11) was marginally decreased and protein C (n = 11) was increased.

Conclusion

The results of this cohort of patients with COVID-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state. These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some of these patients and support antithrombotic prophylaxis/treatment. Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish the type of drug, dosage, and optimal duration of prophylaxis.

### Could hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis be the core issue of severe COVID-19 cases? [^1161kQB9]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Similar to sHLH, COVID-19 patients present with several laboratory abnormalities, with severe cases showing more prominent abnormalities (i.e. lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated CRP levels) than non-severe cases. Elevated D-dimer, serum ferritin, LDH, and IL-6 levels were also shown throughout the clinical course of non-surviving patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared with survivors. In a series of 1449 hospitalized subjects with COVID-19, baseline and maximum values of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in subjects who died than in survivors. Subjects who died had higher fibrinogen concentrations at baseline, but lower minimum values, than survivors. Baseline D-dimer levels and the difference in fibrinogen and platelet levels correlated with an increased risk of death among patients with COVID-19. Indeed, other observations confirm the relationship between coagulation disorders and prognosis.

Coagulation disorders are reported in patients with sHLH, frequently with decreased fibrinogen levels, and can result in severe bleeding complications. Indeed, a low fibrinogen level is one of the main HLH diagnostic criteria. Although this process in HLH is not fully explained, the release of proinflammatory cytokines can cause the release of tissue plasminogen activator and the activation of an alternative fibrinolytic pathway in macrophages. These factors can result in severe consumptive coagulopathy, with elevated fibrinogen degradation and decreased fibrinogen levels. Additionally, liver dysfunction may exacerbate coagulopathy. Therefore, the increase in proinflammatory cytokine release in COVID-19 may lead to analogous coagulation disorders in these patients. Indeed, the abovementioned laboratory abnormalities suggest that a hyper-inflammatory reaction is occurring in patients with severe COVID-19.

### Coagulopathy in COVID-19 [^116umT3X]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has become an urgent issue in every country. Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID-19. The clinical presentation of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, whereas hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial-sepsis-associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID-19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.

### Hemostatic alterations in COVID-19 [^115kYaA3]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Median (min-max) values of the hemostasis measurements in COVID-19 patients are listed in Table 1. The PT-ratio was slightly increased in patients at high- and intermediate- care intensity compared with those at lowintensity care. The APTT-ratio was slightly decreased in all patients irrespective of care intensity. Median platelet counts for patients at intermediate or high-care intensity were higher than those at low-intensity; the lowest observed platelet count (80x10 9 /L) being higher the 50x10 9 /L threshold value for DIC. Fibrinogen for patients admitted to the three care-intensity wards were higher than the upper limit of the normal range, with a gradient of increase across the care intensities and with values in patients at high-intensity care as high as 1,035 mg/dL. The lowest fibrinogen level (150 mg/dL) measure was higher than the 100 mg/dL DIC score threshold value incorporated to assign points. A similar trend of positive association with the level of care intensity was observed for D-dimer; as median values ranged from 870 ng/mL (low-intensity) to 1,347 ng/mL or to 2,217 ng/mL (intermediate- or high-intensity care) (Table 1). The median (min-max) DIC score for the whole patient cohort was 2 (range, 0–4), with only one patient scoring 4. SIC scores were similar in the three groups, all being below the cutoff of 4. Median FVIII, already high (208 U/dL) in lowintensity patients, was increased steadily in intermediate (223 U/dL) and high-intensity (302 U/dL) patients. Median antithrombin varied from 87 U/dL (low-intensity) to 100 U/dL (high-intensity). PC was increased in low-intensity patients (120 U/dL) and was further increased in intermediate (126 U/dL) or high-intensity (143 U/dL) care patients. PS free antigen was lower than 100 U/dL, with small variations according to the intensity of care (Table 1; Figure 1). Median VWF:Ag was high in patients at low-intensity (262 U/dL) and was further increased in intermediate (371 U/dL) and high-intensity (466 U/dL) care patients. VWF:RCo values paralleled those of VWF:Ag, albeit at a lower level, and the VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratio ranged between 0.85 (low), 0.86 (intermediate) and 0.81 (high) care intensity (Table 1; Figure 2). The median FVIII/VWF:Ag ratio ranged between 0.81 (low), 0.61 (intermediate) and 0.65 (high) care intensity. Median ferritin was extremely high, i.e. 380 mg/L (low), 705 ng/mL (intermediate) and 788 ng/mL (high) care intensity. C-reactive protein was 1.00 mg/dL (low), 3.32 mg/dL (intermediate) and 5.05 mg/dL (highintensity) care patients (Table 1).

### The procoagulant pattern of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115EAWtZ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Few observations exist with respect to the pro-coagulant profile of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reports of thromboembolic complications are scarce but suggestive for a clinical relevance of the problem.

Objectives

Prospective observational study aimed to characterize the coagulation profile of COVID-19 ARDS patients with standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests and to evaluate their changes after establishment of an aggressive thromboprophylaxis.

Methods

Sixteen patients with COVID-19 ARDS received a complete coagulation profile at the admission in the intensive care unit. Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases.

Results

At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35–63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa; interquartile range 24–45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa; interquartile range 6–13.5) elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 μg/mL, interquartile range 2.5–6.5), and hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583–933). Fibrinogen levels were associated (R 2 = .506, P = 0.003) with interleukin-6 values. After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P = 0.001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P = 0.017), CS (P = 0.013), PCS (P = 0.035), and FCS (P = 0.038).

Conclusion

The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease. Further studies are needed to assess the best prophylaxis and treatment of this condition.

### Massive pulmonary embolism leading to cardiac arrest is associated with consumptive coagulopathy presenting as disseminated intravascular coagulation [^1171sjQi]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Summary Background

A consumptive coagulopathy resembling disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been seen in patients with massive pulmonary embolism (PE). We hypothesized that a DIC-like condition is relevant in patients whose pulmonary embolism leads to cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

Methods

This hypothesis was tested by the use of a database consisting of all cases of PE diagnosed at the Department of Emergency Medicine from June 1993 to October 2007. Out of 1018 cases with PE, 113 patients underwent CPR. In this cohort study, the resuscitated patients were compared with those with PE but without CPR.

Results

Patients with PE and CPR had 3-fold higher D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), reduced platelet counts and lower fibrinogen and antithrombin (AT) levels compared with PE patients without cardiac arrest (P < 0.001 for all). Among patients with PE and CPR, D-dimer was abnormal in 100%, PT in 44%, AT in 53%, fibrinogen in 19% and platelets in 25%. In comparison, PE without CPR was associated with abnormal D-dimer in 99%, abnormal PT in 15%, low AT in 6%, low fibrinogen in 1% and low platelets in 2%. Nine per cent of the resuscitated patients had a DIC score ≥ 5, indicating overt DIC. The DIC score highly correlated with 1-year and in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Massive PE leading to CPR is associated with consumptive coagulopathy and overt DIC. In resuscitated patients, DIC markers may indicate pulmonary embolism as the underlying cause of arrest.

### Appropriate use of D-dimer in hospital patients [^111XAuCs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

D-dimer, the final product of plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin-rich thrombi, has emerged as a simple blood test that can be used in diagnostic algorithms for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism. D-dimer also is used as a part of the diagnostic tests for disseminated intravascular coagulation, where excessive thrombin generation is the key pathophysiological factor. However, there are no robust data available at present on the use of this test to exclude venous thromboembolism in a hospital inpatient. Considerable confusion also exists among physicians about its appropriate use and interpretation in disseminated intravascular coagulation. This article focuses on the available evidence to guide the appropriate use of D-dimer in patients admitted to a hospital.

### Thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19: a brief update to the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1156jgXL]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

COVID-19–associated thrombosis background and scope: Within the first few months of the COVID-19 global pandemic, it was recognized that patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 often exhibited markers of a hypercoagulable state and had an increased incidence of VTE, and reports documented significantly elevated D-dimer levels that were associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Based upon the limited, low-quality evidence suggesting patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a higher risk of thrombosis than similarly ill patients without COVID-19, societal guidelines were uniform in their recommendation that all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in the absence of a contraindication. Over the past 15 months, randomized controlled trials have emerged focusing on optimal dosing in both moderately ill hospitalized (non-ICU) and critically ill (ICU) patients, and the update provides guidance focused on prevention of thrombosis in hospitalized patients while stating it is not updating guidance related to pre- or posthospital prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment.

### Effect of sirolimus on coagulopathy of slow-flow vascular malformations [^112o2Liz]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Stagnant blood flow present in slow-flow vascular malformations can lead to localized intravascular coagulopathy (LIC), measured by elevated D-dimer levels, low fibrinogen, and/or thrombocytopenia. LIC can lead to localized thrombosis and/or bleeding, resulting in pain, swelling, and functional limitations. Patients with complex vascular malformations treated with sirolimus show clinical improvement in these symptoms. We hypothesized that the clinical benefits of sirolimus may correlate with improvements in coexisting LIC.

Design/Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed, including D-dimer, fibrinogen, and platelet count, in patients with slow-flow vascular malformations treated with sirolimus. Laboratory values were assessed at three time points (presirolimus, 1–3 months postsirolimus, and last clinic visit). Clinical response, as defined by decreased pain and swelling, was extracted from the record.

Results

Thirty-five patients at our vascular anomalies center had been prescribed sirolimus between 2014 and 2017. Fifteen patients (12 combined slow-flow vascular malformations and three pure venous malformations) remained after excluding patients that did not have adequate records or a venous component to their vascular malformation. Patients who did not adhere to the treatment were also excluded. All 15 had elevated D-dimer levels prior to treatment and there was a statistically significant decrease in D-dimer levels following treatment with sirolimus. Symptomatic improvement of pain and swelling was reported after 3 months of starting sirolimus in 13/15 patients.

Conclusion

This study suggests that sirolimus improves coagulopathy in slow-flow vascular malformations, as evidenced by reduced D-dimer levels. Improvement in LIC symptoms also correlates with sirolimus-corrected coagulopathy.

### How we approach thrombosis risk in children with COVID-19 infection and MIS-C [^1119c4Mk]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

2.1.2 What laboratory workup is considered for thrombosis risk?

CAC, which typically presents with extremely elevated D‐dimer, modest decrease in platelet count, elevation of fibrinogen, and mild prolongation of prothrombin time (PT), is associated with increased risk of thrombosis. 11, 14 CAC is distinct from sepsis‐associated coagulopathy where fibrinogen and platelets are significantly low. The pathophysiology of COVID‐19 suggests that cytokine‐mediated endotheliopathy and platelet activation play a central role in CAC. 11 Markers of endothelial and platelet activation, including ultra‐large multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and VWF antigen, factor VIII, and soluble P‐selectin, are higher in adults admitted to the ICU than in those admitted to regular ward. 33 Viscoelastic testing shows elevated maximal clot amplitude or strength consistent with increased platelet activation and increased fibrinogen in both children and adults. 34, 35 IL‐6, IL‐2, and TNF‐α produced during acute infection are also contributory. Dysregulation in plasma levels of coagulation factors and increased levels of anti‐fibrinolytic factors are correlated with high levels of IL‐6 in adults with acute infection. 36 Imbalance between procoagulant elevation and anticoagulant depletion overwhelms fibrinolysis resulting in a prothrombotic milieu. Elevations in D‐dimer, a biomarker for fibrinolysis, and fibrinogen reflect this prothrombotic milieu. Presence of lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies have also been reported during acute infection. 30 Recently, anti‐A antibodies in individuals with blood type "O" have been shown to have protective effect against SARS‐CoV‐2 invasion. 37

For hospitalized patients with symptomatic acute infection, we typically request complete blood counts, peripheral blood smear, screening coagulation tests (PT, activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]), fibrinogen, and D‐Dimer to assess for CAC and disease severity. Inflammatory markers, such as CRP and ferritin, may be used to trend disease progression. In case of prolongation of coagulation tests, lupus anticoagulant testing should be performed to assist the diagnosis of CAC. Other potential biomarkers may be considered for evaluation of children, however their utility to predict clinical outcomes, particularly thrombosis, has not yet been extensively studied.

### A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of 9 children with pulmonary embolism associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia [^1116QdZH]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

D-dimer has been proposed as an independent predictor of embolic risk with high sensitivity, and a normal level can exclude the possibility of pulmonary embolism. However, D-dimer has low sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PE in children. Although the combination of the Wells score and D-dimer is commonly used to predict PE in adults, and the absence of both factors can rule out PE, this approach has not been found to be effective in children. Fibrinogen (FIB) can cause increased blood viscosity, which typically occurs 6–15 days after Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection [13]. This corresponds to the time to embolism in children with MPP in a national study. In our study, all nine children had varying degrees of elevated D-dimer values, and seven had elevated fibrinogen (FIB), with a median time to embolism of approximately 2 weeks from the diagnosis of the MPP. This is consistent with the hypercoagulable state caused by FIB and the time to peak D-dimer levels in the body. Moreover, platelet (PLT) adhesion and aggregation are major mechanisms of PE, and the activation of PLT by the body's anti-inflammatory mechanism during MP infection, as well as the elevated PLT count in seven cases in our study, is consistent with the results reported by Li et al, which suggest that excessive PLT activation may also be a risk factor for PE. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are nonspecific markers of inflammation and tissue damage. Studies have shown that high levels of IL-6 and CRP can promote PE. In our study, IL-6 and CRP levels were elevated in all children, respectively. Although elevated levels of IL-6 and CRP can also be caused by various infectious diseases, our study suggests that PE should also be considered in children with these markers.

### Antithrombotic efficacy and bleeding risks of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia treatments [^114rj785]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Characteristics of patient cohort with VITT

Clinically, all patients with VITT presented with severe thrombotic events, thrombocytopenia, and elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen levels (Table 1), consistent with previously reported VITT cases. The IgG profile of the patient cohort with VITT was characterized using ELISA and SRA. ELISA data revealed elevated levels of anti-PF4 and anti-PF4/heparin IgG antibodies in all patients with VITT. The anti-PF4 ELISA pattern for VITT differed from that of HIT IgG (supplemental Figure 1 A). Positive SRA findings also confirmed the functional activity of VITT antibodies (supplemental Figure 1 B). The presence of low-dose heparin (0.1 U/mL) did not enhance platelet activation, whereas the addition of low-dose PF4 (10 μg/mL) resulted in a slight increase in VITT IgG-induced platelet activation. These data suggest that our VITT cohort had type 3 antibodiesthat are heparin-independent and anti-PF4 platelet-activating antibodies.

### Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115ecvYe]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 VTE diagnosis — D-dimer and other biomarkers: There are few studies evaluating D-dimer or other laboratory values to predict a diagnosis of VTE in patients with COVID-19, and the lack of systematic surveillance for DVT and PE has severely limited the ability to establish a meaningful context; two studies described biomarkers, including D-dimer, but did not describe systematic evaluation for suspected VTE, and one study reported only DVT rather than DVT and PE with a 94% negative predictive value for D-dimer cutoff of 1.0 μg/mL and correlations of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and lymphocyte count with increased risk of VTE, while another did not report on D-dimer levels but noted prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 seconds.

COVID-19 coagulopathy background — disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and prognostic markers: Severe cases can manifest as DIC with thrombotic propensity, and the presence of DIC has been found to be a strong predictor of mortality; in a retrospective review of 183 consecutive patients with COVID-19 at a single institution, 71.4% of nonsurvivors and 0.6% of survivors showed evidence of overt DIC. The literature also demonstrates that many patients have highly abnormal D-dimer levels, which were also prognostic.

### Hematological findings and complications of COVID-19 [^113f1NYB]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis. Lymphopenia may be considered as a cardinal laboratory finding, with prognostic potential. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP and IL-6 may help to identify cases with dismal prognosis and prompt intervention in order to improve outcomes. Biomarkers, such high serum procalcitonin and ferritin have also emerged as poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elevated D-Dimer levels are consistently reported, whereas their gradual increase during disease course is particularly associated with disease worsening. Other coagulation abnormalities such as PT and aPTT prolongation, fibrin degradation products increase, with severe thrombocytopenia lead to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which necessitates continuous vigilance and prompt intervention. So, COVID-19 infected patients, whether hospitalized or ambulatory, are at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and an early and prolonged pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is highly recommended. Last but not least, the need for assuring blood donations during the pandemic is also highlighted.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^117EYHD1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Coagulation.

A more comprehensive discussion of D -dimer and other coagulation-related laboratory studies can be found in a separate article in this series (reference). In brief, D -dimer levels can increase and the prothrombin times (PT) can be longer in COVID-19 patients; both predict severity of COVID-19. D -dimer levels are higher in patients who need critical care and in non-survivors. – Other coagulation tests also predict mortality, as does the presence of thrombocytopenia. The most recent International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis interim guidance document, at the time of revision (October 2020), suggests to monitor coagulopathy in patients with severe COVID-19, by measuring D -dimer levels, PT, and platelet counts every 2–3 daysto guide decisions on anticoagulant therapies.

Chemistry.

Higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, and creatinine have been found in COVID-19 patients, and all may have prognostic value. Chemistry abnormalities that seem most prognostic are LDH and ALT. In a clinical score developed for predicting, at hospital admission, which patients with COVID-19 may develop critical illness, LDH and direct bilirubin were among the 10 independent predictors of critical illness. Glucose, AST, LDH, urea, and creatinine levels are higher, and albumin levels are lower in non-survivors.

Heart enzymes.

Cardiac troponins may predict progression to severe COVID-19. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was higher in non-survivors. Troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels are higher in non-survivors. Acute cardiac injury, defined as an increase in troponin > 99th percentile of the upper reference limit, was found more often in non-survivors than survivors (60% versus 1%)and was seen more often in critically ill patients than those who did not need critical care (22% versus 2%). It remains uncertain whether higher levels were caused by cardiotoxic treatments.

Acute-phase proteins.

C-reactive protein may have prognostication value in COVID-19. C-reactive protein levels, with a median value of 47.6 (range 20.6–87.1) mg/L, are associated with disease severity, although in multiple regression analyses, CRP is not an independent predictor of death.

### Arterio-venous gradients of IL-6, plasma and serum VEGF and D-dimers in human cancer [^114T4Jzt]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

The circulating angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor-A, interleukin-6 and the fibrin D-dimer fragment were measured in the mesenteric vein, the uterine vein, as well as in peripheral venous and arterial samples in 21 randomly selected patients with operable colorectal, ovarian and cervical carcinoma. In addition, immunohistochemistry for vascular endothelial growth factor-A and interleukin-6 was performed on colorectal tumours of such patients. Serum and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor-A were not significantly elevated in the vein draining the tumours, despite tumour cell expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor-A is therefore not all tumour-derived. In contrast, serum interleukin-6 was highly elevated in the draining veins in agreement with expression of interleukin-6 in the cytoplasm of tumour cells. In the megakaryoblastic cell line MEG-01, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A was found to be regulated by interleukin-6. Thus, the higher platelet vascular endothelial growth factor-A load resulting in higher serum vascular endothelial growth factor levels in cancer patients may partly result from an interleukin-6 mediated up-regulation of the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A in the precursor of the platelet, i.e. the megakaryocyte. We also confirmed by immunohistochemistry that platelets adhere and aggregate on tumour endothelium. We propose that interleukin-6 indirectly promotes tumour angiogenesis through its up-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor-A load in platelets. In addition, the correlations found between peripheral venous interleukin-6 and peripheral venous fibrinogen and D-dimers levels, and the high D-dimer levels found in the draining vein of the tumour, in agreement with fibrin deposits found in the tumour stroma, suggest an important role for interleukin-6 in extra-vascular fibrinogen metabolism. Our results suggest a pivotal role for interleukin-6 in the intrinsic link between haemostasis and angiogenesis. This might be of importance in the development of anti-angiogenic agents based on interference with haemostasis.

### Coagulopathy and venous thromboembolic events following cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy [^1117tmsm]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coagulopathy after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is recognized but few details have been studied.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate changes in coagulation biomarkers and their predictive ability for venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Methods

Patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, from 2004 to 2014 were included in a prospective study of coagulation biomarkers. Prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, antithrombin, D-dimer, and platelets were sampled on postoperative days 1, 2, 5, and 10. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate predictive capacity for coagulation-related complications.

Results

Overall, 380 patients were included (214 females, mean age 56 years); 38 patients had a history of thromboembolism and 57 were active smokers. Mean perioperative blood loss was 1228 mL and 231 (61%) received perioperative blood transfusions. PT-INR and APTT were elevated directly after surgery but returned to normal levels on postoperative day 5. Conversely, fibrinogen, platelet count, D-dimer, and antithrombin increased by postoperative day 5 and continued to increase up to day 10. There were 23 radiologically verified cases of VTE within 6 months. The multivariate analysis identified a completeness of cytoreduction score of 2–3 (p = 0.047) and day 2 D-dimer (p = 0.0082) as independent risk factors for postoperative VTE.

Conclusion

Significant postoperative changes in coagulation biomarkers occur with dynamic changes over 10 days postoperatively. The incidence of symptomatic VTE was low. Residual tumor at completion of surgery and elevated D-dimer on day 2 were independent risk factors for postoperative VTE.

### Dabigatran etexilate in the treatment of localized intravascular coagulopathy associated with venous malformations [^114iq5Ce]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Venous malformations (VM) are congenital slow-flow vascular malformations. A common complication is localized intravascular coagulopathy (LIC), which results from chronic, localized, intraluminal activation and consumption of clotting factors and is characterized by elevated D-dimer and, in severe cases, decreased fibrinogen levels. Therapeutic options include anti-coagulation by Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) which has been reported to improve pain, decrease thrombosis, improve laboratory parameters and reduce hemorrhagic complications. However, the use of subcutaneous injections of LMWH has several limitations and the indications for therapy remain controversial.

Materials and Methods

We present the first small case series of 3 patients with VM-LIC in whom a long-term treatment by dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, was initiated in the setting of ambulatory hemostasis consultations.

Results

Clinically, drug tolerance was excellent in all 3 patients. Moderate hemorrhagic complaints occurred in 2 out of 3 patients but there was no thromboembolic event under dabigatran therapy. Dabigatran provided symptomatic relief on pain, swelling and heaviness feeling. Biologically, dabigatran treatment showed various modifications in D-dimers level but the fibrinogen level and platelet count remained unchanged.

Conclusion

In conclusion, dabigatran etexilate may provide a viable and more convenient alternative to LMWH in the long-term treatment of VM-LIC. The dose has to be tailored in each patient in function of the bleeding tendency and laboratory hemostasis parameters.

### The efficacy of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin for obstetric disseminated intravascular coagulation: a retrospective study [^1136jFX4]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) is a novel anti-coagulant agent that regulates the imbalanced coagulation system by reducing the excessive activation of thrombin. rhTM potentially reduces the morbidity and mortality in patients with sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, the efficacy of rhTM in obstetric DIC has not yet been established. We performed this study to examine whether the administration of rhTM was a potentially effective treatment for DIC induced by one or more underlying obstetric disorders.

Methods

This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted between January 2007 and February 2015 using the records of the Department of Obstetrics at the Perinatal Medical Center of TOYOTA Memorial Hospital, Aichi, Japan. The eligibility criteria were known or suspected obstetric DIC documented on the basis of clinical and laboratory data and association with one or more major underlying obstetric disorders. Baseline imbalance between patients with and without treatment of rhTM was adjusted using an inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity scores composed of the following independent variables: severe postpartum hemorrhage, placental abruption, and preeclampsia/eclampsia, including hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet syndrome, initial platelet counts, D-dimer levels, fibrinogen levels, and prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR). We evaluated laboratory changes and clinical outcomes in the early phase of obstetric DIC.

Results

In total, 66 of 4627 patients admitted to our department during the study period fulfilled the required criteria; of these, 37 and 29 patients were included in the rhTM and control group, respectively. After adjustment, treatment with rhTM was associated with significant improvements in platelet counts, D-dimer levels, fibrinogen levels, and PT-INR compared with the control group. The platelet concentrate transfusion volume was significantly lower in the rhTM treatment group (3.02 vs 6.03 units, P = 0.016). None of the adjusted group differences were statistically significant for all types of organ damage and failure.

Conclusion

rhTM administration was associated with clinical and laboratory improvement in patients with DIC caused by underlying obstetric conditions. Further clinical research is needed to clarify the optimal application of rhTM in each of the causative obstetric disorders.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anti-coagulants in painful venous malformations in children [^1118Tta1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In all patients, successful pain control, along with the resolution of functional impairment, was maintained with DOACs, without adverse effects. In patients with deep phlebectasias, for whom thromboembolic prevention is mandatory and requires maintaining D‐dimer levels within the normal range, the increased dosage of dabigatran did not lead to bleeding complications. We showed that increasing the dosage of dabigatran may correlate with better biological and clinical efficacy, while in the current literature, D‐dimer reduction appeared more variable with dabigatran than with LMWH; however, in those reports, dabigatran was mostly used at low dosages.

For patients 3–7, the treatment goal was to achieve pain relief, while persistently elevated D‐dimer levels, similar to those observed under LMWH, were tolerated as long as there was no pain or functional impairment. Therefore, a 10 mg/day dosage was chosen, lowered to 7.5 mg/day in younger patients with lower weight if it was enough to obtain pain relief. Patients 6 and 7 had the highest D‐dimer levels at baseline, with low fibrinogen and platelet count in Patient 7. Although less impressive, as D‐dimer levels remained significantly elevated, biological improvement (D‐dimer level lowering in Patient 6, platelet count and fibrinogen normalization in Patient 7) correlated with dramatic improvement in the clinical condition. The correlation between clinical and biological severity and the response to treatment was previously observed in a recent adult cohort.

Until now, no bleeding manifestations have been observed, confirming previous reports that in this context, DOACs, while improving the coagulopathy comparably to LMWH and fondaparinux, may introduce a lower risk for bleeding. However, none of our patients had invasive procedures while on DOACs, and the current recommended protocol is that children needing a surgical procedure should be switched to LMWH.

In conclusion, this small series of children with VMs and chronic intravascular coagulopathy showed that DOACs may achieve excellent pain control as well as thromboembolic prevention without adverse effects. Such results need to be confirmed in larger trials.

### Platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI-dimer recognizes fibrinogen and fibrin through their D-domains, contributing to platelet adhesion and activation during thrombus formation [^114b87Dr]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Assessing the role of GPVI‐dimer in platelets from a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT)

Because platelets contain far fewer GPVI‐dimers than integrin αIIbβ3, which may mask the subtler effects of GPVI‐dimer, we examined static adhesion and flow adhesion using blood from a GT patient, whose platelets were confirmed to have no αIIbβ3 but a normal GPVI level (Fig. 7 A).

Static adhesion of GT platelets: Washed GT platelets showed essentially no adhesion on fibrinogen or D‐fragment, but retained a low level of adhesion on pFibrin and D‐dimer (Fig. 7 B). mFab‐F (100 μg mL −1) further diminished the adhesion to pFibrin, suggesting that this low level of interaction involved GPVI‐dimer.

Confocal imaging showed that some GT platelets pre‐labelled with Alexa‐fluor 488‐conjugated 204‐11‐Fab (green) and post‐labelled with Alexa‐fluor 647‐conjugated anti‐GPIb (red) (Fig. 7 C) adhered to pFibrin fibers (Fig. 7 C, transmitted light image), but did not spread/aggregate like the normal platelets (post‐labelled with Alexa‐fluor 647‐conjugated anti‐αIIbβ3).

Under flow conditions, adhesion of GT platelets to D‐fragment, D‐dimer, fibrinogen and pFibrin was dramatically reduced, but platelet adhesion was still evident (Fig. 8 A). Quantitation of SA (Fig. 8 B) showed that GT platelets retain some ability to adhere to fibrinogen, pFibrin, D‐fragment and D‐dimer. Their SA on D‐fragment and D‐dimer was reduced by mFab‐F, suggesting GPVI‐dimer involvement in this adhesion. MTH for the GT platelets (Fig. 8 C) was very low, indicating little platelet activation had occurred. This suggests that the absence of αIIbβ3 does not abolish the interaction between GPVI and fibrinogen substrates, although it appears that its absence impairs the ability of platelets to activate on fibrinogen and fibrin.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^114fWovk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — low pretest probability evaluation uses the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) and D-dimer testing. In patients believed to be at low risk for PE, the PERC criteria should be applied. In those who meet all 8 PERC criteria, the risk for PE is lower than the risks of testing; do not order a plasma d-dimer test. Those who do not meet all of the criteria should be further stratified by using a plasma d-dimer test. A normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; do not order imaging studies. An elevated plasma D-dimer level should lead to imaging studies. The PERC items are Age < 50, Initial heart rate < 100 beats/min, Initial oxygen saturation > 94% on room air, No unilateral leg swelling, No hemoptysis, No surgery or trauma within 4 wk, No history of venous thromboembolism, and No estrogen use; the table notes that pretest probability with score of 0 is < 1%.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^111AEke3]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 ICU anticoagulation and D-dimer — For venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) whenever available, and although some clinicians advocate intermediate-dosing LMWH or UFH for adults with severe or critical COVID-19 there are no published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing conventional dosing to intermediate-dosing prophylaxis. It remains unclear whether therapeutic anticoagulation should be administered to COVID-19 patients without VTE, and a pilot RCT randomized 20 hospitalized mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer to receive either full-dose anticoagulation with enoxaparin or prophylactic-dose UFH or enoxaparin but was underpowered to detect meaningful differences. In a U.S. cohort of 3,334 hospitalized patients, 829 were admitted to the ICU; in this study, male sex and elevated D-dimer were the only variables significantly associated with VTE, and a D-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng/mL was associated with an HR of 32 (95% CI 17.2 to 61.9) for VTE. Although D-dimer levels were elevated in patients with and without VTE, median D-dimer was higher in pulmonary embolism cases (1,748 ng/mL; IQR 398 to 10,000) compared with those without VTE (414 ng/mL; IQR 268 to 768). Because different assays measure D-dimer with different diagnostic utility and a decision process based on D-dimer levels needs to be better studied before clinicians adopt empiric anticoagulation — especially since elevated D-dimer could also indicate bleeding — clinical evaluation is crucial before making decisions based on laboratory values. Considering the uncertainty in the absence of VTE, the panel issued a weak recommendation against the use of therapeutic anticoagulation outside clinical trials.

Remarks for low PTP pathways — in studies of suspected upper extremity DVT a dichotomized Constans score (where score ≤ 1 is unlikely and ≥ 2 is likely) was used; if the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required and a negative D-dimer rules out upper extremity DVT if a highly sensitive assay is used and the clinical assessment is that the patient has unlikely PTP; the strategy assumes optimal conditions and suboptimal D-dimer or duplex ultrasound results may require repeat testing; if clinical suspicion remains high after a negative initial duplex ultrasound, serial duplex ultrasound could be considered.

### Characteristics of renal pathology and coagulation function in IgA nephropathy and IgA vasculitis associated nephritis [^113Zwsb3]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

These outcomes are in line with the investigation carried out by Lv et al. who analysed data obtained from 809 paediatric patients with IgAVN and 236 paediatric patients with IgAN. Their findings revealed that IgAN patients exhibited more severe renal interstitial injury, fibrous crescents, and other chronic injury manifestations than IgAVN patients. Additionally, remission rate is a crucial indicator for evaluating the prognosis of IgAN and IgAVN. The results in our study indicate that the cumulative partial remission rate was lower in the IgAN group compared to the IgAVN group. This difference may be associated with poorer renal function and more severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in IgAN patients.

Coagulation dysfunction is an important non-immune factor in the progression of ESKD. Microvascular endothelial cells injury, activation of platelets, and released plasma coagulation factors can lead to diffuse coagulation in the renal microvasculature, then promotes kidney fibrosis. Study has also shown that heparin may reduce the risk of proteinuria in patients with IgAVN.

Plasma D-Dimers formation or elevation reflects activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. Study have shown that plasma D-Dimer was associated with microalbuminuria, and high levels of plasma D-Dimer were associated with the progression of IgAN. In addition, the elevated D-Dimers levels were significantly associated with renal involvement in IgAVN. The results in our study showed that the level of D-Dimers was significantly higher in IgAVN patients than in IgAN patients, which suggests that IgAVN is more active than IgAN.

As is well-known, fibrinogen plays an essential function in blood clotting, and in vivo study has confirmed its significant involvement in the promotion of kidney fibrosis. Fibrinogen deficiency protects mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction from interstitial damage, tubular disruption, collagen accumulation, and expression of α-smooth muscle actin in the obstructed kidney. In addition, study of Qin et al. has demonstrated that low albumin-to-fibrinogen (< 12.44) is an independent prognostic factor of poor renal prognosis in Chinese IgAN patients, and the glomerular fibrinogen deposition in IgAVN patients exhibit more severe glomerular damage. In our study, glomerular fibrinogen deposition was observed to be more severe in IgAVN despite no significant difference in plasma fibrinogen levels between the IgAN and IgAVN groups. Plasma FDPs, another crucial factor in the fibrinolytic system strongly linked to IgAVN disease activity, were found to be significantly greater in IgAVN patients compared to IgAN patients in our study.

### Thromboelastography profiles of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^116Ectc4]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The rate of thromboembolic events among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is high; however, there is no robust method to identify those at greatest risk. We reviewed thromboelastography studies in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 to characterize their coagulation states.

Design

Retrospective.

Setting

Tertiary ICU in New York City.

Patients

Sixty-four patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the ICU with thromboelastography performed.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Fifty percent of patients had a clotting index in the hypercoagulable range (clotting index > 3) (median 3.05). Reaction time and K values were below the lower limit of normal in 43.8% of the population consistent with a hypercoagulable profile. The median α angle and maximum amplitude (75.8° and 72.8 mm, respectively) were in the hypercoagulable range. The α angle was above reference range in 70.3% of patients indicative of rapid clot formation. Maximum amplitude, a factor of fibrinogen and platelet count and function, and a measure of clot strength was above reference range in 60.1% of patients. Thirty-one percent had thromboembolic events; thromboelastography parameters did not correlate with events in our cohort. Those with D-dimer values greater than 2,000 were more likely to have shorter reaction times compared with those with D-dimer levels less than or equal to 2,000 (4.8 vs 5.6 min; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

A large proportion of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 have hypercoagulable thromboelastography profiles with additional derangements related to fibrinogen and platelet function. As the majority of patients have an elevated thromboelastography maximum amplitude, a follow-up study evaluating platelet aggregation would be instructive.

### Patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review [^114DWvMh]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Alterations of coagulation in COVID‐19 patients

Several reports describe coagulation alterations in patients hospitalised with COVID‐19 infection 40, 43, 44, 45. In these reports, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were longer in COVID‐19‐infected vs. non‐infected individuals. In addition, more abnormal coagulation parameters were found in advanced disease states and in non‐survivors compared with survivors 40, 44, 45, together with elevated fibrinogen concentrations 43, 44. Markedly elevated D‐dimers were described as the most prominent characteristic, a finding interpreted as overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 44. A sub‐set of patients with the most severe COVID‐19 are prone to develop consumptive coagulopathy and a hypercoagulable state. Furthermore, the most severely affected COVID‐19 patients may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for respiratory (or cardiac) failure. This treatment can be life‐saving, but also transfusion‐intensive with anecdotal reports of frequent clotting within the ECMO circuits. As new insights are gained about the pathophysiology of these prothrombotic alterations in COVID‐19 patients, it will be important to adapt therapy accordingly 46. Early prehospital low‐dose aspirin or early in‐hospital low molecular weight heparin have been proposed as pre‐emptive treatment strategies. However, premature and unsubstantiated changes in therapeutic concepts should be avoided when based merely on anecdotal reports, as the consequences may be deleterious. Patients should be enrolled in ethically approved trials, and the results of these ongoing randomised trials should guide future therapeutic advances in treatment.

### Dimers of the platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI bind specifically to fibrin fibers during clot formation, but not to intact fibrinogen [^111xmiu8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI) has an independent role as a receptor for fibrin produced via the coagulation cascade. However, various reports of GPVI binding to immobilized fibrin(ogen) are not consistent. As a collagen receptor, GPVI-dimer is the functional form, but whether GPVI dimers or monomers bind to fibrin remains controversial. To resolve this, we analyzed GPVI binding to nascent fibrin clots, which more closely approximate physiological conditions.

Methods and Results

ELISA using biotinyl-fibrinogen immobilized on streptavidin-coated wells indicated that GPVI dimers do not bind intact fibrinogen. Clots were formed by adding thrombin to a mixture of near-plasma level of fibrinogen and recombinant GPVI ectodomain: GPVI dimer (GPVI-Fc 2 or Revacept) or monomer (GPVI-His: single chain of Revacept GPVI domain, with His tag). Clot-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. GPVI-dimer bound to noncrosslinked fibrin clots with classical one-site binding kinetics, with µM-level K D, and to crosslinked clots with higher affinity. Anti-GPVI-dimer (mFab-F) inhibited the binding. However, GPVI-His binding to either type of clot was nonsaturable and nearly linear, indicating very low affinity or nonspecific binding. In clots formed in the presence of platelets, clot-bound platelet-derived proteins were integrin αIIbβ3, present at high levels, and GPVI.

Conclusions

We conclude that dimeric GPVI is the receptor for fibrin, exhibiting a similar K D to those obtained for its binding to fibrinogen D-fragment and D-dimer, suggesting that fibrin(ogen)'s GPVI-binding site becomes exposed after fibrin formation or cleavage to fragment D. Analysis of platelets bound to fibrin clots indicates that platelet GPVI binds to fibrin fibers comprising the clot.

Thrombolytics (plasminogen activators) — alteplase can cause clinically significant fibrinogen depletion and platelet inhibition, with severe fibrinogen decreases after alteplase occurring in approximately 5% of stroke cases; in a controlled trial, 8 of 73 (11%) patients receiving 1.25 mg/kg alteplase over 3 h had fibrinogen fall to below 100 mg/dL, and hypofibrinogenemia may persist with levels decreased by 87% from baseline at 24 h; plasminogen activators produce breakdown of fibrinogen with elevated fibrin degradation products and can inhibit platelet function via cleavage of platelet GPIIIa and GPIb.

### The clinical significance of ultra-high D-dimer levels [^115BXMBZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL are encountered in a number of conditions other than venous thromboembolism (VTE). Recent studies have used plasma D-dimer levels as a prognostic indicator for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The implications of abnormal levels are less clear for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with a baseline elevation in plasma D-dimer levels. In the present study, we reviewed the occurrence of plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL and investigated the clinical significance of this finding before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

Inpatient records for a 4-year period were screened for laboratory results of plasma D-dimer levels > 5000 ng/mL. The patient data were reviewed for the clinical identifiers commonly associated with elevated plasma D-dimer levels, including VTE, cancer, sepsis, pneumonia, other infection, bleeding, and trauma. The patients were then categorized into groups stratified by the plasma D-dimer level to allow for comparisons between the various clinical diagnoses.

Results

A total of 671 patients were included in the present study. VTE was the most common diagnosis for patients with a plasma D-dimer level > 5000 ng/mL, followed by cancer and pneumonia. Multiple clinical diagnoses were present in 61% of the patients. No clear cause for the ultra-high plasma D-dimer level could be identified in 11.3% of the patients. Among the patients lacking a clinical diagnosis at discharge, mortality was 24% in the 5000- to 10,000-ng/mL group, 28.6% in the 10,000- to 15,000-ng/mL group, and 75% in the > 15,000-ng/mL group.

Conclusions

VTE, cancer, and pneumonia were frequently present when ultra-high plasma D-dimer levels were encountered, and mortality was high when the levels were > 15,000 ng/mL. The results from our study from a pre-COVID-19 patient population suggest that ultra-high plasma D-dimer levels indicate the presence of severe underlying disease. This should be considered when using the plasma D-dimer level as a screening tool or prognostic indicator for COVID-19 infection.

### Profound thrombocytopenia and dyspnea 11 Days after cardiac surgery [^116nmkL8]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the normal lactate argued against an overt "shock" state, the moderately elevated hepatic transaminases suggested that hemorrhagic pericarditis could have resulted in cardiovascular dysfunction and associated hepatic congestion. The coagulation testing suggested the possibility of DIC per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC criteria: platelet count < 50 × 10 9 /L (2 points) and greatly elevated‐dimer levels > 10 000 μg/mL FEU (3 points) totaling 5 points suggesting possible DIC. However, the PT and corresponding INR values were only minimally elevated, and the fibrinogen was greatly elevated, as expected in the proinflammatory postcardiac surgery context. Although the ISTH DIC score was possibly consistent with DIC, the concern was that the profound thrombocytopenia seemed more in keeping with a destructive (rather than consumptive) thrombocytopenia and, importantly, that the greatly elevated‐dimer could reflect resorption of blood (and fibrin) from the large (presumed) hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. Moreover, the complete absence of red cell fragments also argued against a diagnosis of severe DIC.

The hematologist calculated a low pretest probability for HIT per the 4Ts score: (a) T hrombocytopenia = 0 points (platelet count < 20 × 10 9 /L); (b) T iming of onset of thrombocytopenia = 2 points (onset between 5 and 10 days); (c) T hrombosis = 0 (no thrombosis); (d) o T her explanation for thrombocytopenia = 1 point (strong suspicion for destructive thrombocytopenia). Given the low 4Ts score (3 points) — and concern of hemorrhagic pericarditis — the decision was made to hold off on anticoagulation therapy.

To evaluate further explanations for destructive thrombocytopenia such as drug‐induced immune thrombocytopenia (D‐ITP), the hematologist focused on the recent initiation of new medications as well as the intraoperative platelet transfusions, which raised the possibility of posttransfusion purpura (PTP) triggered by the receipt of platelet alloantigen‐containing blood products in a patient previously sensitized through pregnancy or prior transfusion. Alloantibodies to human platelet antigen (HPA) — with concomitant reactivity against autologous platelet antigens — cause a profound destructive thrombocytopenia within 5–10 days of transfusion. Accordingly, the EMR and patient were queried for drugs implicated in D‐ITP, and further history was sought regarding previous pregnancies or remote transfusions.

### Clinical care pathway for the evaluation of patients with suspected VITT after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination [^112otMJn]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Three patients were diagnosed with VITT at 12, 14, and 17 days following the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Table 1). Their platelet counts,-dimer levels, and PF4-ELISA OD values were significantly different from those without VITT (Figure 2); there were no differences in INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen values (data not shown). One patient, after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, had thrombocytopenia, mildly elevated-dimer level, and positive PF4-ELISA and SRA results, but imaging was negative for thrombosis.

Table 1.
Patient characteristics with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination

Figure 2.
Distribution of platelet count,-dimer level, and ELISA optical density (OD) for patients with VITT compared with patients without VITT, with or without thrombosis. As shown in (A), there is a significant difference in the median platelet count between the 3 groups. Similarly, median-dimer levels (B) and median ELISA OD values (C) showed significant differences across the 3 groups. As shown in the figure, 23 patients in the non-VITT group had thrombotic events. Of these 23 patients, 3 had-dimer levels ≥ 2.0 mg/L FEU and platelets < 150 000/mm 3. These 3 patients had negative PF4-ELISA and SRA results. Ten of the 23 patients with thrombosis had-dimer ≥ 2.0 mg/L FEU, but their platelet counts were normal. These patients also had negative PF4-ELISA and SRA results. The other 10 patients in the non-VITT with thrombosis group had-dimer < 2.0 mg/L FEU and had normal platelet counts. These patients had negative PF4-ELISA results, but SRA was not performed due to a low likelihood for VITT (according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline). In (C), 1 patient had a positive PF4-ELISA (OD, 1.98) confirmed by positive SRA (see Table 1).

Coagulation assessment for procedures in cirrhosis — several common procedures do not routinely require coagulation assessment before performance, including ascites and therapeutic paracentesis, common forms of thoracentesis, upper endoscopy to screen for and band esophageal varices, and diagnostic (but not therapeutic) colonoscopy; paracentesis and thoracentesis are supported as low risk even with combined elevation in INR and thrombocytopenia so the risks of transfusion greatly outweigh the potential benefit; exceptions include pharmacologically anticoagulated and renal failure patients; when testing is indicated, platelet count and fibrinogen level are the standard of care assessment.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^117DpAmT]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — transfusion thresholds and blood product selection in cirrhosis — blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry transfusion risks; when managing active bleeding or high-risk procedures, thresholds that may optimize clot formation are hematocrit > 25%, platelet count > 50,000, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL, and commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence; thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels; the utility of fresh frozen plasma is limited by large volume requirements and other drawbacks, and although the 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate offers a low-volume option, dosage is partly based on international normalized ratio (problematic in cirrhosis) and experience in liver disease is limited.

### High plasma fibrinogen level is associated with poor clinical outcome in DIC patients [^114uj4jC]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

We measured the plasma level of fibrinogen in 560 patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and evaluated its relationship with outcome and with other hemostatic markers. Forty-seven percent of patients had > 200 mg/dL of plasma fibrinogen and 24% had < 100 mg/dl of plasma fibrinogen, suggesting that plasma fibrinogen level is not a sensitive marker for DIC. In our analysis of outcome and plasma fibrinogen levels, the rate of death was high in leukemia/lymphoma patients with high fibrinogen concentration, but no significant difference in outcome was observed in relation to plasma fibrinogen concentration in non-leukemia/lymphoma patients with DIC. Among patients with leukemia/lymphoma, the frequency of organ failure was markedly high in patients with high plasma levels of fibrinogen. Among patients without leukemia/lymphoma, the frequency of organ failure increased concomitantly with the increase in plasma fibrinogen levels. The international normalized ratio was significantly increased in leukemia/lymphoma patients with low fibrinogen. FDP levels were slightly increased in patients with low fibrinogen. Platelet count was significantly low in patients without leukemia/lymphoma with high fibrinogen. DIC score increased concomitantly with the reduction in plasma fibrinogen levels. Plasma levels of thrombomodulin and tissue factor were significantly high in patients with high fibrinogen levels. Plasma levels of antiplasmin and plasminogen were significantly decreased in patients with low fibrinogen. Plasma levels of plasmin plasmin-inhibitor complex and tissue type plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex (PAI-I) were significantly higher in patients with low fibrinogen than in those with high fibrinogen. Plasma levels of PAI-I and IL-6 were significantly higher in patients with high fibrinogen than in those with low fibrinogen. Patients with high fibrinogen levels showed less activation of secondary fibrinolysis, which might explain the occurrence of organ failure and poor outcome.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation. British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^1172MVUu]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should encompass both clinical and laboratory information. The International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC scoring system provides objective measurement of DIC. Where DIC is present the scoring system correlates with key clinical observations and outcomes. It is important to repeat the tests to monitor the dynamically changing scenario based on laboratory results and clinical observations. The cornerstone of the treatment of DIC is treatment of the underlying condition. Transfusion of platelets or plasma (components) in patients with DIC should not primarily be based on laboratory results and should in general be reserved for patients who present with bleeding. In patients with DIC and bleeding or at high risk of bleeding (e.g. postoperative patients or patients due to undergo an invasive procedure) and a platelet count of < 50 x 10(9)/l transfusion of platelets should be considered. In non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not given unless it is perceived that there is a high risk of bleeding. In bleeding patients with DIC and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may be useful. It should not be instituted based on laboratory tests alone but should be considered in those with active bleeding and in those requiring an invasive procedure. There is no evidence that infusion of plasma stimulates the ongoing activation of coagulation. If transfusion of FFP is not possible in patients with bleeding because of fluid overload, consider using factor concentrates such as prothrombin complex concentrate, recognising that these will only partially correct the defect because they contain only selected factors, whereas in DIC there is a global deficiency of coagulation factors. Severe hypofibrinogenaemia (< 1 g/l) that persists despite FFP replacement may be treated with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate. In cases of DIC where thrombosis predominates, such as arterial or venous thromboembolism, severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia or vascular skin infarction, therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered. In these patients where there is perceived to be a co-existing high risk of bleeding there may be benefits in using continuous infusion unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its short half-life and reversibility. Weight adjusted doses (e.g. 10 mu/kg/h) may be used without the intention of prolonging the APTT ratio to 1.5–2.5 times the control. Monitoring the APTT in these cases may be complicated and clinical observation for signs of bleeding is important. In critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism with prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin is recommended. Consider treating patients with severe sepsis and DIC with recombinant human activated protein C (continuous infusion, 24 microg/kg/h for 4 d). Patients at high risk of bleeding should not be given recombinant human activated protein C. Current manufacturers guidance advises against using this product in patients with platelet counts of < 30 x 10(9)/l. In the event of invasive procedures, administration of recombinant human activated protein C should be discontinued shortly before the intervention (elimination half-life approximately 20 min) and may be resumed a few hours later, dependent on the clinical situation. In the absence of further prospective evidence from randomised controlled trials confirming a beneficial effect of antithrombin concentrate on clinically relevant endpoints in patients with DIC and not receiving heparin, administration of antithrombin cannot be recommended. In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents. Patients with DIC that is characterised by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state and who present with severe bleeding could be treated with lysine analogues, such as tranexamic acid (e.g. 1 g every 8 h).

### Prothrombotic state of patients with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion [^113i4gfb]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for women affected by recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA).

Methods

The present prospective observational study included women with RSA (≥ 2 previous spontaneous abortions) and those without a history of RSA attending Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai, China, between March 2011 and March 2014. D-dimer levels, auto-antibodies, and platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were monitored before pregnancy. Women with unexplained RSA and increased platelet aggregation received low-dose aspirin, and those with elevated D-dimer levels (> 0.75 μg/mL) received LMWH. Platelet aggregation in response to AA and ADP, and D-dimer levels were monitored during pregnancy.

Results

Among 517 participants with RSA, 325 had unexplained RSA. Compared with 63 control patients, those with unexplained RSA and two, three, four, or at least five previous spontaneous abortions had increased platelet aggregation in response to AA (P < 0.05 for all comparisons) but not to ADP. Among 37 women with unexplained RSA who became pregnant, aspirin reduced platelet aggregation in response to AA (P < 0.001). LMWH reduced D-dimer levels during pregnancy (P < 0.001). Among 37 women with unexplained RSA who became pregnant and completed the study, 33 (89.2%) had a live birth.

Conclusion

Aspirin and LMWH maintained a lower thrombotic state and led to a high live birth rate among patients with unexplained RSA.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^116AffBy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected acute PE — factors promoting overuse of imaging include that "pregnancy itself does not confer a greater risk for PE", physicians may feel compelled to "rule out the condition even if its likelihood is extremely low" and may prefer dichotomous tests "such as CT", while "the fear of litigation" may drive imaging; patient preferences and limited communication can increase testing, whereas such communication "has also been found to be associated with less use of diagnostic testing"; system factors include the growth in availability and use of CT in emergency departments and after-hours remote radiology, and "supply-sensitive care" whereby technology availability is linked to use and "may also promote overuse"; practice gaps include that many low- or intermediate-risk patients "either have no plasma D- dimer value obtained or go on to have CT despite normal D- dimer levels", and some with elevated d-dimer do not have follow-up CT, "contrary to evidence-based guidelines".

### Risk factors for thromboembolism and pulmonary artery hypertension following splenectomy in children with hereditary spherocytosis [^113jtY3h]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The aim was to study risk-factors for vascular thrombosis and incidence of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in splenectomized children with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) at a single center.

Procedure

Pre- and post-splenectomy hemoglobin and platelet counts were recorded. Post-splenectomy lipid-profile, fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP and anti-coagulant-protein levels were compared to established controls. Echo-Doppler was performed for PAH.

Results

Twenty-six children with HS had undergone splenectomy; the mean age at surgery was 7.9 ± 3.7 years. Nineteen of the 26 were prospectively investigated at a median duration of 4.5 years (range: 4 months to 19 years) following splenectomy. Thrombocytosis was observed in 19 (73%), whereas no patient had erythrocytosis at the last follow-up visit. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels were not deranged (P ≥ 0.3). Mean CRP levels (males: 2.8 ± 0.5; females: 2.1 ± 0.5 mg/L) were significantly higher than described for normal children (P < 0.001). Six (23%) patients had a positive D-dimer assay. Protein S, anti-thrombin-III and fibrinogen were in range. A single patient had a borderline low protein C activity. Lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibody assays were negative. The mean tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) was 1.8 ± 0.55 meter per second (range: 0–2.4). None had a TRJV ≥ 2.5 meter per second to suggest PAH.

Conclusions

There was no evidence of PAH, dyslipidemia, elevation of fibrinogen or a reduction in anti-coagulant proteins, at a median follow-up duration of 4.5 years following splenectomy in children with HS. However, elevated CRP level (42%), persistent thrombocytosis (73%) and elevated D-dimer levels (23%) were observed. These have been recognized as risk factors for cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease.

### D-dimer level is associated with the severity of COVID-19 [^1135G5h3]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abnormal coagulation function has been demonstrated to be involved in the disease progression of COVID-19. However, the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 is not clear. The study was aimed to investigate the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 based on a cohort study and meta-analysis.

Materials and Methods

Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission to Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were collected and analyzed, and coagulation function parameters were described and compared between patients with severe infection and those with non-severe infection. Cohort studies reporting risk estimates for the D-dimer and severity of COVID-19 association were searched and included to perform a meta-analysis.

Results

In our cohort study, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit dysregulated coagulation function, and a significantly higher D-dimer level (median 1.8 μg/ml [interquartile range 0.9–4.6] vs 0.5 [0.3–1.1], p < 0.001) was found in severe cases than the mild ones, on admission. In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies (including the current study), patients with severe disease had an increase in mean D-dimer value by 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.31, p < 0.001) μg/ml compared to those with non-severe disease, and odds of severe infection was associated with D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml (odds ratio = 5.78, 95% confidence interval, 2.16–15.44, p < 0.001) on admission.

Conclusions

Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher level of D-dimer than those with non-severe disease, and D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml is associated with severe infection in patients with COVID-19.

### Dynamic changes of D-dimer and neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio as prognostic biomarkers in COVID-19 [^111riPds]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

We found that in the deceased patients, peak D-Dimer and NLR were higher than the initial tests. The dynamic changes of D-Dimer and NLR in survival group were statistically significant compared with deceased patients, and the value in deceased patients was higher than those in survival group. Additionally, Peak D-Dimer value was significantly correlated with hospitalization days and PCT rather than initial D-Dimer. We also identified the optimal cut-off points of initial and peak D-Dimer for defining the patients with high risk of death. If the initial D-Dimer of patients was higher than 0.73 mg/L, or the peak D-Dimer increased was higher than 3.78 mg/L, patients could be considered of high risk of death and require further intensive and immediate treatments to prevent a devastating outcome. By using the Cox regression analysis, we found that the peak value of D-Dimer, rather than the initial D-Dimer, was the risk factor of the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Patients with higher peak D-Dimer value tended to have a higher risk of death. High D-Dimer is likely to be associated with persistent clotting disorders, microthrombotic formation, pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial infarction in long-stay or death patients, which may cause refractory hypoxemia, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation or death.

### New marker of platelet activation, SCUBE1, is elevated in hypertensive patients [^117Sei4g]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is associated with an increase in platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction and leads to a tendency to cardiovascular events (CVEs). Signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 1 (SCUBE1) is a novel platelet activation marker. There are currently no studies showing the level of SCUBE1 in hypertensive patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of SCUBE1 in this patient group and to investigate the parameters affecting that level.

Methods

Forty-five newly diagnosed, untreated, stage 1 hypertensive patients and 21 healthy individuals were included. Blood specimens were collected to determine SCUBE1, soluble CD40 ligand, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, D dimer, hemogram, lipid parameters, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid levels. The relation between SCUBE1 level and demographic data and biochemical parameters was then investigated.

Results

SCUBE1 and sCD40L levels obtained from plasma specimens from the hypertensive group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.001; P < 0.05, respectively). Hypertensive group blood pressure (BP) values and uric acid, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were also statistically higher than those of the control group. Parameters affecting SCUBE1 levels were systolic and diastolic BP, sCD40L, lipid parameters, and uric acid levels.

Conclusions

We show elevated levels of SCUBE1, a novel platelet activation marker, in primary hypertensive patients. We think that, when supported by further clinical studies, this newly described marker may be useful in the monitoring of CVEs in this patient group, in which platelet activation is known to be associated with such events.

Hemostasis and coagulation in perioperative cirrhosis — The international normalized ratio (INR) is not predictive of bleeding in cirrhosis and "prophylactic" fresh frozen plasma is "not recommended"; studies indicate platelet counts "above 50,000/μL are adequate to allow clot formation", so prophylactic platelet transfusions to higher levels are "unlikely to be beneficial". For thrombocytopenia, "Only avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are approved" and were "effective in raising platelet counts above 50,000/μL", but "rates of bleeding events… were equivalent" to placebo and "thrombotic events have occurred", so they should be used "with caution", and it "would seem reasonable to consider their use" before elective high-risk procedures when baseline platelets are "less than 50,000/μL". Regarding fibrinogen, low levels are linked to bleeding and "levels < 100 mg/dL are associated with a risk of inhibiting clot formation"; "Fibrinogen can be replaced with low-volume cryoprecipitate", and "it seems physiologically reasonable to replete fibrinogen… before high-risk surgical procedures". If available, "viscoelastic testing… should be considered before and during surgical procedures" to guide transfusion strategy.

### Coagulation parameters during the course of severe postpartum hemorrhage: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^113q363L]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

We describe the pattern of change in coagulation parameters during the course of severe postpartum hemorrhage in a retrospective cohort study among 1312 women experiencing severe postpartum hemorrhage necessitating blood transfusion. Levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) per categorized volume of blood loss during severe postpartum hemorrhage were described and compared between women with and without the composite adverse outcome. Need for surgical intervention, severe acute maternal morbidity, and maternal mortality were jointly considered the composite adverse outcome. Of the 1312 women, 463 (35%) developed the composite adverse outcome. The incidence of a fibrinogen level < 2 g/L was 26% (342 per 1312). Low fibrinogen and prolonged aPTT during the first 2 L of hemorrhage were associated with a subsequent composite adverse outcome; median fibrinogen and aPTT among women with and without the composite end point after 1.5 to 2 L of hemorrhage were 1.5 g/L (interquartile range [IQR], 1.0–1.9) vs 2.7 g/L (IQR, 1.9–3.4) and 39 s (IQR, 30–47) vs 32 s (IQR, 28–36), respectively. PT and platelet count as assessed during the first 2 L of hemorrhage were not associated with morbidity or mortality. Our results suggest that detection of low levels of fibrinogen and elevated aPTT levels during early postpartum hemorrhage can contribute to the identification of women that may benefit from targeted hemostatic treatment. Essential in this identification process is the moment of reaching a level of fibrinogen of < 2 g/L during the course of postpartum hemorrhage.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT04421027) of hospitalized adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared treatment with baricitinib 4mg once daily (n = 764) with placebo (n = 761) for 14 days or hospital discharge, whichever came first. Patients could remain on background standard of care, as defined per local guidelines, including antimalarials, antivirals, corticosteroids, and/or azithromycin. In this study prophylaxis for venous thromboembolic event (VTE) was required for all patients unless contraindicated.

The most frequently used therapies at baseline were:

### Concizumab (Alhemo) [^116VTvo1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Thromboembolic Events

Alhemo may cause thromboembolic events. Venous and arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 1.9% of patients (6/320) in Alhemo clinical trials. These cases occurred in patients with multiple risk factors for thromboembolism, including the use of high doses or prolonged treatment with factor product or bypassing agent (2 of 6 patients).

Risk factors for thromboembolism may include the use of high and/or frequent doses of breakthrough bleed treatments (factor products or bypassing agents) or conditions in which tissue factor is overexpressed (e.g., atherosclerotic disease, crush injury, cancer, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic microangiopathy, or septicemia).

Inform Alhemo treated patients of signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events. Monitor patients for thromboembolic events. In case of suspicion of thromboembolic events, discontinue Alhemo and initiate further investigations and management strategies.

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Alhemo can cause hypersensitivity reaction, including serious cases. Alhemo is contraindicated in patients with a history of known serious hypersensitivity to Alhemo or its components or the inactive ingredients. Hypersensitivity reactions including erythema, rash, pruritus, and abdominal pain have occurred in Alhemo treated patients. One patient (less than 1% of patients treated in the clinical studies) experienced anaphylaxis which resolved after treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Instruct patients of the signs of acute hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider for mild reactions and to seek urgent medical attention for moderate to severe reactions. Discontinue Alhemo if severe hypersensitivity symptoms occur and initiate medical management.

5.3 Increased Laboratory Values of Fibrin D-dimer and Prothrombin Fragment 1.2

Alhemo can cause increased levels of fibrin D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1.2. Increased levels of fibrin D-dimer and increased levels of prothrombin fragment 1.2 were seen in 29 (9.1%) and 26 (8.1%) of patients, respectively. The plasma concentration of concizumab-mtci is positively correlated with fibrin D-dimer and prothrombin fragments 1.2 indicating a hemostatic effect of concizumab-mtci. For patients taking Alhemo, these coagulation biomarkers may not be reliable predictive markers for clinical decision-making with suspicion of thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^1173i9Ua]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Cirrhosis and ACLF — coagulation assessment and venous thromboembolism (VTE) management: INR, although strongly linked with liver function in the absence of vitamin K deficiency, does not measure coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, whereas thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are viscoelastic tests that are more physiologic than standard testing. Normal TEG or ROTEM measurements in compensated or decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF can avoid blood product transfusion for procedures even with elevated INR, and TEG-guided assessment decreases transfusions without changing rebleeding risk. When TEG/ROTEM are unavailable, fibrinogen and platelet levels should be evaluated, and no data support prophylactic transfusions in the absence of bleeding or need for invasive procedures. In patients with cirrhosis without ACLF, a rebalancing in coagulation occurs but hypercoagulability can be found; one cannot justify therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) chronically without a thrombus, whereas full-dose anticoagulation should be used for acute thromboembolic events, especially symptomatic acute portal vein thrombosis in the absence of contraindications. Hospitalized cirrhotic patients are at higher VTE risk than noncirrhhotics; pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis has not been shown to increase bleeding overall, but patients with recent bleeding and significant thrombocytopenia (platelets ≤ 50 × 10^9/L) are not optimal candidates for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis.

### Myocardial infarction… [^114HHTR7]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

A myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops in one of the arteries of the heart, causing infarction to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is retrosternal chest pain or discomfort that classically radiates to the left shoulder, arm, or jaw. The pain may occasionally feel like heartburn. This is the dangerous type of acute coronary syndrome. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, feeling tired, and decreased level of consciousness. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often present without chest pain and instead have neck pain, arm pain or feel tired. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Treatment of an MI is time-critical.

Aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected MI. Nitroglycerin or opioids may be used to help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen is recommended in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath. In a STEMI, treatments attempt to restore blood flow to the heart and include percutaneous coronary intervention, where the arteries are pushed open and may be stented, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications. Unlike the other type of acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, a myocardial infarction occurs when there is cell death, which can be estimated by measuring a blood test for biomarkers. When there is evidence of an MI, it may be classified as an ST elevation myocardial infarction or Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction based on the results of an ECG. Similarly, chest pain similar to a previous heart attack is also suggestive.

The pain associated with MI is usually diffuse, does not change with position, and lasts for more than 20 minutes. It might be described as pressure, tightness, knifelike, tearing, burning sensation. Other Chest pain may be accompanied by sweating, nausea or vomiting, and fainting, and these symptoms may also occur without any pain at all. Dizziness or lightheadedness is common and occurs due to reduction in oxygen and blood to the brain. In females, the most common symptoms of myocardial infarction include shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue. Females are more likely to have unusual or unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting as symptoms. Females having heart attacks are more likely to have palpitations, back pain, labored breath, vomiting, and left arm pain than males, although the studies showing these differences had high variability.

Females are less likely to report chest pain during a heart attack and more likely to report nausea, jaw pain, neck pain, cough, and fatigue, although these findings are inconsistent across studies. Females with heart attacks also had more indigestion, dizziness, loss of appetite, and loss of consciousness. Shortness of breath is a common, and sometimes the only symptom, occurring when damage to the heart limits the output of the left ventricle, with breathlessness arising either from low oxygen in the blood or pulmonary edema. Other less common symptoms include weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and abnormalities in heart rate or blood pressure. These symptoms are likely induced by a massive surge of catecholamines from the sympathetic nervous system, which occurs in response to pain and, where present, low blood pressure.

### Shortness of breath [^115EZ46u]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Causes While shortness of breath is generally caused by disorders of the cardiac or respiratory system, others such as the neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, gastrointestinal system, hematologic, and psychiatric systems may be the cause. DiagnosisPro, an online medical expert system, listed 497 distinct causes in October 2010. The most common cardiovascular causes are myocardial infarction and heart failure, while common pulmonary causes include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia. On a pathophysiological basis, the causes can be divided into increased awareness of normal breathing such as during an anxiety attack, an increase in the work of breathing, and an abnormality in the ventilatory or respiratory system.

Ischemic strokes, hemorrhages, tumors, infections, seizures, and traumas at the brain stem can also cause shortness of breath, making them the only neurological causes of shortness of breath. The tempo of onset and the duration of dyspnea are useful in knowing the etiology of dyspnea. Acute shortness of breath is usually connected with sudden physiological changes, such as laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax. Patients with COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a mild onset and gradual progression of dyspnea on exertion, punctuated by acute exacerbations of shortness of breath. Acute coronary syndrome Acute coronary syndrome frequently presents with retrosternal chest discomfort and difficulty catching the breath. It however may atypically present with shortness of breath alone. Risk factors include old age, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

An electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes are important both for diagnosis and directing treatment. Treatment involves measures to decrease the oxygen requirement of the heart and efforts to increase blood flow. Congestive heart failure Congestive heart failure frequently presents with shortness of breath with exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. It affects between 1 and 2% of the general United States population and occurs in 10% of those over 65 years old. Risk factors for acute decompensation include high dietary salt intake, medication noncompliance, cardiac ischemia, abnormal heart rhythms, kidney failure, pulmonary emboli, hypertension, and infections. Treatment efforts are directed toward decreasing lung congestion. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, most commonly emphysema or chronic bronchitis, frequently have chronic shortness of breath and a chronic productive cough.

An acute exacerbation presents with increased shortness of breath and sputum production. COPD is a risk factor for pneumonia; thus this condition should be ruled out. In an acute exacerbation treatment is with a combination of anticholinergics, beta~2~-adrenoceptor agonists, steroids and possibly positive pressure ventilation. Asthma Asthma is the most common reason for presenting to the emergency room with shortness of breath. It is the most common lung disease in both developing and developed countries affecting about 5% of the population. Other symptoms include wheezing, tightness in the chest, and a nonproductive cough. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for children; however, these drugs can reduce the growth rate. Acute symptoms are treated with short-acting bronchodilators. Pneumonia The symptoms of pneumonia are fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. Inspiratory crackles may be heard on exam.

### Sepsis… [^113ArTSY]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

This initial stage of sepsis is followed by dysregulation of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever. Risk factors include being very young or old, a weakened immune system from conditions such as cancer or diabetes, major trauma, and burns. A shortened sequential organ failure assessment score, known as the quick SOFA score, has replaced the SIRS system of diagnosis. qSOFA criteria for sepsis include at least two of the following three: increased breathing rate, change in the level of consciousness, and low blood pressure.

Sepsis requires immediate treatment with intravenous fluids and antimicrobial medications. Ongoing care and stabilization often continues in an intensive care unit. If an adequate trial of fluid replacement is not enough to maintain blood pressure, then the use of medications that raise blood pressure becomes necessary. Mechanical ventilation and dialysis may be needed to support the function of the lungs and kidneys, respectively. Signs and symptoms In addition to symptoms related to the actual cause, people with sepsis may have a fever, low body temperature, rapid breathing, a fast heart rate, confusion, and edema. Early signs include a rapid heart rate, decreased urination, and high blood sugar.

Signs of established sepsis include confusion, metabolic acidosis, low blood pressure due to decreased systemic vascular resistance, higher cardiac output, and disorders in blood-clotting that may lead to organ failure. Fever is the most common presenting symptom in sepsis, but fever may be absent in some people, such as the elderly or those who are immunocompromised. The drop in blood pressure seen in sepsis can cause lightheadedness and is part of the criteria for septic shock. Oxidative stress is observed in septic shock, with circulating levels of copper and vitamin C being decreased. Diastolic blood pressure falls during the early stages of sepsis, causing a widening/increasing of pulse pressure, which is the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures.

If sepsis becomes severe and hemodynamic compromise advances, the systolic pressure also decreases, causing a narrowing/decreasing of pulse pressure. A pulse pressure of over 70 mmHg in patients with sepsis is correlated with an increased chance of survival. A widened pulse pressure is also correlated with an increased chance that someone with sepsis will benefit from and respond to IV fluids. Within six hours, if blood pressure remains low despite initial fluid resuscitation of 30 mL/kg, or if initial lactate is ≥ four mmol/L, central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation should be measured. Lactate should be re-measured if the initial lactate was elevated. Evidence for point of care lactate measurement over usual methods of measurement, however, is poor.

### Pulmonary embolism [^116GX9uU]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream. Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath, chest pain particularly upon breathing in, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present, such as a red, warm, swollen, and painful leg. Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, and sometimes a mild fever. Severe cases can lead to passing out, abnormally low blood pressure, obstructive shock, and sudden death. PE usually results from a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung. The risk of blood clots is increased by advanced age, cancer, prolonged bed rest and immobilization, smoking, stroke, long-haul travel over 4 hours, certain genetic conditions, estrogen-based medication, pregnancy, obesity, trauma or bone fracture, and after some types of surgery.

A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air, fat, or amniotic fluid. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results. If the risk is low, a blood test known as a D-dimer may rule out the condition. Otherwise, a CT pulmonary angiography, lung ventilation/perfusion scan, or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis. Together, deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism. The strain on the right ventricle may be detected as a left parasternal heave, a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound, or raised jugular venous pressure. A low-grade fever may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction. PEs are sometimes described as massive, submassive, and nonmassive depending on the clinical signs and symptoms. Although the exact definitions of these are unclear, an accepted definition of massive PE is one in which there is hemodynamic instability.

This is a cause of obstructive shock, which presents as sustained low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, or pulselessness. Underlying causes After a first PE, the search for secondary causes is usually brief. Only when a second PE occurs, and especially when this happens while still under anticoagulant therapy, a further search for underlying conditions is undertaken. This will include testing for Factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C and S and antithrombin levels, and later prothrombin mutation, MTHFR mutation, Factor VIII concentration and rarer inherited coagulation abnormalities. Diagnosis To diagnose a pulmonary embolism, a review of clinical criteria to determine the need for testing is recommended.

In those who have low risk, age less than 50, heart rate less than 100 beats per minute, oxygen level more than 94% on room air, and no leg swelling, coughing up of blood, surgery or trauma in the last four weeks, previous blood clots, or estrogen use, further testing is not typically needed. If there are concerns this is followed by testing to determine a likelihood of being able to confirm a diagnosis by imaging, followed by imaging if other tests have shown that there is a likelihood of a PE diagnosis. The diagnosis of PE is based primarily on validated clinical criteria combined with selective testing because the typical clinical presentation cannot be definitively differentiated from other causes of chest pain and shortness of breath. The decision to perform medical imaging is based on clinical reasoning, that is the medical history, symptoms, and findings on physical examination, followed by an assessment of clinical probability.
