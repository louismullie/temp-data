## Question

Failure to thrive infants

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing failure to thrive in infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining failure to thrive and the best diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the etiologic framework and how to distinguish non-organic from organic causes. Next, I will review the initial evaluation, including history, exam, and when to test. After that, I need to outline management principles, including nutrition for catch-up growth and when to use tube feeding. Finally, I should consider red flags, special populations, and long-term outcomes, and close with a concise algorithm and key takeaways anchored to current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic thresholds, because misclassification is common and affects both over- and underdiagnosis. Contemporary guidance favors "growth faltering" and z-score–based criteria rather than fixed percentiles; a practical trigger is a fall in weight-for-age z score of at least 1.0, with attention to centile crossings that vary by birthweight strata, and I should remember to exclude the first 2 weeks of life when physiologic weight loss is expected [^116NQgBh] [^116SMKUe]. Wait, let me verify the percentile-based legacy definitions; historically, weight below the 5th percentile or crossing two major percentile lines has been used, but these have low positive predictive value and poor concordance across criteria, so I should not rely on a single cutoff without trajectory context [^114HdVfm] [^112KQfhv]. I should also confirm growth chart choice: WHO charts are preferred for children under 2 years, and switching from CDC to WHO curves can shift FTT incidence in younger versus older infants, reinforcing the need to interpret growth in clinical context rather than by a single metric [^116NQgBh] [^116YfPcX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I organize the framework. The three broad buckets are inadequate intake, malabsorption or maldigestion, and increased caloric requirements; among these, inadequate intake is the most common in infants, often due to feeding difficulties, behavioral issues, or psychosocial stressors, whereas organic disease accounts for a minority but must be actively considered when red flags are present [^116NQgBh] [^114HdVfm]. I should double-check that this distribution aligns with hospital cohorts; indeed, recent data show insufficient intake dominates, with organic disease comprising about 20% and mixed or unknown etiologies in the remainder, and many organic diagnoses, especially genetic disorders, are missed on initial admission, underscoring the need for structured follow-up and targeted testing when indicated [^111cMfpZ].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation, and I need to ensure I prioritize history and observation over testing. A meticulous feeding history, 24–48 hour intake diary, and direct observation of feeding are the most informative steps; I should ask about breastfeeding technique and supply, formula preparation, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, and family stressors, and I should observe latch, suck, swallow, and breathing coordination during feeds [^116NQgBh] [^114HdVfm]. On exam, I will look for acute illness, dysmorphic features, cardiac or respiratory signs, and signs of neglect, and I should plot accurate measurements on WHO charts to calculate z-scores and assess velocity; routine labs are not recommended unless the history or exam suggests organic disease or the child fails to respond to initial nutritional intervention [^116NQgBh] [^114HdVfm]. But wait, what if I suspect an anatomic airway issue? In infants with respiratory symptoms and FTT, I should consider vallecular cysts or other airway anomalies and involve ENT early, as these are reversible causes of growth failure [^1152cPTw].

> I will now examine when to test, and I should confirm a tiered approach. Basic screening is reasonable if malnutrition is severe or if initial management fails; a CBC, electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, TSH, and urinalysis can uncover anemia, renal disease, endocrine issues, or occult infection, while targeted testing is guided by symptoms such as stool studies for fat or reducing substances, celiac serology in older infants, sweat testing for cystic fibrosis when indicated despite newborn screening, and genetic testing when dysmorphism or developmental concerns arise [^116NQgBh] [^114HdVfm]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions; even with a negative newborn screen, cystic fibrosis can present with FTT and malabsorption, so clinical suspicion warrants sweat testing rather than reliance on screening alone [^111K97u1]. I also need to remember that eosinophilic esophagitis and non–IgE food allergies can present with food refusal, vomiting, and FTT, so a careful allergy and feeding history with appropriate referral is prudent when symptoms persist [^1166XFMP] [^116KBHYs].

> Let me think about management principles, starting with nutrition for catch-up growth. I should confirm that most infants can be managed as outpatients with structured follow-up; the cornerstone is providing 150% of the caloric requirement for expected weight, not actual weight, to support catch-up, with close monitoring of weight gain and adjustment of intake every 1–2 weeks initially [^116NQgBh] [^114CWXch]. For breastfed infants, I should optimize latch, assess milk transfer, consider test weights, and use supplementation only when indicated; for formula-fed infants, concentrating formula or using energy-dense therapeutic feeds can increase intake, and I should avoid modular fat or carbohydrate additions that dilute protein, favoring balanced energy-protein ratios and micronutrient repletion as needed [^112uR6JS]. Wait, let me verify the evidence for energy density; a small crossover study showed that increasing formula energy density improved intake and weight gain in many infants with non-organic FTT, though some self-regulated volume, so I should individualize and monitor response rather than assume uniform benefit [^111PDg7u].

> I should confirm escalation pathways and the role of tube feeding. If oral intake remains insufficient after optimization, nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding may be necessary; multidisciplinary nutrition support reduces complications and ensures safe advancement, and I should set weaning goals early to restore oral feeding when feasible [^112uR6JS]. Hold on, I should verify refeeding risk; in otherwise healthy young children admitted for FTT, routine electrolyte monitoring for refeeding syndrome rarely reveals abnormalities, suggesting that risk stratification rather than universal labs may be reasonable, though I must remain vigilant in high-risk contexts such as chronic disease or severe malnutrition [^1156qdqh].

> Next, I should review non-nutritional interventions that target root causes. For non-organic FTT, addressing caregiver stress, postpartum depression, and feeding dynamics with home visiting, lactation support, and behavioral feeding programs improves outcomes; early intervention studies show attenuation of some long-term cognitive and behavioral risks, reinforcing the value of coordinated psychosocial care [^115GJzDu] [^114oKKTX]. For organic etiologies, disease-specific therapy is essential; examples include treating GERD, managing eosinophilic esophagitis with elimination diets or steroids, correcting endocrine disorders, or intervening surgically for airway obstruction or congenital anomalies, with growth recovery expected as the underlying condition is controlled [^1166XFMP] [^1152cPTw].

> I need to ensure I flag red flags that mandate urgent evaluation or hospitalization. Severe malnutrition with weight-for-length less than 70% of expected, signs of abuse or neglect, failure of outpatient management, or unsafe home environments warrant inpatient care and multidisciplinary involvement, with consideration of child protective services when neglect is suspected [^115CpY1E] [^116NQgBh]. But wait, what if the infant has persistent vomiting and distension? I should consider surgical causes such as pyloric stenosis or intestinal obstruction and escalate promptly to avoid complications [^1145SfKU].

> Let me consider special populations where my threshold for testing and intervention should be lower. Late preterm and early term infants have immature feeding skills and higher risks of dehydration, jaundice, and readmission; they need early, frequent follow-up with lactation support and careful growth surveillance to prevent FTT [^117QmAqM] [^115SvpdC]. Infants with Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, or other genetic conditions have higher rates of feeding difficulties and FTT; anticipatory guidance and early feeding therapy are recommended to mitigate growth failure [^113dcLbR] [^114CWXch]. Infants with neonatal opioid exposure have elevated risks of FTT and neglect-related readmissions, so I should coordinate early developmental and social supports to reduce adverse outcomes [^112LWZKZ].

> I should double-check long-term outcomes to guide counseling and follow-up. Systematic review data suggest a modest IQ decrement of about 3 points and persistent height and weight deficits in some children with a history of FTT, though many recover by school age; early, sustained intervention appears to mitigate some risks, but confounding by socioeconomic context complicates attribution, so I should avoid overpromising while emphasizing the importance of early treatment [^111AjVMg] [^112MogaR]. Longitudinal studies in low birth weight preterm infants show that those with both SGA and postnatal FTT fare worst at age 8, reinforcing the need to address both prenatal and postnatal growth trajectories proactively [^1116krF9].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, confirm growth faltering with accurate measurements and z-scores and exclude early neonatal weight loss; then, obtain a detailed feeding and psychosocial history and observe feeding; next, implement outpatient nutrition with 150% of expected caloric needs and arrange close follow-up; if no improvement in 2–4 weeks, broaden evaluation with targeted labs and specialty referral; escalate to inpatient care for severe malnutrition, safety concerns, or diagnostic uncertainty, and involve multidisciplinary teams for complex or non-resolving cases [^116NQgBh] [^112uR6JS]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with evidence; yes, this stepwise approach mirrors contemporary primary care guidance and avoids unnecessary testing while catching organic disease in a timely manner [^116NQgBh] [^114HdVfm].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this is consistent with the evidence: most infant FTT reflects inadequate intake and responds to structured nutrition and family support; a minority signals organic disease and requires targeted testing and disease-specific therapy; early recognition and intervention reduce long-term growth and neurodevelopmental risks, and a z-score–based, trajectory-aware approach improves diagnostic precision and guides safe, effective care [^116NQgBh] [^112MogaR] [^116SMKUe].

---

Failure to thrive (FTT) in infants is best defined as **persistent growth faltering** — a fall in weight-for-age z-score of ≥ 1.0 or weight below the 2nd percentile on WHO/CDC charts — confirmed on repeat measurements over time [^116NQgBh] [^116SMKUe]. The most common cause is **inadequate caloric intake** due to feeding difficulties, breastfeeding issues, or psychosocial factors; less often, malabsorption or increased energy expenditure are responsible [^116NQgBh] [^114HdVfm]. Evaluation should start with a **focused history and exam**, reserving labs for severe cases or when red flags appear; management centers on nutrition rehabilitation with 150% of usual calories, close follow-up, and addressing underlying causes, with hospitalization for severe malnutrition, safety concerns, or diagnostic uncertainty [^116NQgBh] [^114CWXch]. Early intervention improves growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, but persistent FTT can cause long-term deficits in cognition and growth [^112MogaR] [^111AjVMg].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

FTT is a **growth faltering** — inadequate weight gain or weight loss — confirmed on repeat measurements over time [^116NQgBh]. Current criteria include:

- **Weight-for-age z-score**: fall ≥ 1.0 from a prior z-score [^116SMKUe].
- **Weight-for-length**: below 2nd percentile or z-score < −2 [^116NQgBh].
- **Weight velocity**: below 5th percentile for age [^notfound].

These criteria should be applied using **WHO growth charts** for children < 2 years and CDC charts for older children [^116NQgBh].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

FTT has diverse causes; **inadequate intake** is most common, with malabsorption and increased energy expenditure less frequent [^116NQgBh] [^114HdVfm]:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Inadequate intake | - Breastfeeding difficulties <br/> - Formula preparation errors <br/> - Feeding aversion <br/> - Psychosocial stressors (e.g. postpartum depression, food insecurity) [^116NQgBh] [^114oKKTX] [^112cmanN] |
| Malabsorption | - Celiac disease <br/> - Cystic fibrosis <br/> - Cow's milk protein allergy <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease [^1166XFMP] [^116KBHYs] [^111a7zCA] |
| Increased energy expenditure | - Chronic infections <br/> - Congenital heart disease <br/> - Hyperthyroidism <br/> - Malignancy [^notfound] |

---

Risk factors include **prematurity, low birth weight, congenital anomalies, chronic illness, and socioeconomic adversity** [^116NQgBh] [^112cmanN].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: Detailed feeding history, growth trajectory, family/social context, and review of systems [^116NQgBh].
- **Physical examination**: Growth parameters, vital signs, and organ-system assessment [^116NQgBh].
- **Laboratory testing**: Reserved for severe cases, red flags, or failure of initial therapy; may include CBC, electrolytes, renal/liver function, TSH, celiac serology, stool studies, and targeted genetic testing [^116NQgBh] [^114HdVfm].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **nutrition rehabilitation** and addressing underlying causes:

- **Nutrition**: Provide 150% of usual caloric intake for catch-up growth; fortify breast milk or use energy-dense formula as indicated [^116NQgBh] [^112uR6JS].
- **Feeding support**: Lactation consultation, feeding therapy, and behavioral interventions for feeding difficulties [^112uR6JS].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve nutrition, social work, and pediatric specialists as needed [^116NQgBh].
- **Hospitalization**: For severe malnutrition, safety concerns, or diagnostic uncertainty [^116NQgBh] [^115CpY1E].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

With early intervention, most infants recover; however, **persistent FTT** is associated with:

- **Growth**: Reduced adult height and lean mass [^111AjVMg].
- **Cognition**: Lower IQ and academic achievement, especially with early-onset or severe FTT [^112MogaR] [^1116krF9].
- **Behavior**: Higher risk of behavioral and emotional problems [^115GJzDu].

---

## Prevention

Prevention emphasizes **early detection** through routine growth monitoring, breastfeeding support, and addressing psychosocial risk factors such as postpartum depression and food insecurity [^116NQgBh] [^114oKKTX] [^112cmanN].

---

Failure to thrive in infants reflects **persistent growth faltering** from inadequate intake, malabsorption, or increased energy needs; **early, structured evaluation and nutrition-focused management** with multidisciplinary support yield the best outcomes, while persistent FTT carries risks of lasting growth and cognitive deficits.

### Failure to thrive [^114CWXch]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive is a condition commonly seen by primary care physicians. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are important for preventing malnutrition and developmental sequelae. Medical and social factors often contribute to failure to thrive. Either extreme of parental attention (neglect or hypervigilance) can lead to failure to thrive. About 25 percent of normal infants will shift to a lower growth percentile in the first two years of life and then follow that percentile; this should not be diagnosed as failure to thrive. Infants with Down syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation, or premature birth follow different growth patterns than normal infants. Many infants with failure to thrive are not identified unless careful attention is paid to plotting growth parameters at routine checkups. A thorough history is the best guide to establishing the etiology of the failure to thrive and directing further evaluation and management. All children with failure to thrive need additional calories for catch-up growth (typically 150 percent of the caloric requirement for their expected, not actual, weight). Few need laboratory evaluation. Hospitalization is rarely required and is indicated only for severe failure to thrive and for those whose safety is a concern. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended when failure to thrive persists despite intervention or when it is severe.

### Growth faltering and failure to thrive in children [^116NQgBh]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Growth faltering, previously known as failure to thrive, is a broad term describing children who do not reach their expected weight, length, or body mass index for age. Growth is assessed with standardized World Health Organization charts for children younger than two years and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention charts for children two years and older. Traditional criteria for growth faltering can be imprecise and difficult to track over time; therefore, use of anthropometric z scores are now recommended. These scores can be calculated with a single set of measurements to assess malnutrition severity. Inadequate caloric intake, the most common cause of growth faltering, is identified with a detailed feeding history and physical examination. Diagnostic testing is reserved for those who have severe malnutrition or symptoms concerning for high-risk conditions, or if initial treatment fails. In older children or those with comorbidities, it is important to screen for underlying eating disorders (e.g., avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia). Growth faltering can usually be managed by the primary care physician. If comorbid disease is identified, a multidisciplinary team (e.g., nutritionist, psychologist, pediatric subspecialists) may be beneficial. Failure to recognize and treat growth faltering in the first two years of life may result in decreased adult height and cognitive potential.

### Severe failure to thrive in infant [^116mhbVV]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive in an infant has multiple etiologies and at times, is only manifestation of underlying serious disease. Bartter syndrome is a rare disease that manifests as failure to thrive. It can be diagnosed by a careful history, physical examination, and abnormal electrolyte pattern. It can be alleviated by appropriate management, whereas failure to recognize early can be life threatening. A case of severe failure to thrive in an infant due to neonatal form of Bartter syndrome, its manifestations, management, and outcome is presented in this article.

### Failure to thrive as a manifestation of child neglect [^112QRuwo]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive is a common problem in infancy and childhood. It is most often multifactorial in origin. Inadequate nutrition and disturbed social interactions contribute to poor weight gain, delayed development, and abnormal behavior. The syndrome develops in a significant number of children as a consequence of child neglect. This clinical report is intended to focus the pediatrician on the consideration, evaluation, and management of failure to thrive when child neglect may be present. Child protective services agencies should be notified when the evaluation leads to a suspicion of abuse or neglect.

Failure to thrive (FTT) is a common symptom, not a diagnosis, of a wide range of childhood diseases. Although FTT is usually caused by inadequate energy intake in diet or constitutional small size, organic pathology should be considered in some cases of FTT. This article is intended to guide primary care physicians for when to suspect inborn errors of metabolism in children who present with FTT.

### What is the long term outcome for children who fail to thrive? A systematic review [^111AjVMg]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To ascertain the long term outcomes in children diagnosed as having failure to thrive (FTT).

Methods

Systematic review of cohort studies. Medline, Psychinfo, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane, and DARE databases were searched for potentially relevant studies.

Inclusion Criteria

cohort studies or randomised controlled trials in children < 2 years old with failure to thrive defined as weight < 10th centile or lower centile and/or weight velocity < 10th centile, with growth, development, or behaviour measured at 3 years of age or older.

Results

Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria; eight included a comparison group, of which five included children identified in community settings. Two were randomised controlled trials. Attrition rates were 10–30%. Data from population based studies with comparison groups and which reported comparable outcomes in an appropriate form were pooled in a random effects meta-analysis. Four studies report IQ scores at follow up and the pooled standardised mean difference was -0.22 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.03). Two studies reported growth data as standard deviation scores. Their pooled weighted mean difference for weight was -1.24 SDS (95% CI -2.00 to -0.48), and for height -0.87 SDS (95% CI -1.47 to -0.28). No studies corrected for parental height, but two reported that parents of index children were shorter.

Conclusions

The IQ difference (equivalent to approximately 3 IQ points) is of questionable clinical significance. The height and weight differences are larger, but few children were below the 3rd centile at follow up. It is unclear to what extent observed differences reflect causal relations or confounding due to other variables. In the light of these results the aggressive approach to identification and management of failure to thrive needs reassessing.

### Failure to thrive: a practical guide [^115BHaAi]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Children with very low weight for age or height and those who do not maintain an appropriate growth pattern may have failure to thrive (FTT), also known as weight faltering. If confirmed by repeated valid measurements, FTT should prompt a search for causes of undernutrition, including neglect, family food insecurity, and underlying medical conditions. Inadequate caloric intake is the most common cause of FTT, but inadequate nutrient absorption or increased metabolism is also possible. Difficulty attaining or maintaining appropriate weight is the first indication of FTT, and sustained undernutrition can impede appropriate height, head circumference, and the development of cognitive skills or immune function in extreme cases. Early identification and management of the issues causing undernutrition are critical. In most cases, an appropriate growth velocity can be established with outpatient management based on proper nutrition and family support. Primary care physicians can effectively treat most children with FTT, and subspecialist consultation or hospitalization is rarely indicated.

### Failure to thrive: an update [^114HdVfm]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive in childhood is a state of undernutrition due to inadequate caloric intake, inadequate caloric absorption, or excessive caloric expenditure. In the United States, it is seen in 5 to 10 percent of children in primary care settings. Although failure to thrive is often defined as a weight for age that falls below the 5th percentile on multiple occasions or weight deceleration that crosses two major percentile lines on a growth chart, use of any single indicator has a low positive predictive value. Most cases of failure to thrive involve inadequate caloric intake caused by behavioral or psychosocial issues. The most important part of the outpatient evaluation is obtaining an accurate account of a child's eating habits and caloric intake. Routine laboratory testing rarely identifies a cause and is not generally recommended. Reasons to hospitalize a child for further evaluation include failure of outpatient management, suspicion of abuse or neglect, or severe psychosocial impairment of the caregiver. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment, including home nursing visits and nutritional counseling, has been shown to improve weight gain, parent-child relationships, and cognitive development. The long-term effects of failure to thrive on cognitive development and future academic performance are unclear.

### Failure to thrive: still a problem of definition [^116wnjeo]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The term 'failure to thrive' (FTT) is widely used to describe inadequate growth in early childhood. However, no consensus exists concerning the specific anthropometrical criteria to define this description. The aim of this study was to make an updated assessment concerning the use of FTT definitions and describe possible trends regarding the use of specific criteria. A cross-sectional review was done covering English-language articles published from January 2003 until June 2004, and recent textbooks of general pediatrics. Most of the reviewed literature broadly defined FTT as inadequate growth and total agreement existed to define FTT based solely on anthropometrical parameters. Large differences, however, were seen regarding which growth parameters to use and whether to use attained values or velocities. Weight was the most predominant choice, but many included more than one anthropometrical parameter. Failure to thrive in children is currently described solely based on anthropometrical indicators, with weight gain as the predominant choice of indicator and cut off around the 5th percentile. Discussion is needed as to whether the term 'failure to thrive' is still a useful common term for pediatric undernutrition of different types.

### Hospitalization for failure to thrive: a prospective descriptive report [^114FYwzj]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive (FTT) is a common symptom leading to hospitalization of children. Most literature describing this population is from 30 years ago. Since that time the hospitalized population has become more medically complex. We aimed to describe children hospitalized for FTT in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. We prospectively collected demographic, anthropometric, evaluation, and outcome data for 92 consecutive children admitted with FTT. The majority of children grew with behavioral interventions alone (primary nonorganic FTT) and had negative evaluation (n = 63). Children with primary organic FTT had longer hospital stays (7 vs 4 days; P < .001) and lower daily weight gain (35 vs 58 g/d; P < .001). Laboratory, radiological, and endoscopic evaluation rarely led to a diagnostic etiology of FTT in hospitalized children. We conclude that children hospitalized with FTT should be observed for weight gain prior to pursuing diagnostic investigation.

### Etiology of failure to thrive in infants and toddlers referred to a pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic [^114KxhWc]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to determine the underlying etiology of failure to thrive (FTT) in infants and toddlers referred to an outpatient pediatric endocrinology clinic. A chart review was done on FTT referrals to a pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic between 2002 and 2005. Majority of patients (51.5%) had a purely nutritional deficiency. The endocrine etiologies included short stature due to being small for gestational age, constitutional or familial short stature (28.9%). The third most common etiology was gastrointestinal disease. Endocrine causes of FTT seem to be rare even in the selected population of patients referred to pediatric endocrine outpatient clinics. In the primary care setting, nutritional assessment and consultation seem to be adequate in the majority of cases. Only a small percentage of the patients with FTT will require a multidisciplinary approach and more extensive work-up.

### Characteristics of failure to thrive in a referral population: implications for treatment [^1123iPck]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive (FTT) in children is an important pediatric problem. Environmental and behavioral causes predominate, and detrimental effects on neurocognitive development are well documented. Multidisciplinary clinics designed to identify and treat FTT are effective but have not been widely adopted. A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients with FTT seen at the authors' large inner-city children's hospital over a 40-month period, including those referred to a new multidisciplinary clinic. Over 40 months, only 75 children were referred and only 20 had moderate or severe FTT (z-score < -2.0). Nutritional status improved with treatment, but the small number of referrals who were severely affected led to the closing of the clinic. Recommendations for evaluating and treating children with mild FTT in primary care settings and a standardized definition of FTT that warrants more intensive treatment would help ensure that children were referred and treated appropriately.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^113kRgqF]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Faltering growth in infants and children < 2 years of age is a common problem regularly seen by health care professionals. It has multiple causes and occurs due to disease-related and non-disease related factors, and in low-, middle-, and high- income settings. However, in all settings it is essential to detect FG, address underlying causes and support catch-up growth where this is indicated.

### Failure to thrive: the prevalence and concurrence of anthropometric criteria in a general infant population [^112KQfhv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to thrive (FTT) in early childhood is associated with subsequent developmental delay and is recognised to reflect relative undernutrition. Although the concept of FTT is widely used, no consensus exists regarding a specific definition, and it is unclear to what extent different anthropometric definitions concur.

Objective

To compare the prevalence and concurrence of different anthropometric criteria for FTT and test the sensitivity and positive predictive values of these in detecting children with "significant undernutrition", defined as the combination of slow conditional weight gain and low body mass index (BMI).

Methods

Seven criteria of FTT, including low weight for age, low BMI, low conditional weight gain and Waterlow's criterion for wasting, were applied to a birth cohort of 6090 Danish infants. The criteria were compared in two age groups: 2–6 and 6–11 months of life.

Results

27% of infants met one or more criteria in at least one of the two age groups. The concurrence among the criteria was generally poor, with most children identified by only one criterion. Positive predictive values of different criteria ranged from 1% to 58%. Most single criteria identified either less than half the cases of significant undernutrition (found in 3%) or included far too many, thus having a low positive predictive value. Children with low weight for height tended to be relatively tall.

Conclusions

No single measurement on its own seems to be adequate for identifying nutritional growth delay. Further longitudinal population studies are needed to investigate the discriminating power of different criteria in detecting significant undernutrition and subsequent outcomes.

### Etiologies of poor weight gain and ultimate diagnosis in children admitted for growth faltering [^111cMfpZ]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Growth faltering (GF) (previously failure to thrive) is a common reason for hospital admission, but there is little data on whether diagnoses made during initial admission remain accurate in follow-up. We sought to characterize infants admitted for isolated GF and identify diagnoses at discharge and ultimate diagnoses determined over 2 years of follow-up, to determine how diagnoses changed. We also sought to identify patient factors on admission associated with ultimate diagnosis.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of children aged 2 weeks to 2 years with index admissions for GF from 2013 to 2017. We reviewed clinical data and documentation to determine discharge and ultimate diagnosis, and identify factors associated with ultimate diagnosis.

Results

Of 497 patients, 292 (59%) had insufficient intake, 103 (20%) had organic disease including 36 genetic disorders, 52 (11%) had mechanical feeding difficulties, and 50 (10%) had mixed or unknown diagnoses 2 years after admission. Over 90% of cases of insufficient intake were diagnosed during admission. Sixty-five percent of organic diseases, and only 39% of genetic disorders, were diagnosed during admission. Patient factors associated with genetic disorders included previous NICU stay, low birth weight, dysphagia, hypotonia, and dysmorphisms.

Conclusions

Insufficient intake remains the most common diagnosis, and this diagnosis was accurately made during admission. Organic disease, especially genetic disease, was often not diagnosed during admission. Better tools are needed to identify patients with organic disease. We identified patient factors on admission associated with ultimate diagnosis, which could be used to prioritize evaluation and expedite follow-up.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^114ofQBh]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

Faltering growth (FG) in infants and young children (< 2 years of age) is a common problem for general clinicians to see in clinical practice, especially in low-income settings.
FG is associated with a range of adverse outcomes and there may be benefits in promoting catch-up growth where this is indicated.
Health care professionals may be deterred from adequately addressing the problem of growth failure, due to the reported misconception that addressing FG may promote accelerated growth.

### Hypertension: a cause of growth impairment [^115UCiSV]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The effects of high blood pressure on growth are not fully understood and while hypertension may be associated with failure to thrive, hypertension causing failure to thrive in children is poorly documented. We describe four children presenting with failure to thrive due to hypertension consequent to various aetiologies. Control of hypertension with appropriate therapy resulted in improved growth. The exact pathogenesis of failure to thrive in hypertensive children is not known. These cases demonstrate the importance of careful measurement of blood pressure in children with failure to thrive.

### Clinician diagnoses of failure to thrive before and after switch to World Health Organization growth curves [^116YfPcX]. Academic Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate change in the incidence of failure to thrive (FTT) based on selected growth percentile criteria and diagnostic codes before and after a switch in growth curves.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of children 2 to 24 months of age in a large primary care network that switched its default growth curve from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reference to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards in 2012. We compared the incidence of FTT defined by growth percentile criteria (using the default growth curve at the time of each measurement) and by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes in the 3 years before and after the CDC-WHO switch using an interrupted time series analysis. We performed these analyses stratified by age group (≤ 6 months and > 6–24 months).

Results

We evaluated 83,299 children. Among those ≤ 6 months, increases in FTT incidence were found in both growth-percentile and clinician-diagnosis criteria at the CDC-WHO switch (P < .05). Among those > 6 to 24 months, decreases in FTT incidence were found by growth-percentile criteria at the CDC-WHO switch (P < .05), but no significant changes were found in FTT incidence by diagnostic codes.

Conclusions

When switching from the CDC to the WHO growth curves, changes in the incidence of FTT by growth-percentile and clinician-diagnosis criteria differed for younger versus older infants. Factors beyond growth likely influence the decision to diagnose a child as having FTT and may differ in younger compared to older infants.

### Vallecular cyst: a dangerous cause of failure to thrive in infants [^1152cPTw]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 2-month-old full-term female infant with medical history of situs inversus totalis presented to the emergency department with congestion and abnormal breathing. She was discovered to have failure to thrive (FTT) and subsequently admitted. Investigations revealed a large vallecular mass at the base of her tongue which was noted to cause severe, intermittent airway obstruction. The mass underwent marsupialisation by otolaryngology (ENT) and pathology confirmed a diagnosis of vallecular cyst. The patient made a full recovery and is now growing and thriving. This case emphasises the need to consider anatomic airway abnormalities in the differential diagnosis of young infants with the constellation of respiratory symptoms and FTT. Such airway abnormalities can cause life-threatening airway obstruction if not discovered.

### Interesting presentation of postnatal depression and infant failure to thrive [^113Gkr5z]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

This case report is of a woman in her 30s, 10 months post partum who was referred to Mother Baby Unit at a tertiary hospital with depressive symptoms including lowered mood, reduced self-care and motivation despite initiation of escitalopram 3 months earlier. In addition, her infant had non-organic failure to thrive mediated by decreased feeding and non-initiation of solids. On admission, her cognitive difficulties, blurred vision and reported loss of smell led to further neurological assessment and investigation with an MRI. Diagnosis of a frontal meningioma was made on the basis of the MRI finding of a 7cm meningioma in the anterior cranial fossa. Surgical removal was successful which led to resolution of her depressive symptoms and improved parenting functioning. This case highlights the importance of considering organic causes of depression and non-organic causes of failure to thrive in infants.

### Abstract… [^115PXgbb]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The recognition of growth and developmental problems in infants and children is one of the major challenges facing primary care physicians. Failure to thrive is a common condition of varying etiologies that has been associated with adverse effects on later growth and cognitive development. 1, 2 Primary care physicians need to be able to diagnose and manage FTT promptly to reduce the risk of long-term sequelae. Stress and other psychosocial factors frequently contribute to FTT. For example, a depressed mother may not feed her infant adequately. The infant may become withdrawn, responding to the mother's depression, and feed less well. Another example is when parents are overly anxious about a child's feeding. Coercive practices can lead to feeding behavior problems and FTT. Limit fruit juice to 8 to 16 oz per day.

Fruit juice is an important contributor to poor growth by providing relatively empty carbohydrate calories and diminishing a child's appetite for nutritious meals, leading to decreased caloric intake.
17. REFERRAL For children who do not respond to initial management, it may be necessary to seek assistance from a subspecialist. Traditionally, a multidisciplinary approach to FTT — using physicians, nurses, dietitians, social workers, and psychologists — has produced better outcomes. 7 This approach may not be practical in all cases, but for children who are not improving because of an undiagnosed medical condition or a particularly challenging social situation, a multidisciplinary approach may be the best answer. Outcomes Children with FTT are at risk for adverse outcomes such as short stature, behavior problems, and developmental delay. 1, 2, 5, 22–24 FTT is more likely a contributing or associated factor to these adverse outcomes, rather than the exclusive cause.

There are a limited number of outcome studies on children with FTT, each with different definitions and designs, so it is difficult to comment with certainty on the long-term results of FTT. 25 In addition, it is often difficult to disentangle the effects of FTT from those of the high-risk environments in which FTT often occurs. 5, 26. To decrease the risk of adverse effects, it is important to recognize and treat FTT promptly. Early childhood is a critical period for growth and development, and early intervention for any child with FTT will maximize the potential for better outcomes. 22 Given the evidence of long-term problems, all children who have been diagnosed with FTT need to be followed carefully for possible later sequelae.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^112PrzSv]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Additional challenges in low- and middle-income countries

In low- and middle-income countries, only 50% to 60% of infants born SGA show catch-up growth in either height, weight, or both, due to multiple factors, such as poor maternal and postnatal nutrition, poor hygiene, many infections, and factors associated with low socioeconomic status. Catch-up growth in countries with poor nutrition and relatively low protein dietary content may be delayed up to 4 to 5 years of age. Children of upper socioeconomic status show better catch-up growth. Appropriate local reference charts can be used to monitor growth of children born SGA. Using WHO charts in low-income countries has its problems, as many healthy children fall below the third percentile of WHO charts for both height and weight with relative sparing of weight-for-height. In SGA, this effect is more pronounced, and hence one should give more attention to the growth trajectory than to a single reading of a growth parameter for stunting and wasting.

Given the high prevalence of malnutrition and infections, recommendations may be different beyond the sensitive window of metabolic programming, specifically, the first 3 to 6 months of life. This may only be achieved by changing the feeding policy based on very close monitoring of the growth trajectory — allowing neither failure to thrive nor excessive catch-up in weight. Exclusive breastfeeding has been associated with less rapid catch-up and lower fasting insulin and glucose concentrations, at least in the short term, and is associated with a consistent protective effect against later obesity in numerous observational studies and meta-analyses. Therefore, current WHO policy recommends exclusive breastfeeding or using standard formulas rather than nutrient-enriched formulas up to the age of 6 months. For low-birth-weight infants in extremely impoverished environments, clearly the priority is to prevent malnutrition and growth faltering.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^113dcLbR]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome — feeding and growth in infancy often require anticipatory support. The guideline notes, "Approximately one-third of infants with TS are born small for gestational age (SGA), though the degree of SGA is typically mild, but can be up to 600–1000 g lighter". It adds, "Inadequate weight gain is common, with estimates of up to half of all infants with TS experiencing failure to thrive", and explains contributory factors: "High arched and narrow palate, hypotonia, poor coordination, and delay in oral-motor skills can all contribute to feeding and/or swallowing difficulties in infants with TS". It also states, "While there are no TS-specific treatment recommendations, anticipatory guidance and proactive intervention are desired".

### Use of energy-dense formula for treating infants with non-organic failure to thrive [^111PDg7u]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate if simply increasing the energy density of the formula will lead to increased energy intake and weight gain in infants with non-organic failure to thrive.

Design

In this hospital-based trial, 15 infants (mean age, 7.6 ± 1.4 months) with non-organic failure to thrive were fed a regular strength formula (2.8 kJ/ml) for 3 days and then switched to the same formula with a higher energy density (4.18 kJ/ml) for 3 days after a 2 day 'wash-out' period. Daily nude weights and energy intakes were recorded for the two 3 day periods.

Results

During feeding with the higher density formula, nine (60%) infants had a significant increase in their energy intake and weight gain (both P < 0.02); four (27%) showed no change in energy intake and self-regulated their intake by decreasing the volume of feeds consumed to maintain energy intake; and two (13%) infants consumed a significantly reduced amount of energy (P < 0.02).

Conclusion

Increasing the energy density of the formula may provide a useful intervention to increase the weight gain and energy intake of most infants with non-organic failure to thrive.

### Atopic dermatitis-induced failure to thrive and hypernatremic dehydration managed with dupilumab in a 5-month-old patient [^1143HD4S]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by genetics, environmental factors, epidermal barrier disruption, and immune dysregulation. Rarely, severe AD induces skin barrier dysfunction resulting in protein deficiency and electrolyte abnormalities, ultimately causing failure to thrive (FTT). This case features a 5-month-old female who presented with altered consciousness due to electrolyte abnormalities, poor feeding, weight loss, and subsequent FTT. After extensive investigation, she was diagnosed with severe AD and initiated on dupilumab. This case highlights the rare sequelae of severe AD and the use of biologic therapies for infants with severe or refractory cases of AD.

### Late preterm birth is a risk factor for growth faltering in early childhood: a cohort study [^116Ebx3J]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Late preterm children have already shown to be at increased risk of dying during infancy. Results of the current study bring a new source of concern: for those who survive, high morbidity continues and failure to thrive in the first two years may put them at increased risk of future occurrences of serious morbidity in late childhood and of chronic disease development in adult life.

### Frequent breastfeeding and food refusal associated with failure to thrive. A manifestation of the vulnerable child syndrome [^111oWazQ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This paper acquaints pediatricians and health care personnel with the triad of poor weight gain, frequent breastfeeding, and food refusal in infants during the second 6 months of life. The histories of six infants aged 8–11 months, with failure to thrive, food refusal, and frequent breastfeeding, are presented. All the mothers were facing significant stresses, which may have decreased their breast milk supply, and were leading them to use breastfeeding for their comfort and/or the comfort of their infant. The infants responded with continued frequent breastfeeding, refusal of complementary foods, and decreased weight gain. These infants fit the characteristics of the vulerable child syndrome. Treatment of these infants required evaluation and treatment of the mothers' psychosocial issues along with a behavioral feeding program. Even with this multidisciplinary approach, these infants showed very slow catch-up growth. Pediatricians and health care personnel should use and build on this information in the evaluation and treatment of infants with similar problems.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^116SMKUe]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Faltering Growth

There are many definitions of FG (also referred to by other terms including growth faltering, "failure to thrive", stunting, and growth failure). For example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises the National Health Service in the UK, suggested the following thresholds for concern about FG in infants: a fall across 1 or more weight centile spaces (1 centile space = 0.67 z scores) if birthweight was below the 9th centile; a fall across 2 or more weight centile spaces if birthweight was between the 9th and 91st centiles; a fall across 3 or more weight centile spaces if birthweight was above the 91st centile; when current weight is below the 2nd centile for age, whatever the birthweight.

Given the international nature of this review, the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of growth faltering seems most relevant to provide a simple, pragmatic approach for clinicians: a fall in weight for age (WFA) z score of ≥ 1.0 merits evaluation. Current definitions lack a timeframe for the period of growth faltering. We suggested that it was important to include a time frame for falling weight that should be sufficient to ensure that acute weight loss, such as that occurring rapidly with an episode of vomiting and diarrhea is not classified as growth faltering. Growth faltering also excludes the first 2 weeks after birth, when weight loss is expected.

Growth faltering potentially has an immediate effect on a child's health and can be a marker for something serious, so it is clearly important that clinicians recognize growth faltering and manage it appropriately.

### Failure to thrive, metabolic acidosis, and diarrhea in a 7-week-old infant [^114uXWPg]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A 7-week-old infant presented to the emergency department with fussiness, decreased oral intake, loose stool, and respiratory distress for 2 days. The patient was born full-term with an uncomplicated birth history but had a history of slow weight gain. He was alert, but toxic-appearing at presentation, hypothermic with signs of dehydration, and with respiratory failure. He was found to have severe anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, elevated lactate, and hyperammonemia. He responded well to initial resuscitation and was admitted to the ICU for intravenous electrolyte replacement, bowel rest, and respiratory support. A workup was pursued for failure to thrive with severe malnutrition, hyperammonemia, hyperlactatemia, anemia, vitamin D deficiency, and electrolyte abnormalities. After stabilization, he was restarted on enteral feeds and had a recurrence of loose stool and severe electrolyte abnormalities, which were refractory to enteral supplementations and required readmission to the ICU. His hospital course extended several weeks, included several subspecialty consultations, and ended with a surprising diagnosis of exclusion based on his clinical response to therapy.

### Evaluation of income and food insecurity as risk factors for failure to thrive: an analysis of national survey data [^112cmanN]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

Our study included children under 3 years of age in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during the years 1999 to 2014.NHANES is a prospective survey that uses multistage probability sampling; when analyzed with appropriate sampling weights, it can provide nationally representative estimates. We restricted the sample to those under 3 years of age because, in our experience, children in this age group are most likely to present with new diagnoses of FTT, and most studies included in the systematic review for the recent guideline by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom had an upper age limit of 3 years.

The Penn State College of Medicine Institutional Review Board considered this study of publicly available deidentified data to not be human subject research.

Definitions

Our primary definition of underweight was weight-for-age (WFA or weight-for-length (WFL < 5th percentile on the World Health Organization (WHO) growth curve for children < 2 years of age, or WFA or body mass index-for-age (BFA < 5th percentile on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth curve for those 2 to 3 years of age. We excluded children with a birth weight < 2500 g in our primary analysis because a history of low birth weight is associated with both SES and with underweight that is less likely to be caused by undernourishment. -

Primary Analyses

Our 2 primary analyses were a comparison of underweight status in children with and without low income and with and without food insecurity. We adjusted household income for household size by dividing the income by the square root of the number of people living in the household. These adjusted values were then categorized in quintiles. Our goal was to evaluate risk of underweight in children with low income; quintiles were used because of prior research suggesting a possible U-shaped relationship of underweight with income. As alternate measures of low income, we compared the prevalence of underweight in children receiving and not receiving Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits and in children with a family income below (vs above) 130% of the federal poverty level. This corresponds to a federal poverty income index below 1.3, a threshold used to determine eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The index was calculated in NHANES by dividing family income by the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines specific for that participant's year, location, and family size.

### 'Severe malnutrition': thinking deeply, communicating simply [^115WRrD4]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Severe malnutrition

By Severe Malnutrition we mean (Table 2):

Table 2
Severe malnutrition definition

Benefits of this term include the following.

Focus on severe adverse outcomes

An important clinical maxim is to 'treat the patient, not the numbers'. The ultimate aim of any intervention is to ensure children not only survive but thrive. Severe in our framework refers to clinically important severe adverse outcomes: mortality, morbidity, impaired development. To capture true programme impact, these should be measured wherever possible (since some interventions might improve anthropometry but not mortality; others improve nutrition but not anthropometry). The framework also highlights underlying clinical causes because acute/chronic illness and anthropometric deficits are intimately related: deficits are associated with increased risk of and impaired response to illnesses; illness can exacerbate anthropometric deficit.

Inclusivity (including of long-term consequences)

Different manifestations of malnutrition are more-common or less-common/important in different settings but details are mainly relevant to technical audiences. While widely understood to mean undernutrition, we acknowledge that malnutrition is also used to describe overweight. Severe overweight is widely recognised as obesity so our using 'severe malnutrition' does not risk misunderstanding. It does create opportunities to highlight long term consequences of undernutrition: speaking about mal rather than under nutrition is a reminder that early-life undernutrition increases susceptibility to the harmful effects of adult overweight, especially elevated non-communicable non-communicable disease.

Increased linkages and synergies between different nutrition-related programmes

Working towards common mortality/morbidity goals could facilitate interprogramme linkages and more efficient resource utilisation.

'Severe malnutrition' also provides bridging language supporting recent research on relationships between different malnutrition manifestations:

Wasting predisposes to stunting — 'chronic' terminology under-recognises the role of acute insults.
Wasting is common in children with low birth weight and disabilityand many wasted children are stunted — 'acute' terminology is usually erroneous.
Children with concurrent wasting/stunting are at particularly high risk of death — programmes should be integrated.

Since all forms of malnutrition are fundamentally social problems of poverty and inequity, our terminology also emphasises the importance of tackling these common determinants.

### Osteopathic treatment of infants with infantile colic / excessive crying: a prospective, multicentric, randomized controlled trial and nested observational trial [^112oCmT4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Colic in infants is defined as excessive crying in an otherwise healthy and thriving baby. In the literature, this health disorder is often referred to as infantile colic (IC) / excessive crying (EC). The crying typically starts in the first weeks of life and usually resolves within 6 months. IC/EC is a common but poorly understood and often frustrating problem for parents and caregivers. Although IC/EC is classified as benign and self-limiting, it is one of the most common causes of medical consultations in the first months of a child's life due to the excessive crying and the accompanying distressing impairment to parents.

Definitions

Three types of infant crying are distinguished: physiological crying (due to physical and emotional needs), pathological crying (due to organic causes), and nonspecific crying (without an apparently reasonable cause). To date, however, there is no exact definition for IC/EC, which makes it difficult to compare different studies and scientific papers on this topic. Traditionally, the definition of IC/EC was based on the "rule of three": unexplained episodes of paroxysmal crying for more than three hours per day for three days per week for at least three weeks. The Rome III Committee describes IC/EC as a behavioral syndrome in infancy that involves prolonged crying episodes and behavior that is difficult to soothe, without an obvious cause, and without failure to thrive.

Epidemiology

Reported incidence rates of IC/EC vary between 2% and 40%, not least because of differences in the criteria used to define the condition. Twenty-one percent of UK families report having sought advice for persistent infant crying. A review by Vandenplas et al. identified 30 studies that reported a prevalence of IC or crying problems ranging from 2% to 73% in infants younger than 12 months of age. In a meta-analysis by Wolke et al. pooled estimates of IC/EC cry duration were 117 min at 1–2 weeks of age, 118 min at 3–4 weeks, 133 min at 5–6 weeks, followed by a significant decrease to 68 min at 10–12 weeks of age.

### Oesophageal eosinophilia and oesophageal diseases in children: are the limits clear? [^113PkAcR]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Clinical aspects

In paediatric patients, diagnostic guidance based on symptoms is difficult, especially at younger ages, when symptoms are more non-specific, and generally reported by caregivers, and therefore depend on their interpretation.

EoE is suspected clinically when there are symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction, which could manifest in various ways, including dysphagia, food impaction, food refusal, failure to progress with food introduction, heartburn, regurgitation, vomiting, chest pain, odynophagia, abdominal pain and malnutrition. Atopic comorbidities such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, or immediate food allergies should increase the clinical index of suspicion. In younger children, the most common symptoms are those similar to GER, in addition to vomiting, abdominal pain, food refusal and failure to thrive. In older children, adolescents and adults, dysphagia to solids, food impaction and chest pain not associated with swallowing are more frequently reported. Because these symptoms are non-specific, patients should be treated as clinically indicated. The diagnostic algorithm cannot anticipate all clinical possibilities, and provides scope for appropriate evaluation.

Among the most frequent symptoms that may be associated with GERD in infants and children are general manifestations (irritability, food refusal, failure to thrive), gastrointestinal manifestations (heartburn, regurgitation/vomiting, retrosternal chest pain, dysphagia, epigastric pain) and manifestations of the airway (cough, wheezing, stridor, apnoea episodes, asthma, pneumonia). Given that the symptoms of GERD are not specific, 'red flags' or warning signs have been defined to guide the need for research studies to rule out complications of GERD and underlying disorders with similar symptoms. It should be noted that GER in infants is very common, and is usually self-limiting. In the presence of an infant with recurrent regurgitation, a thorough history and physical examination with attention to warning signals suggesting other diagnoses is generally sufficient to establish a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated infant GER. In the absence of warning signs, diagnostic testing and/or therapies including acid suppression are not needed if there is no impact of the symptoms on feeding, growth or acquisition of developmental milestones. Referral to the paediatric gastroenterologist is recommended when in infants or children there are warning signs or symptoms suggesting an underlying gastrointestinal disease.

### Evaluation of income and food insecurity as risk factors for failure to thrive: an analysis of national survey data [^114ncc3g]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In some children with borderline low weight or rate of weight gain it can be difficult to determine whether they have some degree of undernourishment, also known as failure to thrive (FTT). For these children, a clinician must determine whether the child is healthy and small or has FTT. Socioeconomic status (SES) and food insecurity have often been considered to play a role in children having FTT, mediated by factors such as caregiver stress and a lower amount of food offered. - There is no widely accepted definition of FTT in the United States, and no protocol for diagnosing FTT. Anecdotally, many pediatricians report considering SES when making a multifactorial assessment of children with slow weight gain, and some experts have recommended doing so. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a higher prevalence of multiple conditions. However, there is limited evidence to support an association between low SES and an increased prevalence of FTT, or to support an association between low SES and an increased prevalence of underweight which could reflect a higher risk of FTT. A recent systematic review found conflicting evidence on the topic, with little data from the United States.- Furthermore, a recent prospective study in the United States did not find an increase in underweight prevalence in children with public insurance experiencing food insecurity in tertiary centers in 5 US cities.

It is important to understand factors that do or do not provide information about the risk of FTT because underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of FTT both have potential harms. Evaluations of children with FTT sometimes include costly testing and can involve detailed questioning about parenting practices or home visits. Management of FTT may involve strict feeding routines, purchase of specific foods, and frequent in-person follow-up, all of which may be more challenging for families with less money and control over their schedules or with fewer transportation options. Underdiagnosis of FTT may also disproportionately affect children with lower SES because they are at higher risk of poor outcomes from some medical conditions. Socioeconomic status and food insecurity are also associated with race and ethnicity, leading to the potential for further health care disparities if children with these risk factors are overidentified, or underidentified, as having FTT. -

We used a nationally representative US sample to determine whether there was a higher prevalence of children with underweight in children with low income, a component of SES, or food insecurity, compared to those without. A higher prevalence of underweight in these children would likely reflect a higher risk of FTT.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^112MogaR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease-related FG can have serious short- and long-term consequences. Critically ill children who become malnourished during PICU stay show increased mortality, length of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay. Malnourished children also have increased rates of infection and longer-term behavioral problems, including impaired communication skills, attention-deficit, and hyperactivity disorders. However, most data on the adverse effects of malnutrition come from studies carried out in low-income countries, with very limited data on the long-term effects of FG in children in Western countries, although there is some evidence in children with congenital heart disease.

Considering the long-term consequences of FG, investigators relying on population- and community-based samples have found that most children with a history of FG have experienced growth recovery by school age. Although many continue to be shorter than age-matched peers they rarely experience growth deficits indicative of severe malnutrition. However, FG may have a small, though potentially important, impact on children's cognitive performance. A meta-analysis in 2004 suggested that FG in infants may result in long-term problems in cognitive development with a 4.2 intelligence quotient point decrement. In another study, young children who had failure to thrive followed for up to 8 years had measurable intelligence quotient deficits as well as learning and behavioral difficulties. Chronic illness leading to stunting may have consequences on long-term growth and final size/target size and if FG caused by disease is not corrected it can develop into non-disease-related FG.

### Ankyloglossia, exclusive breastfeeding, and failure to thrive [^114dYoAw]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

A 6-month-old term boy was hospitalized to evaluate the cause of his failure to thrive, mandated as part of an investigation by the Department of Children and Families after an allegation of medical neglect was made. On admission the patient was below birth weight, and a medical workup for failure to thrive was pursued; however, he was noted to have severe ankyloglossia and was an exclusively breastfed infant. The only interventions during his hospitalization were frenotomy and assistance to the mother to increase her milk supply. The infant immediately experienced weight gain and has continued to show slow, but steady, weight gain as an outpatient. We illustrate here many of the controversies concerning ankyloglossia.

### Incidence of refeeding syndrome in children with failure to thrive [^1156qdqh]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the incidence of refeeding syndrome in otherwise healthy children < 3 years of age admitted for failure to thrive (FTT).

Methods

A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed on patients aged ≤ 36 months admitted with a primary diagnosis of FTT from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients with laboratory evidence of refeeding syndrome. Exclusion criteria included admission to an ICU, parenteral nutrition, history of prematurity, gastrostomy tube feeds, and any complex chronic conditions.

Results

Of the 179 patients meeting inclusion criteria, none had laboratory evidence of refeeding syndrome. Of these, 145 (81%) had laboratory work done at the time of admission, and 69 (39%) had laboratory work repeated after admission. A small percentage (6%) of included patients experienced an adverse event due to repeat laboratory draw.

Conclusions

In otherwise healthy hospitalized patients < 3 years of age with a primary diagnosis of FTT, routine laboratory monitoring for electrolyte derangements did not reveal any cases of refeeding syndrome. More robust studies are needed to determine the safety and feasibility of applying low-risk guidelines to this patient population to reduce practice variability and eliminate unnecessary laboratory evaluation and monitoring.

### A 3-month-old with failure to thrive and persistent vomiting [^1145SfKU]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 3-month-old boy was admitted from his pediatrician's office for failure to thrive and vomiting. On admission, he weighed barely more than his birth weight and was cachectic with muscle wasting. His abdomen was grossly distended but soft and nontender. A trial of nasogastric feeds resulted in a worsening of his clinical status. He was transferred to the ICU, and diagnostic imaging was concerning for a distal bowel obstruction. Surgical pathology revealed a surprising diagnosis, which is described in detail in the following case.

### Increased resting energy expenditure is associated with failure to thrive in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency [^112Q31ks]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To measure resting energy expenditure (REE) and determine whether increased REE (hypermetabolism) is associated with failure to thrive (FTT) in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) at diagnosis.

Study Design

REE was measured in 26 patients with SCID in a single transplant center. Predicted REE was determined with World Health Organization standards. Measured REE > 110% of predicted REE was classified as hypermetabolism. Other data collected included FTT status, infections, genotype, phenotype, and the feeding methods used.

Results

Fifteen of 26 patients (57.7%) had FTT, and 18 of 26 patients (69.2%) were hypermetabolic. Hypermetabolism occured in 14 of 15 patients (93%) with FTT, and only 4 of 11 patients (36%) without FTT had hypermetabolism (P = 0.003). There was a significant difference between the measured REE (71.75 ± 16.6 kcal/kg) and the predicted REE (52.85 ± 2.8 kcal/kg; P < .0001). Eleven of 17 patients (65%) required nasogastric feeding, parenteral nutrition, or both to meet their energy needs.

Conclusions

Hypermetabolism is common in patients with SCID and may contribute to the development of FTT. The hypermetabolism in these patients may necessitate intensive nutrition support.

### Preoperative determinants of outcomes of infant heart surgery in a limited-resource setting [^112KfUcS]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

We studied the effect of preoperative determinants on early outcomes of 1028 consecutive infant heart operations in a limited-resource setting. Comprehensive data on pediatric heart surgery (January 2010-December 2012) were collected prospectively. Outcome measures included in-hospital mortality, prolonged ventilation (> 48 hours), and bloodstream infection (BSI) after surgery. Preoperative variables that showed significant individual association with outcome measures were entered into a logistic regression model. Weight at birth was low in 224 infants (21.8%), and failure to thrive was common (mean-weight Z score at surgery was 2.72 ± 1.7). Preoperatively, 525 infants (51%) needed intensive care, 69 infants (6.7%) were ventilated, and 80 infants (7.8%) had BSI. In-hospital mortality (4.1%) was significantly associated with risk adjustment for congenital heart surgery-1 (RACHS-1) risk category (P < 0.001). Neonatal status, preoperative BSI, and requirement of preoperative intensive care and ventilation had significant individual association with adverse outcomes, whereas low birth weight, prematurity, and severe failure to thrive (weight Z score < -3) were not associated with adverse outcomes. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, preoperative sepsis (odds ratio = 2.86; 95% CI: 1.32–6.21; P = 0.008) was associated with mortality. Preoperative intensive care unit stay, ventilation, BSI, and RACHS-1 category were associated with prolonged postoperative ventilation and postoperative sepsis. Neonatal age group was additionally associated with postoperative sepsis. Although severe failure to thrive was common, it did not adversely affect outcomes. In conclusions, preoperative BSI, preoperative intensive care, and mechanical ventilation are strongly associated with adverse outcomes after infant cardiac surgery in this large single-center experience from a developing country. Failure to thrive and low birth weight do not appear to adversely affect surgical outcomes.

### Early intervention and recovery among children with failure to thrive: follow-up at age 8 [^115GJzDu]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to examine the impact of a randomized, controlled trial of home visiting among infants with failure to thrive on growth, academic/cognitive performance, and home/classroom behavior at age 8.

Methods

Infants with failure to thrive (N = 130) or adequate growth (N = 119) were recruited from pediatric primary care clinics serving low-income, urban communities. Eligibility criteria included age < 25 months, gestational age > 36 weeks, birth weight > 2500 g, and no significant medical conditions. Evaluation included anthropometries, Bayley scales, maternal anthropometries, demographics, negative affect, IQ, and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scale. Infants with failure to thrive were treated in an interdisciplinary growth and nutrition clinic and randomized into clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention or clinical-care-only groups. The home-visiting curriculum promoted maternal sensitivity, parent-infant relationships, and child development. Follow-up visits were conducted by evaluators who were unaware of the children's growth or intervention history. At age 8, the evaluation included anthropometries, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III, and the Wide Range Achievement Test, Revised. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist and teachers completed the Teacher Report Form.

Analysis

Multivariate analyses of variance were used to examine differences in growth, cognitive/academic performance, and home/school behavior, adjusted by maternal education, public assistance, and, when appropriate, infant Bayley score, maternal BMI, height, negative affect, IQ, and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scores.

Results

Retention was 74% to 78%. Children in the adequate-growth group were significantly taller, heavier, and had better arithmetic scores than the clinical-intervention-only group, with the clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention group intermediate. There were no group differences in IQ, reading, or mother-reported behavior problems. Children in the clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention group had fewer teacher-reported internalizing problems and better work habits than the clinical-intervention-only group.

Conclusions

Early failure to thrive increased children's vulnerability to short stature, poor arithmetic performance, and poor work habits. Home visiting attenuated some of the negative effects of early failure to thrive, possibly by promoting maternal sensitivity and helping children build strong work habits that enabled them to benefit from school. Findings provide evidence for early intervention programs for vulnerable infants.

### ABM clinical protocol # 10: breastfeeding the late preterm (34–36 6 / 7 weeks of gestation) and early term infants (37–38 6 / 7 weeks of gestation), second revision 2016 [^117QmAqM]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #10 — definitions and breastfeeding-related risks in late preterm and early term infants — states that infants born between 34 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation are designated as late preterm, and that establishing breastfeeding in the late preterm infant is often more difficult compared with the full-term infant born at ≥ 39 weeks of gestation; a growing body of literature has documented an increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to feeding problems, and hospital readmission within the first 7–10 days after discharge is almost always due to feeding-related problems (hyperbilirubinemia, failure to thrive, hypernatremia, and/or dehydration).

### Evaluation of income and food insecurity as risk factors for failure to thrive: an analysis of national survey data [^1162QKLo]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Limited data exist regarding the relationship between socioeconomic risk factors and failure to thrive (FTT). Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from years 1999 to 2014, we sought to determine whether there was a higher prevalence of underweight (< 5th percentile weight-for-age [WFA], weight-for-length [WFL], or body mass index-for-age [BFA]), and, therefore, likely a higher risk of FTT, in US children < 3 years with low household income or food insecurity compared with children without these factors. Among 7356 evaluated children, there were no significant differences in the prevalence of underweight by adjusted household income quintile, food security, household Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) status, or federal poverty income ratio. These findings do not support a link between low income or food security and underweight in children and, therefore, do not provide support for an association between low income or food security and FTT.

### Hereditary hypotonia, muscle weakness, failure to thrive, and cognitive delay in a large moslem kindred [^113iQw41]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Five infants of a Moslem-Arab extended family were evaluated for common and characteristic clinical findings of failure to thrive, extreme muscle weakness, severe motor delay, and moderate to severe cognitive and verbal delay. All children were below the third percentile in weight and height, and three of them had head circumference below the third percentile. Neurologic examination revealed severe hypotonia, muscle weakness, and absent deep tendon reflexes. Two children died at 2 years of age, and none of the children acquired full head control and the motor milestones of rolling and sitting. Laboratory evaluation including muscle biopsies, genetic studies, and metabolic evaluation was nondiagnostic.

### Diagnosing failure to thrive: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in identical twins [^114ZPp4g]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) has significant variability in clinical presentation. Cardinal features include congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency and palatal abnormalities, but none are pathognomonic in isolation. Features can be classified as major or less common and are thought to be linked to the size of the 22.q11 deletion. Historically, syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome were recognised as distinct before a common genetic aetiology was identified. While the original triad of symptoms described in the 1960s included immunodeficiency, hypoparathyroidism and congenital heart disease, other studies have expanded this list, highlighting conotruncal cardiac anomalies (75–80%), immunodeficiency due to a hypoplastic thymus (up to 75%), palatal abnormalities (65%) and developmental delay as major features. Intermediate features or those that are relatively less common but still significant for the patient's medical care include gastrointestinal issues (30% of patients), hypocalcaemia (greater than 50–65%), renal defects (33%), hearing loss, swallowing dysfunction and behavioural disturbances. Diagnosis is typically made in infancy and early childhood once key features are identified, with confirmatory testing done using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) single nuclear polymorphism array to detect and locate a specific DNA sequence or lack thereof. The higher resolution of whole chromosome genetic microarray can help to detect smaller variations and has grown in favour in diagnosing genetic conditions, especially when a clear clinical picture is not evident. The extensive phenotypic variation in presentation makes it challenging from a diagnostician's standpoint to initiate workup for this condition, especially if it is an intermediate feature that is the presenting symptom in the absence of major features.

Failure to thrive (FTT) is variably cited in 22q11.2DS.FTT may be secondary to the features of the disease, including gastro-oesophageal reflux, aspiration and swallowing difficulties. Short stature has also been cited to be a complication of disease and can be related to the patient's FTT or to growth hormone deficiency. For any patient presenting with FTT, workup consists of evaluating for inadequate intake, malabsorption issues, increased metabolic expenditure secondary to an underlying condition and ultimately a possible genetic aetiology.

This report details the case of monochorionic monoamniotic identical twin boys, who were both found to have de novo 22q11.2DS and exhibiting FTT, yet lacking the major features typically seen with the condition.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^113TNFRi]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Infant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — symptoms, snoring prevalence, and risk factors: Symptoms of OSA, which may be subtle or absent in infants, include snoring, noisy respirations, labored breathing, mouth breathing, and profuse sweating, and some infants with OSA will present with failure to thrive, witnessed apnea, and/ or developmental delay. In otherwise normal infants, snoring is present at least 2 days per week in 11.8% and at least 3 days per week in 5.3% of infants. Some infants with OSA may be asymptomatic and have a normal physical examination, yet studies have reported a high incidence of snoring in infants with (26%–44%) and without (22%–26%) OSA. Additional risk factors for infant OSA include prematurity, maternal smoking, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, obesity, and specific medical conditions including laryngomalacia, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular weakness, Down syndrome, achondroplasia, Chiari malformations, and Prader-Willi syndrome.

### Leptin and cytokines levels in children with failure to thrive [^111tZfJi]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of cases of failure to thrive (FTT) are non-organic. Many of these patients present with significant decreased caloric intake. It appears as if the appetite regulation center in the hypothalamus is not attuned to the calorie requirements of the infant.

Objective

Our hypothesis was that some cases of non-organic FTT might be caused by abnormalities in hunger/satiety control secondary to neuroendocrine or cytokine imbalance. The aim of this study was to investigate which hormonal/cytokine profiles could be assigned to a defined category of FTT, namely organic, psychosocial and idiopathic subgroups.

Study Design

34 patients were enrolled and 32 completed the study (12 controls, 12 idiopathic FTT, 5 organic FTT, and 3 psychosocial FTT). Each child was assessed by a pediatric gastroenterologist, dietician, and social worker and underwent appropriate laboratory investigation during which leptin, IL1, IL6 and TNF-alpha levels were determined. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the groups.

Results

IL6 was the only cytokine that showed significant differences between FTT patients (4.06 ± 6.3 pg/ml) and normal controls (0.0 pg/ml (p = 0.028). Leptin values were significantly higher in the normal control group (1632 ± 483 pg/ml) as compared to FTT patients (685 ± 687 pg/ml) (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Our results indicate that leptin does not play a role in the pathogenesis of anorexia in children with FTT. It is however, possible that IL6 may be an important factor in the etiology of anorexia in patients with FTT.

### Multidisciplinary guidelines for the care of late preterm infants [^114Z96Ef]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Short-Term Follow-Up Care

Late preterm infants (LPIs) should be seen by their community primary care provider within 1–2 days after transition/discharge from the hospital; the provider should assess the infant's continued stability, review screening results, ensure ongoing safety, and evaluate the adequacy of support systems. LPIs can appear deceptively vigorous on the first day or two after birth prior to transition/discharge. It is not unusual for morbidities common to LPIs to first appear a few days after transition/discharge. If not detected and managed early, these can quickly escalate and lead to re-hospitalization, increased family stress, and even permanent disability and death.

It is especially important that breastfeeding LPIs be seen within a day after transition/discharge because of the feeding challenges so prevalent in this population. Immature feeding patterns, such as uncoordinated suck/swallow/breathe, ineffective milk transfer, and increased sleepiness because of immature brain/central nervous system (CNS) development, may not be apparent until the mother's milk supply increases on postpartum days 2–5. Feeding failure, in both breastfed and formula-fed newborns, can be caused by other morbidities more common in LPIs, such as respiratory distress, cold stress, sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, low muscle tone, and decreased stamina. Congenital heart disease and patent ductus arteriosis, also more common in LPIs, should be considered for any infant with feeding failure.

The community follow-up care provider should have received a copy of the transition/discharge summary from the in-hospital care provider prior to the initial follow-up visit. To guide evaluation, the follow-up care provider should carefully review maternal and infant history, as well as the infant's hospital course, on the first follow-up visit. Because LPIs have many needs and because it is critically important to assess carefully the issues of continued stability, screening, safety, and support, it may be necessary to schedule extra time for follow-up visits of LPIs. Short-term follow-up care should include weekly assessments until the infant reaches 40 weeks of corrected gestational age (GA) (the infant's due date) or is clearly thriving. More frequent visits may be necessary if weight or bilirubin checks are indicated.

### Defining pediatric failure to thrive in the developed world: validation of a semi-objective diagnosis tool [^1167TDsw]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

There is no concordance between current diagnostic criteria for failure to thrive (FTT). We analyzed validity of the Semi-Objective Failure to Thrive (SOFTT) diagnosis tool, which uses a combination of subjective and objective components to make the diagnosis of FTT. The tool was used to diagnose FTT in 94 patients who met 1 of 7 accepted criteria for FTT. Concurrent and predictive validity were demonstrated using anthropometric z-scores and change in anthropometric z-scores, respectively. SOFTT results correlated with differences in anthropometric z-scores for length (P = 0.011), weight, weight-for-length, body mass index, mid-upper arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness (P < .0001) between those diagnosed as normal and those with FTT. At follow-up, children with FTT compared with children rated as normal had significantly higher change in weight (P ≤ .001) and body mass index (P = 0.026) z-scores. The SOFTT tool leads to the accurate diagnosis of FTT demonstrated by concurrent and predictive validity.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: classification, evaluation, and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infancy [^1121GwR4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) syndrome — definition elements and required exclusions. The definition includes "(2) respiratory signs (e.g., resting tachypnea, adventitious sounds, retractions, digital clubbing, failure to thrive, or respiratory failure); (3) hypoxemia; and (4) diffuse abnormalities on CXR or a CT scan", and specifies "Abnormalities in pulmonary function are not included, because PFT may not be available, particularly in younger children". It further states, "This definition is sensitive for detecting the presence of a chILD disease, but its specificity has not been determined. The definition also has not been studied prospectively (14)". The syndrome "requires that more common causes of DLD have been excluded", including "cystic fibrosis, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary infection, primary ciliary dyskinesia presenting with newborn respiratory distress, and recurrent aspiration".

### Inhalational lung injury associated with humidifier "white dust" [^112ZmkVZ]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Humidifiers are commonly used in the community to relieve symptoms associated with acute respiratory infections in young children; however, clear benefits of these devices have not been documented. The Environmental Protection Agency has not found any adverse health effects related to humidifier use. We report here the case of a young infant with significant accidental inhalational lung injury related to dispersal of mineral dust from an ultrasonic home-use humidifier. The clinical consequences included prolonged hypoxemia, tachypnea, and failure to thrive. Radiography revealed pneumonitis, and pulmonary-function testing showed a nonreversible mild obstructive ventilatory defect. Because of persistent symptoms, evolution of failure to thrive, and nonresponse to inhaled and short courses of systemic glucocorticoids, an aggressive management approach was successfully pursued with high-dose pulse steroid therapy, which could be a potential therapeutic approach for similar patients. In addition, this case raises important questions about the safety of exposing infants and young children to humidifiers and emphasizes the need for further study.

### Diagnosing failure to thrive: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in identical twins [^116DQidF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, posing a diagnostic challenge. When cardinal characteristics, such as conotruncal cardiac anomalies or immunodeficiency, are absent, genetic testing may be delayed, postponing interventions to minimise developmental delay. We present a case of monochorionic monoamniotic identical twins diagnosed with de novo 22q11.2DS around 3 months of life, who lacked major characteristics of the disease. Both infants were admitted and discharged multiple times with consistent concerns for failure to thrive (FTT) and aspiration. Twin B was incidentally found to have asymptomatic hypocalcaemia and hypoparathyroidism, leading to a 22q11.2DS diagnosis. Twin A had no symptoms other than FTT and aspiration. This case encourages considering 22q11.2DS in the differential diagnosis for FTT, even when classic symptoms are absent or delayed in presentation. Early recognition allows for timely intervention and better outcomes.

### Sensory processing difficulties in toddlers with nonorganic failure-to-thrive and feeding problems [^112WN7eL]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Failure-to-thrive is defined as an abnormally low weight and/or height for age. The term "nonorganic failure-to-thrive" (NOFT) has been used to describe "failure-to-thrive" without an obvious cause underlying the growth failure. The purpose of the present study was to compare sensory processing abilities between toddlers with NOFT and feeding problems and age-matched controls.

Methods

Toddlers with NOFT and feeding problems (N = 16) were recruited from the pediatric feeding clinic in a tertiary university hospital, and age-matched controls (N = 16) were recruited from community volunteers. They were evaluated for sensory processing ability using an Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile (ITSP), and for development of cognition, motor skills, and language using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and Sequenced Language Scale for Infants. Behavior at mealtime was evaluated using the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale.

Results

In the NOFT with feeding problems group, atypical performances were more frequently observed in 3 of 5 ITSP section items (tactile, vestibular, and oral) compared with those in the control group. Significant delayed development of cognition, motor skills, and language was observed in the NOFT with feeding problems group compared with that in the control group. In addition, children who showed 1 or more atypical performances in ITSP had delayed development in cognition, motor skills, and language.

Conclusions

Sensory processing problems were more commonly observed in toddlers with feeding problems and growth deficiency. The present study could provide a preliminary evidence for a possible impact of the sensory processing problems on the feeding difficulties in toddlers with NOFT. Future large studies should be conducted to clarify the relation between sensory processing difficulties and feeding problems in toddlers.

### Consensus recommendation for a diagnostic guideline for acid sphingomyelinase deficiency [^113jrk5G]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Appendix: Case Vignettes

The following are fictitious case vignettes based on real-life cases and are meant to describe the symptoms that may help differentiate between the different forms of ASMD as well as highlight the difficulty in establishing a proper clinical diagnosis based solely on a patient's genotype.

Case 1: Infantile neurovisceral ASMD

A male infant with Eastern European Jewish ancestry presented at 3 months of age with hepatosplenomegaly. At 4 months of age, notable signs and symptoms included elevated liver transaminases, gastroesophageal reflux, and failure to thrive. In addition, at 4 months of age, the patient was hospitalized for failure to thrive. Hypotonia with poor head control was noted. Enzyme assay for ASM activity was performed at 5 months of age and the diagnosis of ASMD was made. Genotyping showed a common mutation associated with infantile neurovisceral ASMD in patients of Eastern European Jewish ancestry as well as a novel frameshift mutation. At 10 months of age, the patient was unable to sit independently or hold a bottle. The patient had progressive failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, and neurologic deterioration. He died at 2 years of age.

Comment: This is the classic presentation and course for infantile neurovisceral ASMD. The severity of the symptoms at a very young age together with the relevant ancestry should prompt early medical attention and diagnosis.

### International consensus guideline on small for gestational age: etiology and management from infancy to early adulthood [^1173wdLt]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for intrauterine growth restriction, more specifically with respect to postnatal infant surveillance (GH therapy), ICG-SGA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate GH treatment in children born SGA with persistent short stature at an age after which catch-up growth is unlikely to occur (at the age of 3–4 years in most children), provided other common causes for short stature have been excluded.

### The need for vigilance: the case of a false-negative newborn screen for cystic fibrosis [^111K97u1]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disorder in the white population. CF is caused by abnormalities in the gene that codes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) and may result in severe chronic lung disease, poor growth, and malnutrition. Physicians often do not consider CF in the differential diagnosis of an infant with failure to thrive in the presence of a negative newborn screening (NBS) result. In Minnesota, newborn infants are screened for CF by immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) testing followed by DNA analysis if the IRT screen result is abnormal. All positive NBS results are followed by confirmatory sweat-testing by pilocarpine iontophoresis. We present here the case of a 1-month-old white boy with failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, and severe malnutrition. Minnesota state CF NBS results were negative at birth (IRT: 43 ng/mL [96% cutoff value: 52 ng/mL]). Clinical symptoms resulted in sweat-testing by Gibson-Cooke pilocarpine iontophoresis at 1 month of age, and the result was positive (102 mmol Cl(-)/L [normal: ≤ 30 mmol Cl(-)/L]). CFTR mutation analysis confirmed a homozygous f508del genotype, and stool pancreatic elastase testing revealed severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. This case represents the first known false-negative result in Minnesota since the initiation of NBS for CF in 2006, which illustrates the importance of considering CF in the evaluation of an infant with failure to thrive and symptoms of malabsorption, regardless of NBS results.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of eosinophilic esophagitis [^1166XFMP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Eosinophilic esophagitis — symptoms across ages and diagnostic considerations: For the first step, symptoms vary by age; in adolescents and adults, dysphagia and food impaction are most common, although heartburn and chest pain can be present as well, while in infants and young children, poor growth, failure to thrive, feeding intolerance, failure to progress to solid foods, increased time needed for eating, or food refusal can be seen, and in school-aged children, abdominal pain, vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn are common. All symptoms of EoE are non-specific and have a broad differential diagnosis, and special attention should be paid when eliciting symptoms of dysphagia because patients can use food avoidance and modification behaviors to minimize these symptoms over long periods, leading to diagnostic delays.

### Failure to thrive in infants with complicated facial hemangiomas [^113koNcQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

We have observed that some children with facial hemangiomas of infancy have feeding difficulties coincident with periods of failure to thrive. We evaluated the early oral sensory and feeding experiences of four children with facial hemangiomas through medical record review and parental surveys to investigate their contribution to the patients' failure to thrive. All children with feeding irregularities experienced some degree of oral sensory impairment and required early oral sensory intervention, but there were varying reports of difficulty or delay in the development of oral feeding. The nature of these difficulties is discussed. Infants with complicated facial hemangiomas with perioral and airway involvement may be at higher risk for feeding and oral sensory problems. We recommend close monitoring for failure to thrive and early evaluation by speech or occupational therapists.

### Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy [^116KBHYs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food-induced allergic disorders (non-IgE-GI-FAs) account for an unknown proportion of food allergies and include food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Non-IgE-GI-FAs are separate clinical entities but have many overlapping clinical and histologic features among themselves and with eosinophilic gastroenteropathies. Over the past decade, FPIES has emerged as the most actively studied non-IgE-GI-FA, potentially because of acute and distinct clinical features. FPIAP remains among the common causes of rectal bleeding in infants, while classic infantile FPE is rarely diagnosed. The overall most common allergens are cow's milk and soy; in patients with FPIES, rice and oat are also common. The most prominent clinical features of FPIES are repetitive emesis, pallor, and lethargy; chronic FPIES can lead to failure to thrive. FPIAP manifests with bloody stools in well-appearing young breast-fed or formula-fed infants. Features of FPE are nonbloody diarrhea, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy, hypoalbuminemia, and failure to thrive. Non-IgE-GI-FAs have a favorable prognosis; the majority resolve by 1 year in patients with FPIAP, 1 to 3 years in patients with FPE, and 1 to 5 years in patients with FPIES, with significant differences regarding specific foods. There is an urgent need to better define the natural history of FPIES and the pathophysiology of non-IgE-GI-FAs to develop biomarkers and novel therapies.

### Child with suspected short stature [^1164WAx6]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of short stature — common causes and idiopathic short stature criteria are specified as follows: Common causes include familial or intrinsic short stature, constitutional delay of growth and puberty, idiopathic short stature, and small for gestational age without catch up growth by 2 years. In constitutional delay, children typically cross percentiles downwards in the first 3 years and then grow at a normal growth velocity on the lower percentiles or just below the 3rd percentile, and bone age is delayed. Idiopathic short stature is defined as height < 2.25 SD below the mean for age and sex (shortest 1.2% of children) – FDA definition, with notes that patients are unlikely to attain adult height in the normal range (less than 63 inches for boys and 59 inches for girls) and that diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes of short stature.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: classification, evaluation, and management of childhood interstitial lung disease in infancy [^112qw7NX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) in infancy — genetic testing is described for suspected monogenic causes of chILD. Several single-gene disorders have been identified that can result in chILD syndrome, and patients are generally selected for genetic testing if the clinician recognizes clinical, radiographic, and/or histopathologic characteristics of a genetic disorder. Because phenotypes overlap, more than one gene is often analyzed, and gene prioritization depends on age of presentation, mode of inheritance, or extrapulmonary findings. In newborns with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension, etiologies include alveolar-capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD-MPV) and mutations in SFTPB, ABCA3, and possibly SFTPC, and ACD-MPV may include cardiac, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary malformations. Another phenotype with hypothyroidism and chorea may reflect loss-of-function mutations or deletions of NKX2.1, and in infants and young children, diffuse lung disease with failure to thrive and alveolar proteinosis may be due to loss-of-function mutations or deletions in CSF2RA and CSF2RB. Although genetic testing may be relatively expensive, it is rarely harmful and can provide a definitive diagnosis and obviate unnecessary procedures, but the sensitivity and specificity of genetic testing for chILD disorders has not been formally evaluated so false-positive and false-negative rates cannot be estimated; the committee assumed these rates are low.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms in infancy: a population-based prospective study [^116hWykR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Background

During the first months of life, infants can suffer from many 'minor' gastroenterological disturbances. However, little is known about the frequency of these problems and the factors which predispose or facilitate their onset.

Aims

(a) To ascertain the frequency of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in infants during the first 6 months after birth; (b) to evaluate the influence of some variables on the onset of the symptoms.

Study Design and Patients

Each of the 150 paediatricians distributed throughout Italy followed 20 consecutive infants from birth to 6 months. 2879 infants (1422 f, 1457 m) concluded the study. The presence of the following symptoms was evaluated: constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting, regurgitation, failure to thrive and prolonged crying fits (colic). Symptoms were recorded whenever the parents requested a clinical check-up or during a set monthly examination.

Results

1582/2879 (54.9%) infants suffered from one of the gastrointestinal symptoms. Regurgitation was the most common disturbance (present in 23.1% of infants), followed by colic (20.5%), constipation (17.6%), failure to thrive (15.2%), vomiting (6%) and diarrhoea (4.1%). Low birth weight was the factor most frequently associated with the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by low gestational age. Feeding habits did not influence the onset of symptoms, with the exception of constipation, which was linked to a low frequency of breast-feeding. Ninety-three infants (3.2%) were hospitalised for one or more of the gastrointestinal symptoms which were considered. During the whole study period the type of formula-milk was changed in 60% of the infants with one or more gastrointestinal symptoms, and in 15.5% of the infants who did not suffer from any gastrointestinal troubles.

Conclusions

Gastrointestinal symptoms are very common in infants during the first 6 months after birth. These symptoms required hospitalisation only in a small percentage of cases, but led to the prescription of a 'dietary' milk formula in approximately 60% of the cases. Low birth weight and low gestational age were the main factors influencing the onset of the symptoms.

### Growth in children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia during the first year of life [^1172JKX2]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) have high rates of mortality and long-term morbidity, including poor growth and failure to thrive. The aim of this study was to describe growth patterns during the first year of life in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia in a non-ECMO cohort.

Methods

Medical records of infants with CDH admitted to our center between January 2005 and December 2011 were reviewed. Infants with anthropometric measurements at 3, 6 and 12months were included. Anthropometric measurements were obtained for the first year of life. Logistic regression analyses were performed to find predictive associations with failure to thrive (FTT).

Result

Of the 45 survivors, 38 were seen twice (84%) and 24 (53%) were seen on three occasions to age 12months. Poor growth was observed with weight being most affected. FTT was present in 63% during the first six months of life. Days of mechanical ventilation were the only predictor of FTT. Besides poor weight gain, height and head circumference were also reduced. However, catch-up growth occurred during the second half of infancy and at age 12months failure to thrive had reduced by two thirds to 21%.

Conclusions

Poor growth is a common early finding in CDH patients, which improves during infancy. This emphasizes the importance of close follow-up and aggressive nutritional management in CDH patients.

### Breastfeeding and the use of human milk [^116KaUyu]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Breastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. Given the documented short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding, infant nutrition should be considered a public health issue and not only a lifestyle choice. The American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirms its recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant. Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. Infant growth should be monitored with the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Curve Standards to avoid mislabeling infants as underweight or failing to thrive. Hospital routines to encourage and support the initiation and sustaining of exclusive breastfeeding should be based on the American Academy of Pediatrics-endorsed WHO/UNICEF "Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding". National strategies supported by the US Surgeon General's Call to Action, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and The Joint Commission are involved to facilitate breastfeeding practices in US hospitals and communities. Pediatricians play a critical role in their practices and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and thus should be knowledgeable about the health risks of not breastfeeding, the economic benefits to society of breastfeeding, and the techniques for managing and supporting the breastfeeding dyad. The "Business Case for Breastfeeding" details how mothers can maintain lactation in the workplace and the benefits to employers who facilitate this practice.

### Catch-up growth in infants and young children with faltering growth: expert opinion to guide general clinicians [^112uR6JS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Agreed Statements

Nutritional management of FG should consider the cause of the growth faltering and intervention should be tailored towards the underlying problem.
Nutritional management of disease- and non-disease-related FG requires a balanced ratio of energy and protein in addition to micronutrients for optimal catch-up.
Nutritional management of disease-related FG should consider macro and micronutrient requirements specific to the underlying diagnosis.
Nutritional management of non-disease-related FG should also manage the underlying cause which may include feeding difficulties, inappropriate dietary elimination, and food security.
Breastfeeding should be supported in both disease- and non-disease-related FG by ensuring assessing technique and supply and only where appropriate infant milk fortification, cup feeding, or supplementary formula should be considered.
In formula-fed infants ready to use energy dense therapeutic feeds with proven efficacy should be used, where available; if these are not available suitable locally available powdered feeds can be used, applying WHO hygiene safety for mixing.
Modular additions of only fat and carbohydrates to feed and food should be avoided, as this reduces the protein energy ratio.
Nutritional management for both medical and non-medical FG should include either/both the fortification of accepted foods and advice on foods that are naturally energy dense and locally available. In the case when nutritional requirements of the nutritional management plan cannot be met through oral intake, a nutritional management plan should entail enteral (ie, tube) feeding. Monitoring by a multidisciplinary nutrition support team should be provided to minimize the risk of EN-associated complications. In LMICs children with acute severe malnutrition who fail the appetite test and/or are clinically unwell should be treated as inpatients. WHO guidelines should be followed to determine the need for vitamin A supplementation or antibiotic treatment.
Micronutrient deficiencies need to be corrected as part of the nutritional treatment plan, with appropriate therapeutic dosages and monitoring of the intervention is required at an interval appropriate for the deficiency.
The nutritional management plan should include a target for appropriate catch-up growth that is monitored at an interval that is deemed appropriate by the health care professional, the available health care service, and the severity of the FG.

### Pediatric hospital admissions in indigenous children: a population-based study in remote Australia [^1125Q51z]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We analysed hospital admissions of a predominantly Aboriginal cohort of children in the remote Fitzroy Valley in Western Australia during the first 7 years of life.

Methods

All children born between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003 and living in the Fitzroy Valley in 2009–2010 were eligible to participate in the Lililwan Project. Of 134 eligible children, 127 (95%) completed Stage 1 (interviews of caregivers and medical record review) in 2011 and comprised our cohort. Lifetime (0–7 years) hospital admission data were available and included the dates, and reasons for admission, and comorbidities. Conditions were coded using ICD-10-AM discharge codes.

Results

Of the 127 children, 95.3% were Indigenous and 52.8% male. There were 314 admissions for 424 conditions in 89 (70.0%) of 127 children. The 89 children admitted had a median of five admissions (range 1–12). Hospitalization rates were similar for both genders (p = 0.4). Of the admissions, 108 (38.6%) were for 56 infants aged < 12 months (median = 2.5, range = 1–8). Twelve of these admissions were in neonates (aged 0–28 days).

Primary reasons for admission (0–7 years) were infections of the lower respiratory tract (27.4%), gastrointestinal system (22.7%), and upper respiratory tract (11.4%), injury (7.0%), and failure to thrive (5.4%). Comorbidities, particularly upper respiratory tract infections (18.1%), failure to thrive (13.6%), and anaemia (12.7%), were common.

In infancy, primary cause for admission were infections of the lower respiratory tract (40.8%), gastrointestinal (25.9%) and upper respiratory tract (9.3%). Comorbidities included upper respiratory tract infections (33.3%), failure to thrive (18.5%) and anaemia (18.5%).

Conclusion

In the Fitzroy Valley 70.0% of children were hospitalised at least once before age 7 years and over one third of admissions were in infants. Infections were the most common reason for admission in all age groups but comorbidities were common and may contribute to need for admission. Many hospitalizations were feasibly preventable. High admission rates reflect disadvantage, remote location and limited access to primary healthcare and outpatient services. Ongoing public health prevention initiatives including breast feeding, vaccination, healthy diet, hygiene and housing improvements are crucial, as is training of Aboriginal Health Workers to increase services in remote communities.

### Acquired Brucella bacteraemia in a young infant [^1139tEKz]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

An infant aged 6 weeks presented with failure to thrive since birth, fever and lethargy for 4 days. The child was fed on unpasteurised diluted goat's milk after birth. She was diagnosed to have brucellosis both by blood culture and serology. Her mother's Brucella serology was negative. She was successfully treated with injection amikacin and tablet rifampicin and had satisfactory weight gain thereafter. Acquired brucellosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of failure to thrive in young infants.

### ABM clinical protocol # 10: breastfeeding the late preterm (34–36 6 / 7 weeks of gestation) and early term infants (37–38 6 / 7 weeks of gestation), second revision 2016 [^115SvpdC]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Late preterm and early term infants — risk profile and monitoring — Close observation and monitoring are required, especially in the first 12–24 hours after birth when the risk of inadequate adaptation to extra-uterine life is the highest. Late preterm infants born at 34 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks of gestation have a 50% risk for morbidity during the birth hospitalization, and early term infants, born between 37 0/7 and 38 6/7 weeks of gestation, are also at higher risk compared with term infants, born between 39 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks of gestation, for problems including hyperbilirubinemia, hospital readmission, and reduced breastfeeding initiation and duration. Morbidities in late preterm infants include hypothermia, hypoglycemia, excessive weight loss, dehydration, slow weight gain, failure to thrive, prolonged infant formula supplementation, exaggerated jaundice, kernicterus, dehydration, fever secondary to dehydration, sepsis, apnea, re-hospitalization, and breastfeeding failure, and transfer to a higher level of care for appropriate care and monitoring may be needed.

### Factors affecting the growth of infants diagnosed with cystic fibrosis by newborn screening [^111awHBS]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The implementation of newborn screening (NBS) has fundamentally changed the care of children with cystic fibrosis (CF). They are now identified in the first few weeks of life and no longer have to wait for the presenting symptoms to become severe enough to warrant investigation. Historically, this wait was often associated with failure to thrive and irreversible lung damage. CF-NBS improves outcomes, particularly nutritional ones. This is important for children with CF as nutritional status is closely related to lung function, quality of life and ultimately survival. The nutritional benefits of CF-NBS are maintained into adulthood.

Despite early diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate treatment, some infants diagnosed with CF by NBS do not achieve optimal growth. Antenatal factors such as maternal smoking or poor nutrition can contribute to this, as can postnatal factors such as acute or chronic respiratory infections, adherence with therapy, nutritional intake, dose of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and other environmental exposures. It would be useful for clinicians to know which variables have the most significant impact on infant growth. This would mean children at higher risk of growth failure could be identified and considered for more careful monitoring of growth and/or earlier nutritional support. We collated NBS, demographic, microbiology and growth data on a cohort of children diagnosed with CF by NBS. We then used classification modelling to establish the factors / variables useful in predicting infant growth.

### Cystic fibrosis in three children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^116WwcCQ]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are two common causes of chronic lung disease in children. Patients with BPD or CF often have recurrent respiratory symptoms, failure to thrive, and/or metabolic alkalosis during infancy and childhood. Thus, recognizing the diagnosis of CF in an infant with BPD can be difficult. We present three infants with both BPD and CF. The infants shared a history of respiratory distress and prolonged oxygen requirements. All three also had difficulty gaining weight, even after pancreatic enzyme supplementation was instituted. Metabolic alkalosis was observed in two infants. Previous studies in children with CF suggest that early diagnosis may impact both lung health and nutritional status. A high index of suspicion is necessary for clinicians to identify these children early and intervene with appropriate therapy.

b No vaccine dose was received by this group B woman.

n, number of participants with that outcome of special interest.

Adverse neonatal/infant outcomes of interest and median days between outcomes and vaccination are described in Table 3 and illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 3, with their definitions in Extended Data Table 3 and 95% CI half-widths of the frequency of outcomes of interest in Supplementary Table 2. Adverse neonatal/infant outcomes of interest were reported in 251 of 964 (26.0%, 95% CI = 23.3–28.9%) infants in group A and 251 of 981 (25.6%, 95% CI = 22.9–28.4%) infants in group B. The most frequently reported outcome was small for gestational age (group A — 138/964 (14.3%), 95% CI = 12.2–16.7%), group B — 116/981 (11.8%), 95% CI = 9.9–14.0%)). In group A, other adverse outcomes of interest with at least 1.0% frequency included failure to thrive (87/964 (9.0%), 95% CI = 7.3–11.0%)), low birth weight (45/964 (4.7%), 95% CI = 3.4–6.2%)), preterm birth (26/964 (2.7%), 95% CI = 1.8–3.9%)) and neonatal death (11/964 (1.1%), 95% CI = 0.6–2.0%)). In group B, other adverse outcomes of interest with at least 1.0% frequency included failure to thrive (101/981 (10.3%), 95% CI = 8.5–12.4%)), low birth weight (49/981 (5.0%), 95% CI = 3.7–6.6%)), preterm birth (30/981 (3.1%), 95% CI = 2.1–4.3%)) and congenital anomaly (11/981 (1.1%), 95% CI = 0.6–2.0%)). Although the study was not designed to evaluate adverse neonatal/infant outcomes of interest by trimester, these data are shown in Extended Data Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 2.

### Incorporating recognition and management of perinatal depression into pediatric practice [^114oKKTX]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Perinatal depression — impact on the infant, dyad, and family is described as exposing infants of mothers with significant depression to toxic stress with downstream risks for impaired social interaction and delays in multiple developmental domains, along with impaired parenting behaviors and safety judgment; in severe cases, consequences can include suicide or infanticide. Maternal PPD can hinder bonding, distort perception of the infant, reduce maternal sensitivity or increase controlling behavior, and impair attention to health and safety, and infants may be at risk for failure to thrive and attachment disorders of infancy. Early response to PPD is described as urgent, and effects can extend to preschoolers and older children, with untreated cases associated with poor self-control, poor peer relationships, school problems, aggression, potential need for special education services, grade retention, early school exit, and persistence of attachment disorders, behavior problems, and mood disorders into childhood and adolescence.

### Global consensus recommendations on prevention and management of nutritional rickets [^116wNRwz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are common worldwide, causing nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents; the consequences can be lethal or can last into adulthood. The goals of this evidence-based consensus document are to provide health care professionals with guidance for prevention, diagnosis, and management of nutritional rickets and to provide policy makers with a framework to work toward its eradication.

Evidence

A systematic literature search examining the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nutritional rickets in children was conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system that describe the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence.

Process

Thirty-three nominated experts in pediatric endocrinology, pediatrics, nutrition, epidemiology, public health, and health economics evaluated the evidence on specific questions within five working groups. The consensus group, representing 11 international scientific organizations, participated in a multiday conference in May 2014 to reach a global evidence-based consensus.

Results

This consensus document defines nutritional rickets and its diagnostic criteria and describes the clinical management of rickets and osteomalacia. Risk factors, particularly in mothers and infants, are ranked, and specific prevention recommendations including food fortification and supplementation are offered for both the clinical and public health contexts.

Conclusion

Rickets, osteomalacia, and vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are preventable global public health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Implementation of international rickets prevention programs, including supplementation and food fortification, is urgently required.

### Inflammatory bowel disease in children 5 years of age and younger [^111a7zCA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can affect all age groups, although it has not been well described in infants and young children. Our aim was to evaluate early onset IBD in patients 5 yr of age and younger.

Methods

Medical records of patients diagnosed with early onset IBD at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 1977 and 2000 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three categories: those with Crohn's disease (CD), those with ulcerative colitis (UC), and those with indeterminant colitis (IC).

Results

A total of 82 patients fulfilled the criteria. In 12 patients (15%), the IBD diagnosis was changed during the course of illness. At the end of the follow-up period, linear growth failure was present in 10 of 35 (29%) children with CD, one of 30 (3%) with UC, and three of 17 (18%) with IC. Failure to thrive was a frequent presenting symptom in children with CD (44%) and IC (39%), whereas in all four patients with UC and failure to thrive the diagnosis was subsequently changed to CD or IC. A high proportion of patients with CD had large bowel (89%), and perianal (34%) disease. None of the tested patients were positive for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), and 10 tested positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (three of five patients with CD, five of seven with UC, and two of three with IC).

Conclusions

Failure to thrive, at the time of presentation, is indicative of a final diagnosis of CD or IC, not UC. Linear growth failure is a common finding in patients with early onset CD. A high proportion of patients with CD have failure to thrive, colonic, and perianal disease. The IBD serology panel is of limited clinical relevance in providing definitive diagnostic information in this pediatric population.

### ASPEN definitions in pediatric intestinal failure [^113HxdKk]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Aspen Pediatric Intestinal Failure (PIF) Section — pediatric intestinal failure is a relatively rare disease requiring focused interdisciplinary care and specialized nutrition management; because there has long been a lack of consensus in the definition of key terms related to PIF, this document is the product of an effort by the Section to create evidence-based consensus definitions with the goal of allowing appropriate comparisons between clinical studies and measurement of long-term patient outcomes; the paper has been approved by the ASPEN Board of Directors, and the definitions should have direct relevance to the daily management of children with intestinal failure by allowing providers across disciplines and centers to speak a common language.

### The diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): the primary immune deficiency treatment consortium (PIDTC) 2022 definitions [^111Cz6tj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) was established to investigate natural history and outcomes for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other rare primary immune deficiencies by means of prospective and retrospective natural history studies. Criteria for the diagnosis of SCID, using tests commonly applied at participating centers, were developed for PIDTC protocols beginning in 2010. The early diagnostic experience, codified by Dr William Shearer and collaborators in the PIDTC 2014 Criteria, proposed definitions for typical SCID, leaky SCID, and Omenn syndrome, with the goal of facilitating a rigorous analysis of consistent subtypes of SCID, independent of clinical factors such as infections or failure to thrive. These definitions, based on review of the 332 patients with SCID enrolled in the retrospective PIDTC Protocol 6902, between 2000 and 2009, mainly considered T-cell numbers, naive versus memory T cells, T-cell proliferative responses to PHA, and transplacentally acquired maternal engraftment (TME) of T cells.

Between 2014 and 2021, both clinical presentation and diagnosis of SCID have changed with widespread adoption of newborn screening (NBS) and improved availability of gene sequencing. – Current enrollment into the PIDTC Protocols for SCID has made possible analyses showing that the 2014 Criteria should now be refined to incorporate these and other contemporary advances. Universal NBS for SCID by enumerating T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in dried blood spots collected at birth has radically altered how infants with SCID in the United States and most infants in Canada are now identified. NBS has also brought to attention a new category of patients: very young infants (typically aged < 30 days) with low TRECs and T-cell lymphopenia in whom SCID is suspected, but not yet confirmed. Simultaneously, genetic sequencing has become faster, cheaper, and widely available, and so causative pathogenic gene variants are identified in more than 90% of patients with SCID.

### Infants and children 6–59 months of age with severe wasting and / or nutritional oedema: evidence gaps identified during WHO guideline development [^113wbidN]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The way forward

The 2023 WHO guideline comes at a critical juncture with the risk of severe wasting and nutritional oedema increasing particularly in regions experiencing conflict, food insecurity and economic instability. This guideline promotes evidence-informed care that can be scaled and integrated into broader systems, ensuring that vulnerable children receive life-saving support even as global conditions remain unpredictable or worsen.

However, despite presenting recommendations based on the best available evidence, significant evidence gaps remain. Standardised research protocols with a clearly defined set of core outcomes could help to generate data that can be pooled to provide higher certainty evidence that will impact the development of future guidelines, ensuring that recommendations are based on relevant, comparable evidence. These core outcomes, when integrated into research and clinical practice workflows, will allow for harmonisation of outcome assessments across different contexts.

Additionally, there is an ethical imperative to definitively answer fundamental questions about dosage, efficacy and adverse effects of current treatment protocols as failure to do so could result in ineffective or harmful treatment, misused resources and inequity in care. Future randomised controlled trials with proper ethical oversight could be used to test different dosages or treatment regimens and implement adaptive trial designs that respond to findings in real time and reduce participant risks.

This guideline calls researchers to address evidence gaps, focus on operational feasibility and promote contextualised research. Funders are urged to invest in implementation research and priority areas identified by the WHO, and policy-makers are encouraged to strengthen health systems and build equity and access. It is therefore critical for researchers, practitioners, decision-makers and funders to align on key knowledge priorities to provide the evidence that will help ensure better short-term, medium-term and long-term outcomes for infants and children 6–59 months of age with severe wasting and/or nutritional oedema.

### Contemporary definitions of infant growth failure and neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in extremely premature infants at two years of age [^116kjV4b]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Growth from birth to NICU discharge

Of the original 941 infants enrolled in the trial, 692 survived and had at least one BSID-III subscale score assessed at 2-year follow-up. After excluding infants who had mechanical ventilation at discharge (n = 17), ventriculomegaly (n = 39), and missing follow-up body measurement data (n = 46), n = 590 infants met the criteria for this secondary analysis. Maternal and child characteristics for infants with length growth cohorts are shown in Table 1, weight growth cohorts in Supplementary Table 1, and OFC growth cohorts in Table 2. Growth velocities and common co-morbidities of prematurity including necrotizing enterocolitis, severe ICH, BPD, symptomatic culture-positive sepsis, and length of stay are included. BMI z-score at 2 years did not differ between those with weight or length accelerated, normal growth, or GF during their initial hospitalization. Birth to discharge weight z-score change was positively associated with length z-score change (r² = 0.16, p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 1A) and OFC z-score change (r² = 0.21, p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 1C). Birth to discharge OFC z-score change was positively associated with length z-score change (r² = 0.09, p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. 1B).

### Guidance on forgoing life-sustaining medical treatment [^112DGZXL]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Neonatal prognosis in severe conditions — For some newborn infants who were born at extremely low gestational age (< 25 weeks), survived profound asphyxia, possess certain life-threatening congenital anomalies, or have multiple organ system failure, the AAP recognizes that "prognosis is uncertain but likely to be very poor", and survival may be accompanied by a high risk of "permanent, severe neurodevelopmental and other special health care needs" and diminished quality of life.

### Early infant growth impairment in the setting of frequent exclusive breast feeding: considering therapeutic options [^112wTevi]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

To identify a strategy that has the potential to reduce the prevalence of infant growth impairment in locations where best practices to support EBF did not, our study team conducted initial stakeholder visits and qualitative data collection in Guinea-Bissau, Nepal, Pakistan and Uganda, including focus groups and key informant interviews to explore local attitudes and experiences related to newborn feeding. Both in Guinea-Bissau and Uganda, there was a high degree of local concern regarding failure to thrive among some EBF infants and high interest in developing therapeutic options. Observational data in these locations showed that the risk of being underweight at 30 days of age was increased 6-fold among infants who were low birth weight and 10-fold among those who weighed < 2600 g on the 4th day after birth.

Based on this qualitative and observational data as well as on stakeholder feedback, the Preventing Infant Malnutrition with Early Supplementation (PRIMES) pilot randomised controlled trial was designed to test the efficacy of supplementing early breast feeding with a small daily volume of formula to improve growth for breastfeeding infants identified as at-risk due to risk factors demonstrated by the initial observational work. The trial's initial design was modified based on feedback from ethical committees overseeing the study, including the Makerere University School of Public Health Research and Ethics Committee, the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, the Guinea-Bissau Committee of Health and Ethics and the Institutional Review Board of the University of California San Francisco. PRIMES has been monitored by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board consisting of physicians, scientists and epidemiologists from Africa, Europe and the USA.

### Does persistent inflammatory catabolic syndrome exist in critically ill neonates? [^115i7CYx]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent inflammatory catabolic syndrome (PICS) has not been described in the infant population. This study proposes a definition of PICS in critically ill infants.

Methods

A published adult criterion of PICS was modified using anthropometric and biochemical reference ranges for infants. A prospective chart review of admissions to a tertiary surgical neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was performed over 65 days. Demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, and other clinical variables such as length of stay and medication use were collected daily throughout admission. Infants were categorized as having or not having PICS.

Results

Twenty percent of admitted infants (n = 15) developed PICS using the proposed criteria. Infants with PICS were more likely to be classified as failure to thrive (53%), meeting only 75% of their anticipated weight gain. Significantly more infants with PICS had undergone surgery (100%; P = 0.01), received inotropic medication (40%; P = 0.05), and had longer NICU and total hospital length of stay (P < .001 and P < .001). Infants with PICS had higher peak glucose levels (11.8 ± 7.3 mmol/L) and elevated urea concentrations (7.9 ± 4.6 mmol/L).

Conclusions

PICS does exist in a critically ill neonatal population and may be identified using the definition proposed in this study. Infants with PICS displayed metabolic dysregulation, impaired expected growth velocity, and longer length of stay despite no differences in severity scores or diagnosis between the groups. Validation of this work is required, and research into timely identification of infants with PICS is needed to inform whether these infants would benefit from earlier and novel nutrition intervention.

### Every newborn: progress, priorities, and potential beyond survival [^1124cj2i]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

In this Series paper, we review trends since the 2005 Lancet Series on Neonatal Survival to inform acceleration of progress for newborn health post-2015. On the basis of multicountry analyses and multi-stakeholder consultations, we propose national targets for 2035 of no more than 10 stillbirths per 1000 total births, and no more than 10 neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths, compatible with the under-5 mortality targets of no more than 20 per 1000 livebirths. We also give targets for 2030. Reduction of neonatal mortality has been slower than that for maternal and child (1–59 months) mortality, slowest in the highest burden countries, especially in Africa, and reduction is even slower for stillbirth rates. Birth is the time of highest risk, when more than 40% of maternal deaths (total about 290,000) and stillbirths or neonatal deaths (5.5 million) occur every year. These deaths happen rapidly, needing a rapid response by health-care workers. The 2.9 million annual neonatal deaths worldwide are attributable to three main causes: infections (0.6 million), intrapartum conditions (0.7 million), and preterm birth complications (1.0 million). Boys have a higher biological risk of neonatal death, but girls often have a higher social risk. Small size at birth — due to preterm birth or small-for-gestational-age (SGA), or both — is the biggest risk factor for more than 80% of neonatal deaths and increases risk of post-neonatal mortality, growth failure, and adult-onset non-communicable diseases. South Asia has the highest SGA rates and sub-Saharan Africa has the highest preterm birth rates. Babies who are term SGA low birthweight (10.4 million in these regions) are at risk of stunting and adult-onset metabolic conditions. 15 million preterm births, especially of those younger than 32 weeks' gestation, are at the highest risk of neonatal death, with ongoing post-neonatal mortality risk, and important risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment, stunting, and non-communicable conditions. 4 million neonates annually have other life-threatening or disabling conditions including intrapartum-related brain injury, severe bacterial infections, or pathological jaundice. Half of the world's newborn babies do not get a birth certificate, and most neonatal deaths and almost all stillbirths have no death certificate. To count deaths is crucial to change them. Failure to improve birth outcomes by 2035 will result in an estimated 116 million deaths, 99 million survivors with disability or lost development potential, and millions of adults at increased risk of non-communicable diseases after low birthweight. In the post-2015 era, improvements in child survival, development, and human capital depend on ensuring a healthy start for every newborn baby — the citizens and workforce of the future.

### Hospital readmissions among infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^112LWZKZ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this cohort study is the first to use the latest nationally representative data to comprehensively examine all causes of hospital readmissions for infants born with NOWS. There are 3 key findings from this analysis of hospital discharge records representing nearly 14 million newborns: (1) infants with NOWS had a 90-day all-cause readmission rate of 4.2% compared with 3.0% for infants without NOWS; (2) after risk adjustment, readmissions for failure to thrive, seizures, and serious injuries, including head injuries, were substantially higher in infants with NOWS; and (3) infants with NOWS were more likely to be readmitted with a diagnosis of confirmed maltreatment from neglect but not physical abuse.

Our findings based on national data are consistent with previous regional and hospital-based studies. Specifically, Patrick et alexamined 30-day readmissions in the state of New York between 2006 and 2009 and found that infants with NOWS had a readmission risk of 3.0% compared with 3.7% for late-preterm births and 1.9% for uncomplicated full-term births. In an analysis of pediatric hospital data, Milliren et alfound that 9.9% of infants with NOWS were readmitted within 1 year. In these previous studies, however, the adjusted risk of readmission was 1.5 to 2.5 times higher for infants with NOWS, which is notably higher than our adjusted results. These studies examined different readmission time frames and comparison groups and included data from approximately 1 decade earlier than those we used. Our up-to-date national data showed that of the 5 medical conditions we examined, only 2 led to early readmissions (ie, within 90 days) for infants with NOWS: seizures and failure to thrive.

### Impact of prenatal and / or postnatal growth problems in low birth weight preterm infants on school-age outcomes: an 8-year longitudinal evaluation [^1116krF9]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the 8-year growth, cognitive, behavioral status, health status, and academic achievement in low birth weight preterm infants who had failure to thrive only, were small for gestational age only, had failure to thrive plus were small for gestational age, or had normal growth.

Methods

A total of 985 infants received standardized evaluations to age 8; 180 infants met the criteria for failure to thrive between 4 and 36 months' gestational corrected age. The following outcome variables were collected at age 8: growth, cognitive, behavioral status, health status, and academic achievement. Multivariate analyses were performed among the 4 growth groups on all 8-year outcome variables.

Results

Children who both were small for gestational age and had failure to thrive were the smallest in all growth variables at age 8, and they also demonstrated the lowest cognitive and academic achievement scores. The children with failure to thrive only were significantly smaller than the children with normal growth in all growth variables and had significantly lower IQ scores. Those who were small for gestational age only did not differ from those with normal growth in any cognitive or academic achievement measures. There were no differences among the 4 groups in behavioral status or general health status.

Conclusion

Low birth weight preterm infants who develop postnatal growth problems, particularly when associated with prenatal growth problems, demonstrate lower physical size, cognitive scores, and academic achievement at age 8. There does not seem to be an independent affect of small for gestational age status on 8-year cognitive status and academic achievement when postnatal growth is adequate.

### Improvement in BMI z-score following adenotonsillectomy in adolescents aged 12–18 years: a retrospective cohort study [^112WnvSL]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common childhood disorder with a prevalence of 1–6% in the pediatric population Clinically the syndrome is characterized by a disordered sleep with snoring and respiratory disturbances due to upper airway obstruction during sleep. For infants and toddlers untreated OSAS can lead to retardation of growth with a failure to thrive which is present in up to 56% of the children who are diagnosed with OSA. Risk factors for childhood OSA may be to some extent inheritance/genetics or obesity. Clearly adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the most common cause for OSA in children, and adenotonsillectomy (T&A) is considered the first line treatment. This is based both on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS). An association was found between OSA and cardiovascular impairment as well as problems with learning and behavior in school aged children.

During infancy and early childhood, OSA frequently results in failure to thrive (FTT), in up to 50% of cases. Infants and toddlers under 4–6 years old with FTT seem to benefit from growth acceleration after conducting T&A with increase in BMI Z-score in these ages. During school years, weight gain was reported in children with OSA treated with T&A compared to children with OSA who were not treated at a 7–24 months follow up. The increase in BMI Z score was particular in children who were FTT, normal weight and overweight. In a twin study at the age of 3–12 years, T&A was associated with an increase of growth and IGF-1 levels compared to their twin none OSA sibling. An early surgical intervention made a significant growth recovery compared to the twin which had a lower BMI Z-score prior to surgery and had a greater increase in BMI Z-score following the surgery, compared with older children who had a greater BMI to begin with but the increase after T&A was minor.

### Failure to thrive as a manifestation of child neglect… [^115CpY1E]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Failure to thrive in infants and children may develop as a result of neglect, and in its extreme form it may result in death. The American Academy of Pediatrics has published a clinical report guiding the assessment, management, and support of children with failure to thrive as a manifestation of child neglect. The full report was published in the November 2005 issue of. Pediatrics. Clinical evaluation for failure to thrive should include a comprehensive family and medical history, a general physical examination, observation of feeding, and a home visit by an appropriate health care professional. Laboratory and radiologic testing usually is not necessary but may be used to rule out organic disease or to determine deficits of nutrition, or when the history or physical examination raises concerns. Infants with failure to thrive often were born preterm or had a low birth weight, and they may have been separated from their caregivers in the perinatal period.

Decrements in growth rates often are ignored in older children, but neglect is a possibility in children of any age. Physicians should raise and monitor concerns of abuse or neglect during intervention for failure to thrive if it becomes clear that there has been intentional withholding of food, that a parent has a strong belief in a health or nutrition regimen that is detrimental to the child, or that the family is resistant to interventions. Failure to thrive in infants who weigh less than 70 percent of the predicted weight for length is considered a medical emergency. Severe cases must be recognized and treated early to avoid detrimental effects on early brain development. Institution of increased feeding may be difficult and may initiate metabolic problems. A speech therapist can give guidance on effective feeding techniques. Parents should be involved throughout treatment in all aspects and should be supported and educated to carry out the care plan.

If a child with failure to thrive does not respond to treatment, a multidisciplinary approach must be taken involving nursing staff, social services, and dietitians. Physicians should recognize child neglect as a possible cause of failure to thrive and should report cases of failure to thrive that do not resolve on treatment to the appropriate child protective services. Documentation should be made of attempted interventions, instructions to parents, evidence of parental understanding of instructions and adverse consequences, and evidence of parental failure to carry out recommendations. If aggressive interdisciplinary intervention does not correct and maintain the weight to above 80 percent of expected levels, foster care may be required. The physician must be involved in all phases of the protective services intervention.

### Potocki-lupski syndrome: a microduplication syndrome associated with oropharyngeal dysphagia and failure to thrive [^112fYJPk]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Failure to thrive (FTT) is a feature of children with Potocki-Lupski syndrome (PTLS) [duplication 17p11.2]. This study was designed to describe the growth characteristics of 24 subjects with PTLS from birth through age 5 years in conjunction with relevant physical features and swallow function studies.

Study Design

We evaluated 24 individuals with PTLS who were ascertained by chromosome analysis and/or array comparative genome hybridization. Clinical assessments included review of medical records, physical examination, otolaryngological examination, and swallow function studies. Measures of height and weight were converted to Z-scores.

Results

The mean weight-for-age and weight-for-length Z-scores at birth were lower (P < .01) than the reference standard and did not change with age. A history of poor feeding, hypotonia, and FTT were reported in 92%, 88%, and 71%, respectively. Individuals with hypotonia had lower weight-for-age and body mass index-for-age Z-scores (P = 0.01). Swallow function studies demonstrated at least one abnormality in all subjects.

Conclusions

FTT is common in children with PTLS. We hypothesize that oropharyngeal dysphagia and hypotonia likely contribute to FTT in patients with PTLS and recommend that once a diagnosis is established, the individual be assessed for feeding and growth issues and be availed of oromotor therapy and nutritional services.

### Pediatric gastrostomy feeding tube weaning strategies: a scoping review [^116QRJZm]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

The search strategy identified 4619 unduplicated records (Figure 1). Titles and abstracts were screened, and 4406 records were excluded. Two hundred thirteen full‐text studies were assessed for eligibility. Forty‐five articles were included in this scoping review, with details outlined in Table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of feeding tube weaning interventions for children included in scoping review with ≥ 5 participants (n = 40).

3.1 Design of study

Articles consisted of retrospective studies (n = 21), prospective interventions (n = 12), case series (n = 10), and quality improvement projects (n = 2). Articles were published between 1986 and 2023.

3.2 Cohort characteristics

Study sample sizes varied from 2 to 378. Participants ranged in age from younger than 10 months to 24 years. Although each study included at least one child with a gastrostomy FT, a minority of participants had nasogastric, gastrojejunal, or jejunal FTs.

Clinical characteristics varied greatly. Some interventions focused on children with specific diagnoses, and others had diagnostic exclusions. Medical diagnoses commonly reported amongst study populations included children with reflux, genetic disorders, congenital heart defects, prematurity, neurological conditions, history of failure to thrive, respiratory diseases, metabolic diseases, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, chronic lung disease, food allergies, and history of cleft lip and/or palate.,

Some studies had exclusion criteria based on participant age, medical diagnosis, comorbidities, evaluations of swallow safety, cognitive/developmental age, measurements of FT dependency, and history of failed attempts at weaning. Because some interventions required parental involvement as core interventionists, some families were excluded if unable to fully engage in the intervention.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115XnSwg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society — swallow evaluation (VFSS) in post-prematurity respiratory disease (PPRD) is suggested for specific clinical indications with very-low-certainty evidence: For infants, children, and adolescents with PPRD, we suggest a swallow evaluation (VFSS) for those who are eating by mouth and have cough or persistent oxygen desaturation during feeding, suspected or confirmed vocal cord paralysis or other airway anomalies, failure to wean from oxygen therapy or ventilatory support as expected, persistent or worsening pulmonary hypertension, failure to thrive, or chronic pulmonary symptoms out of proportion to viral respiratory infections (conditional recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence). The panel's confidence in the accuracy of these estimated effects of the utility of swallow evaluation for critical outcomes was very low, and implementation guidance notes that an organized, multidisciplinary team is necessary to perform quality swallow evaluations in preterm patients and that clinicians should consider how the results will impact care as well as the risks and benefits when deciding to order a swallow evaluation.

### Eosinophilic esophagitis: clinical, endoscopic, histologic and therapeutic differences and similarities between children and adults [^116HQNrr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation in children and adults

Symptoms of EoE follow a hierarchal and pyramidal pattern from early childhood to adulthood (Table 2). Clinical presentation in young children is reported and filtered by the caregiver. Infants and toddlers usually present non-specific symptoms such as reflux-like symptoms, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, food refusal, and failure to thrive. It has been widely described that clinical presentation varies by age: failure to thrive in the youngest children (median age 2.0 years), vomiting in older children (median age 8.1 years), abdominal pain in young adolescents (median age 12.0 years), and dysphagia (mean age 13.4 years) and food impaction (median age 16.8 years) in older adolescents.

Table 2.
Clinical presentation in children and adults.–

In contrast, adults predominantly complain of dysphagia to solids, followed by food impaction. The impaction of a food bolus is a typical and recurring symptomwhich sometimes requires an emergency upper endoscopy for unblocking. EoE can mimic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in its presentation with heartburn and regurgitation. Exercise-induced chest pain is also common among adults. Some patients report minimal symptoms, and in such cases, the clinician should investigate dietary and behavioral modification, that is, eating slowly, excessive mastication before swallowing, drinking often to push the bolus down while eating, and avoidance of solid foods; this is so that patients spontaneously adapt to the reduced distensibility of the esophagus.

Both children and adults have higher rates of allergic diathesis than the general population, and most patients have asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis. Accordingly, EoE is more commonly associated to IgE-mediated food sensitization in children, and milk, eggs, soy, wheat/rye, beef, and peanuts are the main triggers. In adults, hypersensitivity to aeroallergens such as pollens is also common. Despite such strong evidence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, EoE is not directly mediated by IgEand eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells and cytokines are also involved.
