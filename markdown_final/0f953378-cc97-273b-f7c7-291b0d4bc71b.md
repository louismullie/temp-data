## Question

Qual a serie de leucocitos mais depletada na clozapina?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which white blood cell series is most depleted by clozapine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hematologic adverse effect that clozapine is classically associated with. Then, I should verify the specific cell lineage involved in that adverse effect. Next, I will check whether other leukocyte lines are meaningfully affected and whether any monitoring guidance points to a different series. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, reference-backed answer and confirm the terminology in Portuguese versus English to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the primary hematologic risk. Clozapine is well known for causing severe neutropenia, historically termed agranulocytosis, which reflects a dangerous drop in the absolute neutrophil count and carries a risk of serious infection; this is the reason for mandatory ANC monitoring and boxed warnings in regulatory labeling [^b23119f5] [^95d0702d] [^b9772091].

> Wait, let me verify the exact cell lineage. The FDA labeling explicitly defines severe neutropenia as an ANC less than 500/μL and emphasizes that the ANC, derived from the total WBC multiplied by the percent neutrophils, is the relevant parameter for clozapine-induced toxicity; this confirms that the neutrophil series is the principal target of depletion, not lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, or basophils [^b9772091] [^95d0702d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about other leukocytes. I should check whether clozapine meaningfully depletes lymphocytes or other granulocytes. The regulatory and clinical literature consistently frame the risk as neutropenia/agranulocytosis, with no comparable signal for lymphopenia or selective depletion of other leukocyte subsets; while mild eosinophilia or transient shifts can occur, these are not the defining or most clinically consequential depletion associated with clozapine [^b9772091] [^95d0702d] [^d3053d4e].

> I need to ensure the terminology is precise in Portuguese. The question asks for the "série de leucócitos mais depletada". Given the evidence, the correct answer is the neutrophil series, i.e., neutrófilos, which are the granulocytic leukocytes most affected by clozapine, leading to neutropenia or agranulocytosis when severe [^b9772091] [^95d0702d].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about monitoring nuances? The FDA REMS historically required both WBC and ANC, but the pivotal parameter for decision-making is the ANC, and recent updates have further emphasized ANC-only thresholds and algorithms, reinforcing that neutrophils are the critical lineage to track for safety [^b0c773e5] [^8dcfdc2e].

> Final answer: The white blood cell series most depleted by clozapine is the neutrophil series (neutrófilos), which is why clozapine is associated with neutropenia and agranulocytosis and why ANC monitoring is mandatory during treatment [^b9772091] [^95d0702d] [^b23119f5].

---

A série de leucócitos mais depletada pela clozapina é a **série neutrofílica (neutrófilos)** [^b9772091], causando neutropenia ou agranulocitose [^95d0702d]. Essa depleção é imprevisível, não dose-dependente [^b9772091] e pode levar a infecções graves, sendo o motivo pelo qual o monitoramento regular do **contagem absoluta de neutrófilos (ANC)** é obrigatório [^b23119f5] [^cc126389]. Outras linhagens, como linfócitos e monócitos, não são afetadas de forma consistente ou clinicamente significativa [^notfound].

## Mecanismo de ação e efeitos hematológicos

A clozapina tem um mecanismo de ação complexo, envolvendo antagonismo de receptores dopaminérgicos, serotoninérgicos e outros neurotransmissores. No entanto, o mecanismo exato pelo qual a clozapina causa neutropenia **ainda não é completamente compreendido** [^b9772091]. Acredita-se que a neutropenia induzida por clozapina seja mediada por mecanismos imunológicos, possivelmente envolvendo reações idiossincráticas e de hipersensibilidade [^0497bfd1].

---

## Frequência e gravidade da neutropenia induzida por clozapina

A neutropenia induzida por clozapina é uma reação adversa relativamente rara, mas potencialmente grave. A incidência de neutropenia severa (contagem absoluta de neutrófilos < 500/μL) é de aproximadamente **0,8%** [^9f6e1703] em pacientes tratados com clozapina, com maior risco nos primeiros 18 semanas de tratamento [^95d0702d]. A neutropenia pode progredir para agranulocitose, uma condição caracterizada pela ausência quase total de neutrófilos, aumentando significativamente o risco de infecções graves e potencialmente fatais [^b9772091].

---

## Monitoramento e gestão clínica

Devido ao risco de neutropenia, o uso de clozapina requer **monitoramento hematológico rigoroso** [^b23119f5]. As diretrizes clínicas recomendam a obtenção de uma contagem absoluta de neutrófilos (ANC) basal antes do início do tratamento, seguida por monitoramento semanal durante os primeiros 6 meses, quinzenalmente durante os próximos 6 meses e mensalmente após esse período [^db8e850b]. Em casos de neutropenia moderada a severa, a clozapina deve ser imediatamente descontinuada e o paciente monitorado de perto para sinais de infecção [^e3b349a8].

---

## Impacto clínico e implicações terapêuticas

A neutropenia induzida por clozapina tem **implicações clínicas significativas**. Pacientes com neutropenia severa têm maior risco de infecções bacterianas graves, incluindo pneumonia e sepse, o que pode resultar em hospitalização e, em casos extremos, morte [^b9772091]. Essa reação adversa também limita o uso de clozapina, muitas vezes restringindo-a a pacientes com esquizofrenia refratária ao tratamento, ou seja, aqueles que não responderam a pelo menos dois antipsicóticos diferentes [^a7cb70c9].

---

## Comparação com outras linhagens de leucócitos

Embora a clozapina cause depleção significativa de neutrófilos, **não há evidência consistente de depleção significativa de outras linhagens de leucócitos**, como linfócitos ou monócitos. Alguns estudos relatam alterações leves em outras linhagens, mas essas mudanças não são clinicamente significativas ou consistentes como a neutropenia observada [^notfound].

---

## Conclusão

A série de leucócitos mais depletada pela clozapina é a **série neutrofílica (neutrófilos)** [^b9772091], causando neutropenia ou agranulocitose [^95d0702d]. Essa depleção é imprevisível e potencialmente grave, necessitando monitoramento hematológico regular e cuidados clínicos cuidadosos [^b23119f5]. Outras linhagens de leucócitos, como linfócitos e monócitos, não são afetadas de forma significativa ou consistente [^notfound].

Anecdotal evidence tends to suggest clozapine treatment as a cause of leucocytosis in schizophrenic patients, however, no conclusive evidence is available on this topic. We report the clinical cases of two schizophrenic men who were diagnosed with clozapine-related leucocytosis. The clozapine treatment was performed at a dose between 200 and 400 mg/day. When leucocytosis appeared, there was a loss of response to clozapine in both patients. Clozapine-induced leucocytosis in schizophrenic patients could be correlated to occurrence of psychotic symptomatology.

Introduction

In 1989, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clozapine (Clozaril; Novartis) for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.Preapproval testing demonstrated clozapine’s marked efficacy,, and subsequent observational studies confirmed its marked effectiveness. Yet clozapine use has been modest in the US. Although an estimated 30% of people with schizophrenia have the treatment-resistant form,, by the late 2000s, fewer than 10% of people with schizophrenia were treated with clozapine in 44 states.

A key reason for low clozapine use has been its perceived safety, specifically concern over its risk of agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count <500/μL of blood [to convert to ×10 9 /L, multiply by 0.001]). Shortly after clozapine launched in Finland in 1979, 18 of 2000 patients (0.9%) taking it developed agranulocytosis, resulting in 8 deaths.To secure FDA approval, clozapine’s manufacturer developed the Clozaril Patient Management System, in which patients had to obtain a white blood cell count (WBC) and a blood differential prior to initiation and to undergo weekly blood testing (WBC count monitoring) while receiving treatment and for 4 weeks following treatment.

In September 2015, under the authority granted by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007,the FDA approved a new centralized monitoring program for all manufacturers called the clozapine risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), which included the need for prescriber certification in addition to a safe use requirement (blood testing). As part of the certification process, prescribers received educational materials about the risk of agranulocytosis and the requirements of the clozapine REMS program, completed a knowledge assessment, and were asked to attest on the prescriber enrollment form that they had reviewed the educational materials and successfully completed the knowledge assessment. In 2021, the REMS was modified and required prescribers to submit monthly patient status forms, pharmacies had to verify the safe use condition via a website or call center, and prescribers and pharmacies had to complete a one-time recertification.

Recent Development inRegulations for Clozapine Use

Clozapine is currently the only effective antipsychotic (AP) for treatment‐resistant schizophrenia,having been approved for this indication by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989. At that time, due to the known risk of developing agranulocytosis (also known as severe neutropenia and typically defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500/mm 3 or μL), routine white blood cell monitoring was mandated for its use. Initially, the Clozaril Patient Management System (CPMS)required indefinite weekly blood draws. However, as evidence emerged showing that the highest risk for neutropenia occurs within the first 3 (84% of agranulocytosis cases) to 6 (96% of cases) months of treatment,,the requirements evolved. In 2005, the FDA changed the requirements to weekly ANC monitoring for the first 6 months, biweekly from 6 to 12 months, and monthly thereafter. Starting in 2015, CPMS was subsumed under the Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program.

In February 2025, the FDA lifted the requirement to use the REMS program in conjunction with clozapine prescribing in the United States, aiming to simplify its prescription and increase utilization. Although various groups around the world have proposed alternative, less‐restrictive hematological monitoring over the years,this shift in regulatory requirements introduces uncertainty. Specifically, prescribers are now solely responsible for determining what, if any, hematological monitoring to perform. Further complicating matters, the FDA‐approved package insert for clozapine remains unchanged for the time being, continuing to require the monitoring schedule that the REMS program put in place. Additionally, beyond the United States, global guidelines vary considerably with respect to monitoring frequency, discontinuation thresholds, and criteria for rechallenge, with some countries having no monitoring protocols at all.

2.5 Discontinuation of CLOZARIL Treatment

If discontinuing CLOZARIL in patients with:

Moderate or severe neutropenia, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
Normal or mild neutropenia, reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, and continue monitoring ANC levels until their ANC is ≥1500/μL.

If discontinuing CLOZARIL in patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) with:

Neutropenia, see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
ANC within their normal range of ANC reduce the dosage gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks.

When discontinuing CLOZARIL, monitor patients for the symptoms related to psychotic recurrence and cholinergic rebound (e.g., profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

2.6 Restarting CLOZARIL Treatment After Interrupting CLOZARIL

When restarting CLOZARIL in patients who have interrupted CLOZARIL treatment, use a lower dosage to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

If one day’s dosage is missed, resume CLOZARIL treatment at 40% to 50% of the previous dosage.
If two days of dosing is missed, resume CLOZARIL treatment at approximately 25% of the previous dosage.
For longer interruptions, restart CLOZARIL treatment with a dosage of 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If this dosage is well-tolerated, may increase the dosage to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended than for initial CLOZARIL treatment.

2.7 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions

See Table 3 for recommended dosage modifications to reduce the risk of CLOZARIL-associated adverse reactions or reduce the risk of lower effectiveness [see Drug Interactions (7)].

2.8 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers

It may be necessary to reduce the CLOZARIL dosage in patients with significant renal impairment or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

CLOZARIL has caused severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/μL) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] and is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Severe neutropenia occurred in a small percentage of CLOZARIL-treated patients. The risk of severe neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks of CLOZARIL treatment. The mechanism by which CLOZARIL causes neutropenia is unknown. Neutropenia is not dose dependent.

Consider a hematology consultation before initiating CLOZARIL treatment or during treatment.

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modifications

Prior to initiating CLOZARIL treatment, obtain a baseline ANC. CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/μL. Throughout CLOZARIL treatment, regularly monitor ANC. Table 1 provides recommendations for dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC levels, during CLOZARIL treatment and frequency of ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

ANC Monitoring and Dosage Modification in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia

Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) generally have lower baseline neutrophil counts but they are not at higher risk for developing infections, and they are not at increased risk for developing CLOZARIL-induced neutropenia.

2.1 Absolute Neutrophil Count Testing Prior to CLOZARIL Initiation

Prior to initiating CLOZARIL treatment, obtain a baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC). CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC less than 1500/μL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

For patients with documented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), obtain at least two baseline ANC levels. CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/μL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

For dosage modifications based on ANC results, see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4).

2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration

To reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope, the recommended starting dosage is much lower than the target dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

CLOZARIL can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended starting oral dosage of CLOZARIL is 12.5 mg once or twice daily. If well-tolerated, increase the total daily dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day to achieve a target dosage of 150 mg to 225 mg twice per day by the end of two weeks. Subsequently, may increase the dosage in increments of up to 100 mg once weekly or twice weekly. The maximum recommended CLOZARIL oral dosage is 450 mg twice daily.

2.3 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results

Table 1 provides recommended CLOZARIL dosage modifications based on ANC results [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count), see Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

2.4 Dosage Modifications Based on ANC Results for Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia

Table 2 provides recommended CLOZARIL dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN) (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . For dosage modifications based on ANC results for patients without BEN, see Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Mediation and longitudinal analysis to interpret the association between clozapine pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics, and absolute neutrophil count [^ab6321f3]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Finally, while analyses performed on the CLOZUK2 datasetincluded a “time on treatment” covariate, this was not available for CLOZUK3. As such, we are unable to control for a potential differential risk of neutrophil decrease over the course of treatment. Equally, our available blood measurements do not necessarily start at clozapine initiation, and therefore it is possible that patients may have previously experienced neutropenia or agranulocytosis and since have been rechallenged. Thus, while it is likely for our dataset to be enriched in long-term clozapine users, as was CLOZUK2, we cannot quantify their proportion or assess the potential cumulative impacts of clozapine exposure.

Implications

Clozapine use is associated with decreased all-cause mortality compared to other commonly used antipsychotic drugs; however unexpected deaths by various causes remain a rare and currently unpredictable feature of the medication. While ANC is not necessarily related to mortality itself, a progressive depletion of immune cells has been argued to be a primary contributor to the susceptibility to infectious disease exhibited by clozapine users,. The present work found several associations between pharmacokinetic and genetic variables with ANC in a UK-based sample of clozapine users with no detectable immune-related ADRs. Our results could have clinical applicability from the perspective of treatment management, supporting the view that clozapine dose might become a modifiable risk factor in cases with abnormal neutrophil counts. While agranulocytosis and severe neutropenia are considered dose-independent, subclinical variation in ANC might respond to dose alterations. Clozapine metabolism is also a factor to consider as plasma clozapine and norclozapine levels were also significantly associated with ANC in our sample. However, large inter- and intra-individual differences in levels at fixed doses might make it complicated to influence these variables in practice, though they still could find applicability for the identification of patients at risk of extreme ANCs.

### Information on clozapine (...) [^52a50961]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Latest Update February 24, 2025
- Beginning today, FDA does not expect prescribers, pharmacies, and patients to participate in the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies program for clozapine or to report results of absolute neutrophil count blood tests before pharmacies dispense clozapine. FDA still recommends that prescribers monitor patients’ ANC according to the monitoring frequencies described in the prescribing information. Information about severe neutropenia will remain in the prescribing information for all clozapine medicines, including in the existing Boxed Warnings. Although the risk of severe neutropenia with clozapine still exists, FDA has determined that the REMS program for clozapine is no longer necessary to ensure the benefits of the medicine outweigh that risk. Eliminating the REMS is expected to decrease the burden on the health care delivery system and improve access to clozapine.

FDA has notified the manufacturers that the clozapine REMS must be eliminated. FDA has instructed the clozapine manufacturers to formally submit a modification to eliminate the Clozapine REMS and to update the prescribing information, including removing mandatory reporting of ANC blood tests to the REMS program. In the coming months, FDA will work with the clozapine manufacturers to update the prescribing information and eliminate the Clozapine REMS. As part of this reevaluation, FDA has funded a study by Brigham and Women’s Hospital that includes an analysis of clozapine utilization, adherence to the REMS requirement for monitoring of absolute neutrophil count, and clinical outcomes.

In addition, FDA is conducting a study in collaboration with the Veterans Health Administration to better understand the incidence and severity of neutropenia in patients taking clozapine, and the Agency is conducting a study using the Sentinel System to better understand adherence to the monitoring requirements. While clozapine is beneficial for some patients, there are risks associated with this drug. Specifically, clozapine can decrease the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, that function in the body to fight off infections. When neutrophils are significantly decreased, severe neutropenia may result and the body may become prone to infections. For this reason, patients taking clozapine need to have their absolute neutrophil count monitored on a regular basis. This monitoring requirement serves as the basis for the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.

5.1 Severe Neutropenia

Background 

Clozapine can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count (ANC)), defined as a reduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available as a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant to drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be calculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total percentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil “segs” plus neutrophil “bands”). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia and their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Neutropenia may be mild, moderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, “severe neutropenia” replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or agranulocytosis.

Severe neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/μL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking clozapine and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then declines. The mechanism by which clozapine causes neutropenia is unknown and is not dose-dependent.

### Risk of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis and mandatory white blood cell monitoring: can the regulations be relaxed? [^7d50072e]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

After the introduction of clozapine eight Finnish patients died after developing agranulocytosis. Clozapine was withdrawn from the market and only reintroduced with strict mandatory white blood cell monitoring as long as treatment lasts and thresholds at which clozapine must be discontinued definitively. The fear of agranulocytosis and the need for intensive blood monitoring is the single most important barrier for prescribers and patients alike and leads to underprescription of the only effective and approved medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We summarize evidence that the risk of agranulocytosis is smaller than perceived at the time of reintroduction, is concentrated in the first 18 weeks of treatment, is not greater than with other antipsychotics thereafter and that frequent blood monitoring has not demonstrably decreased the rate of agranulocytosis. Therefore we propose 1) mandatory monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exclusively during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment, 2) that thereafter the prescriber and the well-informed patient decide together about further monitoring frequency, 3) that clozapine treatment must be stopped if the ANC falls below 1.0 × 10 9 /L. Continuation of clozapine or a rechallenge are possible if prescriber and patient determine that the benefits outweigh the risks. 4) National registries which control the haematologic monitoring are unnecessary and do not help to reduce clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. They should at least be restricted to the first 18 weeks of clozapine use.

### Establishing the characteristics of an effective pharmacogenetic test for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^1c1afc63]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

To prevent agranulocytosis by detecting a fall in ANC, patients treated with clozapine are subject to compulsory haematological monitoring. In Europe, the full white blood cell count and ANC are monitored weekly for the first 18 weeks of treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter for the duration of the treatment.If at any time during treatment the white blood cell count falls below 3000 cells mm −3 or the ANC below 1500 cells mm −3, clozapine should be discontinued immediately and these patients should not be treated with clozapine again except in a controlled setting. Although the obligatory monitoring has the benefit of regular contact with a health-care professional, it is an invasive procedure and can be a burden for the patient. Moreover, some patients decline to take clozapine because of the monitoring requirement.

As agranulocytosis can develop within 2–5 days, even weekly monitoring cannot guarantee timely detection in all cases.The incidence of agranulocytosis induced by clozapine varies between 0.38 and 0.8%, with approximately 80% of cases occurring within the first 18 weeks., The incidence of agranulocytosis decreases from 0.7% in the first year, to 0.07% or lower in the second year of treatment. Few cases occur later in the course of treatment, but the risk does not fully disappear. In 2–4% of patients, agranulocytosis is fatal, which corresponds to an overall mortality rate of about 1–3 in 10 000 patients on clozapine.However, most patients recover completely from agranulocytosis with no haematological consequences.

### White blood cell monitoring during long-term clozapine treatment [^70200759]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Late-onset agranulocytosis is rare during treatment with clozapine, especially in monotherapy. The authors describe a case of agranulocytosis that emerged after 19 years of continuous clozapine monotherapy. The discovery of the agranulocytosis was due to the lifelong white blood cell counts that are now required for clozapine treatment. Despite the fact that this requirement probably saved the life of this patient, this monitoring is not evidence-based because the incidence of agranulocytosis does not exceed that of conventional antipsychotic drugs, for which no such requirement exists. For mentally competent and adequately informed patients, the Netherlands Clozapine Collaboration Group now permits quarterly monitoring after the first 6 months of clozapine treatment.

### Evaluating reduced blood monitoring frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a chart review study from the COVID-19 pandemic [^685935db]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Hypothesis

In response to Health Canada’s March 2020 directive, patients on clozapine for over 12 months were allowed to extend hematological testing intervals from 4 to 8 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that this change would not affect the timely detection of hematological abnormalities in patients with severe mental illness.

Study Design

A chart review was conducted of patients at the Royal Ottawa who were prescribed clozapine from March 2019 to March 2021. We analyzed clinical and hematological data from electronic health records and Clozaril Support and Assistance Network database to compare occurrences of hematological abnormalities [leukopenia (white blood cell count <3.5 × 10 9 /L) and agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count <0.5 × 10 9 /L)] from March 17, 2020 to March 16, 2021, between standard and extended monitoring protocols using binomial logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions.

Study Results

Of 621 patients, 196 were on extended blood monitoring, and 425 followed standard blood monitoring. Clozapine dose did not differ between groups (standard: 370 ± 201 mg; extended: 352 ± 172 mg; P =.14, d s = 0.10). Clozapine treatment duration up to March 2021 was 12.6 ± 8.3 years, with the extended group (10 ± 7.9 years) having a significantly (P <.01, d s = 0.50) shorter duration than the standard (14 ± 8.2 years). Extended monitoring did not significantly impact likelihood of detecting hematological abnormalities (OR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.58,1.41], P =.55) after controlling for age, sex, total bloodwork, and other psychotropics associated with neutrophil counts (ie, valproate, olanzapine). No patient on the extended regimen developed agranulocytosis.

Conclusions

Reducing blood monitoring frequency in patients on clozapine for more than 12 months did not compromise detection of hematological abnormalities.

### Clozapine (Clozaril) [^36ad5831]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients with documented BEN, obtain at least two baseline ANC levels prior to CLOZARIL initiation. CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with BEN with an ANC less than 1000/μL. There are different ANC dosage modification recommendations in CLOZARIL-treated patients with BEN due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 2 provides recommendations on dosage modifications (dosage interruption and treatment discontinuation), based on ANC monitoring, during CLOZARIL treatment in patients with BEN and recommended frequency of ANC testing [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Management of CLOZARIL-Treated Patients Who Develop a Fever

For patients who develop a fever during CLOZARIL treatment:

Interrupt CLOZARIL in those who develop a temperature of 101.3 °F (38.5 °C) or greater and obtain an ANC level.
If the ANC is less than 1000/μL in patients without BEN, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection. Refer to Table 1 or Table 2 for dosage modifications based on ANC monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

In patients with fever and a normal neutrophil count, see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Warnings and Precautions (5.13) for fever.

Restarting CLOZARIL in Patients Who Recovered from Severe Neutropenia

Generally, do not rechallenge patients with CLOZARIL in those who experienced severe neutropenia. However, for some patients who had resolution of their CLOZARIL-related severe neutropenia after stopping CLOZARIL, the risk of schizophrenia exacerbation from not restarting CLOZARIL treatment may be greater than the risk of neutropenia reoccurrence from restarting CLOZARIL (e.g., patients who have no treatment options other than CLOZARIL).

Concomitant Use of CLOZARIL with Other Drugs Known to Cause Neutropenia

If CLOZARIL is used concomitantly with another drug known to cause neutropenia, consider more frequently ANC monitoring than the recommendations provided in Table 1 and Table 2 .

### Clozapine and chemotherapy: a dangerous couple or a necessary partnership? [^dd6ede42]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 48-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia was diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma of the small bowel. Neutropaenia occurred secondary to chemotherapy, which led to clozapine being discontinued, which resulted in the deterioration of his mental state, in turn, affecting the treatment of lymphoma. Clozapine was later reintroduced alongside granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, leading to improved mental state without any further incidences of neutropaenia.

### Combination of strategies to initiate clozapine for refractory schizophrenia in a patient with low neutrophil levels [^064287c1]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

Clozapine is an effective drug for refractory schizophrenia; however, its use is restricted due to the risk of potentially life-threatening side effects, such as agranulocytosis.Low baseline levels of leucocytes and neutrophils are risk factors for clozapine-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis.In most countries, mandatory haematological monitoring and strict regulations have been implemented to reduce these haematological risks. In Japan, patients with schizophrenia who are prescribed clozapine must register with the Clozaril Patient Monitoring Service for patient management.

In Japan, a common clinical problem is that clozapine cannot be initiated in patients whose baseline leucocyte and neutrophil counts are ≤4.0×10 9 /L and ≤2.0×10 9 /L, respectively. This restriction is more stringent in Japan than in other countries.In other countries, considerations have been established for patients with low white blood cell counts and absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) due to benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN), and clozapine treatment may be initiated after receiving consent from a haematologist.In addition, patients with BEN are managed according to a different ANC algorithm with relaxed criteria for baseline ANC levels.However, this consideration has not been established in Japan.Therefore, it is expected that more people in Japan than in other countries will miss the opportunity to receive clozapine due to low leucocyte and neutrophil levels. Clozapine is the only drug that is confirmed to be effective for refractory schizophrenia; thus, those denied clozapine as a treatment option are at a significant disadvantage.

In this case report, a patient with refractory schizophrenia who had earlier been denied clozapine due to low neutrophil levels was successfully administered clozapine following a combination of several strategies to increase neutrophil levels.

### Distinctive pattern of neutrophil count change in clozapine-associated, life-threatening agranulocytosis [^b894cc83]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Clozapine’s association with neutropenia is rarely questioned but clozapine may not in fact cause a benign neutropenia. In the original Finnish analysisthe incidence of neutropenia that did not progress to agranulocytosis was 7 in 3000, or 0.23%—less than a tenth of later estimates of the incidence of neutropenia. It is possible that the perceived association with neutropenia is a result of surveillance bias, whereby intensive blood monitoring reveals random, clinically silent, and non-pathological episodes of neutropenia occurring coincidentally to the use of clozapine. This is important because a great many people are prevented from receiving clozapine because of erroneously diagnosed clozapine-related blood toxicity. The concept of clozapine-induced neutropenia might also be a blind-alley for research into genetic predisposition to clozapine-induced blood dyscrasia. Although the same genetic variants seem to be responsible for the increased risk of both neutropenia and agranulocytosis, a recent study found a strong link between the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism rs113332494 and agranulocytosis but not neutropenia. Moreover, in studies where genetic associations with clozapine-associated neutropenia are suggested, it is acknowledged that the majority of neutropenia cases do not develop into agranulocytosis.

It could be argued that what really matters in respect to the safe use of clozapine is the detection and treatment of episodes of reduced neutrophil count that are sufficiently severe and prolonged to represent a risk to life. Few studies have investigated the time course of neutrophil count before, during and after confirmed cases of clozapine-induced life-threatening agranulocytosis (LTA). The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of neutrophil count in patients with true clozapine-induced LTA and to characterise this reaction so as to distinguish it from benign and coincidental episodes of neutropenia. Our hypothesis was that true clozapine toxicity might be distinguished from benign events by carefully describing the pattern of neutrophil count changes in life-threatening cases.

### Clozapine versus other antipsychotics during the first 18 weeks of treatment: a retrospective study on risk factor increase of blood dyscrasias [^d3053d4e]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

Blood dyscrasias excluding agranulocytosis received limited attention in antipsychotic-treated patients during the first 18 weeks of therapy, although severe clinical conditions have been reported in a few cases. We extracted data records of 285 Caucasian patients after 18 weeks of antipsychotic treatments to investigate risk factors of blood dyscrasias. We observed a higher risk to develop both transient and persistent anemia, neutrophilia and eosinophilia in clozapine-treated patients, whereas in those treated with other atypical antipsychotics when compared to a reference group under typical antipsychotics, emerged an increased risk for transient neutrophilia and eosinophilia. Male patients revealed a higher risk of persistent eosinophilia, neutrophilia, and leukocytosis. Concomitant treatments with mood stabilizers or benzodiazepines proved to be risk factors for transient anemia, antidepressants for transient eosinophilia. Severe complications emerged in 3 cases of agranulocytosis. Cross-tabulation analysis showed a higher probability of a poor response in clozapine-treated patients with persistent anemia and a positive with persistent neutrophilia and eosinophilia. Our data evidenced that emerging blood dyscrasias were not associated with critical adverse effects, and only agranulocytosis required a treatment interruption. Other atypical antipsychotics might represent a viable alternative to potentially harmful clozapine and typical antipsychotics at the onset of life-threatening haematological alterations.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^5033ead2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

In all cases, aside from leucocytosis, G-CSF was well tolerated, with only 1 patient reporting short-lived back pain.

As for the timeline of use, G-CSF was given at the first occurrence of neutropenia solely for patient 3 resulting in a rapid ANC normalization and a quick rechallenge. In contrast, 4/8 patients did not use G-CSF at the first neutropenia episode and stopped clozapine for an average time of 16 months before a rechallenge was attempted, which is longer than the 9 months median time reported by Myles and colleagues’. This leads to wonder if an earlier use of G-CSF could provide better results. Three patients continued clozapine despite neutropenia without initially resorting to G-CSF. The average follow-up of 4.5 years after successful clozapine rechallenge indicates that our results are durable.

Although clozapine rechallenge following agranulocytosis seems to pose more risks and may have lower success rates according to a recent systematic review, many questions remain unanswered regarding predictive factors for clozapine rechallenge. Likewise, a previous study reported a 22-fold increased risk of agranulocytosis following clozapine rechallenge independently of the presence of other possible contributory causes for the first neutropenia episode. However, this finding was based on only a few number of patients and has not been reproduced. Hence, assessing the likelihood that clozapine is in fact the cause of a neutropenia episode is still clinically relevant. For those reasons, clozapine’s imputability in all neutropenia episodes was carefully assessed using the Naranjo algorithm, a validated and widely used pharmacovigilance tool. Although, clozapine was considered to be the most probable cause in most cases, it was only identified as a definite cause with no other explanation for patients one and five. Interestingly, they were cases of successful clozapine rechallenge. Other possible causes included low ANC at baseline, infections and the use of concomitant drugs known to cause neutropenia, namely here, benzodiazepines, proton pump inhibitors, antidepressants, antipsychotics, ceftriaxone, gabapentin, and sodium valproate (;).

WARNING: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION, BRADYCARDIA, AND SYNCOPE; SEIZURE; MYOCARDITIS, PERICARDITIS AND CARDIOMYOPATHY; INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS

Severe Neutropenia

CLOZARIL has caused severe neutropenia which is associated with an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal infections. Prior to initiating CLOZARIL treatment, obtain baseline ANC(s). CLOZARIL initiation is not recommended in patients with a baseline ANC less than 1500/μL (less than 1000/μL for those with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (also known as Duffy-null associated neutrophil count)). See recommendations for dosage modifications based on ANC levels during CLOZARIL treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)] . Consider a hematology consultation before initiating CLOZARIL or during CLOZARIL treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, Syncope

Orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with CLOZARIL treatment. The risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose escalation. These reactions can occur with the first dose, with doses as low as 12.5 mg per day, or when restarting patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with CLOZARIL. Initiate treatment at 12.5 mg once or twice daily; titrate slowly; and use divided dosages to minimize risk. Use CLOZARIL cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease or conditions predisposing to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, use of antihypertensive medications) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

14.1 Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia

The efficacy of CLOZARIL in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (chlorpromazine) study in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia who had inadequate responses to at least 3 different antipsychotics (from at least 2 different chemical classes) during the preceding 5 years. The antipsychotic trials must have been judged adequate; the antipsychotic dosages must have been equivalent to or greater than 1000 mg per day of chlorpromazine for a period of at least 6 weeks, each without significant reduction of symptoms. There must have been no period of good functioning within the preceding 5 years. Patients must have had a baseline score of at least 45 on the investigator-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). On the 18-item BPRS, 1 indicates the absence of symptoms, and 7 indicates severe symptoms; the maximum potential total BPRS score is 126. At baseline, the mean BPRS score was 61. In addition, patients must have had a score of at least 4 on at least two of the following four individual BPRS items: conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content. Patients must have had a Clinical Global Impressions–Severity Scale score of at least 4 (moderately ill).

Family burden calculation

One point for a first-degree relative, 0.5 for a second-degree relative and 0.25 for a third-degree relative. During the follow-up, the patients came for visits every three months (T1, T2 and T3), during which the same battery of tests was administered, except for the sociodemographic questionnaire. Analytical measurements (blood count, blood glucose and lipid profile), physical measurements (blood pressure, weight and body mass index) and complementary measurements (urinary toxins and an electrocardiogram, ECG) were also performed.

The dosage of CLZ was adjusted according to the psychopathology presented by each patient, respecting its therapeutic index (between 200 and 900 mg daily); an effective dose had already been identified from the time of the T1 visit (greater than 150 mg daily). The leucocyte count and absolute neutrophil count were monitored on a weekly basis, according to the technical data sheets. In terms of monitoring the safety of investigational drugs, we complied with the provisions of Spanish Royal Decree 1090/2015, which regulates clinical trials with drugs, the Ethics Committees for Research with Drugs and the Spanish Registry of Clinical Studies.

Regarding the pharmacological intervention, there were no differences between the trial approach applied to participants and the approach that would have been taken in the context of routine clinical practice; the only additional procedure was the administration of the assessment scales, which did not add any additional risk of harm to the participants.

At the ethical level, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Council of Europe Convention were followed. All participants (or their legal representatives) signed an informed consent to participate. The confidentiality of the participant data was guaranteed according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) established by Organic Law 3/2018 of 5 December on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights.

The trial was registered in the EudraCT database (2021-001278-44) and the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS) Clinical Trials Registry (REec: protocol CLZ_TRS_TEA). It was also approved by the CEIM of the Provincial Hospital Consortium of Castellón (resolution made on 20/04/2021) and the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CEIC) of the CEU Cardenal Herrera University of Castellón (CEEI22/346).

### Low awareness of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis in a mixed-method survey of 354 patients and carers [^f84905ce]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders are chronic, severe mental health conditions, estimated to affect 0.7–4% of the global population. For approximately one-third of individuals experiencing an acute episode of psychosis, conventional antipsychotic treatments fail to provide adequate symptom reduction, a condition known as treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Clinical guidelines recommend clozapine in these cases, as it is regarded as more effective than other antipsychotic medications. Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA) is a decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) persistently below 0.5 × 10 9 /L, increasing susceptibility to potentially life-threatening infections. The standard preventative protocols for CIA in most countries include ongoing haematological monitoring and a heightened awareness of any newly emerging physical alterations or symptoms that may suggest an infection, including fever, sore throat, or other flu-like manifestations.

Epidemiological research has consistently shown that CIA occurs predominantly within the first few months of treatment, with recent data estimating an incidence of 0.9% that drops significantly after two years –. This reduced risk is further supported by observational studies suggesting it is safe to reduce blood monitoring to every three months once the initial high-risk period has passed,. The analysis of likely cases of CIA indicates a rapid decline in neutrophils over a week, casting doubt on the utility of ongoing mandatory fortnightly or monthly monitoring. Furthermore, recent observational data suggests that 70% of CIA cases transition from a ‘normal count’ (ANC > 2.0 × 10 9 /L) immediately to agranulocytosis (< 0.5 × 10 9 /L) predominantly within the early stages of treatment. While monitoring systems are undoubtedly effective, this body of evidence highlights their limitations and supports calls for a revision of haematological monitoring requirements after the early treatment phase to enhance patient access to clozapine,.

If monitoring requirements were to be revised, patient education on identifying and responding to CIA (by seeking medical care when suspected) is plausibly the most essential safeguards against potential complications associated with CIA. Despite current concerns, there have been no attempts to explore patient and family/carers understanding around clozapine’s association with agranulocytosis, its identification and action it warrants when suspected. Understanding this may assist care providers and policymakers to provide optimal support and resources for patients and key others in their networks. Therefore, our aim was to explore how informed people with lived experience of clozapine treatment, their family and carers, are about the potential signs and symptoms of CIA and what actions they should take.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^0497bfd1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine is well known for its unique efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), representing about 30% of this vulnerable population. Regardless, clozapine use in Canada is as low as 4–16%, mostly because of hematological concerns. Clozapine is associated, respectively, with 2–3% and 0.8% of cases of neutropenia and agranulocytosis (;). Although the underlying mechanism is not completely understood, it is believed that these side effects are immune-mediated, rather than toxic, and they do not appear to be dose-dependent (;). They would be more frequent in females, in Africans/Asians, genetically predisposed individuals, within the first year of clozapine exposition, after a previous neutropenia/agranulocytosis episode or in the presence of other concomitant drugs also known to cause neutropenia (e.g. sodium valproate) (;;;).

However, the challenge of improving the extent of clozapine use is opposed by restrictive hematologic monitoring guidelines that have become synonymous with clozapine prescribing.

### Establishing the characteristics of an effective pharmacogenetic test for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^d6a32014]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although there are 22 FDA-approved antipsychotics used to treat schizophrenia, around 30% of schizophrenia patients do not respond to drugs other than clozapine.Clozapine has superior efficacy for positive symptoms in these treatment-resistant patientsand may improve negative symptoms.Furthermore, clozapine reduces suicidal behaviour especially when compared with first generation antipsychotics and overall mortality at population level.,,

Despite its proven efficacy, the clinical use of clozapine is limited by the risk of agranulocytosis, a rare but potentially fatal adverse drug reaction, characterized by the acute loss of neutrophils in circulating blood. Agranulocytosis is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500 cells mm −3 blood. Shortly after clozapine was introduced in Europe in the 1970s, it was withdrawn from the market when 17 cases of agranulocytosis were reported in Finland, of which 8 were fatal.In 1990, clozapine was reintroduced after its superiority over chlorpromazine for the treatment of refractory schizophrenia was shown.However, its use was restricted in most Western countries to treatment of refractory patients, that is, patients who have not improved on at least two different antipsychotics.,

Clozapine‐Associated Agranulocytosis: Historical Risk and Comparative Evidence

The primary rationale behind the stringent blood monitoring protocols is the risk for neutropenia, and subsequently agranulocytosis, associated with clozapine use, with potential for significant morbidity and even mortality. Early data from Europe in the 1970s suggested that up to 2% of patients taking clozapine developed agranulocytosis, contributing to several patient deaths.

Following clozapine's introduction in the United States, a study was conducted to evaluate clozapine‐induced agranulocytosis among 11,555 patients who initiated treatment post‐marketing. The cumulative incidence was 0.8% at 12 months, but with very few incident cases after 6 months. Risk of agranulocytosis was independent of dose, although these data were based on patients treated for primary psychiatric disorders (i.e. schizophrenia) at usual doses. Higher age and female sex appeared to have an increased risk.A more recent, larger review confirmed the risk of agranulocytosis to be approximately 0.7%, with only 25% of those with mild neutropenia progressing to severe neutropenia.About 2% of clozapine‐induced agranulocytosis cases were fatal.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^4d754ec6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Upon monograph recommendations, clozapine requires mandatory hematological surveillance to prevent agranulocytosis and further complications. In Canada, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 1.5 × 10 9 /L warrants for clozapine cessation and forbids its rechallenge. In some patients, lowering hematological threshold is possible (e.g. benign ethnic neutropenia), but clozapine cessation may still be required upon reaching ANC value below the adjusted threshold. In such situations, clozapine abrupt cessation is associated with an increased risk of sudden psychotic relapse, jeopardizing recovery (;). In some cases, seeking ways to reintroduce clozapine despite hematological caveats may provide the last chance of re-achieving recovery.

A brief review of the literature has highlighted two different off-label pharmacological strategies in Canada, used to re-expose a patient to clozapine. These strategies include the use of lithium to induce leukocytosis and the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to stimulate leukopoiesis (;). These strategies may sometimes be used concomitantly, although it remains unknown whether such practice is superior to the use of both agents used separately. Furthermore, even though the use of G-CSF for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is well documented, data regarding the use of G-CSF and lithium for clozapine-induced blood dyscrasias are scarce and are mainly based on case reports (;). For this latter purpose, G-CSF is either used “as-needed,” giving doses until neutrophil normalization only if an ANC result is below a prespecified threshold, or used as a “prophylactic strategy,” giving doses weekly on a regular basis independently of ANC values. In two recent systematic reviews, clozapine rechallenge using G-CSF showed a 75–76% success rate and an “as-needed” strategy seemed to be the most promising (;).

### Randomised controlled trial of clozapine in resistant schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder [^1652d8e3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of CLZ was not accompanied by an increase in secondary effects but rather by a reduction in the prescription of other antipsychotics and sedative-hypnotics. Decreased polypharmacy was not only not associated with relapses, but also significantly improved symptoms. Furthermore, reducing side effects prevented discontinuation: patients with CLZ presented lower discontinuation rates compared to those for other molecules in its class (;).

In our work, participants with CLZ perceived their side effects as being better, also coinciding with the findings of the evaluators and as reported in previous work based on the UKU. Indeed, previous studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia taking CLZ had a significantly better subjective experience of their mental health than those receiving other second-generation antipsychotics (;). Haematological monitoring also confirmed findings from previous studies in that these patients did not show significant reductions in leucocyte or neutrophil levels. The probability of cytopenias was similar between the intervention and control groups, although the TRS–CONTROL presented significantly lower neutrophil levels.

This trial confirms that belonging to the CLZ arms predicted lower scores on psychotic and affective symptom scales. Given that the main intervention was the prescription of the drug, and other covariates were controlled, this efficacy can thus be attributed to CLZ, as also indicated by a recent meta-analysis. The lack of association between the final dose of CLZ and the scores on the adjusted model may have been because of the influence of other variables typical of naturalistic studies or to the fact that the drug dose did not influence its efficacy, meaning that CLZ is effective once the therapeutic dose is reached, regardless of the amount administered.

Recruitment from the UME predicted better PANSS scores, probably because these patients were at a more advanced phase of admission with greater therapeutic adherence and had participated in rehabilitation programmes. In addition, cannabis use predicted increased symptoms of depression at the end of the trial, thereby reinforcing conclusions from previous work. Less time off treatment predicted higher endpoint scores, because patients with more severe symptoms were detected early and were not off medication for as long; however, this did not prevent them from finishing the trial with poorer outcomes.

### Clozapine therapy and COVID-19: a systematic review of the prevalence rates, health outcomes, hematological markers, and patient perspectives [^a13070a2]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

There have been concerns that clozapine treatment may undermine the capacity of the body to fight infection and increase the vulnerability to contracting COVID-19. This review of recent cohort studies investigated (1) whether people with a severe psychiatric disorder are at increased risk of COVID-19 and complications, (2) the immunological response of clozapine-users who contract COVID-19, and (3) patients' perspectives on COVID-19 and the pandemic response.

Methods

A systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, Pubmed, and PsycINFO databases using PRISMA guidelines using "COVID-19", "clozapine", and "vaccination" terms.

Results

18 studies (out of 330 identified) met all criteria (N = 119 054 including 8045 on clozapine). There was no strong evidence that clozapine users may be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing complications after adjusting for medical comorbidities. Hematological studies showed temporary reductions in neutrophils in COVID-19-positive patients and vaccination suggesting a clozapine effect in defence against infection. Vaccination studies did not report major adverse effects. Increased plasma levels of clozapine and neutropenia however point to COVID-19-related interference of clozapine metabolism. Patient surveys reported limited impact on mental health and positive attitudes regarding pandemic response.

Conclusion

This review did not find compelling evidence that the immune system of clozapine users put them at risk of COVID-19 and further complications. Evidence of drug-infection interactions however points to the importance of adhering to consensus guidelines about clozapine therapy during the pandemic. More evidence using longitudinal designs is required to examine the longer-term effects of COVID-19 and vaccination in this vulnerable population.

### Establishing the characteristics of an effective pharmacogenetic test for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^b77d2dfa]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Clozapine is the only evidence-based therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it induces agranulocytosis, a rare but potentially fatal haematological adverse reaction, in less than 1% of users. To improve safety, the drug is subject to mandatory haematological monitoring throughout the course of treatment, which is burdensome for the patient and one of the main reasons clozapine is underused. Therefore, a pharmacogenetic test is clinically useful if it identifies a group of patients for whom the agranulocytosis risk is low enough to alleviate monitoring requirements. Assuming a genotypic marker stratifies patients into a high-risk and a low-risk group, we explore the relationship between test sensitivity, group size and agranulocytosis risk. High sensitivity minimizes the agranulocytosis risk in the low-risk group and is essential for clinical utility, in particular in combination with a small high-risk group.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^b4ea4b23]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case 1

Patient 1 has already been described in a previous case report. He is a 32-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 16 according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 (DSM-5). Six months following clozapine introduction, he developed neutropenia and clozapine was discontinued. During the following 2 years, he became severely psychotic and was hospitalized for a total of 161 non-consecutive days. Homicidal threats and aggressive behavior led to a clozapine rechallenge. A month later, he developed a second neutropenia; filgrastim was administered and ANC normalized. A week later, a second dose of filgrastim was required due to an ANC drop. Clozapine was maintained during those two episodes. The patient was not receiving any concomitant medication and there was no other contributory cause for these neutropenia episodes. The two doses of filgrastim were well tolerated and only a short-lived back pain was experienced. More than 8 years later, clozapine is still ongoing with positive outcomes.

Case 2

A 65-year-old Caucasian female with DSM-5 schizophrenia diagnosed at the age of 22 started clozapine at the age of 47 for TRS, leading to a significant response. During the following 17 years, she experienced two mild neutropenia episodes that did not require clozapine discontinuation nor G-CSF use. A year later, she discontinued clozapine on her own because she felt physically ill. She was diagnosed with influenza and a possible bacterial pneumonia. Shortly after, she was admitted to the intensive care unit and received ceftriaxone while clozapine was being reinstated. She developed agranulocytosis 10 days after clozapine re-exposition. The drug was withdrawn, and she received a few doses of filgrastim to improve her ANC. Olanzapine was then initiated until a clozapine rechallenge was attempted 1 month later. After 12 days, she once again developed agranulocytosis; clozapine was withdrawn for good, unfortunately leading to a severe psychopathological deterioration.

Case 3

A 45-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with DSM-5 schizophrenia at the age of 28 had a first neutropenia after receiving clozapine for 14.5 years. Clozapine was withdrawn and a single dose of filgrastim was administered. The patient was also receiving haloperidol 10 mg daily, which was discontinued as well. ANC quickly normalized, and clozapine was reintroduced 12 days later. Clozapine treatment was still ongoing at follow-up.

### Beyond white blood cell monitoring: screening in the initial phase of clozapine therapy [^566ed51f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Clozapine is the preferred option for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, since 1975, clozapine has been known to cause agranulocytosis. In the clozapine screening guidelines, white blood cell count is mandatory. In the past 20 years, after its reintroduction, 3 other serious side effects, namely, diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal hypomotility, and myocarditis have been documented but have so far failed to be incorporated in the screening guidelines. The objective of this review is to determine whether an update of the screening guidelines for serious side effects with clozapine is evidence based.

Data Sources

The English-language literature, available via MEDLINE or PubMed, on the incidence of 4 clozapine-related side effects, using clozapine, agranulocytosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and gastrointestinal hypomotility as keywords, that have been published over the period 1976-2010, was collected.

Study Selection

16 studies that provided incidence rates or data from which these rates could be calculated were included.

Data Extraction

We compared 1-year incidence rates, mortality rates in the whole study population and in the affected cases. When rates reflected longer periods of observation, the given rate was recalculated to obtain a 1-year incidence rate.

Results

The incidence of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis varies between 3.8‰-8.0‰. The mortality rate is 0.1‰-0.3‰, and the case-fatality rate is 2.2‰-4.2‰. In diabetic ketoacidosis, the incidence was calculated at 1.2‰-3.1‰, and the case-fatality rate was 20%-31%. In gastrointestinal hypomotility, the incidence was 4‰-8‰, and the case-fatality rate was 15%-27.5%. The discrepancy in incidence rates between Australia (7‰-34‰) and the rest of the world (0.07‰-0.6‰) impairs a general approach of this side effect.

Conclusions

In 2 of the 3 studied side effects, diabetic ketoacidosis and gastrointestinal hypomotility, reduction of mortality to the level of agranulocytosis is both necessary and feasible. In order to obtain this outcome, the screening guidelines need to be modified; early detection of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia, that might-via diabetes mellitus-develop into diabetic ketoacidosis, requires obligatory monthly measurement of fasting plasma glucose. To prevent gastrohypomotility, and complications therefrom, the clinician should be required to choose between either weekly monitoring or standard coprescription of laxatives for prevention. The reported incidence of myocarditis (high in Australia, low in the rest of the world) is too divergent to allow for an overall recommendation outside Australia.

### Clozapine-specific proliferative response of peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells in Japanese patients with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^5754e4f9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although clozapine-induced granulocytopenia (CIG) is less severe than clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA), and some patients with CIG may not go on to develop serious complications, clozapine is discontinued in cases of both CIA and CIG. Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of CIA/CIG could provide better management of clozapine therapy. Recently, as a mechanistic insight into adaptive immune systems, European groups reported clozapine-specific proliferative responses and clozapine-specific T cells using blood taken from patients with CIA and/or CIG.

Aims

The aims of our study are to support this mechanistic evidence and to investigate the difference in the lymphocyte response to clozapine between patients with CIG and those with CIA.

Methods

Lymphocyte stimulation tests (LSTs) were conducted using CD25-positive cell-depleted peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from blood of four Japanese patients with CIA, four patients with CIG, and nine clozapine-tolerant subjects.

Results

Three of four patients with CIA and one of four patients with CIG showed proliferative responses to clozapine with a stimulation index of greater than 2. In contrast, none of the nine clozapine-tolerant subjects showed any response to clozapine. Olanzapine did not stimulate PBMCs of patients with CIA, patients with CIG, or clozapine-tolerant subjects.

Conclusions

Clozapine- and CIA-specific lymphocyte reactions in a Japanese population provided supportive evidence that the pathogenesis of CIA is based on adaptive immune reactions. In addition, patients with CIG who show a positive response to an LST may at the very least not be chosen for clozapine-rechallenge and further prospective studies are desirable to verify this hypothesis.

### Asenapine (Secuado) [^b89515db]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9	Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis

In clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to
									antipsychotic agents, including asenapine. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported with other agents in the class.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute 
									neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with pre-existing low WBC or ANC or 
									history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of SECUADO at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat 
									promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue SECUADO in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 
									<1000/mm3) and follow their WBC until recovery.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in patients with a first episode of psychosis: a two-year longitudinal follow-up study [^9463cef6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

A pro-inflammatory phenotype has been related to psychotic disorders. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an accessible biomarker that could be helpful to characterize this systemic inflammation state.

Study Design

This study evaluated the NLR in a cohort of 310 subjects with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) and a matched group of 215 healthy controls, recruited in 16 Spanish centers participating in the PEPs Project. We investigated the NLR measures over 2 years in a prospective, naturalistic study.

Study Results

At baseline, the FEP group showed a significant higher mean NLR compared to the control group (1.96 ± 1.11 vs 1.72 ± 0.74, P = 0.03). These ratio differences between groups grew at the 24 months follow-up visit (2.04 ± 0.86 vs 1.65 ± 0.65, P < 0.001). Within the FEP group, there were no significant differences in NLR across the follow-up visits, between genders or diagnosis groups (affective vs nonaffective). NLR values did not correlate with the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale scores. The group of patients who did not reach remission criteria at the end of the study showed a significant higher NLR than those who remitted (2.1896 ± 0.85 vs 1.95 ± 0.87, P = 0.042). A significant correlation between antipsychotic doses and NLR was found at the two-years follow-up visit (r=0.461, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our results highlight the existence of an underlying predisposition of FEP patients to present an increased mean NLR. The use of NLR in clinical practice could be helpful to identify this inflammatory imbalance.

### Pharmacogenomics of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1d2b556a]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The reasons for underuse and delay in clozapine initiation could be attributed to several factors, including highly variable and difficult to predict clinical outcomes. For example, roughly 40–70% of patients on clozapine experience persistent symptoms and remain treatment-resistant. Further, side effects in patients taking clozapine vary greatly, ranging from none or mild to life-threatening side effects. Particularly of concern is the development of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA), which is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500 cells/mm 3. CIA is a severe and potentially fatal neutropenia with an overall prevalence of 0.4% (95% CI: 0.3%, 0.6%) and fatality rate of 0.05% (95% CI: 0.03%, 0.09%). The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Pharmacovigilance global database, VigiBase, containing more than 140,000 clinician reports of clozapine adverse drug reactions (ADRs) classified in over 5,000 ADR categories, showed that the “broad agranulocytosis” category is the third major cause of fatal outcomes after “broad pneumonia” and “sudden death and cardiac arrests”. Although CIA is a rare hematological condition that represents only 2% of reported fatal outcomes within the VigiBase database, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) along with the majority of global health authorities have mandated that patients taking clozapine receive regular blood draws to monitor neutrophil count. These authorities also require enrollment in the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program in order to reduce the risk of clozapine-induced neutropenia.

### Differential effectiveness of clozapine for patients nonresponsive to or intolerant of first generation antipsychotic medications [^7e4ee400]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

This report examines whether the gains associated with changing to clozapine are greater for people who have been intolerant of first generation antipsychotic medications versus those who have been treatment-nonresponsive to previous agents. We examined data from an open-label, randomized trial that compared clozapine to usual care with first generation agents (n = 227). While most patients (n = 173, 76%) entered that study because they were nonresponsive to at least two first generation antipsychotic medications (treatment nonresponsive [TNR]), 24 percent (n = 54) were eligible because they experienced intolerable side effects (treatment intolerant [TI]). Significantly more TI patients discontinued their clozapine trial during the 2-year study compared to TNR patients, and TI patients taking clozapine were more likely to develop agranulocytosis or severe leukopenia. However, TI patients who remained on clozapine showed significant reductions in problematic behaviors and greater movement toward independent living situations than TNR patients. Clinicians should give serious consideration to offering clozapine and other second generation antipsychotic medications to patients who have demonstrated intolerance to first generation antipsychotic medications.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^43987017]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 6

A 60-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with DSM-5 schizophrenia and potomania at the age of 19 was receiving clozapine for 10 years when a first neutropenia occurred. Clozapine was discontinued, leading to numerous psychiatric hospitalizations during the following 2 years. As a result, clozapine was rechallenged with a reduced ANC surveillance threshold (1.0 × 10 9 /L). Two months later, the patient experienced two neutropenia episodes in a row. At that time, the patient was also taking quetiapine, oxazepam, and citalopram. Two doses of filgrastim were given during the last episode, a few days apart, which only led to transitory ANC normalization. Clozapine was withdrawn shortly after as the medical team feared the undocumented innocuity of filgrastim in this off-label use.

Case 7

A 53-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder started clozapine at the age of 43 despite low baseline ANC values. While also receiving sodium valproate, neutropenia occurred 8 years later, leading to clozapine discontinuation. The patient eventually developed thrombocytopenia secondary to sodium valproate, which was switched for lithium. A year after, clozapine was reintroduced with a lowered ANC surveillance threshold. Only 3 months later, ANC dropped below the adjusted threshold and a hematologist suggested prophylactic use of filgrastim, initially twice weekly, and then thrice weekly for a year to allow clozapine to be maintained. G-CSF was eventually stopped due to recurrent leucocytosis, resulting in agranulocytosis 20 days later. Clozapine was stopped and G-CSF was reinstated, with ANC normalization; unfortunately, the patient died from choking on an apple 14 days later and it was concluded that the cause of death was unrelated to agranulocytosis, clozapine or G-CSF.

### Clozapine rechallenge or continuation despite neutropenia or agranulocytosis using colony-stimulating factor: a systematic review [^f28070b0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine (CLZ) is the most efficacious antipsychotic used in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), including in the early stage of treatment, which affects nearly one-third of all patients with schizophrenia (;;). Although it often represents their only opportunity for recovery and reduces suicidality, CLZ use in schizophrenia is as low as 4% in Canada, 2.5%‒5.5% in the United States, and 4.3%‒12.8% in the United Kingdom (;;;;). These low rates are largely due to the potential occurrence of neutropenia/agranulocytosis, which require a strict hematological surveillance. Indeed, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, which can be life-threatening, occur in 3.8% and 0.4%‒0.9% of CLZ users, respectively (;). Of note, these higher rates of neutropenia, compared to other antipsychotics, could also be explained in part by surveillance bias resulting from stricter hematological monitoring as well as undiagnosed cases of benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN). Neutropenia/agranulocytosis induced by CLZ mostly occur during the first 6–12 months of treatment (;). Other risks factors for developing neutropenia while receiving CLZ include being younger, Afro-American, having low baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) values and using drugs also associated with neutropenia.

In most countries, ANC values below 1.5 × 10 9 cells/L during CLZ treatment warrant its discontinuation, but this threshold can be lowered for individuals with BEN. In the United States, since 2015, this threshold has been lowered to 1.0 × 10 9 cells/L, which can be further reduced to 0.5 × 10 9 cells/L for people with BEN. Unsurprisingly, discontinuation of CLZ following neutropenia can have tremendous consequences as a significant proportion of patients will quickly relapse from their TRS, which will in turn represent a major step back in their quest for recovery. For this reason, strategies allowing CLZ rechallenge or treatment pursuit despite neutropenia are a subject of growing interest, even though it remains on an off-label basis except in the United States. So far, both lithium and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs), or less frequently granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSFs), have been used off-label in this context.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^026c48d3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest case series of clozapine rechallenge with the use of G-CSF. Overall, 38% (3/8) patients remained on clozapine treatment after a mean follow-up period of 3 years using only 1-2 G-CSF doses (see Table 1). There were no deaths nor any infectious complications related to clozapine.

Table 1. 
Patients characteristics.

All patients were Caucasian and median age at first neutropenia was 48 years (see Table 1). We observed five late-onset neutropenia (i.e. > 1 years), with a median time of 4.8 years before the initial neutropenia. This is rather surprising considering the rare incidence of neutropenia after the first year of clozapine treatment. Perhaps this could be explained by the fact that clinicians are more likely to rechallenge clozapine in patients experiencing substantial clinical improvement over a long time. On the contrary, clinicians might hesitate to rechallenge patients whose initial clozapine trial was stopped prematurely due to neutropenia, without a well-established long-term response.

Objectives

The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CLZ rechallenge/continuation using CSF following a previous episode of neutropenia or agranulocytosis. Secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of different strategies of CSF administration as well as to identify potential predicting factors of either successful or unsuccessful CLZ rechallenge/continuation.

### Clozapine rechallenge or continuation despite neutropenia or agranulocytosis using colony-stimulating factor: a systematic review [^24beb5c4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While statistical power remains limited by the relatively small number of published cases, factors such as time of onset to first neutropenia and severity of the episode do not necessarily impact the outcome of a subsequent CLZ rechallenge using CSF. Thus, although the efficacy of CSF use to allow successful CLZ rechallenge remains to be adequately evaluated using more robust study designs, its long-term innocuity warrants considering its use more proactively in the management of CLZ hematological adverse events as to maintain this treatment for as many individuals as possible. Although there are insufficient data pointing toward any difference in terms of efficacy and safety between administering CSF on a prophylactic basis or “as-needed” only, the latter could improve accessibility to this costly medication. Further research is essential to further identify which patients would be better suited for this strategy. Hopefully, the development of new treatment strategies that ensure the safety of CLZ treatment, even in the occurrence of serious adverse events, will promote its widespread use and offer patients the best chance of recovery.

### Combination of strategies to initiate clozapine for refractory schizophrenia in a patient with low neutrophil levels [^4197b62b]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Clozapine is the only drug with confirmed efficacy for refractory schizophrenia; however, its use is restricted due to the risk of potentially life-threatening side effects, such as agranulocytosis. Although this restriction ensures safety against haematological risks, some patients with refractory schizophrenia who have low neutrophil levels may miss the opportunity to receive clozapine treatment. We herein report the case of a patient with refractory schizophrenia and low neutrophil levels who was successfully initiated on clozapine treatment after the use of several methods for increasing neutrophil levels. These strategies consisted of discontinuation of antipsychotics, treatment with lithium carbonate and adenine, and light exercise before blood testing. Combining these procedures may be an effective option in the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia whose neutrophil levels are not sufficient to initiate clozapine.

Case 4

A 53-year-old Caucasian male diagnosed with DSM-5 schizophrenia at the age of 22 had been hospitalized for the last 30 years due to TRS. Clozapine was only introduced at the age of 53 due to a low ANC at baseline (around 1.5 × 10 9 /L). Noteworthy, he had received a single dose of clozapine by mistake in his 20s, which led to an ANC drop. However, at that time, the patient was also taking sodium valproate, chlorpromazine and olanzapine. Three months after clozapine initiation, while also receiving quetiapine, a first neutropenia occurred. Clozapine was discontinued but reintroduced 8 months later with a lowered ANC surveillance threshold given his low baseline values (from 1.5 to 1.0 and eventually to 0.8 × 10 9 /L). Despite this adjustment, the patient had nine other neutropenia episodes during which clozapine could nonetheless be maintained using a total of 13 “as-needed” doses of filgrastim over 3 months. Following a 10 th neutropenia, clozapine was discontinued because of severe agranulocytosis.

Case 5

A 21-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with DSM-5 schizophrenia at the age of 20 started clozapine early on following her diagnosis due to a significant substance use disorder history and TRS. She developed neutropenia 4 months later while also taking haloperidol, which was discontinued. Clozapine was maintained, even after a second neutropenia 6 days later, given that in both instances, blood tests repeated in the afternoon showed normal ANC values. After a third episode a few days later, confirmed by an afternoon blood test, a single dose of filgrastim was administered and ANC quickly normalized. Clozapine was maintained and is still ongoing at follow-up.

The following variables were included as independent variables in the analysis based on prior literature or their potential association with patient satisfaction: age, sex, diagnosis, relationship status, highest educational attainment, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), use of recreational drugs, illness duration, clozapine dose, clozapine dose frequency, and the use of antipsychotic polytherapy compared to clozapine monotherapy –,,. Furthermore, participants were asked if they experienced common ADRs associated with clozapine; and if so, which ADRs they experienced (no restrictions to the number of ADRs they could list). This was done using a standardized questionnaire (Supplementary Fig. 1, further explained in ref.). The initial responses to this questionnaire about the occurrence or experience of ADRs were provided by the participants themselves. If a participant was unsure about their answer or if the researcher had doubts about the reliability of the response, the treating physician was consulted for verification. As explained previously, the total number of clozapine-associated ADRs experienced by each participant was then summed to create a new variable: ‘total number of ADRs’.

Severity of schizophrenia symptoms was assessed by the treating physician or trained researcher using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale, ranging from 1 (indicating normal, not ill) to 7 (indicating the most severe level of illness; Supplementary Fig. 2), as also explained before. Additionally, the treating physician evaluated the treatment response level using a 10-point scale, as per criterion A of the Alda scale,. This criterion entails assessing the extent of response (activity of the illness under adequate clozapine treatment) on a scale ranging from 0 (no change or worsening of symptoms) to 10 (complete response; Supplementary Fig. 3),.

Moreover, treatment adherence was assessed during stable periods based on criterion B4 of the Alda scale,. A score of 0 indicates excellent compliance, with all documented clozapine blood levels within the therapeutic range, while a score of 1 indicates good compliance, with 80–99% of blood levels within the therapeutic range. A score of 2 indicates poor compliance, with <80% of blood levels within the therapeutic range (Supplementary Fig. 3). The term ‘therapeutic range’ refers to the target clozapine serum level considered appropriate for the patient, as determined by the treating physician.

### Genetic risk of clozapine-induced leukopenia and neutropenia: a genome-wide association study [^412db33a]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder accompanied by considerable morbidity and mortality, which affects ~1% of the population worldwide. The etiology of schizophrenia is still not well understood. Environmental and genetic factors play important roles in the development of schizophrenia. The heritability of schizophrenia is estimated to be 60–80%,. Antipsychotic medications are commonly used to treat patients with schizophrenia, but responses to these drugs vary widely. Although antipsychotics can relieve symptoms of psychosis, ~75% of patients discontinue their therapy due to adverse effects in two years.

Clozapine is considered to be the most effective antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia and has a distinctive pharmacological profile in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, it is also associated with several adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease and leukopenia. Leukopenia is defined as white blood cell (WBC) count less than 4,000 cells per microliter. Neutropenia and agranulocytosis are different types of leukopenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1,500 and 500 cells per cubic millimeter (mm −3), respectively. Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA) is a severe leukopenia that may be life-threatening, first reported in Finland in 1974,. Among patients taking clozapine, the cumulative risk of neutropenia is 3.8% and for agranulocytosis is 0.9%.

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^52828eb8]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The immune system appears to be dysregulated in schizophrenia (SZ). The potential prognostic or diagnostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inexpensive proxy marker for a wide spectrum of conditions, has not been established in SZ. We seek to investigate a) whether NLR is increased in SZ patients, b) if this difference in more prominent in relapsed SZ or first-episode psychosis.

Methods

A structured algorithm was applied in MEDLINE (1946-2018), PsychInfo, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (1999-2018), PSYNDEX (1984-2017) and Clinicaltrials.gov (2008-2018) databases.

Results

Through the database search, 1023 articles were screened. Ten studies (804 SZ patients, 671 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. In SZ patients, the NLR was increased by 0.65 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.86, p < 10 -5 ). This difference was significant in both acute relapse and first-episode psychosis subgroups. Studies of moderate and high quality also showed a significant NLR increase in SZ patients (I 2  = 0%). Meta-regression analysis showed that the polymorphonuclear count and antipsychotic use may confound the result. In leave-one-out meta-analysis, no study altered the significance of the result when omitted.

Conclusions

NLR in SZ patients is increased, both in chronic disease and in first-episode psychosis. Baseline characteristics, such as polymorphonuclear count and antipsychotic use, may affect its accuracy. The application of this marker in clinical practice requires the description of its normal values in the general population, its potential change after antipsychotic administration and its correlation with disease activity. A large-scale, prospective study design would resolve these issues.

### Aprueba el nuevo programa REMS compartido para todos (...) [^8dcfdc2e]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Las recomendaciones de monitoreo para detectar la neutropenia ocasionada por el tratamiento con clozapina han cambiado. La clozapina puede reducir el número de neutrófilos en sangre, en algunos casos provocando una neutropenia severa. Como se describe en la información revisada de prescripción para clozapina, y en el Programa REMS de clozapina, la neutropenia será monitoreada únicamente por el conteo absoluto de neutrófilos, en lugar de hacerlo en conjunto con el conteo de glóbulos blancos.
- El conteo absoluto de neutrófilos es el único resultado de pruebas aceptado en el Programa REMS para clozapina con el fin de monitorear la neutropenia:
- Si el paciente es ambulatorio, el ANC debe reportarse al Programa REMS para clozapina antes de despachar la clozapina.
- Si el paciente está hospitalizado, el ANC debe ser reportado dentro del lapso de 7 días de la muestra de sangre más reciente.
- Los pacientes con neutropenia étnica benigna pueden tratarse ahora con clozapina.
- Existen dos algoritmos de monitoreo para el ANC: . Para pacientes de la población general, es decir, aquellos __sin__neutropenia étnica benigna, interrumpir el tratamiento si se sospecha que la neutropenia es inducida por la clozapina para un ANC menor a 1, 000 células por microlitro. Para pacientes con BEN, interrumpir el tratamiento si se sospecha que la neutropenia es inducida por la clozapina para un ANC menor a 500 células por microlitro.
- Todos los pacientes listados en el NNRMF serán automáticamente transferidos al Programa REMS para clozapina y estarán claramente identificados.

### Immunomodulatory effects of clozapine and their clinical implications: what have we learned so far? [^59bb406d]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

Clozapine remains the drug of choice for treatment resistant schizophrenia, but is associated with potentially life threatening side effects, including agranulocytosis and myocarditis. Immunological mechanisms may be involved in the development of these side effects or in the unique antipsychotic efficacy in subgroups of schizophrenia patients. This systematic review presents the immunomodulatory effects of clozapine from human in vitro and in vivo studies and relates these findings to the developments of adverse and therapeutic effects of clozapine. Several studies confirm the immunomodulatory actions of clozapine, but only few studies investigated their relationship to the unique adverse and therapeutic effects of clozapine. During the first month of clozapine treatment, up to 50% of patients develop fever and flu like symptoms, which is seemingly driven by increased cytokines. Within the same time period, the risk of side-effects with a suspected immunological mechanism peaks. Patients developing fever during the first weeks of treatment should have a thorough physical examination, and measurements of white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, ECG, C-reactive protein, creatinine kinase, and troponin to exclude infection, agranulocytosis, myocarditis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. To what degree the unique antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine in subgroups of schizophrenia patients is related to its immunomodulatory effects has not been studied. Research relating the immunomodulatory actions of clozapine and its early markers to clinically relevant adverse and therapeutic outcomes is hoped to provide new leads for the understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and aid the development of novel treatment targets.

### Severe neutropenia unrelated to clozapine in patients receiving clozapine [^ebcf6af0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clozapine is known to cause agranulocytosis. Mandatory monitoring schemes are aimed at reducing the risk of agranulocytosis and of the consequences of agranulocytosis. All cases of agranulocytosis occurring in people prescribed clozapine are assumed to be caused by clozapine.

Methods

In a previous study, we examined a cohort of patients listed on our hospital database as having had clozapine-induced agranulocytosis and applied specific criteria to identify those with confirmed clozapine-related, life-threatening agranulocytosis. In this study, we examine the cases not meeting these specific criteria.

Results

In the original study, 9 of 23 cases met the criteria for clozapine-induced, life-threatening agranulocytosis. Of the 13 remaining cases for whom data were available, 5 were probably caused by clozapine but were not life-threatening. Three cases were the result of concomitant cancer chemotherapy. Three were anomalous results probably related to measurement error. For the remaining two cases, the cause was not identified.

Conclusion

Not all cases of agranulocytosis occurring in people taking clozapine are caused by clozapine. The widely used threshold criterion-based diagnosis overestimates the risk of agranulocytosis. True clozapine-related agranulocytosis is best identified by pattern-based criteria: rapid fall in neutrophil counts over around 2 weeks to below 0.5 × 109/L for two consecutive days (unless clozapine is stopped very early or granulocyte colony stimulating factor is given) where other possible causes (benign ethnic neutropenia, cancer chemotherapy) can be ruled out.

### Clozapine rechallenge or continuation despite neutropenia or agranulocytosis using colony-stimulating factor: a systematic review [^2d0ef67c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Rechallenge/continuation of clozapine in association with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) following neutropenia/agranulocytosis has been reported, but many questions remain unanswered about efficacy and safety. This systematic review aims to assess the efficacy and safety of rechallenging/continuing clozapine in patients following neutropenia/agranulocytosis using CSFs.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception date to July 31, 2022. Articles screening and data extraction were realized independently by two reviewers, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 systematic review guidance. Included articles had to report on at least one case where clozapine was rechallenged/continued using CSFs despite previous neutropenia/agranulocytosis.

Results

Eight hundred forty articles were retrieved; 34 articles met the inclusion criteria, totaling 59 individual cases. Clozapine was successfully rechallenged/continued in 76% of patients for an average follow-up period of 1.9years. There was a trend toward better efficacy reported in case reports/series, compared with consecutive case series (overall success rates of 84% and 60%, respectively, p -value=0.065). Two administration strategies were identified, "as-needed" and prophylactic, both yielding similar success rates (81% and 80%, respectively). Only mild and transient adverse events were documented.

Conclusions

Although limited by the relatively small number of published cases, factors such as time of onset to first neutropenia and severity of the episode did not seem to impact the outcome of a subsequent clozapine rechallenge using CSFs. While the efficacy of this strategy remains to be further adequately evaluated in more rigorous study designs, its long-term innocuity warrants considering its use more proactively in the management of clozapine hematological adverse events as to maintain this treatment for as many individuals as possible.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^ede30305]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

A mean number of 4 (ranging from one to ten events) neutropenia events were observed for each patient. Almost every patient (7/8) had one or more subsequent ANC drop following the initial neutropenia. For these patients, as previously observed in other studies, subsequent neutropenia episodes developed quicker following clozapine rechallenge, with lower mean ANC at nadir for the third and subsequent neutropenia episode in comparison to the first.

Lithium use to induce leucocytosis seems to be a common practice in Quebec as it was used at some point in 7/8 cases while it was only used in 5/30 cases in a previous systematic review.

As for G-CSF use, 7/8 patients had an “as-needed” strategy with a pre-established ANC threshold varying from 0.5 × 10 9 /L to 1.5 × 10 9 /L. Intervals between doses and number of doses received by patients varied extensively (see Table 1). Patient 7 was the only one receiving G-CSF with a prophylactic strategy. He received regular doses of G-CSF for a year with an adequate hematologic response during that time. G-CSF prescription patterns reported herein thus differ from previously published cases where G-CSF was most commonly given using a prophylactic protocol. However, in contrast with a previous systematic review that reported a 100% success rate for clozapine rechallenge associated with the “as-needed” use of G-CSF, that strategy was successful in only three out of seven cases. The “as-needed” strategies used in this case series were identical in terms of ANC threshold to the identified cases in Myles and colleagues’ review but, differed slightly in terms of G-CSF agents used. Given that a younger age is associated with an increased rechallenge success rate, this discrepancy could in part be accounted by the fact that patients described here were on average more than 10 years older than previously published case reports (;). Consequently, considering the small number of published cases and the potential for publication bias, uncertainty remains as to which G-CSF strategy should be favored.

### Evaluating reduced blood monitoring frequency and the detection of hematological abnormalities in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia: a chart review study from the COVID-19 pandemic [^28362983]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To date, clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.Schizophrenia is a disabling psychiatric disorder characterized by positive (eg, hallucinations, delusions), negative (eg, anhedonia, avolition), and cognitive (eg, impairment in executive functioning) symptoms. Over recent decades, second-generation antipsychotics (eg, risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine) have emerged as effective treatments by blocking 5HT2A and D2 receptors.Prescription of second-generation antipsychotics has surged since their approval in Canada in the 1990s, largely due to their lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects.However, a major reported barrier to clozapine’s broader use is the stringent blood monitoring protocol due to a 1% estimated risk of severe neutropenia, known as agranulocytosis.

Recent research reporting that the risk of agranulocytosis with clozapine treatment is less than 1% has intensified debate surrounding the necessity of current blood monitoring protocols.In Canada, patients on clozapine must undergo weekly monitoring during the first 26 weeks, biweekly for the next 26 weeks, and then monthly thereafter.This requirement was established 30 years ago when robust data on the long-term risk of agranulocytosis and mortality associated with clozapine were lacking. Since then, many studieshave estimated that the risk of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis falls between 0.3% and 0.8%, which is comparable to rates for other medications that have no monitoring requirements, such as typical antipsychotics (0.1–1.4/1000 patient-years) and Mianserin (0.66/1000 patient-years).Moreover, the estimated mortality rate from clozapine without bloodwork monitoring ranges between 0.02 and 0.38/1000 patient-years, which aligns with mortality rates from sudden death associated with typical antipsychotics (1.0–1.5/1000 patient-years) and Mianserin (0.01/1000 patient-years). Despite these findings, blood monitoring frequency for clozapine varies internationally, and meta-analytic data indicate no significant difference in rates of severe clozapine-induced neutropenia across 5 continents.The stringent hematological requirements may reduce clozapine use, potentially leaving many patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia without effective treatment.Thus, it is crucial to find a balance between the benefits of frequent bloodwork frequency against the risk that these requirements might limit access to effective treatment.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^a3d0dcfa]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia spectrum disorders in youth—a clinical standard: A trial of clozapine should be considered for youth with treatment resistant schizophrenia spectrum disorders [CS]. Before using clozapine, it is important to review the child’s clinical status and treatment history to ensure that the presentation accurately reflects treatment refractory schizophrenia, and for complicated cases or the apparent diagnosis of schizophrenia in a younger child (e.g., <12 years), a diagnostic second opinion may be warranted. When using clozapine, systematic monitoring of side effects, including following established protocols for blood count monitoring, is required; white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts are obtained at baseline and weekly for the first 6 months to monitor the risk for agranulocytosis, and protocols require a coordinated effort among the pharmacy, laboratory, and physician to ensure that the blood count parameters are being monitored concurrently with prescriptions.

PRECAUCIONES

General: los procedimientos que implican el uso de medios de contraste radiopacos deben llevarse a cabo bajo la dirección de personal con la capacitación requerida y con un conocimiento profundo del procedimiento particular que se realizará. Los antecedentes de asma bronquial, atopia, como lo evidencian la fiebre del heno y el eccema, o una reacción previa a un agente de contraste, merecen especial atención. Se debe tener precaución con el uso de medios radiopacos en pacientes severamente debilitados y en aquellos con hipertensión marcada o enfermedad cardiaca avanzada. No se recomienda la ingestión de bario en pacientes con antecedentes de aspiración de alimentos. Tenga cuidado si administra este producto a pacientes en quienes se desconoce la integridad del mecanismo de deglución. Si se aspira bario en la laringe, se debe interrumpir inmediatamente la administración posterior. Después de cualquier estudio con bario del tracto gastrointestinal, puede ser importante rehidratar al paciente lo más rápido posible para evitar la impactación del bario. Para evitar la impactación del bario en el colon, también puede ser necesario el uso de laxantes suaves como leche de magnesia o lactulosa después de la finalización del examen. Estos laxantes suaves se recomiendan de forma rutinaria y en pacientes con antecedentes de estreñimiento a menos que esté clínicamente contraindicado.

### When can patients with potentially life-threatening adverse effects be rechallenged with clozapine? A systematic review of the published literature [^263d66fd]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clozapine is widely prescribed for treatment refractory patients with schizophrenia, but its use is limited by potentially life threatening adverse effects. Rechallenge after these complications has been occasionally attempted in patients with severe psychotic symptoms.

Objective

To review the outcome of clozapine rechallenge after potentially life threatening adverse effects.

Methods

Electronic, all-language, literature search (1972-2011) followed by demographic and clinical data extraction. The outcome of rechallenge was considered favorable when the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the proportion of patients who could continue clozapine was >50%.

Results

Altogether, 138 patients (mean age: 36.3years, 65.7% male, 57.6% Caucasian, virtually all with schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis) underwent clozapine rechallenge after developing neutropenia (n=112), agranulocytosis (n=15), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) (n=5), myocarditis (n=4), pericarditis (n=1) and lupus erythematosus (n=1). Rechallenge strategies were heterogeneous and not systematically evaluated. Clozapine rechallenge was successful in 78/112 patients (69.6%, CI: 60.6-77.4) after neutropenia, 3/15 (20%, CI: 7.1-45.2) after agranulocytosis, 5/5 (100%, CI: 56-100) after NMS, 3/4 (75%, CI: 30-95) after myocarditis, 1/1 after pericarditis, and 0/1 after clozapine-induced lupus. Successfully rechallenged patients were followed for 16-96weeks. None of the rechallenged patients died.

Conclusions

Although controlled studies are clearly needed, using a priori, confidence interval-based criteria, case reports/series suggest that in refractory patients who benefited from clozapine, careful rechallenge can be considered after neutropenia and NMS, but not after agranulocytosis and myocarditis.

### An international guideline with six personalised titration schedules for preventing myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine [^03156217]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

White blood cell (WBC) monitoring has reduced clozapine-treated patient deaths associated with agranulocytosis to a rarity. However, clozapine protocols and package inserts worldwide provide no instructions for preventing myocarditis or pneumonia during clozapine titrations. Prescribers worldwide are largely unaware of that. Meanwhile, as they worry about agranulocytosis, their clozapine-treated patients are at risk of dying from pneumonia or myocarditis. Consequently, an international guideline with 104 authors from 50 countries/regions was recently published to provide personalised clozapine titration schedules for adult inpatients. This forum article reviews pneumonia and myocarditis occurring during clozapine titration, as well as the three most innovative aspects of this new guideline: (1) personalised titration, (2) C reactive protein (CRP) measures, and (3) dose predictions based on blood levels. Clozapine metabolism is influenced by 3 levels of complexity: (1) ancestry groups, (2) sex-smoking subgroups, and (3) presence/absence of poor metabolizer status. These 3 groups of variables should determine the maintenance dose and speed of clozapine titration; they are summarised in a table in the full-text. The international clozapine titration guideline recommends measuring CRP levels simultaneously with WBC, at baseline and weekly at least for the first 4 weeks of titration, the highest risk period for clozapine-induced myocarditis.

### Pharmacogenomics of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bb3186f6]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a debilitating condition that affects as many as 20 million people worldwide. Approximately 20–30% of these individuals experience treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), which is characterized by ongoing psychotic symptoms and functional impairments despite adequate trials with different antipsychotic medications. At present, clozapine remains the standard treatment of choice for TRS recommended by international guidelines due to its superior efficacy compared to other existing antipsychotics. Despite the abundance of robust evidence supporting the effectiveness of clozapine in improving outcomes for TRS patients, clozapine is underutilized due to concerns about tolerability and monitoring, and its initiation is commonly delayed for several years in many countries worldwide, including in the USA and Canada. Studies have even suggested that the utilization of clozapine earlier in treatment, rather than waiting for multiple drug failures and subsequent severe TRS, results in better response. Further, initiation of clozapine has been shown to reduce healthcare costs by decreasing the number of hospitalizations and shifting care from inpatient to outpatient.

### Assessment and management of patients at risk for suicide: synopsis of the 2024 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^346ed482]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clozapine for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with suicidality—we suggest clozapine to reduce the risk of suicide attempts for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and either suicidal ideation or a history of suicide attempt(s). This is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, and the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was low with limitations including a small sample size; the benefits slightly outweighed potential harms such as weight gain, lipid abnormalities, sialorrhea, somnolence, and the rarely occurring but serious adverse events of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Monitoring and infrastructure burdens are emphasized: the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) mandates frequent visits to monitor laboratory results before refills, requires capacities to meet FDA regulatory requirements including laboratory tests to monitor neutrophil levels, training for pharmacies and prescribers, registration of pharmacies, prescribers, and patients, and reporting of episodes of neutropenia. Patients may be unwilling to commit to repeated weekly blood draws over six months, and clozapine is often used as the antipsychotic of last resort due to risks such as agranulocytosis.

### FDA modifies monitoring for neutropenia associated with... [^b0c773e5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety Announcement The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is making changes to the requirements for monitoring, prescribing, dispensing, and receiving the schizophrenia medicine clozapine, to address continuing safety concerns and current knowledge about a serious blood condition called severe neutropenia. Severe neutropenia is a dangerously low number of neutrophils, white blood cells that help fight infections. Severe neutropenia can be life-threatening. The monitoring recommendations for neutropenia caused by clozapine treatment have changed. Clozapine can decrease the number of neutrophils in the blood, in some cases causing severe neutropenia. As described in the revised clozapine prescribing information, and in the Clozapine REMS Program, neutropenia will be monitored by the absolute neutrophil count only, rather than in conjunction with the white blood cell count.

Moreover, in the Clozapine REMS Program, the requirements for ANC are being modified so that patients will be able to continue on clozapine treatment with a lower ANC, a change that will allow continued treatment for a greater number of patients. In addition, patients with benign ethnic neutropenia, who previously were not eligible for clozapine treatment, will now be able to receive the medicine.
- Important changes to the neutropenia monitoring recommendations and treatment algorithm for clozapine include:
- Absolute neutrophil count is the only test result accepted in the Clozapine REMS Program to monitor for neutropenia:
- If the patient is an outpatient, the ANC must be reported to the Clozapine REMS Program before clozapine is dispensed. For general population patients, i. e. , those __without__benign ethnic neutropenia, interrupt treatment if neutropenia is suspected to be clozapine-induced for ANC less than 1, 000 cells per microliter.

For patients with BEN, interrupt treatment if neutropenia is suspected to be clozapine-induced for ANC less than 500 cells per microliter.
- All patients listed in the NNRMF will be automatically transferred to the Clozapine REMS Program and clearly identified.
- Absolute neutrophil count is the only test result accepted in the Clozapine REMS Program to monitor for neutropenia:

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Discuss the following issues with patients and caregivers:

• Severe Neutropenia:

Instruct patients (and caregivers) beginning treatment with clozapine about the risk of developing severe neutropenia and infection.
Instruct patients to immediately report to their physician any symptom or sign of infection (e.g., flu-like illness; fever; lethargy; general weakness or malaise; mucus membrane ulceration; skin, pharyngeal, vaginal, urinary, or pulmonary infection; or extreme weakness or lethargy) occurring at any time during clozapine therapy, to aid in evaluation for neutropenia and to institute prompt and appropriate management. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.12, 5.14)] .
Inform patients and caregivers clozapine is available only through a restricted program called the Clozapine REMS Program designed to ensure the required blood monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of developing severe neutropenia. Advise patients and caregivers of the importance of having blood tested as follows:
Weekly blood tests are required for the first 6 months.
An ANC is required every 2 weeks for the next 6 months if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the first 6 months of continuous therapy,
An ANC is required once every 4 weeks thereafter if an acceptable ANC is maintained during the second 6 months of continuous therapy.
Clozapine is available only from certified pharmacies participating in the program. Provide patients (and caregivers) with website information and the telephone number on how to obtain the product (www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

### Clozapine (Clozaril) [^463af037]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder

The effectiveness of CLOZARIL in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was assessed in the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT™, a trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group comparison of CLOZARIL versus olanzapine (*Zyprexa®, a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company) in 956 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) who were judged to be at risk for recurrent suicidal behavior. Only about one-fourth of these patients (27%) were considered resistant to standard antipsychotic drug treatment. To enter the trial, patients must have met 1 of the following criteria:

They had attempted suicide within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation.
They had been hospitalized to prevent a suicide attempt within the three years prior to their baseline evaluation.
They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation with a depressive component within one week prior to their baseline evaluation.
They demonstrated moderate-to-severe suicidal ideation accompanied by command hallucinations to do self-harm within one week prior to their baseline evaluation.

Dosing regimens for each treatment group were determined by individual investigators and were individualized by patient. Dosing was flexible, with a dose range of 200–900 mg/day for CLOZARIL and 5–20 mg/day for olanzapine. For the 956 patients who received CLOZARIL or olanzapine in this study, there was extensive use of concomitant psychotropics: 84% with antipsychotics, 65% with anxiolytics, 53% with antidepressants, and 28% with mood stabilizers. There was significantly greater use of concomitant psychotropic medications among the patients in the olanzapine group.

### Hematological adverse events in clozapine-treated children and adolescents [^cf7f0fa2]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To retrospectively examine rates of hematological adverse events (HAEs) in psychiatrically ill, hospitalized children treated with clozapine.

Method

Clozapine treatment was administered in an open-label fashion using a flexible titration schedule, and data from weekly complete blood counts was obtained. The rate of neutropenia and agranulocytosis (HAEs) development was determined for 172 eligible patients (mean age at clozapine initiation, 15.03 +/- 2.13 years) with a median observation period of 8 months.

Results

Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1,500/mm) developed in 23 (13%) patients and agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm) in one (0.6%) patient. The cumulative probability of developing an initial HAE at 1 year of clozapine treatment was 16.1% (95% confidence interval 9.7%-22.5%). Eleven (48%) of 24 patients who developed an HAE were successfully rechallenged on clozapine. Eight (5%) of 172 patients from this sample eventually discontinued clozapine because of an HAE (one agranulocytosis, seven neutropenia).

Conclusions

The occurrence of HAEs is a significant risk associated with the administration of clozapine. However, in this sample, few children actually discontinued therapy because of an HAE and the incidence of agranulocytosis does not appear higher than what has been reported in the adult literature.

### Clozapine rechallenge following neutropenia using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: a Quebec case series [^0b765d6a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background:

Clozapine has a unique efficacy profile among individuals suffering from treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but is associated with hematological side effects. The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) to allow clozapine continuation or rechallenge has emerged as a promising option, but evidence is still scarce.

Aim:

To describe the largest case series so far published regarding this practice.

Method:

A national clozapine hematological monitoring database was consulted to identify all patients who had had neutrophil count <1.5 × 10 9 /L since 2004 in Quebec and was cross-referenced with hospital pharmacy software to identify patients who had received at least one dose of G-CSF, such as filgrastim, while being exposed to clozapine. All data were collected retrospectively, using patients’ medical files, from January to July 2019.

Results:

Using G-CSF, three out of eight patients could maintain clozapine despite neutropenia episodes that otherwise would have required treatment discontinuation. The only side effect reported was mild short-lived back pain, over a mean 3-year follow-up period. In all but one case, filgrastim was used on an “as-needed” basis at doses of 300 mcg administered subcutaneously.

Conclusion:

These results suggest that the “as-needed” use of G-CSF is well-tolerated and may allow clozapine rechallenge in some well-selected patients, adding to the paucity of data regarding long-term safety and efficacy of this strategy. More research may help to better define potential candidates and optimal regimen of such practice.

### Distinctive pattern of neutrophil count change in clozapine-associated, life-threatening agranulocytosis [^69e2577b]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

The wider use of clozapine is limited by the risk of agranulocytosis and the associated requirement for monitoring of neutrophil counts. We searched local electronic patient records for cases of agranulocytosis occurring during clozapine treatment during the period 2007-2020. We found 23 episodes recorded as agranulocytosis in clozapine patients. Of these, nine met pre-defined criteria and were considered episodes of life-threatening agranulocytosis (LTA). These episodes of clozapine-induced LTA exhibited a distinct pattern of continuous and rapid neutrophil count decline to zero or near zero. Mean time for neutrophils to fall from ANC>2 to ANC<0.5×10 9 /L was 8.4 days (range 2-15 days). Each event was also characterised by a prolonged nadir and delayed recovery (range 4-16 days). Non-LTA episodes were, in contrast, brief and benign. We conclude that an important proportion of cases of agranulocytosis identified in people prescribed clozapine are not life-threatening and may not even be clozapine-related. Monitoring schemes should aim to identify true clozapine-induced LTA as opposed to threshold-defined nominal agranulocytosis. Genetics studies might benefit from examining associations with clozapine-induced LTA rather than with recorded cases of agranulocytosis or neutropenia.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline—clozapine safety, monitoring, and practical requirements: Safe and effective use of clozapine requires ‘laboratory tests to monitor neutrophil levels; training for both pharmacies and prescribers; registration of pharmacies, prescribers, and patients; and reporting of episodes of neutropenia,’ as well as ‘the need for increased clinical contacts…starting at very low doses and increasing gradually.’ Access barriers related to benign ethnic neutropenia were addressed through ‘modifications in the Clozapine REMS protocols for blood testing in people with BEN.’ Both systematic reviews note ‘clinically useful associations exist between plasma levels of clozapine and its metabolites and clinical responses,’ and ‘speculations have occurred that titrating doses to adjust plasma levels could enhance therapeutic benefits.’ Additional findings ‘suggest that smoking increases the rate of clozapine metabolism,’ with smoking cessation or reduction on a constant dose increasing blood levels and toxicity, while starting or restarting smoking can decrease levels and reduce effectiveness; aging ‘decreases the rate of clozapine metabolism’ and ‘physiological changes related to aging increase the risks of several adverse effects.’ Therefore, ‘safe, effective use of clozapine might require the availability of laboratory resources to evaluate blood levels and providers who have the training and knowledge required to interpret them.’

### Clozapine [^2bfefd8d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for clozapine management due to their lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing clozapine treatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN.

General Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia

Fever: Interrupt clozapine as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops fever, defined as a temperature of 38.5°C [101.3°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level. Fever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection.
ANC less than 1000/µL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/µL, initiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for management.
Consider hematology consultation.
See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome [NMS] and Fever under WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17) .

Rechallenge after an ANC less than 500/µL (severe neutropenia) 

For some patients who experience severe clozapine-related neutropenia, the risk of serious psychiatric illness from discontinuing clozapine treatment may be greater than the risk of rechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other than clozapine). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a patient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with clozapine or a clozapine product.

If a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2 and 3, the patient’s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of clozapine rechallenge, and the severity and characteristics of the neutropenic episode.

Using Clozapine with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia 

It is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or severity of clozapine-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid clozapine treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If clozapine is used concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic agents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in Tables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy.

### Add-on filgrastim during clozapine rechallenge unsuccessful in preventing agranulocytosis [^35770867]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor agents such as filgrastim can be administered in order to reduce the duration of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. Successful long-term combination treatment with filgrastim and clozapine in patients with previous clozapine-induced agranulocytosis has been described in several cases. We describe a patient with schizophrenia who developed agranulocytosis during treatment with clozapine and who did not respond to other antipsychotics. Add-on treatment with filgrastim during a clozapine rechallenge did not prevent the reoccurrence of agranulocytosis, and clozapine treatment had to be discontinued. Our case suggests that add-on filgrastim is a therapeutic option when clozapine is rechallenged, but physicians should be aware of the potential dangers especially severe clozapine-induced agranulocytosis.

clozapine possession in the past 365 days. Outcomes of interest: Mild neutropenia: absolute neutrophil count 1000-1499 cells/µL; moderate neutropenia: ANC 500-999 cells/µL; severe neutropenia: ANC < 500 cells/µL. patients identified with severe neutropenia during VA follow-up. Results: Descriptive: Of 9300 patients treated with clozapine during the study period, 6488 clozapine initiators met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, with approximately 250-300 new patients added each year. The mean age was 50. 2 years,

### High neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio upon admission is associated with better response in psychotic depression [^99f5f528]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence relates the inflammatory system to the aetiology and evolution of mood disorders. The Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is an affordable and reproducible biomarker of inflammation. The aim of the study is to retrospectively evaluate the association between NLR and response to treatment in 50 patients aged over 50 with a diagnosis of Psychotic Depression (PD) who were admitted to an acute psychiatric unit between 2010 and 2018. They were stratified according to sex and treatment received: antidepressants, antipsychotics and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The NLR was collected on admission and the clinical response was quantified by the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. In the simple linear regression, high NLR upon admission was associated with better clinical response during hospitalization as measured by GAF. When stratifying the patients, this association was maintained in women, in patients who received antidepressant treatment with tricyclics and SNRIs, antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine/quetiapine and those who did not receive ECT. NLR is an accessible biomarker in clinical practice, and in PD patients it could guide the therapeutic strategy and be a predictor of response.

PRECAUCIONES

PRECAUCIONES: General: los procedimientos que implican el uso de medios de contraste radiopacos deben llevarse a cabo bajo la dirección de personal con la capacitación requerida y con un conocimiento profundo del procedimiento particular que se realizará. Los antecedentes de asma bronquial, atopia, como lo evidencian la fiebre del heno y el eccema, o una reacción previa a un agente de contraste, merecen especial atención. Se debe tener precaución con el uso de medios radiopacos en pacientes severamente debilitados y en aquellos con hipertensión marcada o enfermedad cardiaca avanzada. No se recomienda la ingestión de bario en pacientes con antecedentes de aspiración de alimentos. Tenga cuidado si administra este producto a pacientes en quienes se desconoce la integridad del mecanismo de deglución. Si se aspira bario en la laringe, se debe interrumpir inmediatamente la administración posterior. Después de cualquier estudio con bario del tracto gastrointestinal, puede ser importante rehidratar al paciente lo más rápido posible para evitar la impactación del bario. Para evitar la impactación del bario en el colon, también puede ser necesario el uso de laxantes suaves como leche de magnesia o lactulosa después de la finalización del examen. Estos laxantes suaves se recomiendan de forma rutinaria y en pacientes con antecedentes de estreñimiento a menos que esté clínicamente contraindicado.

### Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) can allow treatment with clozapine in a patient with severe benign ethnic neutropaenia (BEN): a case report [^a33f230b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Clozapine is the treatment of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it is associated with a risk of neutropaenia and agranulocytosis. Clozapine use is regulated by mandatory blood monitoring in the UK, requiring cessation of treatment should the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) drop below specified values. Benign reductions in the ANC in non-white populations are common, and this can preclude a patient from receiving treatment with clozapine. A diagnosis of benign ethnic neutropaenia can reduce these treatment restrictions (UK specific), but the degree of neutropaenia can be significant enough to still prevent treatment. In this report, we show that response to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be quite variable and difficult to predict, but with careful monitoring it can be used to increase the ANC count and allow continued treatment with clozapine.

### Olanzapine pamoate (Zyprexa) [^4bf1bd9c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of olanzapine pamoate ER IM (also known as Zyprexa Relprevv): 
- Cognitive difficulties, motor impairment: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- Decreased gastrointestinal motility: use caution in patients with constipation or a history of paralytic ileus or related conditions.
- Decreased WBC count, decreased blood neutrophil count, agranulocytosis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis. Monitor CBC frequently during the first few months in patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever and other symptoms or signs of infection.
- DRESS syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of DRESS syndrome.
- Dysphagia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal dysmotility and aspiration.
- Exacerbation of urinary retention: use caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention or clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy.
- Falls: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine can cause somnolence, postural hypotension, and motor and sensory instability, which may result in falls and fractures.
- Hyperprolactinemia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of olanzapine may increase prolactin levels.
- Impaired thermoregulation: maintain a high level of suspicion, as antipsychotic agents have been associated with an increased risk of impaired thermoregulation, resulting in a reduced ability to lower core body temperature.
- Metabolic changes: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Obtain fasting blood glucose testing and a lipid profile before initiation and periodically during treatment.
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- Orthostatic hypotension: use caution in patients with known CVD, cerebrovascular disease, conditions predisposing to hypotension, or taking other drugs increasing the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or CNS depression.
- Seizure: use caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder.
- Suicidal ideation: use caution in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
- Tardive dyskinesia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as olanzapine has been associated with an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia, especially in the elderly.

### Why is my patient neutropenic? [^41e7d6ef]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Neutropenia is a common reason for hematology consultations in the inpatient and outpatient settings and is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL. Neutropenia varies in severity, with more profound neutropenia being associated with higher rates of infections and infection-related deaths. The causes for neutropenia are diverse and include congenital and acquired conditions (ie, autoimmune, drugs, infection, and malignancy). This article outlines the most common causes of neutropenia and discusses differential diagnoses, treatment modalities, and the mechanisms by which neutropenia occurs.

### Monitoring white blood cell count in adult patients with schizophrenia who are taking clozapine: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^0ebb2f4e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term monitoring of white blood cell count is compulsory in patients taking clozapine, although the incidence of drug-induced agranulocytosis is lower than previously expected. The cost-effectiveness of this monitoring is unknown. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of various strategies to monitor white blood cell count in adult patients with schizophrenia taking clozapine.

Methods

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of four strategies for monitoring white blood cell count (national strategies used in the UK, USA, and European countries, and a hypothetical 8-week strategy) compared with that of no monitoring. We used a semi-Markov model to do the cost-utility analysis from a health-care perspective with a 3-year time horizon, assuming a probability of 0·7% that a patient would develop agranulocytosis. Clinical and resource parameters were based on data from national registries of patients treated with clozapine, study cohorts, and a pharmacovigilance database; we derived estimates of health-related quality of life and mortality from the scientific literature. We assessed model uncertainty, including time horizon, with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Findings

Compared with no monitoring, all four monitoring strategies increased quality-adjusted survival by less than 1 day per patient; more than 5000 patients would need to be monitored to avoid one death. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were at least US$970000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for all four strategies compared with no monitoring. The ICERs were highest in the strategies with highest frequencies and longest durations of monitoring. The results remained robust in the one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, suggesting that no monitoring had the highest probability of being cost effective.

Interpretation

Existing strategies for monitoring white blood cell count in patients taking clozapine, based on divergent national requirements, do not seem to be cost effective. This finding should be taken into account by public health authorities and policy makers in the revision of guidance for clozapine prescription.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^796e6f8d]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia—augmentation of clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) is addressed as follows: “The evidence suggests augmenting clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic medication,” and it is “categorized as Reviewed, New-added.” The Work Group’s “confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low,” and “for clozapine-resistant, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, the benefits of augmenting treatment with clozapine by adding a second-generation antipsychotic slightly outweighed the potential harms of adverse events or worsened symptoms.” Cautions include that “discontinuation and consideration of other avenues of treatment, such as a different antipsychotic medication or procedural treatments (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]), might be prudent,” and that “caution and careful consideration of patient goals and side effect profiles should be considered.” Burden and acceptability are noted: “The use of clozapine alone can be burdensome because of the Clozapine REMS requirement of blood draws for monitoring the risk arising from the presence of dangerous neutropenia and cardiomyopathy,” and “for some individuals, adding an SGA to augment clozapine for residual symptoms of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia might not represent an increased burden,” whereas “for some patients, acceptability implications might be a factor when adding an SGA to clozapine because of the increased burden of side effects.” “Patient values and preferences varied because some individuals might express concern over treatment with additional medications.” Recommendation: “We suggest augmenting clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic medication for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who have not experienced an adequate response to clozapine.”

### Sudden late onset of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis [^22c8cb19]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a patient who suddenly developed agranulocytosis after long-term clozapine therapy.

Case Summary

A 41-year-old white man suddenly developed agranulocytosis after 89 months of nearly continuous clozapine therapy. During this time, which included the addition of risperidone to the treatment regimen, his white blood cell (WBC) and granulocyte counts remained stable. One week after having stable hematologic counts, the patient suddenly developed agranulocytosis. WBC and granulocyte counts returned to baseline shortly after discontinuation of all medications and administration of sargramostim.

Discussion

The main factor limiting the use of clozapine as a first-line agent in mentally ill patients is the risk of agranulocytosis. Although the greatest risk of developing this adverse reaction is during the initial 6-month exposure, clozapine-induced agranulocytosis continues to pose a risk after years of exposure. Current product labeling requires weekly WBC and granulocyte monitoring for the first 6 months of treatment with clozapine, which may be decreased to biweekly monitoring after 6 months. Based on the sudden and late onset of agranulocytosis in our patient, clinicians may consider opting for weekly monitoring of hematologic function for patients on long-term clozapine therapy. The likelihood that clozapine was the cause of the agranulocytosis was rated possible according to the Naranjo probability scale.

Conclusions

Clinicians must remain vigilant to trends in WBC and granulocyte counts and may wish to consider weekly hematologic monitoring regardless of duration of clozapine therapy. Patient and treatment system compliance with the registries' protocol regarding WBC monitoring is instrumental in reducing morbidity and mortality rates associated with clozapine use.
