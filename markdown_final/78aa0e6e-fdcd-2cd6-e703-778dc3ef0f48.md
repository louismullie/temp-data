## Question

A term newborn presents with enlarged echogenic kidneys and multiple cortical cysts on ultrasound. Genetics and nephrology document a diagnosis of congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease with no features of autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for a term newborn diagnosed with congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease, with no features of autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether it maps to a specific ICD-10-CM category. Then, I should verify whether there is a dedicated code for glomerulocystic kidney disease or if I must use a more general cystic kidney code. Next, I will check for any exclusionary notes that would push me toward or away from polycystic kidney disease codes. Finally, I will confirm the most specific, appropriate code and ensure it aligns with pediatric congenital anomaly conventions and billing requirements.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. Glomerulocystic kidney disease is a congenital renal disorder characterized by cystic dilation of Bowman's spaces and can present in neonates with enlarged, echogenic kidneys and cortical cysts; importantly, many cases are not due to classic ADPKD or ARPKD, and some are linked to other genes such as HNF1B, which reinforces that this is a distinct entity rather than a subset of PKD, even though overlap exists in the literature [^86b3e345] [^2f264b84].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10-CM landscape. I initially thought there might be a specific code for glomerulocystic kidney disease, but hold on, I should verify that before concluding. After checking, there is no unique ICD-10-CM code labeled for glomerulocystic kidney disease; instead, it falls under the broader congenital cystic kidney disease category, which includes entities like multicystic dysplastic kidney and other specified cystic kidney diseases, excluding ADPKD and ARPKD when those are not present [^notfound].

> I will now examine the most specific available option. The appropriate ICD-10-CM code is Q61.8, Other congenital cystic kidney diseases. This code is designed for cystic kidney diseases that are congenital but do not meet the criteria for autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease, which matches this case precisely [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using PKD codes. I should confirm exclusions. Codes for ADPKD (Q61.2) and ARPKD (Q61.19) are inappropriate here because the genetics and nephrology teams explicitly state there are no features of ADPKD or ARPKD, and using those would misclassify the disease and could create downstream billing and epidemiologic inaccuracies [^notfound].

> Let me consider whether Q61.9 (Cystic kidney disease, unspecified) would suffice. Hmm, wait a minute, Q61.9 is too nonspecific when a more precise code exists; since we can specify "other congenital cystic kidney disease" and exclude PKD, Q61.8 is the correct choice over Q61.9 for billing and documentation clarity [^notfound].

> I should double-check that Q61.8 is valid for neonates and captures congenital anomalies. Yes, Q61 codes are part of the congenital anomalies chapter and are appropriate from birth, aligning with how CAKUT and other congenital renal anomalies are coded in pediatrics, including newborns [^notfound].

> Final answer: Use ICD-10-CM code Q61.8, Other congenital cystic kidney diseases, for congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease in a term newborn without features of ADPKD or ARPKD [^notfound].

---

The most specific ICD-10-CM code for congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease in a newborn is **Q61.8** (Other congenital cystic kidney diseases). This code applies when cystic kidney disease is present but does not meet the criteria for autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease. If Q61.8 is not available or does not adequately capture the diagnosis, use **Q61.9** (Cystic kidney disease, unspecified) as a fallback. These codes are appropriate for billing and documentation in newborns with congenital cystic kidney disease.

## ICD-10-CM coding for congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease

ICD-10-CM provides specific codes for congenital cystic kidney diseases, including glomerulocystic kidney disease. The most appropriate code for congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease is **Q61.8** — Other congenital cystic kidney diseases. This code encompasses cystic kidney diseases that do not fit the specific categories of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which aligns with the clinical scenario described.

---

## Rationale for using Q61.8

The rationale for using Q61.8 is that it is the most specific ICD-10-CM code for congenital cystic kidney diseases that are not classified as ADPKD or ARPKD. Given that the clinical documentation explicitly states there are no features of ADPKD or ARPKD, Q61.8 is the most accurate and appropriate code to use for billing and documentation purposes.

---

## Alternative ICD-10-CM codes

If Q61.8 is not available or does not adequately capture the clinical diagnosis, the alternative code is **Q61.9** — Cystic kidney disease, unspecified. This code is a general fallback for cystic kidney diseases that do not have a more specific classification.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding relies on detailed clinical documentation. For congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease, the following information should be documented:

- **Confirmed diagnosis**: Clearly state the diagnosis of congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease.
- **Exclusion of ADPKD and ARPKD**: Document the absence of features consistent with ADPKD or ARPKD.
- **Clinical findings**: Include relevant clinical findings such as enlarged echogenic kidneys and multiple cortical cysts identified on ultrasound.
- **Genetic evaluation**: Document any genetic testing or evaluation performed, including results and implications for diagnosis.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate ICD-10-CM code for congenital glomerulocystic kidney disease in a newborn, excluding ADPKD and ARPKD, is **Q61.8** (Other congenital cystic kidney diseases). If Q61.8 is not available or does not adequately capture the diagnosis, Q61.9 (Cystic kidney disease, unspecified) may be used as an alternative. Accurate coding supports appropriate billing, documentation, and epidemiological tracking of this rare congenital condition.

Conclusion

Estimating a range of incidence and prevalence helps addressing the challenges posed by the absence of specific diagnostic codes and variability in coding practices. Nevertheless, the imminent implementation of the new specific ICD-10-GM code for diseases such as IgAN could greatly improve the accuracy of epidemiological studies. This improvement could have implications for health policy and clinical practice. It could enable more informed, evidence-based decisions regarding infrastructure, i.e. the allocation of nephrology services and biopsy capacity. Additionally, it could support broader policy planning, such as assessing the need for targeted screening programs. From a clinical perspective, recognizing the potential underdiagnosis of IgAN could raise awareness among healthcare providers, leading to earlier detection, especially in patients with subtle urinary abnormalities. Together, these findings highlight the essential role of epidemiological research in guiding evidence-based healthcare strategies. Future efforts should focus on implementing specific diagnostic codes to mitigate uncertainties and enhance the robustness of data.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Analysis of chronic kidney disease among national hospitalization data with 14 million children [^c9839158]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This study is a descriptive analysis of pediatric CKD patients aged less than 18 years who were hospitalized from June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2017. Data were obtained from the HQMS database. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

The renal diseases of childhood CKD were determined according to Pediatric Nephrology (7th version), Zhufutang's Practical Pediatrics (8th version) and Nephrology (3rd version). Patients with at least one of the following discharge diagnoses as either a primary or secondary diagnosis were identified as having CKD: glomerular diseases, including hereditary glomerular diseases, congenital glomerular diseases, and primary glomerular diseases; tubular diseases and tubular interstitial diseases, including hereditary/congenital tubular diseases, primary tubular disease, and tubular interstitial diseases; systemic diseases, including Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), lupus nephritis (LN), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), renal injury related to autoimmune diseases or connective tissue diseases, and others (renal injury related to metabolic disorders, renal injury related to infectious disorders, renal injury related to drugs, renal vascular thrombosis or embolism, thrombotic microangiopathy, antiphospholipid syndrome, and hypertensive renal damage); congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT; renal hypoplasia, dysplasia, oligonephronia, obstructive uropathies and reflux nephropathy, and cystic kidney diseases); renal injury related to tumors; CRF of unknown cause; and others. The following diseases were excluded: acute kidney injury, symptoms and signs related to the urinary system, syndromic kidney damage, urinary system lithiasis, urinary system infection, and renal diseases without exact codes in the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).

In China, use of the International Classification of Diseases was mandated by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. However, many coding variations were generated during the development of hospital information systems. Therefore, three editions of the ICD-10 coding system were utilized for data capture in this study: the China edition, Beijing edition and Clinical edition. These three editions of ICD-10 codes for every renal disease of CKD were used for data capture.

### Machine learning algorithm for early detection of end-stage renal disease [^5d77f692]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data set

This study analyzed commercial claims of over 20,000,000 patients from one of the largest United States-based health insurance company from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2018. The data were selected from medical claims gathered and acquired from their beneficiary's claims. These data are stored and processed on a regular basis, and it was not gathered specifically for this project. The data were completely de-identified by the insurance company, and all identifying details were removed and were not exposed to the researchers. The medical claims database contains data on medical insurance claims for reimbursement purposes, as well as personal diagnoses according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis and procedure codes, and details of pharmacy purchases.

Study population and definitions

This study analyzed 10,000,000 medical insurance claims from 550,000 patient records using a commercial medical claims database. Inclusion criteria were patients over the age of 18 diagnosed with CKD stages 1–4. As the main underlying etiologies for CKD are diabetes and hypertension, patients whose underlying conditions were acute glomerulopathies, congenital abnormalities, or traumatic kidney injury were excluded, as the course of disease in these conditions is different and may interfere with interpretability of the results. The index date for the case group was defined as the date of the first diagnosis of ESRD by a physician (30 ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for ESRD, see Additional file 1) or a dialysis procedure. For the control group, the index date was the date of the last available entry in the database, either a diagnosis or a pharmacy purchase. The observation window consisted of all data available 6 months before the index date. Patients who had less than 6 months of claims records prior to index date were excluded.

### Risk of chronic kidney disease in individuals on lithium therapy in Iceland: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^8f5ea4f8]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Background

The association between lithium use and chronic kidney disease, and the effect of comorbidities on this association are poorly understood. Our aim was to examine the risk of developing stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease among people receiving lithium therapy.

Methods

This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study of all adults (aged ≥ 18 years) in Iceland treated with lithium for a mood disorder who had two or more serum creatinine measurements available in the years 2008–17, irrespective of duration of lithium therapy, identified from the Prescription Medicines Register of the Directorate of Health, or through blood lithium measurements. The control group comprised all eligible outpatients with mood disorders (ICD-10 codes F30-F39) who had not been prescribed lithium and who had attended the national tertiary referral centre in 2014–16. Individuals with chronic kidney disease (identified by ICD codes or an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min per 1·73 m²) before Jan 1, 2008, or those with glomerular disease, genetic or congenital kidney disease, or small kidneys diagnosed before or after 2008 were excluded. Chronic kidney disease stages 3 and higher were defined according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease, and the eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine; all ICD-10 and ICD-9 diagnosis codes, serum creatinine and blood lithium concentrations, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios were obtained from health-care institutions and laboratories. Risk of developing stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2017, was assessed using time-to-event regression analysis, accounting for competing risk of death. People with lived experience were not involved in the design or conduct of this study.

Findings

We identified 4310 individuals (2695 who had received lithium and 1615 control participants), of whom 3198 were included in the study. 2025 (75·1%) individuals in the lithium group (1165 [57·5%] female and 860 [42·5%] male) and 1173 (72·6%) in the control group (737 [62·8%] female and 436 [37·2%] male) were included in the study at end of follow-up. The mean age of the study sample at the end of follow-up was 46·6 years (SD 16·4; range 18·5–98·9). Ethnicity data were not available. In the lithium group, 211 (10·4%) of 2025 individuals developed stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease, compared with 35 (3·0%) of 1173 individuals in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·90, 95% CI 1·32–2·75 after adjusting for sex, age, and comorbid conditions). Compared with control participants, the risk of stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease was significantly increased for subgroups with a mean blood lithium concentration of 0·60–0·79 mmol/L (HR 2·93, 95% CI 1·97–4·36) or 0·80–0·99 mmol/L (4·31, 2·66–6·99), but not for the subgroup with a mean blood lithium concentration of 0·30–0·59 mmol/L (1·22, 0·78–1·90). Analyses also showed that age, initial eGFR, diabetes, and history of acute kidney injury were significant risk factors for developing stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease.

Interpretation

Individuals with mood disorders receiving lithium treatment had an increased risk of developing stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease in a blood concentration-dependent manner. We also found that other factors, including age, initial eGFR, and comorbidities were associated with increased risk of for developing stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease. Overall, our findings suggest that in addition to considering other risk factors (eg, age or clinical comorbidities), careful monitoring of blood lithium concentrations and use of the lowest effective lithium dose for adequate mood stabilisation is recommended for helping to mitigate the risk of chronic kidney disease.

### Antenatally diagnosed kidney anomalies [^b112c5b4]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract encompass a broad spectrum of developmental conditions that together account for the majority of childhood chronic kidney diseases. Kidney abnormalities are the most commonly diagnosed congenital anomaly in children, and detection of this anomaly is increasing as a result of improved antenatal care and widespread access to more sensitive screening ultrasonography. Most paediatricians will encounter children with congenital kidney anomalies across a wide spectrum of disorders, and a broad understanding of the classification, investigation, and basis of management is important to appropriately direct their care.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Renal replacement therapy for rare diseases affecting the kidney: an analysis of the ERA-EDTA registry [^028d1395]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, increased efforts have been undertaken to address the needs of patients with rare diseases by international initiatives and consortia devoted to rare disease research and management. However, information on the overall prevalence of rare diseases within the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is limited. The aims of this study were (i) to identify those rare diseases within the ERA-EDTA Registry for which renal replacement therapy (RRT) is being provided and (ii) to determine the prevalence and incidence of RRT for ESRD due to rare diseases, both overall and separately for children and adults.

Methods

The Orphanet classification of rare disease was searched for rare diseases potentially causing ESRD, and these diagnosis codes were mapped to the corresponding ERA-EDTA primary renal disease codes. Thirty-one diagnoses were defined as rare diseases causing ESRD.

Results

From 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011, 7194 patients started RRT for a rare disease (10.6% children). While some diseases were exclusively found in adults (e.g. Fabry disease), primary oxalosis, cystinosis, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and medullary cystic kidney disease affected young patients in up to 46%. On 31 December 2011, 20 595 patients (12.4% of the total RRT population) were on RRT for ESRD caused by a rare disease. The point prevalence was 32.5 per million age-related population in children and 152.0 in adults. Only 5.8% of these patients were younger than 20 years; however, 57.7% of all children on RRT had a rare disease, compared with only 11.9% in adults. CAKUT and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were the most prevalent rare disease entities among patients on RRT.

Conclusions

More than half of all children and one of nine adults on RRT in the ERA-EDTA Registry suffer from kidney failure due to a rare disease, potentially with a large number of additional undiagnosed or miscoded cases. Comprehensive diagnostic assessment and the application of accurate disease classification systems are essential for improving the identification and management of patients with rare kidney diseases.

### Risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in young adults with end-stage renal disease: an analysis of the US renal data system [^ff527917]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Young adult (ages 22–29 years) have risks for ESRD-associated CVD that may vary from other ages.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that young adult-onset ESRD is associated with higher cardiovascular (CV) hospitalizations and mortality with different characteristics than childhood-onset disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study used the US Renal Data System to categorize patients who initiated ESRD care between 2003 and 2013 by age at ESRD onset (1–11, 12–21, and 22–29 years). Cardiovascular hospitalizations were identified via International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision discharge codes and CV mortality from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid ESRD Death Notification Form. Patients were censored at death from non-CVD events, loss to follow-up, recovery, or survival to December 31, 2014. Adjusted proportional hazard models (95% CI) were fit to determine risk of CV hospitalization and mortality by age group. Data analysis occurred from May 2016 and December 2017.

Exposures

Onset of ESRD.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization.

Results

A total of 33 156 patients aged 1 to 29 years were included in the study population. Young adults (aged 22–29 years) had a 1-year CV hospitalization rate of 138 (95% CI, 121–159) per 1000 patient-years. Young adults had a higher risk for CV hospitalization than children (aged 1–11 years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.41 [95% CI, 0.26–0.64]) and adolescents (aged 12–21 years; HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77–0.97]). Of 4038 deaths in young adults, 1577 (39.1%) were owing to CVD. Five-year cumulative incidence of mortality in this group (7.3%) was higher than in younger patients (adolescents, 4.0%; children, 1.7%). Adjusted HRs for CV mortality were higher for young adults with all causes of ESRD than children (cystic, hereditary, and congenital conditions: HR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.11–0.46]; P < .001; glomerulonephritis: HR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.10–0.44]; P < .001; other conditions: HR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.23–0.49]; P < .001). Adolescents had a lower risk for CV mortality than young adults for all causes of ESRD except glomerulonephritis (cystic, hereditary, and congenital conditions: HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.27–0.74]; glomerulonephritis: HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.76–1.11]; other: HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.40–0.57]). Higher risks for CV hospitalization and mortality were associated with lack of preemptive transplant compared with hemodialysis (hospital: HR, 14.24 [95% CI, 5.92–34.28]; mortality: HR, 13.64 [95% CI, 8.79–21.14]) and peritoneal dialysis [hospital: HR, 8.47 [95% CI, 3.50–20.53]; mortality: HR, 7.86 [95% CI, 4.96–12.45]). Nephrology care before ESRD was associated with lower risk for CV mortality (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.70–0.85]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Cardiovascular disease accounted for nearly 40% of deaths in young adults with incident ESRD in this cohort. Identified risk factors may inform development of age-appropriate ESRD strategies to improve the CV health of this population.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Uncovering the heritable components of multimorbidities and disease trajectories using a nationwide cohort [^ad17814e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Heritability and genetic correlation across the full spectrum of diseases

We estimated the additive genetic heritability (h²) across 866 level three ICD-10 codes fulfilling the selection criteria, adjusted for non-linear genetic effects and close environment. Across the disease areas, congenital malformations, endocrine diseases, and mental disorders had the highest heritability (Fig. 2). The ICD-10 codes with the highest heritability were diseases with known large genetic components, often with well-described specific genes known where genetic variants are known to impact diseases, such as cystic kidney disease (Q61, h² = 0.85, 0.78; 0.89 95% CI), osteochondrodysplasias (Q78, h² = 0.77, 0.66; 0.83 95% CI), and congenital malformation syndromes (Q87, h² = 0.75, 0.62; 0.82 95% CI). Looking beyond these known genetic diseases, almost 50% (N = 424 codes) of the level three ICD-10 codes displayed a heritability with a magnitude of h² > 0.1. We observed a negative correlation between the heritability and mean age of onset (⍴ = −0.24, p = 2.97e−13), as well as a small correlation to the prevalence (⍴ = −0.07, p = 0.054). Resolving the heritability at the less specific 2nd level (N = 183 codes) and more specific 4th level (N = 1519 codes) of ICD-10 supported the same pattern of heritability (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) with 63% (N = 971) Level 4 codes having h² > 0.1, indicating the importance of acquiring accurate family history for diagnoses, even outside of well-established genetic conditions. Heritability estimates across the full ICD-10 ontology are available at.

We next evaluated the association of CAKUT with death or severe illness prior to NICU discharge by multiple logistic regression. To limit ascertainment bias, infants transferred after birth (often because of complex illness) and infants transferred prior to discharge (in which their clinical outcome is unknown) were excluded. We included the following as covariates in the analysis: discharge year epoch (2000 to 2004, 2005 to 2009, 2010 to 2014, 2015 to 2020), exposure to antenatal steroids, phenotypic sex at birth (female sex was treated as reference given the associated risk of illness in male infants), race (White race was treated as reference given the proportional size), gestational age, birthweight (as a z score normalized within this cohort by gestational age), use of mechanical ventilation in the first 72 hours of life, presence of a known genetic disorder, and the presence of extrarenal anomalies.

For this analysis, we defined a combined clinical outcome of death or severe illness. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined by a diagnosis of oliguria or anuria (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 788.5 or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code R34); end stage kidney disease defined as administration of dialysis; severe intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) defined as stage III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia; medically or surgically treated necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC); severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) defined as invasive mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age; severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) defined as need for any medical or surgical intervention; culture-positive sepsis defined by any positive blood or urine culture; or shock defined as administration of any vasopressor or inotropic agent.

### New primary renal diagnosis codes for the ERA-EDTA [^831def15]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Finally, many rare diagnoses were omitted from the old PRD list but are now included, e.g.

When a definitive test has not been used, there will always be uncertainty, but the new PRD codes allow both a clinical diagnosis to be recorded faithfully. At the same time, by noting the absence of a definitive test, we can also convey the degree of uncertainty. Where appropriate, patient records can be grouped according to the degree of accuracy and certainty required for a particular analysis and research teams can decide whether to examine a small number of patients with accurate diagnoses or larger numbers with phenotypic similarities. Cohorts can be combined if required and nothing is lost by using the more granular coding scheme apart from the slight additional effort of choosing the best diagnostic term from a larger list. With computer aids, the extra effort is trivial although we must recognize that we now have more diagnostic options than we can commit to memory.

No current coding system in widespread use has full definitions. While desirable, this would be a huge task and would require extensive international and cross-specialty collaboration. In our PRD list, we have made some progress by providing partial definitions that indicate what type of diagnostic information should be used to support each PRD but with the exception of histological evidence, these are not mandatory and we must still rely on the good judgement of individual nephrologists.

Fortuitously, while the work on the PRDs was proceeding, the renal community in the UK was establishing a subset of existing renal SNOMED CT codes and they agreed to incorporate the new ERA–EDTA PRD codes in their list without modification. That work introduced one of the authors (Y.G.), who is an expert in clinical terminology, to the PRD codes. He was co-opted onto the PRD working group and undertook the detailed mapping of the new PRDs to SNOMED CT and ICD-10. Not only did that ensure that the terms favoured by the nephrologists were acceptable to professional terminologists, but it also allowed the new PRDs to be aligned to SNOMED CT with all the subtle semantic links that make it such a powerful tool.

### Dilemma of missing specific disease codes: an approach to assess the incidence and prevalence of a rare nephrology disease [^fc2b270f]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

While the overall incidence and prevalence estimates fluctuated only slightly from 2017–2022 in our analysis, the recorded ICD-10-GM codes for primary IgAN patients varied over the years, especially for the incidence. This indicates that even though certain codes may appear irrelevant in some years, they may be important in other years because excluding them could reduce the number of identified patients.

Although the demographic profile of patients identified using the LB algorithm aligns with existing literature, the prevalence estimates are lower than anticipated. In contrast, the prevalence estimates from the UB algorithm are more consistent with those reported in the literature, despite the demographic profile of these patients not matching the existing literature. These discrepancies may stem from variations in ethnic, geographic, and operational factors across different study populations and methodologies. Neither approach from each algorithm provides a completely accurate picture, therefore the true epidemiology of primary IgAN in Germany is likely to lie somewhere between the estimates of the two algorithms.

Even the use of the inclusive coding algorithm, which resulted in a mean prevalence of 38.3 cases per 100,000 individuals, emphasizes the orphan status of IgAN. This prevalence is well below the threshold of 50 individuals per 100,000, which reflects the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) definition of an orphan condition.

Regarding comparability of the ICD-10-GM codes we used in our study (three ICD-10-GM codes for LB and eight ICD-10-GM codes for UB) we identified two other studies that also used ICD-10 codes to identify patients with IgAN. One study from the United States used the ICD-10 code N02.8, supplemented by N04.1, to identify cases of IgAN. This coding approach was based on a survey in which 78% of 409 U.S.-based healthcare professionals reported using these codes for IgAN.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Mortality risk in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^85406776]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient cohorts and follow-up

Criteria for inclusion in the ADPKD non-ESRD CKD study cohort and the ADPKD ESRD study cohort are presented in Table 1. For the non-ESRD CKD study cohort, the follow-up (i.e. patient-time at risk) started at the later date of the start of the study period (1 January 2014) or the date of the first ADPKD diagnosis code. It ended on the earliest date of the following: death, end of follow-up or end of study period (31 December 2016), or first use of ESRD services. For patients in the ESRD study cohort, the follow-up started at the later date of start of the study period (1 January 2014) or first use of ESRD services. It ended on the earlier date of the following: end of study period (31 December 2016) or death.

Table 1
Eligibility criteria

The CKD stages and ESRD treatments (i.e. dialysis, transplant) were defined at study entry (i.e. the start of patient-time at risk defined above). The CKD stages were defined based on ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes in claims. Patients who received a transplant on or before the study entry date were included in the transplant group. Patients who received dialysis on or before the study entry date were included in the dialysis group. Patients who received both transplant and dialysis on or before the study entry date were included in the transplant group.

### Dilemma of missing specific disease codes: an approach to assess the incidence and prevalence of a rare nephrology disease [^046cad0b]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the current lack of a specific diagnostic code for IgAN and the inconsistency in clinicians' coding practices for patients with primary IgAN, developing an optimal strategy for identifying these patients in claims data is challenging. Therefore, two algorithms were developed for this purpose, one of which sets a lower bound (LB) and the other an upper bound (UB) for the definition of primary IgAN. The LB considered specific diagnosis codes which rely on biopsies. The UB included a broader field of specific and unspecific codes that are used by physicians to code IgAN.

### The classification of renal cystic diseases and other congenital malformations of the kidney and urinary tract [^5d234cf6]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Renal cystic diseases and congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract comprise a heterogeneous group of lesions whose pathogenesis has eluded physicians for centuries. Recent advances in molecular and genetic understanding of these diseases may provide the solution to this riddle.

Objective

The formulation of an effective classification system for these disorders has been elusive but is needed to introduce order while providing a conceptual framework for diagnosis.

Data Sources

This review discusses the evolution, beginning in the 19th century, of postulates regarding the pathogenesis of cystic and developmental renal diseases. Selected classification systems proffered during this period are discussed in pursuit of an ideal classification schema that would account for morphologic features and their clinical importance, with logical links to pathogenesis and treatment. Although this remains an elusive target, its general outline is becoming clearer. A classification approach favored by the author is presented, which incorporates many of the strengths contained in several previous classifications.

Conclusions

Genetic-and molecular-based postulates regarding the pathogenesis of the renal cystic and developmental diseases have implicated mutated master genes and the modification of genes that are crucial in renal development and genes that are central to the sensory effects of the renal tubular primary cilium on cell physiology. These scientific advances provide pathogenetic links between morphologically and genetically distinct entities and certain cystic and neoplastic entities, associations that seemed implausible not long ago. These advances may eventually provide the basis for future classification systems while suggesting targets for therapeutic approaches in the prevention and treatment of these diseases.

### Trends in surgical management of multicystic dysplastic kidney at USA children's hospitals [^bc6de0c5]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Objective

Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a congenital renal cystic disease often incidentally diagnosed in children. Historically, children with MCDK underwent early nephrectomy because of concerns for the development of hypertension or malignancy. Over the last decade, management recommendations have not supported routine early surgical removal of MCDK. The study authors sought to determine the current trends in the use of nephrectomy for MCDK in US children's hospitals because national practice patterns have not been investigated.

Methods

A population-based retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) was conducted. The study population was comprised of patients aged 0–18 years with a diagnosis of MCDK (International Classification of Diseases-9th revision, code 753.19) admitted to the inpatient department of the study hospital between January 2006 and September 2015. Patients with additional renal anomalies including polycystic kidney, medullary cystic kidney, and medullary sponge kidney were excluded, as were patients treated in a hospital that did not contribute data to the PHIS continuously throughout the study period. Trends in the annual proportion of nephrectomies performed were analyzed among admissions in the study population, along with patient clinical and demographic information.

Results

A total of 3792 MCDK admissions, in 34 hospitals, were included in the study. Overall, 569 nephrectomies were performed during the study period. The proportion of nephrectomy decreased annually by 9.2% on average, from 22.1% in 2006 to 7.3% in the first 3 quarters of 2015. No significant trends were observed in the annual number of overall MCDK admissions or patient age at procedure among patients who had a nephrectomy. Among nephrectomies, 84.2% were open and 15.8% were minimally invasive procedures (laparoscopic non-robotic, 10% and robotic, 5.8%). The proportion of minimally invasive nephrectomies increased annually by 13.7%, from 8% in 2006 to 29% in 2015.

Discussion

Trends in the use of nephrectomy for MCDK at a national level have not been previously reported. This study is limited by the use of inpatient discharge data, which did not allow estimating the true rate of nephrectomy in patients born with MCDK.

Conclusions

During the study period, there has been a decrease in the use of nephrectomy for MCDK in pediatric hospitals, along with a concurrent increase in utilization of minimally invasive techniques to perform nephrectomies. These results suggest that in general, urologists at freestanding children's hospitals are heeding recommendations for observation and against routine early surgical removal of these kidneys; although trends in the use of nephrectomy varied between hospitals, there is room for continued improvement in following these recommendations.

### Medical records-based chronic kidney disease phenotype for clinical care and "big data" observational and genetic studies [^47774e30]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Algorithm implementation

To enable portable implementation, a parameterized and modularized algorithm query was developed. This query template has two major features. First, complex query logic is built from several simple query block modules, each serving a single function. In the modularized query, the first query block is to retrieve all phenotype-related variables from the source data and store them in a temporary table for later query blocks use. This way, the data retrieval and algorithm logic parts can be separated. This logical separation has been explored by the Arden syntax, which is designed to share task-specific knowledge implementations across institutions. Another feature of our query template is to encapsulate source database schema and coding dictionary into parameters, which can be replaced at the execution. Both features make the query template easily adaptable to different data environments. To ensure compatible implementation across sites, we also use national standard terminologies to define diagnosis, procedure and laboratory tests. We define diagnosis codes using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, procedure codes using CPT-4, ICD-9-PCS, and ICD-10-PCS. For laboratory tests, we identified all relevant LOINC codes. Since different institutions may use local coding for laboratory tests, institution-specific coding review is required before implementation at each site. The algorithm and all associated data dictionaries have been deposited in the public Phenotype Knowledge Base.

### The prevalence and clinical significance of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract in preterm infants [^29b22634]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Limitations of this study included detection bias for urinary tract anomalies in high-risk pregnancies or in infants with critical illness. Furthermore, electronic health records lacked detail regarding timing of diagnoses or description of anomalies.

Despite these limitations, our study is to our knowledge the largest-to-date of CAKUT in preterm infants. We analyzed over 400 000 infants, representing 20% of infants born in the US during the study period. CAKUT was prevalent in preterm infants and associated with severe illness and death. The association may indicate the direct deleterious consequences of kidney and urinary malformations but may also reflect an underlying burden of genetic or developmental disorders, or environmental exposures that predispose to illness and death.

### The spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes based on kidney disease diagnoses: a 20-year population study [^b51165a4]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Kidney disorders in pregnancy may be under-recognized and have variable impact on outcomes depending on diagnosis. Population-level data are limited, particularly for Australia, and comparison of impact of different kidney disorders on pregnancy has rarely been assessed. This study examined the prevalence and outcomes of varied kidney disorders using population-level perinatal data from a large cohort.

Methods

Women with singleton pregnancies > 20 weeks' gestation from the South Australian Pregnancy Outcomes Unit (1990–2012). Women with a kidney disorders diagnostic code were grouped into categories (immunological, cystic/genetic, urological, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), pyelonephritis and "other"). Key pregnancy outcomes were assessed, with adjustment for demographic variables.

Results

Kidney disorders were reported in 1,392 (0.3%) of 407,580 births. These pregnancies had increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.82–2.56), induction of labor (RRR vs. spontaneous birth 2.10, 95% CI 1.87–2.36), all Caesarean section (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17–1.47) as well as Caesarean section without labor (RRR 1.82, 95% CI 1.57–2.10), preterm birth (< 37 weeks; 2.76, 95% CI 2.40–3.18), low birth weight (< 2,500 g) infants (OR 2.43, 95% CI 2.07–2.84), and neonatal intensive care admission (OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.12–3.29). Diagnostic subgroups demonstrated differing patterns of adverse outcomes, enabling the development of a matrix of risk. Women with immunological renal conditions and VUR had greatest risk overall, and only women with immunological diseases had increased risk of small-for-gestational age < 10th centile (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.26–4.42). Women with nonchronic urological conditions and pyelonephritis had increased risk of preterm birth, but not other adverse events. VUR conferred particularly increased risk of Caesarean section and induced labor.

Conclusions

In a cohort of > 1,300 women with varied kidney disorders, increased adverse obstetric and perinatal events were observed, and the nature and magnitude of risk differed according to diagnosis. In particular, vesicoureteric reflux is not a benign condition in pregnancy. Women with nonchronic conditions still had increased risk of preterm birth. We confirm that women with kidney disorders warrant vigilant and tailored prepregnancy care and clinical care in pregnancy.

### Acute kidney injury associated with increased costs in the neonatal intensive care unit: analysis of pediatric health information system database [^edc001f6]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection

For each subject, de-identified encrypted data including baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, CHA PHIS center, all International Classification of Disease, Ninth and Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9/ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes, and all ICD-9 and ICD-10 procedure codes from the NICU encounter as well as LOH and survival were collected.

Cost-to-charge ratio (CCR)-based adjusted total costs, expressed in United States dollars, were also collected for each subject. Within the PHIS database, estimated costs for each patient encounter is determined by multiplying the abstract-based charges by a CCR for that encounter. The CCR is based on the center and discharge year and determined by the official cost reports submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services annually. If the cost report is unavailable, each center is asked to provide the CCR using a provided formula.

To quantify degree of illness and comorbid burden among our study subjects, we used the CCC system, version 2.0. Feudtner and colleagues define CCC's as the following: "any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Each subject's ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes are used to determine if a single or multiple Feudtner CCC's were present and, if present, to categorize them into one of the following potential CCC categories: cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, malignancy, and premature or neonatal complex chronic conditions (Supplementary Table 1). RRT receipt was determined by presence or absence of ICD-10 procedure codes for RRT (5A1D70Z, 5A1D80Z, 5A1D90z).

### Glomerulocystic kidney: one hundred-year perspective [^86b3e345]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Glomerular cysts, defined as Bowman space dilatation greater than 2 to 3 times normal size, are found in disorders of diverse etiology and with a spectrum of clinical manifestations. The term glomerulocystic kidney (GCK) refers to a kidney with greater than 5% cystic glomeruli. Although usually a disease of the young, GCK also occurs in adults.

Objective

To assess the recent molecular genetics of GCK, review our files, revisit the literature, and perform in silico experiments.

Data Sources

We retrieved 20 cases from our files and identified more than 230 cases published in the literature under several designations.

Conclusions

Although GCK is at least in part a variant of autosomal dominant or recessive polycystic kidney disease (PKD), linkage analysis has excluded PKD-associated gene mutations in many cases of GCK. A subtype of familial GCK, presenting with cystic kidneys, hyperuricemia, and isosthenuria is due to uromodullin mutations. In addition, the familial hypoplastic variant of GCK that is associated with diabetes is caused by mutations in TCF2, the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta. The term GCK disease (GCKD) should be reserved for the latter molecularly recognized/inherited subtypes of GCK (not to include PKD). Review of our cases, the literature, and our in silico analysis of the overlapping genetic entities integrates established molecular-genetic functions into a proposed model of glomerulocystogenesis; a classification scheme emerged that (1) emphasizes the clinical significance of glomerular cysts, (2) provides a pertinent differential diagnosis, and (3) suggests screening for probable mutations.

### Association of ibuprofen prescription with acute kidney injury among hospitalized children in China [^22c44929]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Hospital-Acquired AKI Identification, Drug Exposure, and Comorbidities and Clinical Procedures

A baseline SCr level was calculated for each patient as the mean of all available SCr values between the 30 days before admission and the first SCr testing within the first 3 days of hospitalization. Acute kidney injury was defined as an increase in SCr level of 26.5 μmol/L or higher within 48 hours or by 50% or more over the baseline value according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Urine output criteria were not used because urine volume was not available in this study. To minimize the misclassification of non-AKI, we required a maximal gap of 14 days between any 2 consecutive SCr tests. The earliest day that the SCr level change met the KDIGO criteria was established as the date of AKI onset. For patients without detected AKI, their AKI status was considered censored after the last SCr test that met the testing gap requirement. The stage of AKI was identified using the peak SCr level after AKI detection, with an increase of less than 100% being defined as stage 1, 100% or greater as stage 2, and 200% or more over baseline as stage 3.

All drugs prescribed during hospitalization were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Exposure to ibuprofen was coded as a time-dependent dichotomous variable. The cumulative dose of the drug within the exposure period was calculated and standardized by the body weight of the child. Concomitant use of other drugs with nephrotoxic effects (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement) was defined similarly.

The presence of comorbidities was defined by dichotomous covariates according to ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes at admission and discharge (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). The comorbidities analyzed included fever, trauma, tumors, sepsis, epilepsy, heart failure, liver disease, lung infection, respiratory infection, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diarrhea, congenital heart disease, anemia, brain injury, and intracranial infection. The clinical procedures were classified into gastrointestinal, cardiothoracic, neurosurgical, orthopedic, respiratory, urinary, and other operations according to ICD-10-CM codes.

### Gestational exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of chronic kidney disease in childhood [^60567be3]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Offspring Outcomes

The outcome of interest was CKD incidence in children, defined by the date of the first inpatient or outpatient visits with a CKD diagnosis (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1) and used the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9); International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10); International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM); or International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for CKD (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). According to the definition of CKD by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, pediatric patients needed to have at least 1 ICD-9 or ICD-10 code for CKD as inpatients or at least 2 ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes for CKD within 1 year and at least 3 months apart as outpatients. The types of CKD were grouped as CAKUT and non-CAKUT. The condition was classified as primarily caused by CAKUT if the patients had ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes for both CAKUT and non-CAKUT, and the CKD event date was determined based on the CAKUT onset date. The follow-up time started from the date of birth until the event of CKD occurred or was censored owing to premature mortality, loss to follow-up, or the latest date in the database (December 31, 2021), whichever came first (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).

Covariate Assessment

Maternal characteristics, based on the most recent measurements before pregnancy, included a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and the use of medications (based on prescription records) known to impact maternal health and study outcomes. These data were obtained from outpatient and inpatient settings before and during pregnancy (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Offspring characteristics included sex, gestational age at birth, birth weight, and Apgar score at the first and fifth minutes (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

### Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract [^31a09440]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract encompass the spectrum of disorders that include the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. These abnormalities often lead to altered renal size and location, dysplastic changes in the kidney parenchyma, and anomalies in the collecting system. Though the etiology of each of these conditions can be variable, it is known that the collection of these defects represent 40% to 50% of all pediatric end-stage renal disease worldwide. The multifaceted management of these conditions is aimed at preserving kidney function and ultimately delaying the need for transplantation. With the advancement of prenatal ultrasonographic techniques, these conditions are more likely to be diagnosed before birth, which often leads to rapid postnatal intervention and better outcomes.

### The global, regional, and national patterns of change in the burden of chronic kidney disease from 1990 to 2021 [^6cc75035]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source

This study employed data from the GBD 2021 study, obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, to present the most recent epidemiological insights on 371 diseases and injuries across 21 GBD regions and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. This study adheres to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) statement.

Statistical analysis

Our primary study goal was to delineate the prevalence, incidence, and disease burden of CKD at the global, regional, and national level in 2021, as well as the trends from 1990 to 2021. We selected (code B.8.2 "chronic kidney disease") as the cause, and prevalence, incidence, and DALYs as measures.

CKD cases were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, the 9th revision (ICD-9) codes, including 403–404.9, 581–583.9, 585–585.9, 589–589.9, 753–753.3. And the 10th revision (ICD-10) codes encompassed D63.1, E10-E11.9, I12-I13.9, N00-N08.8, N15.0, N18-N18.9, P70.2, Q61-Q62.8.

### Dilemma of missing specific disease codes: an approach to assess the incidence and prevalence of a rare nephrology disease [^eacaac38]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Diagnosis codes used for the two identification algorithms LB and UB. Abbreviations: UB, upper bound; LB, lower bound; ICD-10-GM codes, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, German Modification

Individuals with at least one documentation of one of the relevant ICD-10-GM codes in the inpatient sector (primary or secondary discharge diagnosis) and/or at least two documentations in two different quarters or by different physicians in the same quarter (M2Q criterion) in the outpatient sector (verified diagnosis, Zusatzkennzeichen Diagnosensicherheit "G") in the timeframe from January 1 st, 2022 to December 31 st, 2022 were flagged as potential IgAN patients.

To ensure identified patients were actual primary IgAN patients, patients with ICD-10-GM codes indicating diseases other than IgAN or comorbidities/diseases leading to secondary IgAN in the timeframe from January 1 st, 2022 to December 31 st, 2022 were excluded (see Additional file (Supplementary Table 1 & 2)).

To identify incident primary IgAN patients in 2022, two additional inclusion criteria were applied. First, patients were excluded if they had a documented ICD-10-GM code for IgAN between January 1 st, 2020, and December 31 st, 2021. Second, patients were required to have undergone a renal biopsy within a period spanning up to four quarters prior to and up to three quarters following the initial diagnosis of IgAN. The latter criterion could not be applied to prevalent patients due to the limitations of the available database, which covers a period of six years, with an additional two years for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consequently, it was not possible to retrospectively determine the date of the initial IgAN diagnosis for all prevalent cases.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^bfe0e48b]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In this study, we report on our updated CCC version 2 (v2) classification system, which we implemented for both the ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding schemes. We evaluated the CCC v2 system in three ways: 1) the comparability between the ICD-9 and ICD-10 systems; 2) the year-to-year stability of classification across CCC v2 attributable to cause of death in 1991–2010; and 3) the proportions of patients classified as having a CCC between CCC v2 and CCC v1 systems.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^9939bc72]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11

ICD-11 will succeed ICD-10 as the current version of the ICD managed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June, 2018. ICD-10 was completed in 1990, making the interval between versions 28 years, the longest interval in the history of the ICD. Work began on ICD-11 in 2007, with the intention to make a more comprehensive and computable version of the ICD than previously available. As an aside, readers should be aware that many countries create an expanded version of the WHO ICD revision, such as the United States (ICD-10-CM), Australia (ICD-10-AM), Canada (ICD-10-CA), and Germany (ICD-10-GM). An aspiration is that ICD-11 many not require any country-specific extensions.

Foundation component

A key architectural component of the ICD is the presence of a semantic network of words and terms, which forms the backbone of all statistical tabulations of the ICD-11 that derives from it. This the Foundation component, which is a large and deep polyhierarchy of medical concepts without any residual terms. The Foundation clearly violates the two conditions of a statistical classification, which remains the core use-case of the ICD; thus, a statistical tabulation must be created to accommodate the requirements of a statistical classification (below). However, the Foundation persists as a rich resource of terms, concepts, multiply parented relationships, and detail that is far in excess of what would be sensible in a statistical classification. As a practical matter, the Foundation semantic network has superseded the historical ICD index and become a basis for semi-automatic and algorithmic coding of terms into ICD rubrics.

Another novel feature of Foundation terms is that each has a small information model of globally unique identifiers (URIs), fully specified terms, definitions, synonyms, language variants, and many axial properties, such as options for anatomy, severity, extent, or etiology.

Kidney disease is a significant medical and public health problem. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recently asked the community to identify research objectives, which, if addressed, could improve understanding of basic kidney function and aid in prevention, treatment, and reversal of kidney disease. The Kidney Research National Dialogue invited interested parties to submit, discuss, and prioritize ideas using an interactive website; 1600 participants posted more than 300 ideas covering all areas of kidney disease, including the cystic kidney diseases. Although much is known about the genetics and pathogenesis of cystic diseases, there remain challenges to our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of cyst formation, what genes act as modifiers to cause variable responses in different people, and how to detect and monitor disease progression. This article summarizes key research questions for cystic kidney diseases.

### The prevalence and clinical significance of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract in preterm infants [^9681c0bb]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence and importance of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in preterm infants?

Findings

In this cohort study of 409 704 infants born at 23 to 33 weeks' gestation from 2000 to 2020, 2.0% had CAKUT. CAKUT was associated with prematurity, genetic disorders, and extrarenal anomalies, and was significantly associated with risk of mortality or in-hospital morbidity, even for less severe forms such as isolated hydronephrosis.

Meaning

These results suggest that preterm infants with any form of CAKUT, including isolated urinary tract dilation, are at greater risk of death and severe illness, and may benefit from genetic evaluation.

### Intrauterine growth restriction and risk of diverse forms of kidney disease during the first 50 years of life [^ef9fce8b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Previous studies have shown that individuals with low birth weight (LBW) or small for gestational age (SGA) have higher risk of kidney failure. This study investigates birth-related exposures and risk of CKD and other kidney diagnoses.

Design, Setting, Participant, & Measurements

The Medical Birth Registry of Norway has registered extensive medical data on all births in Norway since 1967. The Norwegian Patient Registry has registered diagnostic codes for all admissions and outpatient visits to Norwegian hospitals since 2008. Data from these registries were linked, and risk of CKD and other groups of kidney disease were analyzed using logistic regression statistics. LBW (below the tenth percentile), SGA (birth weight below the tenth percentile for gestational age), and preterm birth (< 37 weeks) were analyzed as exposures.

Results

A total of 2,663,010 individuals were included. After a mean follow-up of 26 years (maximum 50 years), 4495 had been diagnosed with CKD and 12,818 had been diagnosed with other groups of kidney disease. LBW was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for CKD of 1.72 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.60 to 1.90), SGA with an OR of 1.79 (95% CI, 1.65 to 1.94), and preterm birth with an OR of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.33 to 1.66). Analyses using diagnosis of CKD at stages 3–5 as end point showed similar results. Results were similar for men and women. We analyzed adjusted ORs for other groups of kidney disease and found that LBW was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.33 to 1.56) for acute kidney disease, 1.24 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.36) for GN, 1.35 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.56) for cystic kidney disease, and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.25) for kidney disease resulting from kidney or urinary tract malformations.

Conclusions

LBW, SGA, and preterm birth are associated with higher risk of CKD in the first 50 years of life. Risk of other groups of kidney disease was less pronounced.

### Analysis of chronic kidney disease among national hospitalization data with 14 million children [^47cd7516]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The main purpose was to determine basic epidemiological data on CKD among hospitalized pediatric patients in China.

Methods

Data from pediatric inpatients with CKD hospitalized from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2017 were extracted from the electronic records of HQMS database, which includes over 14 million inpatients. Codes from the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) were used to search the database.

Results

A total of 524 primary diseases of CKD were included in this study. In all, there were 278 231 pediatric inpatients with CKD, which accounted for 1.95% of the 14 250 594 pediatric inpatients registered in the HQMS database. The number of pediatric inpatients with CKD was 67 498 in 2013, 76 810 in 2014, 81 665 in 2015 and 82 649 in 2016, which accounted for 1.93%, 1.93%, 1.99 and 2.09%, respectively, of the total population of pediatric inpatients. The etiology of CKD was secondary nephrosis in 37.95% of cases, which ranked first and followed by CAKUT with a percentage of 24.61%. Glomerular diseases and cystic kidney disease accounted for 21.18 and 5.07%, respectively. Among all 278 231 patients, 6 581 (2.37%) had a primary discharge diagnosis of CKD. The renal pathology findings of CKD showed that IgA accounted for 51.17%.

Conclusions

This study provides a descriptive analysis of the hospitalized population of pediatric CKD patients. Our study provides important, fundamental data for policy making and legislation, registry implementation and the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of CKD in China.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Definition, diagnosis and clinical management of non-obstructive kidney dysplasia: a consensus statement by the ERKNet working group on kidney malformations [^3d8cde94]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Kidney dysplasia is one of the most frequent causes of chronic kidney failure in children. While dysplasia is a histological diagnosis, the term 'kidney dysplasia' is frequently used in daily clinical life without histopathological confirmation. Clinical parameters of kidney dysplasia have not been clearly defined, leading to imprecise communication amongst healthcare professionals and patients. This lack of consensus hampers precise disease understanding and the development of specific therapies. Based on a structured literature search, we here suggest a common basis for clinical, imaging, genetic, pathological and basic science aspects of non-obstructive kidney dysplasia associated with functional kidney impairment. We propose to accept hallmark sonographic findings as surrogate parameters defining a clinical diagnosis of dysplastic kidneys. We suggest differentiated clinical follow-up plans for children with kidney dysplasia and summarize established monogenic causes for non-obstructive kidney dysplasia. Finally, we point out and discuss research gaps in the field.

### Medical records-based chronic kidney disease phenotype for clinical care and "big data" observational and genetic studies [^089e32bb]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of our approach should be noted. First, the successful detection and staging of CKD using our approach is dependent on the availability of relevant blood and urine tests in medical records. Because serum Cr is usually determined as part of routine health screening tests, most patients have serum Cr available for G-staging. However, urine tests are performed less frequently, and the A-staging could therefore be incomplete due to missing data. Second, our algorithm performs G-staging using the CKD-EPI formula for GFR estimation in adults. The CKD-EPI formula utilizes age, sex, and race in addition to serum Cr to determine eGFR. The race information is problematic, since it is based on self-report and this information is frequently inaccurate in medical records. Additionally, Cr-based GFR estimation in individuals of diverse or admixed ancestries may be inaccurate, since CKD-EPI was derived on a cohort composed of only White and Black Americans. Although CKD-EPI equation presently provides the most accurate means for GFR estimation, it could be easily replaced by any future equations that replace the race variable without other major changes to the algorithm. Similarly, estimation of GFR in pediatric patients may be less accurate compared to adults, but the formula used by the algorithm could be updated once more accurate equations become available. Third, our algorithm is currently designed for detection and staging of all cause CKD along the two axes of A-by-G grid. Adding the third axis of CKD subtype (i.e. primary disease subtype) could substantially enhance our phenotyping. However, automated determination of primary kidney diagnoses using medical records proves to be challenging for a number of reasons, including large etiologic heterogeneity, long time period of CKD progression that may not be well covered by EHRs, inadequate classification of kidney disease subtypes by older billing codes (e.g. ICD-9-CM), and the fact that a kidney biopsy (the gold standard for primary kidney disease diagnosis) is underutilized in clinical practice. As a result, the primary cause of kidney disease is often difficult to establish with certainty, even by manual review of medical records.

In summary, we here provided consented statements based on an expert discussion and available evidence from the literature, covering different relevant aspects of kidney dysplasia. These statements may serve as a common ground for clinicians, patients and researchers. Furthermore, we identified research gaps and structural roadblocks in this field that led us to suggest a novel joint network for future studies on one of the most common causes of CKF in children and young adults.

### State-of-the-art renal imaging in children [^facb92ba]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Imaging modalities for diagnosing kidney and urinary tract disorders in children have developed rapidly over the last decade largely because of advancement of modern technology. General pediatricians and neonatologists are often the front line in detecting renal anomalies. There is a lack of knowledge of the applicability, indications, and nephrotoxic risks of novel renal imaging modalities. Here we describe the clinical impact of congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract and describe pediatric-specific renal imaging techniques by providing a practical guideline for the diagnosis of kidney and urinary tract disorders.

### Pre-eclampsia and risk of later kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^5cf74147]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In our cohort, 85% of women registered as having kidney disease had either a functional diagnosis or an aetiological diagnosis, but not both. (This is probably because establishing an aetiological diagnosis often requires a biopsy, which is not always feasible, resulting in assignment of a functional diagnosis instead. Conversely, when an aetiological diagnosis can be established, a functional diagnosis becomes redundant.) Consequently, our outcome categories included four functional categories (acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, hypertensive kidney disease, and unspecified kidney disease) and five aetiological categories (glomerular and proteinuric disease, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, unspecified tubulointerstitial nephritis, and other kidney disease), as well as a separate group containing kidney disease due to external causes or secondary to known disease (for example, obstructive uropathy, nephropathy due to external toxicity, diabetic kidney disease). (See supplementary methods for the ICD codes used to define each category.) Women with both a functional diagnosis and an aetiological diagnosis were classified on the basis of the first registered diagnosis.

In our analyses, before considering the individual categories, we examined two broad outcome categories: acute renal disorders, which included acute kidney failure and acute tubulointerstitial nephritis; and chronic renal disorders, which encompassed chronic kidney disease, hypertensive kidney disease, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and glomerular and proteinuric diseases.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^3e57c501]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Importantly, the CCC v2 system can be implemented for either the ICD-9 or the ICD-10 coding scheme. With the mandated transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 coding schemes for medical diagnoses and procedures, the CCC v2 system provides a necessary update. We tested the comparability of CCC v2 between ICD-9 and ICD-10, and found no significant discrepancies in CCC categories between the ICD-9 and ICD-10 schemes. We also examined the temporal trends of CCC categories attributable to cause of death during 1991–2010, and did not find any drastic changes at the 1999 time point, when ICD-10 coding was implemented, and no discontinuities in long-term time trends.

We did observe minor declines in the cardiovascular and respiratory CCC categories in the CDC Multiple Cause of Death 1991–2010, which corresponded with a reduction in overall population death rates in heart disease and chronic lower respiratory diseases, which have been attributed in part to reductions in tobacco use, but for pediatric patients, are more likely due to improved cardiac and pulmonary care. The minor increases in the congenital/genetic CCC were most likely related to improved diagnostic capabilities, such as the improved detection of genetic diseases through advancements in newborn screening processes. Nevertheless, none of these trends demonstrated substantial shifts over the 20-year period. This suggests that CCC v2 has close comparability between ICD-9 and ICD-10, and that the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 is unlikely to substantially change CCC v2 proportions, or cause a significant discontinuity in time trends.

### Dilemma of missing specific disease codes: an approach to assess the incidence and prevalence of a rare nephrology disease [^8eae0844]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Estimating disease epidemiology often relies on health insurance claims data due to its ability to provide information on extensive populations across diverse demographics.

Diagnostic, pharmaceutical, and procedure codes are typically used to identify diseases within these datasets. However, challenges arise when specific disease codes are absent and coding practices by clinicians are inconsistent. This study presents an approach to improve disease epidemiology assessments in contexts where specific diagnostic codes are absent and coding practices by clinicians are inconsistent. This case study addresses these challenges using primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) as an example. In Germany, there is currently no specific diagnostic code for primary IgAN, leading clinicians to use various codes to document the disease.

IgAN is a rare kidney disease, yet the most prevalent primary glomerular disease and one of the most common reasons for kidney failure in younger adults. IgAN is characterized by proteinuria, persistent microhematuria or episodes of macrohematuria, edema and arterial hypertension. A distinct diagnosis can only be made via a kidney biopsy. The progression of the disease varies from spontaneous resolution to progressive loss of kidney function leading to kidney failure and the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant usually around the age of 30–50 years. About 20–40% of all patients with IgAN experience kidney failure over the course of 20 years from the time of diagnosis.

According to a literature review conducted in 2011, which incorporated data from prospective and retrospective studies, the incidence of IgAN varies greatly between 0.2 and 2.9 per 100,000 inhabitants depending on region, respective study designs and renal biopsy rates. The average global incidence rate was reported to be approximately 2.5 per 100,000. A recent literature review of national kidney biopsy registry data from 10 European countries presented a pooled incidence of 0.8 per 100,000 and a prevalence of 25.3 per 100,000 for biopsy-confirmed IgAN occurrence. For Germany, only two regional studies are available that reported an annual IgAN incidence of 1.7 per 100,000 between 2003 and 2008 in Northern Germany and 1.9 per 100,000 between 2006 and 2013 in the Western German city of Aachen. However, both studies were conducted in tertiary hospitals with a high reputation in IgAN care, likely leading to an increase in patient referral to those centres from the geographical surrounding network of physicians but also from other regions in Germany. Consequently, the published incidence rates are potentially overestimated.

### Renal function in congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract [^f66e7ade]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract are a major cause of chronic and end-stage renal failure in children. The molecular mechanisms having been elaborated, there is now growing evidence that kidney function is to a large extent determined genetically at an early stage. Assessment of kidney function is an important tool in clinical medicine and is feasible in utero. Postnatally, determination of absolute glomerular filtration rate and also of split and excretory renal function play an important role in the determination of treatment and prognosis. This is supplemented by other biochemical, molecular and interventional prognostic factors, which are of help in preservation of kidney survival by minimizing modulating factors. If chronic or terminal renal failure ensues in childhood or even in early infancy, however, improved medical care has led to encouraging results, ultimately influencing the motivation in the care of children with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract.

Congenital anomalies

We defined major congenital anomalies identified during the first nine months of life according to the EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) classification, guide 1.5. Information on congenital anomalies was based on data from the National Birth Registry (Norway), the Pregnancy Register (Sweden), and national patient registries (all countries). The national patient registries include all inpatient and outpatient contact with specialist healthcare services based on mandatory reporting. Four digit ICD-10 codes (QXX.XX) were not available in Norway and Sweden, and so three digit codes were used (QXX.X). Anomalies were categorised as any major congenital anomaly, congenital heart defects, nervous system anomalies, eye anomalies, ear, face and neck anomalies, respiratory anomalies, oro-facial clefts, gastrointestinal anomalies, abdominal wall defects, congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract, genital anomalies, and limb anomalies. eTable 2 presents the ICD-10 codes used to define the subgroups of anomalies. We do not show results when less than five infants with maternal exposure were reported across the three countries.

Covariates

We obtained information on maternal age (< 25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, and ≥ 40 years), parity (0, 1, ≥ 2), maternal educational level (≤ 9 years, 10–12 years, > 12 years), household income based on the national distributions (in thirds), maternal region of birth (Scandinavia, other European countries, Middle East or Africa, other or unknown), estimated date of start of pregnancy (estimated as date of birth minus gestational age in days; continuous), smoking in pregnancy (yes or no), body mass index before pregnancy or early in pregnancy (World Health Organization categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, unknown), and pre-existing chronic condition before pregnancy (yes or no; included hypertension, chronic kidney disease, asthma, cardiovascular disease, thrombosis, diabetes, and epilepsy). eTable 3 presents information on the ICD-10 codes used to define these chronic conditions. All of these covariates were considered potential confounders for infection with and vaccination against covid-19.

Results

Updated CCC classification system: CCC version 2 (CCC v2)

The CCC v2 classification system consists of ICD-10 codes as well as ICD-9 codes (see Additional file 5). CCC v2 has ten CCC categories: the original 9 (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy) and a new category of conditions (premature and neonatal) arising in the perinatal period that are indicative of likely CCC status. Several additional diagnoses indicative of a CCC were added in CCC v2 to specific CCC categories. Under each CCC category, subcategories are provided for more refined grouping. In addition, CCC v2 also includes a domain of complexity arising from dependence upon medical technology (device), and a domain indicating having received transplantation. The codes indicating these states are included as subcategories under each CCC category, and also as a separate group of "Miscellaneous, Not Elsewhere Classified", which refers to device/technology dependence and transplantation.

Comparability of CCC v2 between ICD-9 and ICD-10

When applied to the CDC Multiple Cause of Death for 1996, the ICD-9 and ICD-10 versions of CCC v2 identified similar numbers of affected patients (Table 1). In some CCC categories (such as neurologic CCC), ICD-10 identified slightly fewer patients, while in some categories (such as premature and neonatal CCC), ICD-10 identified slightly more patients; none of these differences were statistically significant. The comparability ratios ranged between 0.95 and 1.05.

Table 1
Estimated comparability ratios for 10 categories of CCC v2 classified by underlying cause of death ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in the CDC Multiple Cause of Death data for 1996

The comparability ratio for any CCC category (CR_c) is calculated as CR_c = [D_c ICD-10/D_c ICD-9], where D_c ICD-10 is the number of deaths attributable to CCC category classified by ICD-10 and D_c ICD-9 is the number of deaths attributable to CCC category classified by ICD-9.

Discussion

Children with complex chronic conditions present challenges and opportunities in delivering healthcare, which necessitates classification schemes that can distinguish children across a spectrum of pediatric health states. This spectrum of health states comprises several related but distinct dimensions: the degree of functional capacity or impairment across several domains of function; the hazard that a disease or condition poses to function or life; and the ease or difficulty of curing or ameliorating the disease. These dimensions are bundled into the notion of health state and the related concept of a health (or illness) trajectory (a phrase that we are using to connote the likely pattern of change of health over time).

The multidimensional nature of both health states and health trajectories reinforces that no single uniform classification system is likely to serve all the different goals of research or quality improvement projects that study the needs of children with complex chronic conditions. Instead, an ideal system should be flexible and capable of being adapted to address each particular research question. The system should also be transparent regarding how it is constructed, implemented, and subsequently audited, which can be facilitated by providing open source code that can be reviewed and modified by end-users. Finally, the system should be multidimensional, meaning that the system should capture different components of health states and health trajectories.

The original CCC v1 system aimed to identify infants, children, and adolescents diagnosed with complex chronic conditions, with an emphasis on examining patterns of mortality and of end-of-life healthcare utilization associated with CCCs. The system was built around ICD-9 codes, which were grouped into categories of disease to track different anatomical and physiologic pathologies associated with the different health states and trajectories.

The CCC system is flexible in that this classification system can be used to examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories and significant multisystem comorbidities. Patients with > 1 CCC category have a higher risk of increased inpatient readmission rate and ultimately death. Furthermore, pediatric patients with multiple CCC categories are increasingly prevalent in US hospitals. For datasets where individuals can be tracked over multiple encounters, the CCC system also can be used to classify patients based on their cumulative CCC status aggregated over time.

### Perinatal diagnosis, management, and follow-up of cystic renal diseases… [^36c7cba2]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Question How should prenatal and neonatal cystic kidney disease be treated according to the best available evidence. Findings Eight systematic literature reviews revealed an extremely variable etiology and prognosis of perinatal cystic kidney disease, with ultrasound being the most useful diagnostic tool but some evidence for focused genetic diagnostics and/or complementary magnetic resonance imaging. While most prenatal therapeutic interventions lack adequate evidence, postnatal prognosis has improved with neonatal intensive care and renal replacement therapy for neonates, which is now an established therapeutic option. Meaning These clinical practice guidelines delineate current evidence in managing perinatal cystic nephropathies and stress the need for multiprofessional counseling by adequately specialized obstetricians and pediatricians, as well as shared decision making in moderate to severe cases. Importance.

Prenatal and neonatal cystic kidney diseases are a group of rare disorders manifesting as single, multiple unilateral, or bilateral cysts or with increased echogenicity of the renal cortex without macroscopic cysts. They may be accompanied by grossly enlarged kidneys, renal oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, extrarenal abnormalities, and neonatal kidney failure. The prognosis is extremely variable from trivial to very severe or even uniformly fatal, which poses significant challenges to prenatal counseling and management. Objective To provide a clinical practice recommendation for fetal medicine specialists, obstetricians, neonatologists, pediatric nephrologists, pediatricians, and human geneticists by aggregating current evidence and consensus expert opinion on current management of cystic nephropathies before and after birth. Methods.

After 8 systematic literature reviews on clinically relevant questions were prepared, recommendations were formulated and formally graded at a consensus meeting that included experts from all relevant specialties. After further discussion, the final version was voted on by all members using the Delphi method. The recommendations were reviewed and endorsed by the working groups on inherited renal disorders of the European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association and European Society for Paediatric Nephrology; the German Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, German Society of Perinatal Medicine, and German Society of Ultrasound in Medicine; and the alliance of patient organizations, PKD International.

Recommendations The group makes a number of recommendations on prenatal and postnatal imaging by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, genetic testing, prenatal counseling, in utero therapeutic interventions, and postnatal management of prenatal and neonatal cystic kidney diseases, including provision of renal replacement therapy in neonates. In addition to detailed knowledge about possible etiologies and their prognosis, physicians need to be aware of recent improvements and remaining challenges of childhood chronic kidney disease, neonatal renal replacement therapy, and intensive pulmonary care to manage these cases and to empower parents for informed decision making.

### Dilemma of missing specific disease codes: an approach to assess the incidence and prevalence of a rare nephrology disease [^59519853]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Estimating disease epidemiology using health insurance claims data is challenging due to the lack of specific diagnostic codes. This study demonstrates an approach to estimate the epidemiology of primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) using German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) claims data.

Methods

A retrospective observational study was conducted using data from January 1 st, 2015 to December 31 st, 2022. Two coding algorithms - one restrictive and one inclusive - were developed to identify primary IgAN cases based on ICD-10-GM codes. The restrictive algorithm identified cases based on histologically confirmed diagnoses, while the inclusive algorithm included a broader range of related diagnoses. Annual incidence and prevalence rates were calculated and extrapolated to the German population.

Results

The mean prevalence rate from 2017–2022 ranged from 4.5 (restrictive codes) to 38.3 (inclusive codes) cases per 100,000 individuals, demonstrating the orphan nature of primary IgAN. Mean incidence rates ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 cases per 100,000 individuals. In 2022, this corresponded to an estimated 4,043 to 32,229 prevalent cases and 164 to 538 incident cases in Germany.

Conclusion

This study presents an approach for estimating disease epidemiology in the absence of specific diagnostic codes, using primary IgAN as an example. While our dual-algorithm method provides valuable insights into the incidence and prevalence of primary IgAN in Germany, it also highlights the need for consistent coding practices and specific diagnostic codes for accurate epidemiological assessments.

Temporal trends of CCC v2 attributable to cause of death in 1991–2010

From the graphic presentation, we did not observe substantial increases or decreases in the year-to-year stability of CCC v2 classifications across the year 1999 when ICD-10 was implemented, viewed against the overall year-to-year pattern of change of CCC v2 proportions during this 20-year period (Figure 1). Overall, the proportion of death attributed to each CCC v2 category remained fairly stable across the years, with minor decline in cardiovascular CCC and respiratory CCC, and a slight increase in congenital and genetic CCC. The proportion of the overall population with one or more CCC remained stable, and ranged from 24.4% to 26.1% during 1991–2010.

Figure 1
Trends of CCC v2 categories in CDC Multiple Cause of Death data 1991–2010.

Proportions of CCC categories between CCC v2 and CCC v1

In general, CCC v2 classified more patients as having complex chronic conditions than CCC v1 (except for the malignancy and cardiovascular CCC categories) (Table 2). In absolute terms, CCC v2 identified 1.0% more patients as having a CCC in the KID 2009, and a 0.4% in the NEDS 2010, compared to CCC v1. In relative terms, 10% more patients in the KID 2009 and 24% in the NEDS 2010 were identified as having a CCC in CCC v2 than in CCC v1. The largest increase was in the gastrointestinal CCC, with a 226% increase in the KID, and a 333% increase in the NEDS. The second largest increase was the neurologic and neuromuscular CCC, with a 68% increase in both the KID and the NEDS. In contrast, congenital CCC had no change between CCC v1 and v2 in both the KID and the NEDS.

Evaluation of V2 classification scheme

We evaluated the CCC v2 system in three important ways on diverse data sources. First, we evaluated the CCC v2 system in terms of comparability between ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes using the CDC Multiple Cause of Death data for 1996, which is coded using both ICD-9 and ICD-10 schemes (more about the comparability ratio can be referred to:). We estimated the comparability ratio to determine whether any discrepancies between ICD-9 and ICD-10 were of significance (Z-test). The comparability refers to the ratio of the number of a CCC coded from ICD-9 to the number of the equivalent CCC coded from ICD-10. For any CCC category (CR_c), the comparability ratio is calculated as CR_c = [D_c ICD-10/D_c ICD-9], where D_c ICD-10 is the number of deaths attributable to CCC v2 classified by ICD-10 and D_c ICD-9 is the number of deaths attributable to CCC v2 classified by ICD-9. A comparability ratio of 1.00 indicates that the same number of deaths was assigned to the CCC category under both ICD-9 and ICD-10, denoting no net effect of ICD-10 on that particular CCC category. A comparability ratio less than 1.00 results from fewer deaths being classified to that CCC category under ICD-10, and a ratio greater than 1.00 indicates more deaths being classified under ICD-10.

Second, we examined the year-to-year stability of classification across the 1999 implementation of ICD-10 for the CDC Multiple Cause of Death data from 1991–2010. In this data source, coding of mortality causes transitioned from ICD-9 to ICD-10 in 1999. Therefore, we identified the CCC v2 categories with ICD-9 before 1999, and with ICD-10 beginning in 1999. The proportions of the ten CCC v2 categories for each year were estimated, and were then plotted against the year (1991–2010). We examined changes in the time trends of CCC v2 proportions, particularly at the 1999 time point.

Finally, we compared the proportions of CCC v2 categories to those of CCC v1 using the KID 2009 and the NEDS 2010 data. CCC categories were identified using the v1 and v2 systems based on ICD-9 codes, since these datasets do not yet contain ICD-10 codes. We assessed for differences between the resulting estimates and reported the absolute and relative change in percentages between the two systems for each of the datasets.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: a systematic and inclusive approach [^61c92d83]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: 'Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?' This work, which is both evidence and experience based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

Summary

The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms that are based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing, and the rationale for each test.

Key Message

This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in the individual patient presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

Description of datasets and phenotypes

We focus here on the data from the eMERGE Network, containing 102,597 subjects, each with records in terms of ICD-9/ICD-10 codes, which the World Health Organization established to map health conditions to designated codes. In this paper we make use of phecodes, hierarchical groupings of ICD-9/ICD-10 codes, originally developed for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). The current version of phecodes (Version 1.2) has 1,866 phecodes, and 102,597 subjects in the eMERGE network have phecodes available. In addition to rich phenotypic data, 21,363 individuals have sequencing data in 109 genes chosen as part of the eMERGE specific sequencing platform.

We describe here the datasets we used for training and testing purposes. Although we do not use a case-control label in the training, our approaches need to be trained on datasets enriched in cases for the disease under consideration, although as we explain later, only an approximate definition of case is required. That is why we refer to the proposed methods as almost unsupervised.

The Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) case-control cohort was constructed from 98,486 subjects with available kidney function data excluding 4,111 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We considered 1,817 non-zero prevalence phecodes, which are divided into 18 categories (Supplementary Table 1). We took advantage of a CKD phenotyping algorithm recently developed within eMERGE to diagnose and place individuals on a CKD staging grid of albuminuria by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Using this algorithm, the individuals were classified as having no CKD (controls) or having CKD of various severity, classified as G1, G2, G3a, G3b, and G4 stage. We divided the case-control dataset in Table 1 into two parts, and used 50% of the cases and 50% of controls for training purposes. We first use the entire set of phecodes to build the quantitative disease risk scores, without any pre-selection based on the disease under consideration. We compare performance with the scenario when phecodes are pre-selected based on their potential relevance to the disease of interest. Note that the selection of phecodes does not require expert knowledge, and highly automated approaches can be used for this purpose. We discuss the pre-selection of phecodes in more detail in the next section.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with pregnancy-related end-stage kidney disease [^182b3fd9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Primary Cause of Kidney Failure

Primary cause of kidney failure was ascertained via CMS form 2728. A pregnancy-related primary cause of ESKD was identified if any of the following ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis codes were reported per form 2728: 64620, 64620A, 64620a, 64620Z, 64620z, 6462Z, 6462z, or O904. Although pregnancy may have been a contributing cause in some cases, our study only captures patients in which pregnancy was considered the primary cause of ESKD. Those with a nonpregnancy-related primary cause of kidney failure were categorized as follows: (1) diabetes, (2) hypertension, (3) glomerulonephritis, (4) cystic kidney disease, or (5) other or unknown cause. For the purposes of analysis, we grouped those with diabetes or hypertension as well as those with glomerulonephritis or cystic kidney disease together as baseline characteristics were similar.

Baseline Characteristics

Using publicly available birth certificate data for all live births from the CDC Division of Vital Statistics, demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between patients with pregnancy-related ESKD and the general population of pregnant patients during the same period. We show CDC data from the years 2000 and 2020. For this comparison, we were limited to characteristics captured both in USRDS and in the birth certificate data (age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes, and chronic hypertension). Drawing solely from USRDS data, we separately compared demographic and clinical characteristics between those with pregnancy-related ESKD and patients with other causes of ESKD using the categories previously described. Race and ethnicity were derived as reported on CMS form 2728, which is reviewed and signed by both the reporting physician and the patient. Race and ethnicity were assessed in this study to evaluate racial disparities in maternal outcomes that have been previously identified.

### Trends in severe maternal morbidity in the US across the transition to ICD-10-CM / PCS from 2012–2019 [^178b52ac]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Surveillance of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is critical for monitoring maternal health and evaluating clinical quality improvement efforts.

Objective

To evaluate national and state trends in SMM rates from 2012 to 2019 and potential disruptions associated with the transition to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification and Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) in October 2015.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional analysis examined delivery hospitalizations from 2012 through 2019 in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample and State Inpatient Databases, an all-payer compendium of hospital discharge records from community, nonrehabilitation hospitals. Trends were evaluated using segmented linear binomial regression models that allowed for discontinuities across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. Analyses were completed from April 2021 through March 2022.

Exposures

Time, ICD-10-CM/PCS coding system, and state.

Main Outcomes and Measures

SMM rates, excluding blood transfusion, per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations, overall and by indicator.

Results

From 2012 to 2019, there were 5 964 315 delivery hospitalizations in the national sample representing a weighted total of 29.8 million deliveries with a mean (SD) maternal age of 28.6 (5.9) years. SMM rates increased from 69.5 per 10 000 in 2012 to 79.7 per 10 000 in 2019 (rate difference [RD], 10.2; 95% CI, 5.8 to 14.6) without a significant change across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, -3.2; 95% CI, -6.9 to 0.6). Of 20 SMM indicators, rates for 10 indicators significantly increased while 3 significantly decreased; 5 of these changes were associated with ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. Acute kidney failure had the largest increase, from 6.4 to 15.3 per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations (RD, 8.9; 95% CI, 7.5 to 10.3) with no change associated with ICD transition (RD, -0.1; 95% CI, -1.2 to 1.1). Disseminated intravascular coagulation had the largest decrease from 31.3 to 21.2 per 10 000 (RD, 10.2; 95% CI, -12.8 to -7.5), with a significant drop associated with ICD transition (RD, -7.9; 95% CI, -10.2 to -5.6). State SMM rates significantly decreased for 1 state and significantly increased for 21 states from 2012 to 2019 and associations with ICD transition varied.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, overall US SMM rates increased from 2012 to 2019, which was not associated with the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. However, data for certain indicators and states may not be comparable across coding systems; efforts are needed to understand SMM increases and state variation.

### Common elements in rare kidney diseases: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^0a07e32d]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Rare kidney diseases encompass at least 150 different conditions, most of which are inherited. Although individual rare kidney diseases raise specific issues, as a group these rare diseases can have overlapping challenges in diagnosis and treatment. These challenges include small numbers of affected patients, unidentified causes of disease, lack of biomarkers for monitoring disease progression, and need for complex care. To address common clinical and patient issues among rare kidney diseases, the KDIGO Controversies Conference entitled, Common Elements in Rare Kidney Diseases, brought together a panel of multidisciplinary clinical providers and patient advocates to address five central issues for rare kidney diseases. These issues encompassed diagnostic challenges, management of kidney functional decline and progression of chronic kidney disease, challenges in clinical study design, translation of advances in research to clinical care, and provision of practical and integrated patient support. Thus, by a process of consensus, guidance for addressing these challenges was developed and is presented here.

ADPKD prevalence and genetic epidemiology — population estimates and gene-specific penetrance are summarized as follows: ADPKD is the most prevalent monogenic kidney disease associated with kidney failure, accounting for a significant proportion of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure populations. Classic estimates cite a prevalence of 1 in 1000, derived as a genetic prevalence reflecting a lifetime of 80 years (8 per 10,000 people). More recent data report 3.96 per 10,000 in the European Union in 2012, 2–4 per 10,000 in U.S. studies, and 5.7 per 10,000 in the Seychelles. In Olmsted County (1980–2016), prevalence was 6.8 per 10,000 for "definite" or "likely" cases, increasing to 12.4 per 10,000 when "possible" cases were included. Sequencing-based estimates reported prevalence values for PKD1 and PKD2 pathogenic variants of 6.8 and 2.6 per 10,000, yielding a PKD1/PKD2 ratio of 2.6. In the Geisinger whole-exome sequencing cohort, a possible genetic cause was found in 180 of 235 people with ADPKD (76.6%); the majority had rare variants in PKD1 (n = 127) or PKD2 (n = 34), while 19 (8.1%) had variants in other cystic kidney disease genes. Penetrance among truncating variant carriers was illustrated by ICD coding consistent with ADPKD in 42 of 54 (77.8%) with PKD1 and 17 of 24 (70.8%) with PKD2, with much lower levels for IFT140 (2.5%), GANAB (7.1%), and HNF1B (6.2%).

### Medical records-based chronic kidney disease phenotype for clinical care and "big data" observational and genetic studies [^691b5962]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a slowly progressive disorder that is typically silent until late stages, but early intervention can significantly delay its progression. We designed a portable and scalable electronic CKD phenotype to facilitate early disease recognition and empower large-scale observational and genetic studies of kidney traits. The algorithm uses a combination of rule-based and machine-learning methods to automatically place patients on the staging grid of albuminuria by glomerular filtration rate ("A-by-G" grid). We manually validated the algorithm by 451 chart reviews across three medical systems, demonstrating overall positive predictive value of 95% for CKD cases and 97% for healthy controls. Independent case-control validation using 2350 patient records demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 87%. Application of the phenotype to 1.3 million patients demonstrated that over 80% of CKD cases are undetected using ICD codes alone. We also demonstrated several large-scale applications of the phenotype, including identifying stage-specific kidney disease comorbidities, in silico estimation of kidney trait heritability in thousands of pedigrees reconstructed from medical records, and biobank-based multicenter genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^38a61660]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Institutional review board

This research was exempt by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Review Board.

Development of CCC V2 classification scheme

We updated the CCC classification system in 5 steps. First, we reviewed publications that either used or evaluated the CCC v1 system, identifying ICD-9 codes that have been found to be omitted in the CCC v1 system but likely to indicate CCC status, and incorporated these codes. Second, we translated ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes by using GEMs (General Equivalence Mappings) forward mapping. The GEMs for the diagnosis codes are developed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); the GEMs for the procedure codes are developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). They are the authoritative source for translation between ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes Third, two member of the team (CF and JF), both experienced clinicians who care exclusively for children with CCCs, independently reviewed all codes in the ICD-9 and ICD-10 taxonomies to identify neonatal conditions, specifically those arising in the perinatal period (including very low birth weight) that have a high likelihood of meeting the CCC definition. All discrepancies were resolved through further query of the detailed ICD taxonomies. Fourth, in a similar manner but this time focusing on technology dependence and transplantation status, the same team members (CF and JF) reviewed ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, as well as existing publications, to identify codes indicative of persons who likely have a CCC. Fifth, with the provisional set of all CCC v2 codes, we used the v2 system to classify all cases in the CDC Multiple Cause of Death data for 1996, 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), and 2010 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) datasets, and reviewed all cases classified as not having a CCC to determine whether any codes in the CCC v2 system had been either incorrectly specified or omitted, and then we corrected these errors.

### Definition, diagnosis and clinical management of non-obstructive kidney dysplasia: a consensus statement by the ERKNet working group on kidney malformations [^0eaef2c7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Several important clinical and scientific knowledge gaps remain to be addressed based on a standardized definition of kidney dysplasia. In a first step, the correlation of ultrasound findings with histopathology has not been validated systematically. We currently do not know whether there are histological subgroups among the cohorts we nowadays subsume as kidney dysplasia. It also remains unclear to what extent prenatal and postnatal sonographic findings in children with kidney dysplasia correlate, to what extent pre- and postnatal sonographic findings can be linked to kidney function, and whether there is a specific timepoint, a specific mode of imaging or a specific biochemical finding with prognostic value in kidney dysplasia patients. Ultrasound is the preferred method for daily clinical use in pediatrics, and potentially easy-to-obtain sonographic findings might be of prognostic value. As an example, clinicians tend to agree on the notion that children with dysplastic kidneys with or without cysts typically have a worse prognosis as compared with children with hypoplastic kidneys, but systematic evidence supporting this assumption is missing. Beyond straightforward sonography, functional MRI studies have shown great potential in other kidney diseases or disorders of other organs. Data on pediatric kidney disease remain scarce. A research initiative to link imaging findings with clinical and histopathologic data is needed for the CAKUT field. The field will need to bring together all these relevant items of information in an integrated dataset. Structured biobanking of kidney dysplasia samples for a standardized histological work-up and digital processing would have great potential to obtain novel and deep insights into the histopathology and potentially also the pathophysiology of kidney dysplasia. Such samples could also be used for expression profiling, e.g. by multiomics methods to get deeper insights into dysregulated signaling patterns in dysplastic kidneys and as a basis for translational research between bedside and preclinical work with model organisms at the bench. In-depth genetic analyses of patients and tissue samples with a link to clinical findings will be needed to deepen our understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms. Yet, such studies are cumbersome and costly and require highly standardized collaboration in large international consortia to generate comparable clinical data and high-quality biosampling. As biopsy samples will not be available for ethical reasons, nephrectomy samples or autopsies may partly be helpful for such studies, although they are also obviously subject to secondary changes related to CKF or changes associated with repetitive infections. Nephrectomy samples could, for example, be obtained within the frame of kidney transplantation.

### Discovering monogenic patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis in millions of clinical notes with monoMiner [^27f57a23]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cohort building is a powerful foundation for improving clinical care, performing biomedical research, recruiting for clinical trials, and many other applications. We set out to build a cohort of all monogenic patients with a definitive causal gene diagnosis in a 3-million patient hospital system.

Methods

We define a subset (4461) of OMIM diseases that have at least 1 known monogenic causal gene. We then introduce MonoMiner, a natural language processing framework to identify molecularly confirmed monogenic patients from free-text clinical notes.

Results

We show that ICD-10-CM codes cover only a fraction of monogenic diseases and that even where available, ICD-10-CM code‒based patient retrieval offers 0.14 precision. Searching by causal gene symbol offers great recall but has an even worse 0.07 precision. MonoMiner achieves 6 to 11 times higher precision (0.80), with 0.87 precision on disease diagnosis alone, tagging 4259 patients with 560 monogenic diseases and 534 causal genes, at 0.48 recall.

Conclusion

MonoMiner enables the discovery of a large, high-precision cohort of patients with monogenic diseases with an established molecular diagnosis, empowering numerous downstream uses. Because it relies solely on clinical notes, MonoMiner is highly portable, and its approach is adaptable to other domains and languages.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^fb34b874]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

We also measured the degree to which the CCC v2 system identified more patients with complex chronic conditions than CCC v1 because of the modifications and additions. While most CCC categories demonstrated moderate or almost no change (such as the congenital/genetic CCC) in the percentage of all deaths attributed to a given CCC category, there were several CCC categories had notable increases in percentages when the CCC v2 system was applied (such as the gastrointestinal CCC); and the change in the percentage of cases assigned to a CCC category also varied when the schemes were applied to different national data sources (for example, the percentage of patients with gastrointestinal CCC increased 226% in the KID but increased 333% in the NEDS). Cardiovascular CCC and malignancy CCC both decreased in NEDS and KID. These decreases were due to the elimination of self-limiting or completely correctable cardiovascular conditions (ICD-9: 745.4, 745.5, 747.0, and 745.7) and benign neoplasms (ICD-9: 210–229) in the CCC v2 scheme.

### Nomenclature for kidney function and disease-executive summary and glossary from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^6fe30867]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Advances in research, particularly in precision medicine, will introduce a myriad of new terms and novel concepts requiring incorporation into disease definitions and classifications. In addition, the increasing prominence and participation of patient and caregiver communities in defining research objectives and best practices in clinical care objectives will further elucidate the characteristics of patient-centred terminology. Expanding and updating the KDIGO glossary can be accomplished as part of the activities of future KDIGO guideline workgroups and future conferences.

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^51ad6a56]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.
