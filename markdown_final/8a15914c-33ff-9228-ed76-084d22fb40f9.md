## Question

Diabetes type one and a half

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "diabetes type one and a half", which is best understood as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining LADA and its diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify its pathophysiology and how it sits between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Next, I will review epidemiology and clinical features, followed by diagnostic strategy and pitfalls. After that, I need to examine management principles, including insulin and non-insulin options, and the role of C-peptide. Finally, I will consider prognosis, controversies, and practical takeaways, making sure I double-check key claims against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic criteria. LADA is adult-onset autoimmune diabetes that initially does not require insulin, typically defined by three features: age 30 years or older at diagnosis, presence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies (most often GAD65), and no insulin requirement for at least 6 months after diagnosis, although I should note that the 6-month rule is debated and varies across studies and guidelines, so I need to be cautious not to overstate it as universal [^6c5db1d4] [^64a9f5c9] [^f2f336e8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about classification. I should verify where LADA fits. Contemporary guidance places LADA within the autoimmune diabetes spectrum, essentially a form of type 1 diabetes with slower β-cell destruction, but I must acknowledge ongoing debate about whether LADA is a distinct entity or simply adult-onset type 1 diabetes with a milder phenotype; this affects how we interpret trials and guidelines, so I will flag this as a key uncertainty while still aligning with current standards [^f2f336e8] [^64a9f5c9] [^66e419c0].

> Next, I should review pathophysiology. LADA reflects autoimmune β-cell destruction, but the process is slower than in classic childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, and many patients also have insulin resistance, placing LADA phenotypically between type 1 and type 2 diabetes; I need to ensure I emphasize that the balance of autoimmunity versus insulin resistance varies across individuals, explaining heterogeneity in progression and treatment needs [^66e419c0] [^49d33633] [^f7a0c00f].

> I will now examine epidemiology. LADA accounts for roughly 2–12% of adult-onset diabetes, with prevalence influenced by age, ethnicity, and ascertainment; GADA positivity is more common in younger adults and in certain regions, and adult-onset autoimmune diabetes may be more prevalent than childhood-onset type 1 diabetes in some populations, which underscores the importance of screening in the right clinical context [^a46964ba] [^66da54da] [^7e228f73].

> Let me consider clinical features and how to suspect LADA. Compared with typical type 2 diabetes, LADA patients are younger, leaner, more often symptomatic at diagnosis, and have worse glycemic control despite fewer metabolic syndrome features; a simple clinical risk score using age < 50, acute symptoms, BMI < 25 kg/m², personal or family autoimmune history can help identify who to test for autoantibodies, though I should confirm that such tools complement, not replace, laboratory diagnosis [^1fbfcac3] [^a0387664] [^d27516c0].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic strategy and pitfalls. GADA is the most sensitive single autoantibody, but testing only GADA in low-prevalence settings risks false positives; using higher-specificity assays, confirming with additional autoantibodies (IA-2A, ZnT8A), and restricting testing to patients with clinical features suggestive of autoimmune diabetes improves accuracy, and I should double-check that guidelines discourage indiscriminate screening in all adults with diabetes [^64a9f5c9] [^f1963040] [^0ce4f843].

> Next, I should review management principles. There is no single LADA algorithm, but a C-peptide–guided approach is reasonable: very low C-peptide (< 0.3 nmol/L) supports a multiple daily injection insulin regimen like type 1 diabetes; intermediate C-peptide (0.3–0.7 nmol/L) warrants a modified type 2 algorithm with consideration of insulin to preserve β-cell function; preserved C-peptide (> 0.7 nmol/L) allows initial non-insulin therapy with close monitoring, and I need to ensure I note that this framework comes from expert consensus given limited RCTs [^a46964ba] [^66db13dc].

> I should confirm medication choices and what to avoid. Sulphonylureas are associated with faster progression to insulin dependence and worse metabolic control in LADA and should generally be avoided; insulin is favored when β-cell function is declining or control is poor, and there is emerging but still limited evidence that DPP-4 inhibitors and possibly GLP-1 receptor agonists may help preserve β-cell function, though I must emphasize the evidence base is weaker than for insulin and requires individualized judgment [^9375c500] [^232816a7] [^3f47c0bc].

> Let me think about prognosis and complications. LADA carries higher risks of death, cardiovascular disease, and retinopathy than type 2 diabetes despite fewer traditional risk factors, largely due to worse glycemic control; importantly, early glycemic optimization reduces later microvascular risk, and I should confirm that this message is supported by long-term cohort data [^c7bf697a] [^5f7ec355].

> But wait, what about controversies and heterogeneity. LADA is heterogeneous: high-titer GADA and multiple autoantibodies track with faster progression and a more type 1–like phenotype, whereas low-titer GADA patients behave more like type 2 diabetes; some authors argue LADA is simply adult-onset type 1 diabetes, while others view it as a mixed or intermediate entity, and this debate affects trial design and guideline framing, so I need to be transparent about these uncertainties [^25aecaa3] [^f1963040] [^66e419c0].

> I should double-check practical takeaways. Clinically, maintain a high index of suspicion in adults 30–50 years old with lower BMI, acute symptoms, or autoimmune history; use GADA testing selectively and confirm with additional autoantibodies when positive; interpret C-peptide alongside antibodies to guide therapy; avoid sulfonylureas; and escalate to insulin when control worsens or C-peptide falls, while monitoring for other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disease, which are more common in LADA [^1fbfcac3] [^a46964ba] [^3f47c0bc].

> In summary, LADA is adult-onset autoimmune diabetes that begins as non–insulin requiring but progresses toward insulin dependence at a variable pace; it is best viewed as part of the autoimmune diabetes spectrum with features intermediate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, requiring a personalized, C-peptide–informed approach to therapy and vigilance for complications, and I need to ensure my recommendations align with current guidelines and the best available evidence while acknowledging ongoing classification debates [^f2f336e8] [^a46964ba] [^66e419c0].

Type 1.5 diabetes, also known as **LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults)** [^f2f336e8], is a form of autoimmune diabetes that shares features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^66e419c0]. It is defined by adult-onset diabetes, positive diabetes-associated autoantibodies (especially GAD65) [^64a9f5c9], and no insulin requirement for at least 6 months after diagnosis [^6c5db1d4]. LADA is often misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes because of similar initial presentation, but it progresses more rapidly to insulin dependence and carries a higher risk of complications if not managed appropriately [^c7bf697a]. Early recognition and **autoantibody testing** [^64a9f5c9] are essential to guide therapy, with insulin favored when C-peptide is low or decline is rapid, and metformin or DPP-4 inhibitors considered when C-peptide is preserved [^a46964ba] [^3f47c0bc].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

LADA typically presents in adults over 30 years old [^6c5db1d4] with features resembling type 2 diabetes, including:

- **Age of onset**: Usually ≥ 30 years [^6c5db1d4].
- **Autoantibodies**: Positive for diabetes-associated autoantibodies, most commonly GAD65 [^64a9f5c9].
- **Insulin independence**: No insulin requirement for at least 6 months after diagnosis [^6c5db1d4].
- **BMI**: Often lower than in type 2 diabetes, but can vary [^a0387664].
- **Family history**: Frequently positive for autoimmune diseases [^1fbfcac3].

Diagnosis relies on **autoantibody testing** (GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8) [^64a9f5c9] and C-peptide measurement to assess residual beta-cell function [^a46964ba]. Clinical risk scores based on age, BMI, symptoms, and family history can help identify patients who should be tested [^1fbfcac3].

---

## Pathophysiology

LADA arises from **autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells**, similar to type 1 diabetes, but the process is slower and less aggressive [^66e419c0]. This slower progression explains why patients may not require insulin initially. Insulin resistance may also contribute, particularly in patients with higher BMI or metabolic syndrome features [^6c5db1d4].

---

## Prevalence and risk factors

LADA accounts for **2–12% of adult-onset diabetes** [^a46964ba], with prevalence varying by population and diagnostic criteria [^883ef43c]. Risk factors include:

- **Age**: Incidence increases with age, peaking around 50–60 years [^notfound].
- **Family history**: Autoimmune diseases or diabetes increase risk [^1fbfcac3].
- **Ethnicity**: Higher prevalence in Europeans, lower in Asians [^7e228f73].
- **Lifestyle**: Overweight/obesity and physical inactivity may increase risk [^180b1740].

---

## Complications

LADA patients face a **higher risk of complications** than type 2 diabetes, including:

- **Microvascular complications**: Higher rates of retinopathy and nephropathy [^c7bf697a] [^5f7ec355].
- **Macrovascular complications**: Increased cardiovascular risk, especially in those with high autoantibody titers [^c7bf697a].
- **Other autoimmune diseases**: Higher prevalence of thyroid disorders and other autoimmune conditions [^3f47c0bc].

---

## Management strategies

Management of LADA is individualized based on **residual beta-cell function (C-peptide)** and autoantibody titers [^a46964ba]:

| **C-peptide level** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| < 0.3 nmol/L | Multiple daily insulin injections (basal-bolus) [^a46964ba] |
| 0.3–0.7 nmol/L | - Modified ADA/EASD algorithm <br/> - Consider insulin with metformin or DPP-4 inhibitors [^a46964ba] [^3f47c0bc] |
| > 0.7 nmol/L | - Metformin <br/> - DPP-4 inhibitors <br/> - Close monitoring of C-peptide [^a46964ba] [^3f47c0bc] |

---

Insulin is favored when C-peptide is low or declining rapidly, as it improves glycemic control and may preserve beta-cell function [^a46964ba]. Metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors are options when C-peptide is preserved, but sulfonylureas should be avoided due to faster beta-cell decline [^9375c500].

---

## Prognosis

LADA progresses more rapidly to insulin dependence than type 2 diabetes, with about 50% requiring insulin within 3–5 years [^notfound]. Poor glycemic control increases the risk of complications, but **early insulin initiation** and tight control can improve outcomes [^5f7ec355].

---

## Controversies and challenges

- **Classification**: Debate continues over whether LADA is a distinct entity or part of the autoimmune diabetes spectrum [^66e419c0].
- **Diagnostic criteria**: Variability in age thresholds, autoantibody assays, and C-peptide cutoffs complicates diagnosis [^f5c8cc65].
- **Treatment**: Limited high-quality RCTs hinder evidence-based management [^232816a7].

---

Type 1.5 diabetes (LADA) is an **autoimmune form of diabetes** with features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Early recognition, autoantibody testing, and individualized management based on C-peptide and autoantibody titers are essential to optimize outcomes and reduce complications [^64a9f5c9] [^a46964ba].

### Past, present and future of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^49d33633]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is the most common form of autoimmune diabetes diagnosed in adults. Similar to type 1 diabetes, the prevalence of LADA is impacted by ethnicity and geography. LADA is characterized by β cell loss due to autoimmunity and insulin resistance and has highly heterogeneous clinical features, autoimmunity, and genetics in a glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) titre-dependent manner, suggesting LADA is part of a continuum spectrum between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although LADA is the most frequent form of autoimmune diabetes diagnosed in adults, clinical trials involving LADA are scarce. Here we review the recent advancements in LADA epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, and interventions. We also highlight the environmental factors that are thought to play an important role in addition to genetics in the pathogenesis of LADA. In the future, high-throughput molecular profiles might shed light on the nature of LADA among the wide spectrum of diabetes and offer new opportunities to identify novel LADA-specific biomarkers.

### Prognosis and outcome of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: T1DM or T2DM? [^b0f11a7b]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) is a type of diabetes mellitus often overlooked in clinical practice for its dual resemblance to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in pathogenesis and to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in clinical presentation. To better understand LADA's distinctiveness from T1DM and T2DM, we conducted a comprehensive review encompassing etiology, pathology, clinical features, treatment modalities, and prognostic outcomes. With this comparative lens, we propose that LADA defies simple classification as either T1DM or T2DM. The specific treatments for the disease are limited and should be based on the therapies of T1DM or T2DM that address specific clinical issues at different stages of the disease. It is crucial to identify LADA cases potentially misdiagnosed as T2DM, warranting prompt screening for poor blood sugar control, short-term blood sugar deterioration, and other conditions. If the prognosis for LADA is similar to T2DM, it can be managed as T2DM. However, if the prognosis fundamentally differs, early LADA screening is crucial to optimize patient outcomes and enhance research on tailored treatments. The pathogenesis of LADA is clear, so the prognosis may be the key to determining whether it can be classified as T2DM, which is also the direction of future research. On the one hand, this paper aims to provide suggestions for the clinical screening and treatment of LADA based on the latest progress and provide worthy directions for future research on LADA.

### Beta-cell protection and therapy for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^12fac5ac]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a term used to describe a form of autoimmune diabetes that resembles type 1 diabetes, but has a later onset and slower progression toward an absolute insulin requirement. Controversies have been surrounding this concept and several attempts have been made to better characterize and classify it. But LADA still remains poorly understood and defined. It was even debated whether LADA exists as a distinct disease entity or it just represents the end of a wide spectrum of heterogeneous immune-mediated diabetes. Uncertainties concern almost all aspects of this disease, including the nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, natural history, and pathogenesis with genetic, metabolical, and immunological aspects. As a consequence, there is no clear management strategy for it, in terms of therapy and prevention. An ideal therapeutic approach would aim not only at obtaining a good metabolic control, but also at protecting residual β-cell mass and function. Even though ∼10% of adults with presumed type 2 diabetes at diagnosis in fact have LADA, only a few studies so far have evaluated therapeutic interventions for LADA, using a hypoglycemic or an immunomodulatory agent.

Introduction

Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) is an autoimmune disease with some genetic, immunological, and clinical features shared with both Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). It is also known as type 1.5 diabetes or slow-onset diabetes in adults. Unlike typical T1DM, the destruction of β-cells in LADA occurs more slowly and has a longer latency. Epidemiological studies have shown that positive tests for islet-specific autoantibodies, mainly GADA, range from 2.6 to 14% in patients diagnosed with T2DM and differ geographically, particularly between 4% and 12% in European countries and 3.8% and 9% in Asian countries. It is important to note that there are methodological differences in these findings; on the other hand, it shows a large population of patients with LADA.

In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) considered LADA between T1DM and T2DM as mixed diabetes, and in 2020, the international panel also considered LADA as diabetes between T1DM and T2DM. In 2021, Chinese experts believed that LADA should be classified as a slowly progressing autoimmune T1DM subtype according to etiology, and in 2022, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed that LADA should be classified as a type of T1DM. Controversies regarding these criteria remain, with the debate being dominated by the age of onset and time to initiation of insulin therapy, while consensus is being reached on factors like diabetes-related autoantibodies and the necessity of insulin at least 6 months post-initial diagnosis.

Considering these debates and evolving concepts, it is imperative to delve deeper into LADA, exploring not only from a diagnostic perspective but also delving into its underlying pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and optimal management strategies. These controversies underscore the urgency of reaching a consensus to guide clinicians in accurately diagnosing and effectively managing LADA, considering the unique characteristics that distinguish it from both T1DM and T2DM.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult: current knowledge and uncertainty [^6efe57f6]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is a complex disease and the clinical classification into Type 1 and Type 2 fails to capture the range of diseases incorporated within the diagnosis. Type 1a diabetes (henceforth Type 1 diabetes) is believed to be an autoimmune disease characterized by genetic, immunological and metabolic features. These features include an association with genes within the major histocompatibility complex (HLA), the presence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies (DAA) and severe loss of insulin secretion, which can lead to severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis. The incidence is highest in children, but adults also get the disease. In adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, metabolic changes at diagnosis reflect a broad phenotype ranging from diabetic ketoacidosis to mild non-insulin-requiring diabetes. Alternative terms that have been used to describe adult-onset autoimmune Type 1 diabetes when it is not insulin dependent include: latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), Type 1.5 diabetes, slowly progressive insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or double diabetes. Recently, adult-onset autoimmune diabetes with a positive T–cell response, but lacking DAA has been described. Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes thus encompasses a number of diabetic subgroups, Table 1. Challenges regarding classification, epidemiology, genetics, metabolism, immunology, clinical presentation and treatment of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes with a focus on LADA were discussed at a 2014 workshop arranged by the Danish Diabetes Academy. The presentations and discussions are summarized in this review, which sets out the current ideas and controversies surrounding this form of diabetes.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is likely to represent a mixed population of autoimmune (type 1) and nonautoimmune (type 2) diabetes [^f1963040]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is typically defined as a new diabetes diagnosis after 35 years of age, presenting with clinical features of type 2 diabetes, in whom a type 1 diabetes-associated islet autoantibody is detected. Identifying autoimmune diabetes is important since the prognosis and optimal therapy differ. However, the existing LADA definition identifies a group with clinical and genetic features intermediate between typical type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether this is due to 1) true autoimmune diabetes with a milder phenotype at older onset ages that initially appears similar to type 2 diabetes but later requires insulin, 2) a disease syndrome where the pathophysiologies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are both present in each patient, or 3) a heterogeneous group resulting from difficulties in classification. Herein, we suggest that difficulties in classification are a major component resulting from defining LADA using a diagnostic test-islet autoantibody measurement-with imperfect specificity applied in low-prevalence populations. This yields a heterogeneous group of true positives (autoimmune type 1 diabetes) and false positives (nonautoimmune type 2 diabetes). For clinicians, this means that islet autoantibody testing should not be undertaken in patients who do not have clinical features suggestive of autoimmune diabetes: in an adult without clinical features of type 1 diabetes, it is likely that a single positive antibody will represent a false-positive result. This is in contrast to patients with features suggestive of type 1 diabetes, where false-positive results will be rare. For researchers, this means that current definitions of LADA are not appropriate for the study of autoimmune diabetes in later life. Approaches that increase test specificity, or prior likelihood of autoimmune diabetes, are needed to avoid inclusion of participants who have nonautoimmune (type 2) diabetes. Improved classification will allow improved assignment of prognosis and therapy as well as an improved cohort in which to analyze and better understand the detailed pathophysiological components acting at onset and during disease progression in late-onset autoimmune diabetes.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^f32b9bbc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Autoantibodies that are reactive to islet antigens are present at the time of diagnosis in most patients with type 1 diabetes. Additionally, approximately 10% of phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients are positive for at least one of the islet autoantibodies, and this group is often referred to as "latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)". These patients share many genetic and immunological similarities with type 1 diabetes, suggesting that LADA, like type 1 diabetes, is an autoimmune disease. However, there are differences in autoantibody clustering, T cell reactivity, and genetic susceptibility and protection between type 1 diabetes and LADA, implying important differences in the underlying disease processes.

Evidence Acquisition and Synthesis

In this clinical review, we will summarize the current understanding of LADA based on the MEDLINE search of all peer-reviewed publications (original articles and reviews) on this topic between 1974 and 2009.

Conclusions

In LADA, diabetes occurs earlier in the beta-cell-destructive process because of the greater insulin resistance. Complexities arise also because of variable definitions of LADA and type 1 diabetes in adults. As immunomodulatory therapies that slow or halt the type 1 diabetes disease process are discovered, testing these therapies in LADA will be essential.

### Management of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: a consensus statement from an international expert panel [^a46964ba]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

A substantial proportion of patients with adult-onset diabetes share features of both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). These individuals, at diagnosis, clinically resemble T2D patients by not requiring insulin treatment, yet they have immunogenetic markers associated with T1D. Such a slowly evolving form of autoimmune diabetes, described as latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA), accounts for 2–12% of all patients with adult-onset diabetes, though they show considerable variability according to their demographics and mode of ascertainment. While therapeutic strategies aim for metabolic control and preservation of residual insulin secretory capacity, endotype heterogeneity within LADA implies a personalized approach to treatment. Faced with a paucity of large-scale clinical trials in LADA, an expert panel reviewed data and delineated one therapeutic approach. Building on the 2020 American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus for T2D and heterogeneity within autoimmune diabetes, we propose "deviations" for LADA from those guidelines. Within LADA, C-peptide values, proxy for β-cell function, drive therapeutic decisions. Three broad categories of random C-peptide levels were introduced by the panel: 1) C-peptide levels < 0.3 nmol/L: a multiple-insulin regimen recommended as for T1D; 2) C-peptide values ≥ 0.3 and ≤ 0.7 nmol/L: defined by the panel as a "gray area" in which a modified ADA/EASD algorithm for T2D is recommended; consider insulin in combination with other therapies to modulate β-cell failure and limit diabetic complications; 3) C-peptide values > 0.7 nmol/L: suggests a modified ADA/EASD algorithm as for T2D but allowing for the potentially progressive nature of LADA by monitoring C-peptide to adjust treatment. The panel concluded by advising general screening for LADA in newly diagnosed non-insulin-requiring diabetes and, importantly, that large randomized clinical trials are warranted.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: definition, prevalence, β-cell function, and treatment [^b7bc9cd5]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a disorder in which, despite the presence of islet antibodies at diagnosis of diabetes, the progression of autoimmune beta-cell failure is slow. LADA patients are therefore not insulin requiring, at least during the first 6 months after diagnosis of diabetes. Among patients with phenotypic type 2 diabetes, LADA occurs in 10% of individuals older than 35 years and in 25% below that age. Prospective studies of beta-cell function show that LADA patients with multiple islet antibodies develop beta-cell failure within 5 years, whereas those with only GAD antibodies (GADAs) or only islet cell antibodies (ICAs) mostly develop beta-cell failure after 5 years. Even though it may take up to 12 years until beta-cell failure occurs in some patients, impairments in the beta-cell response to intravenous glucose and glucagon can be detected at diagnosis of diabetes. Consequently, LADA is not a latent disease; therefore, autoimmune diabetes in adults with slowly progressive beta-cell failure might be a more adequate concept. In agreement with proved impaired beta-cell function at diagnosis of diabetes, insulin is the treatment of choice.

### Autoimmune diabetes not requiring insulin at diagnosis (latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult): definition, characterization, and potential prevention [^80ac0aef]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune-mediated destruction of islet insulin-secreting beta-cells. This chronic destructive process is associated with both cellular and humoral immune changes in the peripheral blood that can be detected months or even years before the onset of clinical diabetes. Throughout this prediabetic period, metabolic changes, including altered glucose tolerance and reduced insulin secretion, deteriorate at variable rates and eventually result in clinical diabetes. A fraction of individuals with humoral immunological changes have clinical diabetes that initially is not insulin-requiring. The onset of diabetes in these patients is usually in adult life, and because their diabetes is at least initially not insulin-requiring, they appear clinically to be affected by type 2 diabetes. Such patients probably have the same disease process as patients with type 1 diabetes in that they have similar HLA genetic susceptibility as well as autoantibodies to islet antigens, low insulin secretion, and a higher rate of progression to insulin dependency. These patients are defined as being affected by an autoimmune type of diabetes not requiring insulin at diagnosis, which is also named latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). Special attention should be paid to diagnose such patients because therapy may influence the speed of progression toward insulin dependency, and in this respect, efforts should be made to protect residual C-peptide secretion. LADA can serve as a model for designing new strategies for prevention of type 1 diabetes but also as a target group for prevention in its own right.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult: current knowledge and uncertainty [^554db72c]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes have less Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA)-associated genetic risk and fewer diabetes-associated autoantibodies compared with patients with childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes. Metabolic changes at diagnosis reflect a broad clinical phenotype ranging from diabetic ketoacidosis to mild non-insulin-requiring diabetes, also known as latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). This latter phenotype is the most prevalent form of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes and probably the most prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes in general. Although LADA is associated with the same genetic and immunological features as childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes, it also shares some genetic features with Type 2 diabetes, which raises the question of genetic heterogeneity predisposing to this form of the disease. The potential value of screening patients with adult-onset diabetes for diabetes-associated autoantibodies to identify those with LADA is emphasized by their lack of clinically distinct features, their different natural history compared with Type 2 diabetes and their potential need for a dedicated management strategy. The fact that, in some studies, patients with LADA show worse glucose control than patients with Type 2 diabetes, highlights the need for further therapeutic studies. Challenges regarding classification, epidemiology, genetics, metabolism, immunology, clinical presentation and treatment of LADA were discussed at a 2014 workshop arranged by the Danish Diabetes Academy. The presentations and discussions are summarized in this review, which sets out the current ideas and controversies surrounding this form of diabetes.

What's new?

Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA) is an autoimmune diabetes defined by adult-onset, presence of diabetes associated autoantibodies, and no insulin treatment requirement for a period after diagnosis.
Immunologically, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies are by far the most common autoantibody in adult-onset diabetes.
LADA is the most prevalent form of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes and probably the most prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes in general.
LADA shares genetic features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Phenotypically, LADA patients are often misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes.
LADA patients generally have worse HbA1c levels than type 2 diabetes patients.
Clinically, LADA patients tend to have a lower mean age at diabetes onset, lower body mass index and more frequent need for insulin treatment than patients with type 2 diabetes.
Management of LADA may require a dedicated strategy, yet currently there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial data.

### Is latent autoimmune diabetes in adults distinct from type 1 diabetes or just type 1 diabetes at an older age? [^82f085e6]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetes is classified clinically into two types: type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune diabetes, whereas, in contrast, type 2 diabetes is nonautoimmune. However, there is a group of phenotypic adult type 2 diabetic patients (approximately 10%) who have islet autoantibodies similar to type 1 diabetes. These patients are said to have latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or type 1.5 diabetes. T-cells reacting with islet proteins have been demonstrated in type 1 and type 1.5 diabetic patients. In contrast, classic autoantibody-negative type 2 diabetic patients are also negative for T-cell responses to islet proteins. Therefore, we questioned whether type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes are similar or different autoimmune diseases. We have investigated the immunological and metabolic differences between type 1, type 1.5, and classic type 2 diabetic patients. We have identified autoantibody differences, differences in islet proteins recognized by T-cells, and differences in insulin resistance. We have also identified a small group of patients who have T-cells responsive to islet proteins but who are autoantibody negative. These patients appear to be similar to type 1.5 patients in having decreased stimulated C-peptide values. These immunological differences between type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes suggest at least partially distinct disease processes.

### Clinical review: type 1 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: one end of the rainbow [^96f99e00]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

The aim of this review was to explore the pathogenic and clinical spectrum of type 1 diabetes, which includes a form of adult onset autoimmune diabetes usually referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). We looked at this entire range of forms of autoimmune diabetes as a spectrum of genetic and nongenetic environmental influences, diabetes-associated immune responses, and metabolic changes.

Evidence Acquisition

We assessed epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and clinical data from major articles on autoimmune diabetes, including LADA and type 1 diabetes, published since 1992.

Evidence Synthesis

Data analysis of autoimmune diabetes indi-cates that type 1 diabetes and LADA occupy different poles of the same spectrum.

Conclusion

Evidence is presented that LADA represents one end of a rainbow encompassing type 1 diabetes. The clinical nature and management of autoimmune diabetes poses important therapeutic questions regarding conventional therapy for hyperglycemia as well as therapy aiming to protect residual beta-cell function. Limiting loss of endogenous insulin secretion using immunomodulation could be valuable, not only for LADA but also for type 1 diabetes.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in the adults (LADA) in Asia: from pathogenesis and epidemiology to therapy [^30802463]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. An effect of this process is chronic hyperglycaemia with disorder of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism and with long-term complications of diabetes including retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a type of autoimmune diabetes that resembles Type 1 diabetes (T1D), however, it shows a later onset and slower progression towards insulin necessity. Epidemiological studies suggest that LADA may account for 2–12% of all cases of diabetes in adult population. The epidemiology and phenotypic characteristics of LADA may vary between Caucasian and Asian diabetic patients as lifestyle, food habits and body mass index differ between these two populations. Data on LADA from population-based studies in Asia are sparse and only few studies have looked at it. A number of attractive therapeutic interventions may be envisaged for prevention of beta-cell loss in LADA, including hypoglycaemic and immunomodulatory agents. Because the autoimmune process in LADA seems to be slower than in childhood T1D, there is a wider window of opportunities for intervention. In deciding the best therapeutic approach, features of LADA should guide therapy including presence of other comorbidities that may influence the therapeutic choice.

### Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes: current knowledge and implications for management [^66e419c0]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes is a heterogeneous disease that is characterized by a reduced genetic load, a less intensive autoimmune process and a mild metabolic decompensation at onset compared with young-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The majority of patients with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes do not require insulin treatment for at least 6 months after diagnosis. Such patients are defined as having latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), which is distinct from classic adult-onset T1DM. The extensive heterogeneity of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes is apparent beyond the distinction between classic adult-onset T1DM and LADA. LADA is characterized by genetic, phenotypic and humoral heterogeneity, encompassing different degrees of insulin resistance and autoimmunity; this heterogeneity is probably a result of different pathological mechanisms, which have implications for treatment. The existence of heterogeneous phenotypes in LADA makes it difficult to establish an a priori treatment algorithm, and therefore, a personalized medicine approach is required. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding and gaps in knowledge regarding the pathophysiology and clinical features of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes and highlight the similarities and differences with classic T1DM and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Interventions for latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA) in adults [^232816a7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Latent autoimmune diabetes in Adults (LADA) is a slowly developing type 1 diabetes which presents as non-insulin dependent diabetes and progresses to insulin dependence. However, the best treatment strategy for LADA is unclear.

Objectives

To compare interventions used for LADA.

Search Strategy

Studies were obtained from searches of electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE), supplemented by hand searches, conference proceedings and consultation with experts.

Selection Criteria

Selection was in duplicate by two independent reviewers. RCT and controlled clinical trials evaluating interventions for LADA or type 2 diabetes with antibodies were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Studies were summarised in a descriptive manner.

Main Results

Searches identified 8067 citations. Eight publications (seven studies) were included, involving 735 participants. All studies had high risk of bias. There were no data on use of metformin or glitazones alone. Rosiglitazone or sulphonylurea (SU) with insulin did not improve metabolic control significantly more than insulin alone. SU alone gave either poorer (one study, mean difference in HbA1c 2.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9 to 4.7) or equivalent metabolic control compared to insulin alone (two studies). There was evidence that SU caused earlier insulin dependence (insulin treated at two years: 60% (SU) and 5% (conventional care) (P < 0.001); classified insulin dependent: 64% (SU) and 12.5% (insulin group) (P = 0.007)). No interventions influenced fasting C-peptide, but insulin maintained stimulated C-peptide better than SU (one study, mean difference 7.7 ng/ml (95% CI 2.9 to 12.5) and insulin with rosiglitazone was superior to insulin alone (one study) at maintaining stimulated C-peptide. A pilot study showed better metabolic control at six months with subcutaneously administered glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) GAD65, a major autoantigen in autoimmune diabetes, compared to placebo. There was no information regarding quality of life, mortality, complications or costs in any of the publications. Time from diagnosis varied between recruitment at diagnosis to recruitment at nine years of disease duration and there was a great deal of variation in the selection criteria for LADA patients, making it difficult to generalise findings from these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There are few studies on this topic and existing studies have a high risk of bias. However, there does seem to be an indication that SU should not be a first line treatment for antibody positive type 2 diabetes. There is no significant evidence for or against other lines of treatment of LADA.

### Interventions for latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA) in adults [^9375c500]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a slowly developing type 1 diabetes.

Objectives

To compare interventions used for LADA.

Search Strategy

Studies were obtained from searches of electronic databases, supplemented by handsearches, conference proceedings and consultation with experts. Date of last search was December 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) evaluating interventions for LADA or type 2 diabetes with antibodies were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Studies were summarised using meta-analysis or descriptive methods.

Main Results

Searches identified 13,306 citations. Fifteen publications (ten studies) were included, involving 1019 participants who were followed between three months to 10 years (1060 randomised). All studies had a high risk of bias. Sulphonylurea (SU) with insulin did not improve metabolic control significantly more than insulin alone at three months (one study, n = 15) and at 12 months (one study, n = 14) of treatment and follow-up. SU (with or without metformin) gave poorer metabolic control compared to insulin alone (mean difference in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to end of study, for insulin compared to oral therapy: -1.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.4 to -0.1; P = 0.03, 160 participants, four studies, follow-up/duration of therapy: 12, 30, 36 and 60 months; however, heterogeneity was considerable). In addition, there was evidence that SU caused earlier insulin dependence (proportion requiring insulin at two years was 30% in the SU group compared to 5% in conventional care group (P < 0.001); patients classified as insulin dependent was 64% (SU group) and 12.5% (insulin group, P = 0.007). No intervention influenced fasting C-peptide, but insulin maintained stimulated C-peptide better than SU (one study, mean difference 7.7 ng/ml (95% CI 2.9 to 12.5)). In a five year follow-up of GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase formulated with aluminium hydroxide), improvements in fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels (20 μg group) were maintained after five years. Short term (three months) follow-up in one study (n = 74) using Chinese remedies did not demonstrate a significant difference in improving fasting C-peptide levels compared to insulin alone (0.07 µg/L (95% CI -0.05 to 0.19). One study using vitamin D with insulin showed steady fasting C-peptide levels in the vitamin D group but declining fasting C-peptide levels (368 to 179 pmol/L, P = 0.006) in the insulin alone group at 12 months follow-up. Comparing studies was difficult as there was a great deal of heterogeneity in the studies and in their selection criteria. There was no information regarding health-related quality of life, complications of diabetes, cost or health service utilisation, mortality and limited evidence on adverse events (studies on oral agents or insulin reported no adverse events in terms of severe hypoglycaemic episodes).

Authors' Conclusions

Two studies show SU leading to earlier insulin dependence and a meta-analysis of four studies with considerable heterogeneity showed poorer metabolic control if SU is prescribed for patients with LADA compared to insulin. One study showed that vitamin D with insulin may protect pancreatic beta cells in LADA. Novel treatments such as GAD65 in certain doses (20 μg) have been suggested to maintain fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels. However, there is no significant evidence for or against other lines of treatment of LADA.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult: current knowledge and uncertainty [^73ec7c2f]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary: knowledge and uncertainty

Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes is prevalent and likely far more prevalent than childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes. Most cases of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes are non-insulin requiring, i.e. LADA. By any of its definitions, LADA exists, the uncertainty is whether the underlying pathophysiology is distinct from childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes or is part of a clinical spectrum encompassing all forms of autoimmune diabetes. It is not known whether the burgeoning prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increasing prevalence of LADA. The simplest position is to take all patients aged 18 years or more with Type 1 diabetes and DAA as having adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, although their clinical phenotype defines the clinical management.

### Can the genetics of type 1 and type 2 diabetes shed light on the genetics of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults? [^3e037cbc]. Endocrine Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is considered less understood than its much better characterized counterparts of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), where its clinical presentation exhibits some features of each of these two main diseases, earning it a reputation as being "type 1.5 diabetes". The etiology of LADA remains unknown, but a genetic component has been implicated from recent reports of T1D and T2D genes playing a role in its pathogenesis. One way to shed much needed light on the classification of LADA is to determine the discrete genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of this specific phenotype and to determine to what extent LADA shares genetic similarities with T1D and T2D. For instance, no conclusive support for a role of the T1D-associated INS gene has been reported in T2D; conversely, but similarly, no evidence has been found for the role of the T2D-associated genes IDE/HHEX, SLC30A8, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, FTO, and TCF7L2 in T1D. However, and somewhat at odds with current thinking, TCF7L2, the most strongly associated gene with T2D to date, is strongly associated with LADA, a disorder considered by the World Health Organization to be a slowly progressing form of T1D. In this review, we address recent advances in the genetics of T1D and T2D and how such discoveries have in turn shed some light on the genetics of LADA as being potentially at the "genetic intersection" of these two major diseases.

### Insulin secretion in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA): half way between type 1 and type 2 diabetes: action LADA 9 [^f7a0c00f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The study of endogenous insulin secretion may provide relevant insight into the comparison of the natural history of adult onset latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA) with types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to compare the results of the C-peptide response to mixed-meal stimulation in LADA patients with different disease durations and subjects with type 2 and adult-onset type 1 diabetes.

Methods

Stimulated C-peptide secretion was assessed using the mixed-meal tolerance test in patients with LADA (n = 32), type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 33) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 30). All patients were 30 to 70 years old at disease onset. The duration of diabetes in all groups ranged from 6 months to 10 years. The recruitment strategy was predefined to include at least 10 subjects in the following 3 disease onset categories for each group: 6 to 18 months, 19 months to 5 years and 5 to 10 years.

Results

At all time-points of the mixed-meal tolerance test, patients with LADA had a lower stimulated C-peptide response than the type 2 diabetes group and a higher response than the type 1 diabetes group. The same results were found when the peak or area under the C-peptide curve was measured. When the results were stratified by time since disease onset, a similar pattern of residual insulin secretory capacity was observed.

Conclusions

The present study shows that the magnitude of stimulated insulin secretion in LADA is intermediate between that of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes: comparative analysis of classical and latent presentation [^6c5db1d4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes (AID) is a complex and heterogeneous condition, whose main feature is the presence of serum diabetes-related autoantibodies. AID may present as a sudden onset of insulin deficiency, with symptoms and frequent ketosis, being the patient dependent on exogenous insulin just after the diagnosis-the so-called "classic type 1 diabetes mellitus" (T1DM). On the other hand, patients may present with slowly progressive insulin deficiency, variable levels of insulin resistance and often do not require insulin treatment for a considerable period after diagnosis-the so-called "latent autoimmune diabetes in adults" (LADA). According to the Immunology of Diabetes Society (IDS), LADA diagnosis is based on three criteria: a minimal age of 30 years at diabetes onset, the presence of circulating islet autoantibodies and lack of insulin requirement for at least 6 months after diagnosis.

Although LADA and T1DM share common genetic and immune characteristics, LADA patients also seem to match some features of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), like being often overweight/obese, physically inactive and having other criteria for the metabolic syndrome, which leads to insulin resistance. In fact, both autoimmunity and insulin resistance play important roles in the pathogenesis of LADA and, depending on the predominant factor, the phenotype will be more T1DM-like or T2DM-like.

The purpose of this study is to characterize patients with AID, comparing classic T1DM and LADA in what concerns to clinical presentation, metabolic control, pharmacologic treatment and diabetic complications.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^64a9f5c9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) — classification cautions and testing strategy note that the use of the term LADA is common and acceptable in clinical practice and has the practical impact of heightening awareness of a population of adults likely to have progressive autoimmune β-cell destruction, thus accelerating insulin initiation prior to deterioration of glucose management or development of DKA; however, application of only a single imperfect autoantibody test for determining LADA classification may lead to misclassification of some individuals with type 2 diabetes; diagnostic accuracy may be improved by using higher-specificity tests, using confirmatory testing for other autoantibodies, and restricting testing to those with clinical features suggestive of autoimmune diabetes.

### First genome-wide association study of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults reveals novel insights linking immune and metabolic diabetes [^4b73a950]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) shares clinical features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes; however, there is ongoing debate regarding the precise definition of LADA. Understanding its genetic basis is one potential strategy to gain insight into appropriate classification of this diabetes subtype.

Research Design and Methods

We performed the first genome-wide association study of LADA in case subjects of European ancestry versus population control subjects (n = 2,634 vs. 5,947) and compared against both case subjects with type 1 diabetes (n = 2,454 vs. 968) and type 2 diabetes (n = 2,779 vs. 10,396).

Results

The leading genetic signals were principally shared with type 1 diabetes, although we observed positive genetic correlations genome-wide with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we observed a novel independent signal at the known type 1 diabetes locus harboring PFKFB3, encoding a regulator of glycolysis and insulin signaling in type 2 diabetes and inflammation and autophagy in autoimmune disease, as well as an attenuation of key type 1-associated HLA haplotype frequencies in LADA, suggesting that these are factors that distinguish childhood-onset type 1 diabetes from adult autoimmune diabetes.

Conclusions

Our results support the need for further investigations of the genetic factors that distinguish forms of autoimmune diabetes as well as more precise classification strategies.

### The islet autoantibody titres: their clinical relevance in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and the classification of diabetes mellitus [^25aecaa3]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in the adult (LADA) is a slowly progressive form of autoimmune diabetes, characterized by diabetes-associated autoantibody positivity. A recent hypothesis proposes that LADA consists of a heterogeneous population, wherein several subgroups can be identified based on their autoimmune status. A systematic review of the literature was carried out to appraise whether the clinical characteristics of LADA patients correlate with the titre and numbers of diabetes-associated autoantibodies. We found that the simultaneous presence of multiple autoantibodies and/or a high-titre anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) — compared with single and low-titre autoantibody — is associated with an early age of onset, low fasting C-peptide values as a marker of reduced pancreatic B-cell function, a high predictive value for future insulin requirement, the presence of other autoimmune disorders, a low prevalence of markers of the metabolic syndrome including high body mass index, hypertension and dyslipidaemia, and a high prevalence of the genotype known to increase the risk of Type 1 diabetes. We propose a more continuous classification of diabetes mellitus, based on the finding that the clinical characteristics gradually change from classic Type 1 diabetes to LADA and finally to Type 2 diabetes. Future studies should focus on determining optimal cut-off points of anti-GAD for differentiating clinically relevant diabetes mellitus subgroups.

### A clinical screening tool identifies autoimmune diabetes in adults [^1fbfcac3]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is defined as adult-onset diabetes with circulating islet antibodies but not requiring insulin therapy initially. Diagnosing LADA has treatment implications because of the high risk of progression to insulin dependency. Currently, there are no recommendations for islet antibody testing in adult-onset diabetes. In this study, we aimed to develop a clinical screening tool to identify adults at high risk of LADA who require islet antibody testing.

Research Design and Methods

Subjects with LADA (n = 102, GAD antibody [GADA]+) and type 2 diabetes (n = 111, GADA-) (aged 30–75 years) were interviewed retrospectively. The clinical features documented were age of onset, acute symptoms of hyperglycemia, BMI, and personal and family history of autoimmune disease. Any clinical feature that was significantly more frequent in LADA was designated as a distinguishing clinical feature. In each subject, a "LADA clinical risk score", based on the total number of distinguishing features, was calculated. A prospective study of adults with newly diagnosed diabetes (n = 130) was used to determine whether the LADA clinical risk score could identify LADA.

Results

In the retrospective study, five clinical features were more frequent in LADA compared with type 2 diabetes at diagnosis: 1) age of onset < 50 years (P < 0.0001), 2) acute symptoms (P < 0.0001), 3) BMI < 25 kg/m2 (P = 0.0004), 4) personal history of autoimmune disease (P = 0.011), and 5) family history of autoimmune disease (P = 0.024). In the prospective study, the presence of at least two of these distinguishing clinical features (LADA clinical risk score ≥ 2) had a 90% sensitivity and 71% specificity for identifying LADA and a negative predictive value for a LADA clinical risk score ≤ 1 of 99%.

Conclusions

At least two distinguishing clinical features are found in a majority of patients with LADA at diagnosis and can be used to identify adults with diabetes at higher risk for LADA.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult: current knowledge and uncertainty [^7e228f73]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

How does adult-onset autoimmune diabetes differ from Type 2 diabetes?

Epidemiology

Around 4–14% of patients classified with Type 2 diabetes have DAA (Table 2 and Fig. 1) The frequency of GADA-positive Type 2 diabetes is high in studies from northern Europe (7–14% with decreasing prevalence by increasing patient age)–. It appears to be lower in southern Europe, Asia and North America (4–6%)–and, within China, lower in the south than the north. The frequency of DAA positivity is higher in hospital settings than from a population-based ascertainment. These discrepancies are dependent on biases including: selection criteria, patient age at diagnosis, assays and disease duration at study entry. In the Action LADA 7 study in which adult patients with diabetes were tested, autoimmune diabetes was prevalent and those initially non-insulin-requiring for six months (i.e. LADA) were far more frequent than those requiring insulin treatment within a month of diagnosis (i.e. 'classic' Type 1 diabetes; odds ratio 3.3). By implication, adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, including LADA, is more prevalent than childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes in Europe. In China, where childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes is rare, the frequency of LADA was found to be comparable with that in Europe.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults differs genetically from classical type 1 diabetes diagnosed after the age of 35 years [^ab6b6b5b]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) have a progressive insulin secretion defect, have less evidence of metabolic syndrome than type 2 patients, and share a genetic predisposition with both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Whether LADA merely represents older-onset type 1 diabetes or is a distinct subgroup has been debated, but studies comparing LADA with classical type 1 diabetes in a comparative age-range are lacking. We investigated 1) whether LADA differed genetically (with respect to genes associated with risk of type 1 diabetes: HLA-DQB1, PTPN22, INS, and CTLA4) and phenotypically (with respect to metabolic syndrome) from type 1 diabetes diagnosed after age 35 years; and 2) whether the observed clinical heterogeneity within LADA depended on GAD antibody (GADA) levels and type 1 diabetes susceptibility genotypes.

### Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes in Europe is prevalent with a broad clinical phenotype: action LADA 7 [^a42a94ed]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which insulin deficiency results from immune-mediated destruction of insulin-secreting islet cells. Type 1 diabetes was formerly called insulin-dependent diabetes, reflecting the severity of the destructive process and the requirement for insulin therapy in all cases. The majority of patients with type 1 diabetes have autoantibodies in their peripheral blood, and these autoantibodies can predict the future onset of the disease. Autoimmune diabetes is characterized by specific autoantibodies such as GAD autoantibodies (GADA), insulinoma-associated antigen-2 autoantibodies (IA-2A) or zinc-transporter 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8A). Type 1 diabetes is the most prevalent form of diabetes in children but also occurs in adults. A proportion of patients with adult-onset initially non–insulin-requiring diabetes have diabetes-associated autoantibodies and are thought to have a form of autoimmune diabetes called latent autoimmune diabetes of adult onset (LADA). Descriptions of the proportions of LADA patients in clinical case series vary, in part through selection biases such as ascertainment of nonobese cases, insulin-naïve cases, or treatment-naïve cases or the inclusion of impaired glucose tolerance. These studies have established that patients with autoimmune diabetes, as characterized by the presence of GADAs, have a clinical phenotype distinct from initially non–insulin-requiring diabetic patients without GADAs who are mostly designated as type 2 diabetic. There are no studies of the relative frequency of type 1 diabetes and LADA in adults.

The key uncertainty regarding adult-onset diabetic patients is whether LADA is distinct from type 1 diabetes or more common. Furthermore, it is as yet unclear which factors are associated with progression toward insulin therapy in adult-onset autoimmune diabetes. Action LADA is a European study that seeks to address these questions by ascertaining adult-onset diabetic patients presenting to nine European hospital-based clinics (some recruiting from a community of primary care settings; see below) within a defined period. We hypothesized that autoimmune diabetes would be prevalent in Europe, that LADA would be more prevalent than type 1 diabetes, and that these two would show phenotypic differences. Furthermore, we predicted that GADA could detect most cases of autoimmune diabetes.

### Predicting adult-onset autoimmune diabetes: clarity from complexity [^24794cd4]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

From the earliest years it was apparent that childhood diabetes was not always insulin dependent and vice versa. A revised classification of type 1 diabetes recognized as much when it excluded the term insulin dependent, thereby also excluding two features, ketoacidosis and insulin therapy, which were previously regarded as categorical features of this disease. Further complexity ensued with the recognition that a proportion of patients with ketosis-prone diabetes can stop insulin therapy, whereas 5–10% of adult-onset noninsulin-requiring diabetic patients have diabetes-associated autoantibodies. Indeed, adult-onset autoimmune diabetes is only one form of a broad spectrum of autoimmune diabetes, whether viewed genetically, immunologically, metabolically, or clinically (Fig. 1). When viewed genetically, MHC susceptibility, typical of autoimmune diabetes, is less striking in adulthood. From the immunological perspective, autoimmune diabetes is characterized by autoantibodies, although their number in a given subject declines with increasing age at onset. Metabolically, insulin secretory loss, but not insensitivity, is less pronounced in adulthood. From the clinical aspect, noninsulin-requiring autoimmune diabetes is most prevalent in adulthood. Adult autoimmune diabetic patients who are initially noninsulin requiring have latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA), which is latent because without testing for diabetes-associated autoantibodies patients masquerade clinically as having type 2 diabetes. Other acronyms include slowly progressing insulin-dependent diabetes (SPIDM) or type 1.5 diabetes. Clinicians, in reality, still use their clinical nose to identify type 1a diabetes without routinely checking for autoantibodies, e.g. those for GAD (GADA). But, in maintaining a clinical rather than an immunogenetic definition, something is lost. It follows that the best way to identify autoimmune diabetes is to assess diabetes-associated autoantibodies, which represent the only relevant categorical trait.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) in Asian and European populations [^42252e17]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder caused by relative or absolute insulin deficiency and characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia. It is expected that by year 2025, 80% of all type 2 diabetic patients will be living in developing or low- and middle-income countries. Among Asians, there has been an overall increase in abdominal obesity; however, the risk of diabetes in these populations starts at much lower body mass index as compared to Caucasians. A significant proportion of diabetic patients with adult-onset, initially nonrequiring insulin treatment, have diabetes-associated autoantibodies in their sera. A new subclass of diabetes with the designation of latent autoimmune diabetes of adult-onset (LADA) has been proposed for this category of subjects. Studies have demonstrated that patients with autoimmune diabetes, characterized by the presence of glutamic decarboxylase autoantibodies display a different clinical phenotype from classical type 2 diabetes without glutamic decarboxylase autoantibodies. This subset of phenotypic type 2 diabetes subjects with islet autoantibodies tend to have sulphonylurea failure and need insulin treatment earlier in the disease process. Diagnosing LADA at an initial stage will be important so that insulin can be initiated earlier, facilitating improved glycemic control sooner as well as the preservation of residual beta-cell function in adult-onset autoimmune diabetes. Because of differences in dietary habits, environmental factors, and phenotypic characteristics between European and Asian populations, there may be heterogeneity in the prevalence and other characteristics of LADA in these two populations.

### GAD antibody positivity predicts type 2 diabetes in an adult population [^6801202a]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) was introduced nearly 2 decades ago to separate a GAD antibody (GADA)-positive subgroup of adult patients initially diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Using this definition with the add-on criteria of no exogenous insulin during the first 6–12 months, the prevalence of LADA among unselected "type 2 diabetic patients" is ∼25% in subjects younger than 35 years and between 4 and 13% in subjects older than 35 years at diagnosis in populations of European origin. In follow-up studies, a progressive defect in insulin secretion was observed in ∼50–60% of LADA patients within 6–10 years, which led to the inclusion of these patients as a slowly progressing form of type 1 diabetes in the last World Health Organization (WHO) classification of diabetes. However, both the existence of LADA as a distinct subgroup of diabetes and the criteria that should be used to diagnose it have been challenged (e.g. The LADA group is heterogeneous, and most studies have been cross-sectional, whereas prospective studies including patients at or before diagnosis and population-based studies are few (,–). Genetic background, especially for type 1 diabetes, may be a confounding factor, and we have shown that LADA was more frequent in families with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes than in families with type 2 diabetes only. Moreover, some data support that type 1 and type 2 diabetes cluster in same families, although this has been contradicted in a large U.K. study on parents of type 1 diabetic patients.

In children, progression to diabetes has been associated with high antibody levels and early development of multiple autoantibodies, whereas subjects with a later appearance of antibodies had a slower progression. We have previously hypothesized that GADAs would be a marker of a subclinical autoimmune process and showed that GADA positivity was associated with a decrease in maximal insulin secretory capacity in nondiabetic subjects. If that is the case, GADAs should also be a predictor of future diabetes in adults. This was not supported by two studies on the general population, but a Swedish study reported a sixfold increased risk for diabetes in GADA + subjects.

In a prospective follow-up study of a large cohort of relatives of type 2 diabetic patients and population control subjects from Finland, we have now evaluated the predictive value of GADAs and family history for type 1 or type 2 diabetes in conjunction with the traditional risk factors for diabetes.

### Prognosis and outcome of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: T1DM or T2DM? [^fff9f164]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

LADA has its characteristics at all stages, however, individual differences and clinician confirmation are required at some stage of the disease. As Sinead Brophy contends that clinical symptoms and GADA testing, rather than time to insulin, should be used to identify people with LADA. Several cross-sectional studies have shown that GADA titers are associated with phenotypic heterogeneity of clinical characteristics in LADA. Analysis of GADA titers reveals a bimodal distribution: high GADA titers (> 32 arbitrary units) and low GADA titers (≤ 32 arbitrary units), which correspond to distinct clinical, immunological, and genetic features (Table 2) and (Fig. 1).

### Relative contribution of type 1 and type 2 diabetes loci to the genetic etiology of adult-onset, non-insulin-requiring autoimmune diabetes [^26067963]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a heterogeneous group of diseases resulting in hyperglycemia due to insulin secretory dysfunction as well as insulin resistance. A substantial proportion of type 1 diabetes (T1D) cases present in adulthood, and despite the presence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies, the majority of these patients do not initially require insulin. The manifestation of this 'latent autoimmune diabetes in adulthood' (LADA) is clinically defined by (1) an adult age of onset, (2) at least one diabetes-associated autoantibody, and (3) the lack of requisite insulin treatment for at least 6 months after diagnosis. This definition overall represents approximately 5–10% of all cases of adult-onset diabetes, potentially the most frequent form of autoimmune diabetes.

However, classifying adult-onset autoimmune T1D, including LADA, remains challenging. The need for insulin treatment is a clinical decision, while diabetes-associated autoantibodies are neither pathogenic nor categorical features of LADA. Decisions are further confounded by false positives when large numbers of patients are screened. Since LADA has intermediate features between T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D), there are limits to the current classification of diabetes. New paradigms are needed to distinguish LADA and ensure appropriate disease treatment and management.

Recently, several studies have used genetic information derived from diabetes-associated risk variants across the genome to reclassify diabetes. To date, comprehensive genetic studies of T1D and T2D have uncovered dozens of distinct susceptibility loci for each of these two diseases. Initial analyses of T1D loci in relatively small LADA cohorts have consistently shown an association with the T1D locus HLA-DQB1, which resides in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), as well as at PTPN22 and INS. Similar analyses of T2D loci have suggested an association in LADA with the strongest T2D locus harboring TCF7L2 and the ZMIZ1 locus. A significant challenge of these studies has been the lack of statistical power due to the small number of LADA patients included. Thus, the genetic etiology of LADA remains largely unresolved.

To quantify the genetic liability to LADA contributed by genetic risk factors for T1D and T2D, we amassed the largest LADA cohort to date. By assessing the association of these variants in LADA, our objective was to place LADA along the etiological diabetes spectrum and reshape our understanding of the relationship between LADA and classic diabetes phenotypes.

### Autoimmune diabetes in adults: lessons from the UKPDS [^adb046ac]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is characterised by a relatively mild diabetes onset, autoantibody positivity and eventual requirement for insulin therapy. Twelve per cent of newly diagnosed, UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) patients were positive for autoantibodies to GAD65 (GADA) and/or insulinoma-associated antigen-2A (IA-2A) and managed as if they had Type 2 diabetes according to the UKPDS protocol. Here, we compare data from UKPDS LADA patients with that from other cohorts. In common with other groups, UKPDS LADA patients required insulin therapy earlier post-diagnosis than non-LADA patients. Reduction of islet function was similar in UKPDS LADA groups randomised to oral glucose-lowering agents or insulin replacement therapy, contesting the current hypothesis of reduced decline of insulin secretion in LADA by immediate insulin therapy. Disease progression was not predicted by post-diagnosis GADA levels or epitope specificities as has been suggested. Slowly progressing insulitis and pancreatic beta-cell loss at post-mortem are consistent with sustained retention of residual C-peptide secretion in LADA. Genetic association patterns at the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and insulin gene (INS) regions are similar in UKPDS LADA patients and individuals with adult and childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes. The combined evidence suggests that LADA is an adult-onset form of Type 1 diabetes, rather than a separate condition or an intermediate state in a continuum of phenotype from Type 1 to Type 2 diabetes.

### Insulin secretion in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA): half way between type 1 and type 2 diabetes: action LADA 9 [^ca8cac4e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The increased frequency of insulin treatment in adult patients with latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA) is a result of an accelerated pancreatic beta-cell loss due to autoimmune damage. The measurement of the endogenous insulin secretion may provide relevant insight into the comparison of the natural history of LADA with the natural histories of types 1 and 2 diabetes; however, limited data are available regarding fasting or stimulated C-peptide secretion in LADA. Stimulated C-peptide is currently accepted as the reference outcome for assessing beta-cell secretory response in trials studying the prevention of beta-cell loss in established autoimmune diabetes. In addition, no studies have assessed the insulin secretory response using the standardised mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) in patients with LADA. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the stimulated C-peptide response in LADA patients with different disease durations and to compare the results to those of subjects with type 2 and adult-onset type 1 diabetes.

2. Screening.

Only about 15% of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes have a first-degree relative with the disease. The risk of developing type 1 diabetes in relatives of patients with the disease is approximately 5%, which is 15-fold higher than the risk in the general population (1 in 250–300 lifetime risk). Screening relatives of type 1 diabetic patients for islet cell autoantibodies can identify those at high risk for the disease; however, as many as 1%–2% of healthy individuals have a single autoantibody against insulin, IA-2, GAD65, or ZnT8 and are at low risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Because of the low prevalence of type 1 diabetes (approximately 0.3% in the general population), the positive predictive value of a single islet cell autoantibody will be low. The presence of multiple islet cell autoantibodies (IAA, GAD65A, IA-2A/IA-2βA, or ZnT8A) is associated with a > 90% risk of type 1 diabetes; however, until cost-effective screening strategies can be developed for young children and until effective intervention therapy to prevent or delay the onset of the disease becomes available, such testing cannot be recommended outside of a research setting.

Children with certain HLA-DR and/or HLA-DQB1 chains (*0602/*0603/*0301) are mostly protected from type 1 diabetes, but not from developing islet cell autoantibodies. Because islet cell autoantibodies in these individuals have substantially reduced predictive significance, they are often excluded from prevention trials.

Approximately 5%–10% of adult Caucasian patients who present with a type 2 diabetes phenotype also have islet cell autoantibodies, particularly GAD65A, which predict insulin dependency. This condition has been termed "latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood" (LADA), "type 1.5 diabetes", or "slowly progressive IDDM". Although GAD65A-positive diabetic patients progress faster to absolute insulinopenia than do antibody-negative patients, many antibody-negative (type 2) diabetic adults also progress (albeit more slowly) to insulin dependency with time. Some of these patients may show T-cell reactivity to islet cell components. Islet cell autoantibody testing in patients with type 2 diabetes has limited utility, because the institution of insulin therapy is based on glucose control.

RECOMMENDATION: THERE IS CURRENTLY NO ROLE FOR MEASUREMENT OF ISLET CELL AUTOANTIBODIES IN THE MONITORING OF PATIENTS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. ISLET CELL AUTOANTIBODIES ARE MEASURED IN RESEARCH PROTOCOLS AND IN SOME CLINICAL TRIALS AS SURROGATE END POINTS B (low).

### Prevalence and factors associated with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA): a cross-sectional study [^9d2dbf34]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

The LADA patients may present with clinical features like those found in T2D, but they require insulin treatment in prolonged management. There is limited evidence in developing countries, including Tanzania, concerning the outcome and complications of this subgroup of diabetes. Inappropriate diagnosis and mismanagement of the LADA can increase the risk of complications such as Coronary Heart Disease, Retinopathy, Nephropathy, Neuropathy, and Diabetics Mellitus (D.M.) foot which affect the management of quality of life, increase the cost of treatment, and may consequently result into death.

Pending the absence of universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of LADA, the study aimed to address the classification of the LADA, using antibodies to GAD to exploit potential improvement in diagnosis, treatment choices, and management of diabetes. Furthermore, the study assessed the prevalence of LADA and its associated factors among patients with established Type-2 diabetes, which is reported in this manuscript.

### Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes: comparative analysis of classical and latent presentation [^c1081d53]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes (AID) has two different phenotypes: classic type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), with insulin requirement just after diagnosis, and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). The purpose of this study is to characterize patients with AID followed on a tertiary centre, comparing classic T1DM and LADA.

Methods

We collected data from patients with diabetes and positive islet autoantibodies, aged 30 years old and over at diagnosis. Patients who started insulin in the first 6 months were classified as T1DM and patients with no insulin requirements in the first 6 months were classified as LADA. Data regarding clinical presentation, autoantibodies, A1C and C-peptide at diagnosis, pharmacologic treatment and complications were analysed.

Results

We included 92 patients, 46 with classic T1DM and 46 with LADA. The percentage of females was 50% in T1DM group and 52.1% in LADA group. The median age at diagnosis was 38 years (IQR-15) for T1DM and 42 years (IQR-15) for LADA (p = 0.057). The median time between diagnosis of diabetes and diagnosis of autoimmune aetiology was 0 months in T1DM group and 60 months in LADA group (p < 0.001). The mean BMI at diagnosis was 24.1 kg/m 2 in T1DM group and 26.1 kg/m 2 in LADA group (p = 0.042). In T1DM group, 67.4% of the patients had more than one positive autoantibody, comparing to 41.3% of LADA patients (p = 0.012). There was no statistical difference in what concerns to title of GAD autoantibodies, A1C and C-peptide at diagnosis of autoimmune aetiology. The presence of symptoms at diagnosis was associated with T1DM group (p < 0.001). The median daily insulin dose was 40 IU for T1DM (0.58 IU/kg) and 33.5 IU for LADA (0.57 IU/kg), with no statistical difference. LADA patients were more often under non-insulin antidiabetic drugs (p = 0.001). At 10 years follow up, 21.1% of T1DM patients and 63.3% of LADA patients had microvascular complications (p = 0.004). Diabetic nephropathy was present in 23.5% of T1DM patients and 53.3% of LADA patients (p = 0.047). At the last evaluation, 55.6% of T1DM and 82.6% of LADA patients had metabolic syndrome and this difference was independent of diabetes duration.

Conclusion

Patients with classic T1DM presented more often with symptoms, lower BMI and higher number of autoantibodies, which may be related to a more aggressive autoimmune process. Patients with LADA developed more frequently microvascular complications for the same disease duration, namely diabetic nephropathy, and had more often metabolic syndrome.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f2f336e8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

### All-cause mortality and cardiovascular and microvascular diseases in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^c7bf697a]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a heterogenous, slowly progressing autoimmune diabetes. We aim to contribute new knowledge on the long-term prognosis of LADA with varying degrees of autoimmunity by comparing it to type 2 diabetes and adult-onset type 1 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This Swedish population-based study included newly diagnosed LADA (n = 550, stratified into LADAlow and LADAhigh by median autoimmunity level), type 2 diabetes (n = 2,001), adult-onset type 1 diabetes (n = 1,573), and control subjects without diabetes (n = 2,355) in 2007–2019. Register linkages provided information on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and clinical characteristics during follow-up.

Results

Mortality was higher in LADA (hazard ratio [HR] 1.44; 95% CI 1.03, 2.02), type 1 (2.31 [1.75, 3.05]), and type 2 diabetes (1.31 [1.03, 1.67]) than in control subjects. CVD incidence was elevated in LADAhigh (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.04, 2.69) and type 2 diabetes (1.53 [1.17, 2.00]), but not in LADAlow or type 1 diabetes. Incidence of retinopathy but not nephropathy was higher in LADA (HR 2.25; 95% CI 1.64, 3.09), including LADAhigh and LADAlow than in type 2 diabetes (unavailable in type 1 diabetes). More favorable blood pressure and lipid profiles, but higher HbA1c levels, were seen in LADA than type 2 diabetes at baseline and throughout follow-up, especially in LADAhigh, which resembled type 1 diabetes in this respect.

Conclusions

Despite having fewer metabolic risk factors than type 2 diabetes, LADA has equal to higher risks of death, CVD, and retinopathy. Poorer glycemic control, particularly in LADAhigh, highlights the need for improved LADA management.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult: current knowledge and uncertainty [^a0387664]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical features

At diagnosis, the clinical phenotype in patients with autoimmune diabetes is remarkably broad, ranging from diabetic ketoacidosis to diabetes that can be controlled with diet alone. The classification of these patients also covers a range that can appear arbitrary; for example, in the European Action LADA study, patients with GADA and started on insulin within one month of diagnosis were designated classic Type 1 diabetes, those started on insulin within six months were unclassified and those started on insulin at six months or later were designated LADA. By comparison with those with Type 2 diabetes, patients with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, even when non-insulin requiring (LADA), tend to have a lower age at diabetes onset, lower BMI and waist-to-hip ratio, but a more pronounced loss of C–peptide and an increased likelihood of insulin treatment. Substantial heterogeneity is also observed within patients who are GADA positive. Phenotypically, high-titre GADA patients tend to have these same characteristics, but these are more marked and more similar to classic Type 1 diabetes, patients being younger at diagnosis, leaner with a high risk of progression to insulin treatment. Low-titre GADA patients are phenotypically more similar to those with Type 2 diabetes. These differences are also captured by the metabolic syndrome, which is more prevalent in Type 2 diabetes than Type 1 diabetes and LADA, and more prevalent in low-titre than high-titre GADA patients. Because high-titre GADA tends to be associated with multiple DAA, it is not surprising that the NIRAD study found that among patients with adult-onset diabetes, the more DAA were detected the more these patients needed insulin treatment and had younger age at onset. However, there is sufficient overlap for these clinical parameters between groups of patients to make it impossible to accurately distinguish adult-onset autoimmune diabetes from Type 2 diabetes on clinical features alone when considering individual patients.

Summary: knowledge and uncertainty

There are no clear clinical features that distinguish autoimmune diabetes from Type 2 diabetes. However, there is a tendency for adult patients with GADA, even when non-insulin requiring, to be younger at diagnosis and leaner with a greater tendency to progress to insulin treatment. Within a cohort of GADA-positive adult patients, the GADA titre and the number of DAA impact the clinical and biochemical differences from Type 2 diabetes. Clinical phenotype should drive management strategy.

### Associations between clinical characteristics and chronic complications in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and type 2 diabetes [^30896fa2]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to assess the associations between clinical characteristics and chronic complications in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This is a retrospective study. Our diabetes registry included 6975 patients aged 30–75 years old with phenotypic type 2 diabetes who underwent islet autoantibody screening between 2003 and 2012; 384 patients were identified to have LADA. Rates of chronic complications for LADA and type 2 diabetes were compared using a 1:2 matched design. Logistic models were fitted to identify the presence of chronic diabetic complications using clinical characteristics including gender, age, duration of diabetes, glycemic control and metabolic syndrome.

Results

When duration of diabetes is < 5 years, the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy (nephropathy; 12.2% versus 21.8%, p = 0.018) and diabetic retinopathy (retinopathy; 8.1% versus 15.9%, p = 0.011) were significantly lower in patients with LADA than in patients with type 2 diabetes; the prevalence of nephropathy and retinopathy were comparable between both groups when duration is ≥ 5 years. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of macrovascular complications between groups. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves based on the nephropathy and retinopathy models were larger for LADA than for type 2 diabetes (0.72 versus 0.61, p = 0.013; 0.76 versus 0.68, p = 0.056).

Conclusions

Patients with LADA had a lower prevalence of microvascular complications than patients with type 2 diabetes when the duration of diabetes was < 5 years. Regression equation fitted by clinical characteristics can better predict the risk of microvascular complications in LADA than in type 2 diabetes.

### Beta-cell protection and therapy for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^f5c8cc65]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

DEFINITION AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Obviously, an important impediment in establishing adequate and effective management strategies is the lack of a good understanding of the disease development and of a clear definition. Difficulties reside from the fact that LADA has features of an autoimmune disease (mainly presence of autoantibodies at onset), with many genetic, immune, and metabolic features of type 1 diabetes, but also shares some clinical, anthropometric, and metabolic traits with type 2 diabetes (Table 1). As a matter of fact, LADA was first identified in a subset of phenotypic type 2 diabetes individuals who were positive for islet cells antibodies (ICAs), failed sulfonylurea therapy, and needed insulin replacement earlier than the ICA-negative patients, a finding subsequently confirmed by other groups.

Table 1
Clinical and paraclinical features of LADA in comparison to type 1 and type 2 diabetes

Various studies have used different inclusion criteria and markers for disease definition, and thus drawing conclusions is difficult. In the attempt to standardize the diagnosis of LADA, three criteria are currently recommended, but all of them have some pitfalls: criteria 1 and 3 are not categorical traits and are highly dependent on physicians' decisions, and criterion 2 is not specific for LADA.

Criterion 1: adult age at onset

Various cutoff ages have arbitrarily been used (between 25 and 45 years), but the proposed lower limit is now 30 years of age. Nevertheless, since adulthood starts earlier in life, this limit might not be all inclusive.

Criterion 2: presence of circulating islet autoantibodies (at least one)

Because autoantibodies to insulin (IAA) and tyrosine phosphatase-like insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA2) have been reported to be rather infrequent, the diagnosis basically relies on identifying glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADAs), which is the best single marker for screening. Epitope specificity, antibody levels, and concomitant presence of ICAs discriminate two subcategories of LADA with a different risk toward insulin dependency. Obviously, to ascertain an accurate immune profile of LADA, further investigations should be performed.

### Prognosis and outcome of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: T1DM or T2DM? [^3f47c0bc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

LADA genetically overlaps with T1DM and T2DM and is influenced by immune factors, which may lead to islet cell damage and different degrees of insulin resistance, showing intermediate characteristics between T1DM and T2DM. Genomic association studies have confirmed that the genetic characteristics of LADA are mostly similar to those of typical T1DM and more characteristic of T1DM.

Although similar to the clinical presentation of T2DM at initial diagnosis, differences between them become progressively apparent as diabetes progresses. Therefore, the detection of islet cell autoantibodies is necessary, although not specific, combining Electrochemiluminescence assay and C-peptide level helps to identify T2DM and predict the progression of insulin dependence in LADA and improve the therapeutic effect of LADA. At the same time, LADA is associated with a high risk of other autoimmune diseases, and the detection of thyroid-associated antibodies may be considered when detecting islet autoantibodies.

The treatment of LADA is another difficult problem, due to the specificity of LADA, without specific treatment strategies, it is necessary to develop a personalized treatment plan in combination with the clinical characteristics and biochemical parameters of each patient, to control blood glucose, aim to protect β-cell function and reduce the occurrence of diabetic complications. In therapeutic efficacy, exogenous insulin does not completely replace endogenous insulin. Studies have shown that early treatment with insulin delays the rate of β-cell damage in patients with LADA is beneficial for residual β-cell function, and reduces the severity of insulitis. In the long run, early insulin intervention in patients with LADA can help to improve their quality of life. The occurrence of diabetic complications is closely related to blood glucose control, and for patients with LADA, more attention should be paid to their blood glucose control. Multiple groups of clinical studies have shown that DPP-4 inhibitors are beneficial in maintaining β-cell function and can be used as adjuvant therapy in LADA therapy. Further exploration of treatment strategies for LADA is required.

Nevertheless, despite its limitations, our study has the strength of comparing for the first time these three groups of diabetes, which come from a homogeneous population. While we use the term LADA throughout the text for clarity, we would prefer that LADA is called adult-onset autoimmune diabetes since there is no firm evidence that LADA can be categorically distinguished from type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes.

### Proper diagnosis of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults prompts appropriate pharmacotherapy; C-peptide is just one component [^5606694a]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) is a type of diabetes that can phenotypically resemble type 2 diabetes upon initial presentation but expresses the autoimmune component of type 1 diabetes. While technically classed as type 1 diabetes, LADA is distinct from type 1 and 2 diabetes because of its intermediate progression that may or may not lead to complete insulin dependence. Differentiation is made with the presence or absence of autoantibodies and C-peptide. This is demonstrated in the following case. A 29-year-old Black female with a history of gestational diabetes and two-year history of prediabetes was ultimately diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with an A1c of 6.6% and was treated with metformin 500 mg twice daily. Her blood glucose suddenly rose to > 400 mg/dL and A1c to 8.6% after 8 months of therapy. Her BMI was 22.45 kg/m 2. Her provider ordered a C-peptide which measured 1.3 ng/mL (normal 0.8–5.2 ng/mL). Since this was technically normal, the provider continued with the type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Recognizing the C-peptide was low-normal, the clinical pharmacist ordered autoantibody tests, discovering a positive glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) > 250 IU/mL (normal < 0.0–5.0 IU/mL) and confirming the diagnosis of LADA. The pharmacist discontinued metformin and initiated a basal/bolus insulin regimen with titration. Autoantibody testing is crucial to determine the proper diagnosis when the C-peptide is low-normal and should be prioritized. Recognition of the signs of LADA and proper diagnostic testing can lead to earlier optimal treatment and prevention of diabetes complications.

### Randomized, controlled, parallel-group prospective study to investigate the clinical effectiveness of early insulin treatment in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^851faa9a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [LADA] is a type 1 diabetes that is slowly developing. This means many people are treated as having type 2 diabetes at diagnosis as they are adults who are not immediately insulin dependent. LADA can be distinguished from type 2 diabetes by antibody tests. Patients who are antibody positive have an autoimmune reaction which is similar to that of type 1 diabetes and is not found in type 2 diabetes. We would like to examine the best way of treating LADA in the early phase of the conditions, with tablets (similar to type 2 diabetes) or with insulin (similar to type 1 diabetes).

Methods/Design

This is an open parallel group prospective randomised trial. Participants need to have a GAD antibody test results of 101 WHO units or more and a diagnosis of diabetes not requiring insulin at diagnosis. Participants will need to have been diagnosed within 12 months and not treated with insulin at study entry. They will be randomised to receive either insulin (NovoMix 30) or tablets (diet treated followed by metformin followed by glitazone (with or without metformin) followed by insulin). Primary outcome assessment will be for change in HbA1c and change in fasting C-peptide over 24 months. Secondary outcome measures will include Quality of life, GAD antibody levels, adverse events, inflammatory markers, insulin resistance, and markers of the metabolic syndrome.

Discussion

This study seeks the best treatment for early LADA in terms of maintaining glycaemic control and maintaining natural insulin production.

### Time-varying risk of microvascular complications in latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood compared with type 2 diabetes in adults: a post-hoc analysis of the UK prospective diabetes study 30-year follow-up data (UKPDS 86) [^5f7ec355]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA) differs in clinical features from type 2 diabetes. Whether this difference translates into different risks of complications remains controversial. We examined the long-term risk of microvascular complications in people enrolled in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), according to their diabetes autoimmunity status.

Methods

We did a post-hoc analysis of 30-year follow-up data from UKPDS (UKPDS 86). UKPDS participants with diabetes autoantibody measurements available and without previous microvascular events were included. Participants with at least one detectable autoantibody were identified as having latent autoimmune diabetes, and those who tested negative for all autoantibodies were identified as having type 2 diabetes. The incidence of the primary composite microvascular outcome (first occurrence of renal failure, renal death, blindness, vitreous haemorrhage, or retinal photocoagulation) was compared between adults with latent autoimmune diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes. The follow-up ended on Sept 30, 2007. Baseline and updated 9-year mean values of potential confounders were tested in Cox models to adjust hazard ratios (HRs). UKPDS is registered at the ISRCTN registry, 75451837.

Findings

Among the 5028 participants included, 564 had latent autoimmune diabetes and 4464 had type 2 diabetes. After median 17·3 years (IQR 12·6–20·7) of follow-up, the composite microvascular outcome occurred in 1041 (21%) participants. The incidence for the composite microvascular outcome was 15·8 (95% CI 13·4–18·7) per 1000 person-years in latent autoimmune diabetes and 14·2 (13·3–15·2) per 1000 person-years in type 2 diabetes. Adults with latent autoimmune diabetes had a lower risk of the composite outcome during the first 9 years of follow-up than those with type 2 diabetes (adjusted HR 0·45 [95% CI 0·30–0·68], p < 0·0001), whereas in subsequent years their risk was higher than for those with type 2 diabetes (1·25 [1·01–1·54], p = 0·047). Correcting for the higher updated 9-year mean HbA 1c seen in adults with latent autoimmune diabetes than in those with type 2 diabetes explained entirely their subsequent increased risk for the composite microvascular outcome (adjusted HR 0·99 [95% CI 0·80–1·23], p = 0·93).

Interpretation

At diabetes onset, adults with latent autoimmune diabetes have a lower risk of microvascular complications followed by a later higher risk of complications than do adults with type 2 diabetes, secondary to worse glycaemic control. Implementing strict glycaemic control from the time of diagnosis could reduce the later risk of microvascular complications in adults with latent autoimmune diabetes.

### Identification of a distinct phenotype of elderly latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: LADA China study 8 [^016e71c9]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) exhibits significant clinical heterogeneity, but the underlying causes remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether age of onset of LADA contributes to the observed clinical heterogeneity by comparing the clinical, metabolic, and immunogenetic characteristics between elderly and young LADA patients.

Methods

The cross-sectional study included a total of 579 patients with LADA which was further divided into elderly LADA (E-LADA) group (n = 135, age of onset ≥ 60 years) and young LADA (Y-LADA) group (n = 444, age of onset < 60 years). Age-matched subjects with type 2 diabetes were served as control (E-T2D group, n = 622). Clinical characteristics, serum autoantibodies, and HLA-DQ haplotypes were compared among these groups.

Results

Compared with patients with Y-LADA, patients with E-LADA have better residual beta-cell function and higher level of insulin resistance (both P < .01), more metabolic syndrome characteristics, similar proportion of islet autoantibody positivity, and strikingly different HLA-DQ genetic background. In comparison with E-T2D patients, E-LADA patients tend to have similar metabolic syndrome prevalence, comparable C-peptide levels, and insulin resistance levels and share similar HLA-DQ genetic characteristics.

Conclusions

Elderly LADA differs phenotypically and genetically from Y-LADA but has a clinical and genetic profile more similar to that of E-T2D. These distinct phenotypes could potentially help physicians better manage patients with E-LADA.

### Prevalence and factors associated with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA): a cross-sectional study [^b14b5ede]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The study has established the prevalence of LADA among type 2 diabetes patients attending selected health facilities in Dar es Salaam. The study has shown the role of GAD autoantibody in the screening for LADA among T2D. LADA may be associated with serious complications that threaten patients' quality of life which could have been avoided by proper diagnosis. This study has justified a need for recommending larger and different study designs to develop robust evidence on the association of risk factors and complications associated with the LADA.

### Frequency, immunogenetics, and clinical characteristics of latent autoimmune diabetes in China (LADA China study): a nationwide, multicenter, clinic-based cross-sectional study [^ebf856aa]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes is prevalent worldwide, and the epidemic of diabetes is global, not least in China. Among children, autoimmune diabetes, known as type 1 diabetes, is the most prevalent form of the disease. Much of our knowledge about type 1 diabetes comes from studies of children in Europe and North America. Childhood-onset type 1 diabetes in China is infrequent. However, autoimmune diabetes also occurs in adults, where it is characterized by an association with the same HLA genes linked to childhood-onset type 1 diabetes and by serum islet autoantibodies, most notably GAD autoantibodies (GADAs). Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) describes a form of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes that, at least initially, does not require insulin treatment. The immunogenetic and clinical characteristics of LADA have been extensively studied in Caucasians, although the relationship between LADA and the other two major forms of diabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, remains controversial. LADA could be distinct from type 1 and type 2 diabetes, while incorporating certain features of each or be part of a spectrum of autoimmune diabetes.

Immunological features

Adult-onset Type 1 autoimmune diabetes is characterized by less aggressive β–cell loss than childhood-onset autoimmune diabetes, less HLA-associated genetic susceptibility and fewer multiple autoantibodies.

Serum islet autoimmunity characterized by ICA in patients classified with Type 2 diabetes was first described in 1977. Several studies have compared autoantibodies in childhood- and adult-onset autoimmune diabetes. In general, ICA, IAA, IA–2 and ZnT8 were more frequent in childhood-onset than adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, whereas GADA and IA–2 256–760 were equally common. GADA is by far the most common autoantibody in adult-onset diabetes (90% of positive cases) even in China where GADA is less dominant. After diagnosis of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, autoantibodies tend to disappear, especially IA–2A and ZnT8A. However, GADA can still be detected in patients with apparent 'Type 2' diabetes some 12 years post diagnosis.

A bimodal distribution of GADA titres has been reported in several studies in patients with LADA diabetes, although formal analysis for bimodality has not been made–. Other studies did not find such a bimodal distribution. These apparent discrepancies may reflect differences in the character of LADA in different populations and certainly in China, the proportion of patients with high-titre GADA is lower than in Europe. Patients with high-titre GADA tend to have high-affinity GADA and it appears that the β cell loss is more rapid than in those with low-affinity GADA.

Data from the European Action LADA cohort (Action-LADA) showed that adult-onset autoimmune patients, whether they have 'classic' Type 1 diabetes or LADA, have similar changes in systemic cytokines, chemokines and adhesions molecules. A large Chinese study reported higher C–reactive protein and lower adiponectin in LADA compared with adult-onset Type 1 diabetes. In both Chinese and European populations, there was a hierarchy of differences in systemic inflammation (e.g. interleukin–6) such that serum levels were highest in Type 2 diabetes compared with autoimmune diabetes (whether LADA or 'classic' Type 1), and lowest in healthy controls.

### LADA: time for a new definition [^eaeaee29]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

In this issue of Diabetes, Zhou et al. report on the prevalence and characteristics of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) in China. Findings from this study underscore the profound need for a new definition of LADA.

LADA, a slowly progressive form of autoimmune diabetes that develops in adults and does not require insulin therapy for some time after diagnosis, was first described over 25 years ago. Subsequently, clinical, metabolic, immunological, and genetic characteristics that are unique to LADA have been identified. For example, relative to patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), those with LADA are more likely to be obese and have other elements of the metabolic syndrome. They are also more likely to retain greater β-cell function, express a single autoantibody (particularly GAD65) and certain GAD65 epitopes, and carry the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphism, which is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the rationale for the strict criteria that are most often used to define LADA, including age > 30 years at diagnosis and insulin independence for at least 6 months after diagnosis, have been questioned repeatedly. Furthermore, there is substantial heterogeneity in LADA, with some cases closely resembling T1D (e.g. low BMI, association with other autoimmune diseases), and others that share many features with T2D. Many authors and clinicians question the evidence base for defining LADA as a distinct entity and propose instead that LADA and childhood-onset T1D are opposing ends of the same continuum of autoimmune diabetes.

The multicenter study by Zhou et al. evaluated 4,880 subjects in China with diabetes diagnosed at age > 30 years, enrolled within 1 year of diagnosis, and who did not develop diabetic ketoacidosis or insulin dependence for at least 6 months after diagnosis. LADA was diagnosed in 5.9% of these patients based on GAD65 autoantibody positivity, and the rest were classified as T2D. In the south of China, compared with the north, LADA was more prevalent and was characterized by higher GAD65 titers and lower frequency of both metabolic syndrome and obesity. Relative to LADA patients with low GAD65 titers, those with high GAD65 titers were younger, had lower BMI, lower β-cell function, and higher frequency of T1D-associated HLA haplotypes. Thus, consistent with previous studies, LADA with high GAD65 titers resembled T1D in the current report.

### The time is right for a new classification system for diabetes: rationale and implications of the β-cell-centric classification schema [^8a530b2f]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The current classification system presents challenges to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), in part due to its conflicting and confounding definitions of type 1 DM, type 2 DM, and latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA). The current schema also lacks a foundation that readily incorporates advances in our understanding of the disease and its treatment. For appropriate and coherent therapy, we propose an alternate classification system. The β-cell-centric classification of DM is a new approach that obviates the inherent and unintended confusions of the current system. The β-cell-centric model presupposes that all DM originates from a final common denominator-the abnormal pancreatic β-cell. It recognizes that interactions between genetically predisposed β-cells with a number of factors, including insulin resistance (IR), susceptibility to environmental influences, and immune dysregulation/inflammation, lead to the range of hyperglycemic phenotypes within the spectrum of DM. Individually or in concert, and often self-perpetuating, these factors contribute to β-cell stress, dysfunction, or loss through at least 11 distinct pathways. Available, yet underutilized, treatments provide rational choices for personalized therapies that target the individual mediating pathways of hyperglycemia at work in any given patient, without the risk of drug-related hypoglycemia or weight gain or imposing further burden on the β-cells. This article issues an urgent call for the review of the current DM classification system toward the consensus on a new, more useful system.

### Metabolite profiling of LADA challenges the view of a metabolically distinct subtype [^dbcf7474]. Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) usually refers to GAD65 autoantibodies (GADAb)-positive diabetes with onset after 35 years of age and no insulin treatment within the first 6 months after diagnosis. However, it is not always easy to distinguish LADA from type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In this study, we examined whether metabolite profiling could help to distinguish LADA (n = 50) from type 1 diabetes (n = 50) and type 2 diabetes (n = 50). Of 123 identified metabolites, 99 differed between the diabetes types. However, no unique metabolite profile could be identified for any of the types. Instead, the metabolome varied along a C-peptide-driven continuum from type 1 diabetes via LADA to type 2 diabetes. LADA was more similar to type 2 diabetes than to type 1 diabetes. In a principal component analysis, LADA patients overlapping with type 1 diabetes progressed faster to insulin therapy than those overlapping with type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, we could not find any unique metabolite profile distinguishing LADA from type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Rather, LADA was metabolically an intermediate of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with those patients closer to the former showing a faster progression to insulin therapy than those closer to the latter.

Key points
- Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
- There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. There isn't a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help. Other things you can do to help:

- Take medicine as prescribed.
- Get diabetes self-management education and support.
- Make and keep health care appointments. Types Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction. This reaction stops your body from making insulin. If you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults but can be diagnosed at any age, and symptoms often develop quickly. Keep Reading: About Type 1 Diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults. You may not notice any symptoms, so it's important to get your blood sugar tested if you're at risk. Keep Reading: About Type 2 Diabetes. Prevention Prediabetes In the United States, about 1 in 3 adults has prediabetes. More than 8 in 10 people with prediabetes don't know they have it. With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle changes. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes. How you can prevent type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes by the numbers In the United States:

- About 38 million adults have diabetes, and 1 in 5 of them don't know they have it.
- Diabetes is the eighth leading cause of death.
- Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes; type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5% to 10%.

### Time to insulin initiation cannot be used in defining latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^5b64e209]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults is type 1 diabetes presenting as non-insulin dependent diabetes. One feature of the selection criteria is time independent of insulin treatment. We examine the validity of this criterion.

Research Design and Methods

Patients were recruited in nine European centers, and clinicians reported on criteria for initiating insulin. All patients were tested for GAD antibodies (GADAs) in a central laboratory. We examined time to insulin treatment for GADA-positive patients in six participating centers.

Results

There was intercenter variation in the criteria used to initiate insulin. Median time to insulin was 16.15 months (interqartile range 6.7–25.5) in centers with GADA testing compared with 45.6 months (29.5–61.8) in centers without routine GADA testing (P < 0.002).

Conclusion

Time to insulin should not be used to define patients with LADA because it is dependent on local clinical judgment and the use of laboratory tests for GADA.

New treatment algorithm for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)

LADA presents a unique scenario within the diabetic state. LADA is a variant of diabetes accounting for 2–12% of all patients with adult-onset diabetes. Like type 1 diabetes, LADA is characterized by immunogenetic markers of beta cell destruction (albeit with slower destruction than is characteristic of type 1 diabetes). Akin to type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, LADA does not require the use of exogenous insulin, at least in its earlier stages. The clinical profile of LADA has long presented a quagmire for practitioners.

LADA makes our shortlist for this review article because of the introduction of a novel treatment algorithm — one that may reconcile the seemingly opposing features of LADA in determining treatment of choice (Fig. 1). This algorithm by an international expert panel, published in 2020, supersedes, in our opinion, the guidance provided by the American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the. Study of Diabetes (EASD). It can also be used to initially and subsequently distinguish the clinical presentation of LADA from that of type 2 diabetes.

The Buzzetti et al. algorithm employs a two-step decision tree. Autoantibodies that target glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are among the autoantibodies displayed in patients with type 1 diabetes; these autoantibodies serve as immune markers with high sensitivity. Approximately 75% of people with type 1 diabetes at diagnosis exhibit GAD autoantibodies. LADA is part of the autoimmune diabetes spectrum, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) testing serves as the first step in the algorithm.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^26c3dda2]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Incidence and Prevalence of Type 1 Diabetes

The exact number of individuals with type 1 diabetes around the world is not known, but in the U.S. there are estimated to be up to 3 million. Although it has long been called "juvenile diabetes" due to the more frequent and relatively straightforward diagnosis in children, the majority of individuals with type 1 diabetes are adults.

Most children are referred and treated in tertiary centers, where clinical data are more readily captured. The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study estimated that, in 2009, 18,436 U.S. youth were newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (12,945 non-Hispanic white, 3,098 Hispanic, 2,070 non-Hispanic black, 276 Asian-Pacific Islander, and 47 American Indian). Worldwide, ∼78,000 youth are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes annually. Incidence varies tremendously among countries: East Asians and American Indians have the lowest incidence rates (0.1–8 per 100,000/year) as compared with the Finnish who have the highest rates (> 64.2 per 100,000/year). In the U.S. the number of youth with type 1 diabetes was estimated to be 166,984.

The precise incidence of new-onset type 1 diabetes in those over 20 years of age is unknown. This may be due to the prolonged phase of onset and the subtleties in distinguishing the different types of diabetes. In one European study of adults aged 30–70 years, ∼9% tested positive for GAD antibodies (GADA) within 5 years of a diabetes diagnosis, consistent with other studies.

Adults with type 1 diabetes often receive care in primary care settings rather than with an endocrinologist. Unlike the consolidated care seen in pediatric diabetes management, the lack of consolidated care in adults makes incidence and prevalence rates difficult to characterize, and therefore they are often underestimated. The number of adults living with type 1 diabetes is increasing due to two factors: 1) the rising number of new-onset cases of type 1 diabetes in adults, including those diagnosed with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), and 2) individuals with childhood-onset diabetes are living longer.

### Heterogeneity of patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: linkage to autoimmunity is apparent only in those with perceived need for insulin treatment: results from the nord-Tr ø ndelag health (HUNT) study [^180b1740]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Autoimmunity is the major cause of type 1 diabetes. Autoimmunity is also assumed to be the major cause of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) because this category of diabetes shares biochemical markers of β-cell–directed autoimmunity with "classic" type 1 diabetes. In clinical practice, autoimmunity in classic type 1 diabetes as well as in LADA is usually documented by antibodies against GAD.

LADA is considered a "mild" form of type 1 diabetes. Mild indicates the fact that patients with LADA do not by clinical judgment need insulin from the time of diagnosis. However, within the first few years after the diagnosis of diabetes a need for insulin treatment develops in many patients with LADA. This distinguishes patients with LADA from those with nonautoimmune type 2 diabetes in whom a need for insulin treatment develops later than in those with LADA. An early need for insulin treatment in patients with LADA points to ongoing autoimmune-mediated destruction of β-cells in these patients.

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as age, obesity, and lack of physical activity, are associated with the development of LADA. In fact, odds ratios in terms of risk for diabetes for these factors of insulin resistance were the same for LADA and type 2 diabetes. This raises the question of the relative importance of autoimmunity vis-à-vis insulin resistance for the etiology of LADA and whether etiology differs among patients with LADA. Support for etiological heterogeneity comes from the large UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), in which only a minority of patients with the diagnosis of LADA, when defined solely as GAD antibody positivity, developed the need for insulin treatment during 6 years of follow-up. The heterogeneity of LADA is also evident when one compares phenotypes of patients with LADA in different studies.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult: current knowledge and uncertainty [^befeca5c]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Small studies have described differences in LADA with regard to abnormal DNA methylation in CD4 + T cells in LADA, altered T–regulatory cells, NK cells, gene expression profiles of monocytesand some antigen-reactive T cells. However, these data require confirmation and other studies have not shown differences in T cells upon stimulation with different islet-associated antigens. It is generally accepted that T cells are largely responsible for the inflammatory pancreatic β–cell destruction in autoimmune diabetes. Yet we know little of this response and even less in LADA. A T–cell assay of cellular immunoblotting measuring reactivity to human islet antigens using peripheral blood demonstrated excellent specificity and sensitivity, comparable with DAA, in distinguishing between blood from patients with childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes and normal controls. Intriguingly, using this T–cell assay, a proportion of patients with phenotypic Type 2 diabetes showed T–cell reactivity comparable with that seen in patients with Type 1 diabetes. The implications were emphasized by confirmation that a percentage of patients with autoantibody-negative 'Type 2' diabetes have distinct T–cell reactivity to islet antigens and that T–cell reactivity was more closely associated with reduced C–peptide than DAA. These observations need to be confirmed in other laboratories and there is no evidence that the T cells are strictly autoimmune. However, they certainly challenge the conventional perception that only Type 1 diabetes is due to an 'autoimmune' process.

Summary: knowledge and uncertainty

Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes and childhood-onset Type 1 diabetes are barely distinguishable immunologically, although the latter has a greater immunogenetic load with more multiple DAA, more frequent IA–2A and ZnT8A, plus lower C–peptide and more rapid C–peptide loss. High-titre GADA in the former is associated with multiple DAA, high-affinity GADA and with greater loss of C–peptide. In adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, the dominant autoantibody is GADA. In childhood, GADA tends to appear later (about age 5 years) than IAA (about age 2 years). It is not known when GADA associated with LADA first appears and whether GADA found in childhood might predict autoimmune diabetes developing 20 or more years later. The pathophysiological significance of patients with Type 2 diabetes having T–cell islet immunoreactivity, even when they are negative for GADA and other DAA, is not known.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults differs genetically from classical type 1 diabetes diagnosed after the age of 35 years [^9a4b04cd]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

We studied differences between patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), type 2 diabetes, and classical type 1 diabetes diagnosed after age 35 years.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Polymorphisms in HLA-DQB1, INS, PTPN22, and CTLA4 were genotyped in patients with LADA (n = 213), type 1 diabetes diagnosed at > 35 years of age (T1D > 35y; n = 257) or < 20 years of age (T1D < 20y; n = 158), and type 2 diabetes.

RESULTS

Although patients with LADA had an increased frequency of HLA-DQB1 and PTPN22 risk genotypes and alleles compared with type 2 diabetic subjects, the frequency was significantly lower compared with T1D > 35y patients. Genotype frequencies, measures of insulin secretion, and metabolic traits within LADA differed according to GAD antibody (GADA) quartiles, but even the highest quartile differed from type 1 diabetes. Having two or more risk genotypes was associated with lower C-peptide concentrations in LADA.

CONCLUSIONS

LADA patients differed genetically and phenotypically from both T1D > 35y and type 2 diabetic patients in a manner dependent on GADA levels.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a heterogenous disease and commonly classified into type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). An intermediate form known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) affects about 10% of people with diabetes.T1D is caused by an immune‐mediated β‐cell destruction ultimately leading to severe insulin deficiency, whereas T2D is heterogenous and results from insulin resistance and β‐cell failure.

LADA is defined as diabetes that manifests in individuals at adult age, exhibiting clinical characteristics resembling T2D, regarding age of onset and metabolic profile at diagnosis, whilst also showing the presence of autoantibodies associated with T1D. In current guidelines, LADA is considered a subgroup of T1D. Due to the clinical and phenotypical similarity between individuals with LADA and individuals with T2D, and the lack of routine measurements of β‐cell antibodies in individuals with T2D, LADA remains often undetected.

Diabetes is a risk factor for developing macrovascular diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction, as well as microvascular diseases including retinopathy, neuropathy, and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Studies have shown higher values for glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in people with LADA, compared to people with T2D, both at diagnosis and after a follow‐up period of 8.9 years. This was similar for paediatric individuals with latent autoimmune diabetes of the young (LADY), who showed intermediate values of HbA1c, compared to those with T1D and T2D. The loss of β‐cell function in LADA is slower than in T1D, whilst C‐peptide concentration is higher. This supports the hypothesis that people with LADA have intermediate values for glycemic control and β‐cell function when compared to T1D and T2D.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults differs genetically from classical type 1 diabetes diagnosed after the age of 35 years [^362b39f6]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We studied differences between patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), type 2 diabetes, and classical type 1 diabetes diagnosed after age 35 years.

Research Design and Methods

Polymorphisms in HLA-DQB1, INS, PTPN22, and CTLA4 were genotyped in patients with LADA (n = 213), type 1 diabetes diagnosed at > 35 years of age (T1D(> 35y); n = 257) or < 20 years of age (T1D(< 20y); n = 158), and type 2 diabetes.

Results

Although patients with LADA had an increased frequency of HLA-DQB1 and PTPN22 risk genotypes and alleles compared with type 2 diabetic subjects, the frequency was significantly lower compared with T1D(> 35y) patients. Genotype frequencies, measures of insulin secretion, and metabolic traits within LADA differed according to GAD antibody (GADA) quartiles, but even the highest quartile differed from type 1 diabetes. Having two or more risk genotypes was associated with lower C-peptide concentrations in LADA.

Conclusions

LADA patients differed genetically and phenotypically from both T1D(> 35y) and type 2 diabetic patients in a manner dependent on GADA levels.

### Similar genetic features and different islet cell autoantibody pattern of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) compared with adult-onset type 1 diabetes with rapid progression [^dc2dca9c]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the clinical parameters, C-peptide levels, pattern of islet cell-specific autoantibodies, and prevalence of predisposing genotypes in subjects with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and those with adult-onset type 1 diabetes with rapid progression.

Research Design and Methods

We evaluated the clinical parameters, C-peptide levels, and islet cell-specific autoantibodies in 54 LADA, 57 adult-onset type 1 diabetic, and 190 type 2 diabetic patients. Islet cell autoantibodies were also compared between subgroups of newly diagnosed patients with LADA and those with newly diagnosed adult-onset and childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. The genetic study was performed in subjects with LADA and those with adult-onset type 1 diabetes in comparison with a control population.

Results

There were no differences in the clinical parameters between LADA and adult-onset type 1 diabetes. Patients with LADA had lower BMI (P < 0.0001), waist-to-hip ratio (0.0029), total cholesterol (P = 0.001), and triglycerides (P = 0.001); higher HDL cholesterol levels (P < 0.0001); and lower prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.0028) compared with patients with type 2 diabetes. C-peptide levels were similar at onset (P = 0.403) but decreased less rapidly in LADA than in adult-onset type 1 diabetes (P = 0.0253). Single-autoantibody positivity was more often seen in LADA than in type 1 diabetes (P = 0.0001). The prevalence of predisposing HLA-DQB1*0302, -DR4, -DR3, and -DR3/DR4 genotypes and the DR4-DQB1*0302 haplotype were increased in both LADA and adult-onset type 1 diabetic subjects compared with the control population. There were no differences in the frequencies of these risk alleles and haplotypes between the two patient groups.

Conclusions

Subjects with LADA had clinical characteristics similar to those with adult-onset type 1 diabetes with rapid progression. C-peptide levels did not differ at onset but decreased less rapidly in LADA. Patients with LADA rather had single islet cell-specific autoantibody positivity. The prevalence of HLA-DQB1*0302, -DR4, -DR3, and -DR3/DR4 risk alleles and the DR4-DQB1*0302 high-risk haplotype did not differ in the two forms of autoimmune diabetes.

Conclusions

The present study shows that the stimulated insulin secretion capacity in LADA is intermediate between that of types 1 and 2 diabetes. This finding provides new data and further contributes to the characterisation of the natural history of LADA.

In addition, the study results may be helpful for future intervention trials aimed at preserving the residual insulin secretory capacity in subjects with autoimmune diabetes. Potential future prevention trials should be designed accordingly.

### Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes in Europe is prevalent with a broad clinical phenotype: action LADA 7 [^66da54da]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

As a result, we recommend that type 1 diabetes and LADA be viewed as part of a broad clinical spectrum that more truly represents autoimmune diabetes. The most prevalent form of diabetes is adult-onset type 2 diabetes, which affects ~4–7% of the adult European population. Childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, on the other hand, affects only some 0.25% of European children and adolescents, though a lifetime disease-risk analysis suggested that up to 1% develop classic type 1 diabetes, with a proportion doing so after age 30 years. Since we now show that nearly 10% of adult-onset diabetic patients have autoimmune diabetes, it follows that adult-onset autoimmune diabetes is probably more prevalent than childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, while in adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, LADA is more prevalent than classic type 1 diabetes (OR 3.3). Clinically, knowledge that adult-onset diabetic patients have GADA should alert physicians to the increased likelihood of more rapid progression to insulin therapy; i.e. there is value in measuring GADA in all adult-onset diabetes cases because a significant proportion of them with GADA, unidentifiable by clinical phenotype, potentially have a different therapeutic trajectory than in classic type 2 diabetes. In summary, this present study now shows that the majority of adult-onset autoimmune diabetic patients are non–insulin requiring at diagnosis and can be identified through GADA screening. In the tendency to be adult onset, with variable destruction of the target organ, leading to a broad clinical spectrum, autoimmune diabetes can now be seen to resemble other autoimmune diseases.

Univariate analysis for the presence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques

LADA latent autoimmune diabetes in adults

A multivariate logistic regression model including age, diabetes duration, gender, type of diabetes, retinopathy, hypertension, smoking and dyslipidemia (Table 3) revealed that age, but not gender, type of diabetes, and the presence of hypertension and smoking habit were associated with carotid atherosclerosis. The adjusted inverse OR for the presence of carotid plaques in patients with LADA as compared with those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes was 2.44 [(1.65–3.6); P = 0.0225] and 2.06 [(1.47–2.9); P = 0.0334], respectively.

Table 3

Odds ratio was adjusted by age and diabetes duration using a generalized additive model

LADA latent autoimmune diabetes in adults

To explore the impact of disease duration on carotid plaque frequency in patients with LADA, we limited the analysis to patients with LADA and type 2 diabetes, as few patients with type 1 diabetes had a short diabetes duration. We divided patients with LADA and type 2 diabetes into age-adjusted tertiles of disease duration: ≤ 5, 6–11, ≥ 12 years. Table 4 shows the results of this analysis; within 5 years of diabetes duration the prevalence of carotid plaques was lower, though not significantly so, in patients with LADA than in those with type 2 diabetes [26.7% vs. 54.8%, inverse OR 0.38 (0.11–1.39); P = 0.137]. However, with increasing diabetes duration the frequency of carotid atherosclerotic plaques increased in patients with LADA, but not in patients with type 2 diabetes [81.8% vs. 50%, inverse OR 5.72 (1.5–21.8); P = 0.009].

Diseases gain identity from clinical phenotype as well as genetic and environmental aetiology. The definition of type 1 diabetes is clinically exclusive, comprising patients who are considered insulin dependent at diagnosis, whilst the definition of type 2 diabetes is inclusive, only excluding those who are initially insulin dependent. Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) are each exclusive forms of diabetes which are, at least initially, clinically distinct from type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes, and each have a different natural history from these major types of diabetes.KPD can be diagnosed unequivocally as diabetes presenting with the categorical clinical feature, ketoacidosis. In contrast, LADA can be diagnosed by the co-occurrence of three traits, not one of which is categorical or exclusive to the condition: adult-onset non-insulin-requiring diabetes, an islet autoantibody such as glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA) or cytoplasmic islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), and no need for insulin treatment for several months post-diagnosis. But while some would split diabetes into distinct subtypes, there is a strong case that these subtypes form a continuum of varying severity of immune and metabolic dysfunction modified by genetic and non-genetic factors. This article discusses the nature of disease classification in general, and KPD and LADA in particular, emphasizing the potential value and pitfalls in classifying diabetes and suggesting a need for more research in this area.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) in south wales: incidence and characterization [^cf87a1e6]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To define the incidence and characteristics of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).

Methods

We estimated the incidence of LADA by examining the incidence of Type 2 diabetes and calculating the proportion that were antibody positive. The incidence of Type 2 diabetes was calculated by analysis of computer records of 35 out of 36 general practices in Swansea. In addition, thirty-two practices participated in recruiting people with Type 2 diabetes to have glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody testing.

Results

The crude proportion of Type 2 patients testing positive for GAD antibodies (GADA) was 4.0% (28/683). This figure did not change when we analysed only the practices that tested more than 60% of all eligible patients. In these practices, 79% (387/487) of all eligible patients were GADA tested and 14/387 [3.6% (95% confidence interval: 2.1–6.1%)] were classified as having LADA. This gives an incidence of LADA of 9 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval: 4.4–17.8 per 100,000) people per year registered with a general practitioner. Patients testing positive for GADA were more likely to have a lower body mass index, other antibodies, to present with acute symptoms and to have higher glycated haemoglobin.

Conclusions

This is the first study of the incidence of LADA in primary care. People with LADA make up a significant proportion of people with apparent Type 2 diabetes. Patients with LADA are likely to be symptomatic, have poorer glycaemic control and have other autoimmune antibodies.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults differs genetically from classical type 1 diabetes diagnosed after the age of 35 years [^8fb6ecd8]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

All risk genotypes and alleles were most prevalent in patients in the highest GADA quartile (LADA high, GADA > 278 IU/ml) compared with the two middle (LADA mid, 44–278 IU/ml) or the lowest quartiles (LADA low, 33–43.9 IU/ml; Fig. 1), but the difference was significant only for HLA-DQB1 (P = 0.009). However, even LADA high subjects differed from T1D > 35y subjects (P = 0.001), and LADA low subjects had nonsignificantly more HLA-DQB1 risk genotypes than type 2 diabetic subjects (19.6 vs. 14.0%). LADA high subjects also differed from the type 2 diabetic subjects with respect to the allele frequency of PTPN22 (P = 0.02) and CTLA4 (P = 0.03).

In a joint analysis of the four genes, two or more risk genotypes were most common in T1D < 20y patients (82.1%), followed by T1D > 35y patients (74.4%), LADA (54.1%), and type 2 diabetic (38.7%) patients (P < 0.00001). The frequency differed across the GADA quartiles (P = 0.004), and it was similar in LADA high and T1D > 35y patients (72.5 vs. 74.4%), as well as in LADA low and type 2 diabetic patients (46.0 vs. 38.7%) (online appendix Table A3, available at). LADA patients with an increasing number of risk genotypes had decreasing fasting serum (fS)–C-peptide concentrations (P = 0.015).

The LADA patients had higher BMI and lipid concentrations than the T1D > 35y patients (online appendix Table A1). Compared with type 2 diabetic patients, LADA patients had lower insulin secretion and BMI, as well as a better lipid profile. Going from LADA low to LADA high, there was a significant trend toward lower insulin secretion, lipid levels, and BMI (online appendix Table A2). However, the fS–C-peptide concentration was higher in LADA high patients compared with T1D > 35y patients and was somewhat lower in LADA low compared with type 2 diabetic patients. Despite the marked age difference, the T1D > 35y and T1D < 20y patients were metabolically similar.

### Altered regulatory T cell phenotype in latent autoimmune diabetes of the adults (LADA) [^db9add8f]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes of the adults (LADA) accounts for up to 12% of all patients with diabetes. Initially the disease resembles type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, the typical presence of β cell autoantibodies indicates an autoimmune basis of LADA. While dysfunctional regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been implicated in autoimmune diabetes, these cells have been scarcely studied in LADA. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and phenotype of circulating Tregs in LADA patients early during disease progression. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on whole blood and peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients diagnosed with LADA prior to insulin deficiency (n = 39) and from healthy volunteers (n = 20). Overall, we found the frequency and activation status of peripheral putative Tregs to be altered in LADA patients compared to healthy controls. While total T cells and CD4(+) T cells expressing high levels of CD25 (CD4(+) CD25(hi)) were unchanged, the frequency and total numbers of CD4(+) T cells expressing an intermediate level of CD25 (CD4(+) CD25(int)) were decreased in LADA patients. Interestingly, the expression of the Treg -specific marker forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3), as well as the activation and memory makers CD69, cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), CCR4 and CD45RO were increased in CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells of the patients. Our data depict phenotypical changes in T cells of LADA patients that may reflect a derangement in peripheral immune regulation contributing to the slow process leading to insulin-dependent diabetes in these patients.

### Metabolic syndrome and autoimmune diabetes: action LADA 3 [^fccafbe9]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which insulin deficiency results from immune-mediated destruction of insulin-secreting islet cells. The majority of patients with type 1 diabetes have autoantibodies in their peripheral blood, and these autoantibodies can predict the disease. Autoimmune diabetes, as characterized by these autoantibodies, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADAs), is the most prevalent form of diabetes in children and also occurs in a proportion of patients who initially present with adult-onset non–insulin-requiring diabetes, also called latent adult-onset autoimmune diabetes (LADA).

Because glucose disposal and blood glucose are determined by both insulin secretion and insulin action, it follows that insulin sensitivity could be important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. Insulin sensitivity has not been studied in detail in autoimmune diabetes, although studies suggest that its loss may occur in established disease as well as in the pre-diabetic phase. Loss of insulin sensitivity is difficult to assess epidemiologically but is reflected in the cluster of metabolically related cardiovascular risk factors that together comprise the metabolic syndrome and include altered glucose levels, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Several groups, including the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), with Adult Treatment Panel III, have proposed their own definitions for the metabolic syndrome.

LADA is clearly distinct from type 2 diabetes, in that LADA is associated with histocompatability (HLA) genes, diabetes-associated autoantibodies, reduced insulin secretion, no need for insulin therapy initially after diagnosis, and less prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The key question is whether LADA is distinct from type 1 diabetes, that is, whether LADA is one end of a rainbow of pathophysiological variations encompassing autoimmune diabetes with a frequency of metabolic syndrome similar to that of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes or whether LADA is a distinct form of autoimmune diabetes that resembles type 2 diabetes, showing evidence of insulin resistance with a high frequency of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether individuals with type 2 diabetes and autoimmune diabetes (incorporating type 1 diabetes and LADA) have a higher frequency of metabolic syndrome than normal subjects, and our hypothesis was that they would.

### Frequency, immunogenetics, and clinical characteristics of latent autoimmune diabetes in China (LADA China study): a nationwide, multicenter, clinic-based cross-sectional study [^0efd296e]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Although LADA is prevalent and potentially more prevalent than childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, that frequency depends on the defining autoantibody assay (usually GADA), ethnic group, age at diagnosis, and mode of ascertainment. Using GADA, the frequency of LADA in adult-onset diabetes has ranged from 4 to 12% in Caucasian populations, with higher frequencies in those younger at diagnosis or insulin treated. In China as well, GADA positivity was prevalent in hospital-based adult-onset diabetic patients from the Hunan province (7.1%) and in a local small population-based study in Tianjin (9.2% [46 of 498]). Therefore, we established a large multicenter clinical study (LADA China) to determine the prevalence, immunogenotype, and clinical characteristics of this form of diabetes in China. Since China has one-fifth of the world's population, of whom ~92 million adults have diabetes, within 56 ethnic groups spread over 9.6 million square kilometers with remarkably varied climates, diets, and patterns of infectious diseases, data from China should inform our general knowledge of the nature of diabetes. We now report, for the first time, that GADA positivity and LADA are prevalent among adult-onset non–insulin-requiring diabetic patients, with apparent type 2 diabetes, throughout China, with a geographic difference between north and south, and clinical and immunogenetic features implying both similarities and differences in relation to Caucasian LADA patients but consistent with LADA in China being part of an autoimmune spectrum.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults is phenotypically similar to type 1 diabetes in a minority population [^428f1047]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is a form of autoimmune diabetes that has been classified as part of type 1 diabetes or as a distinct clinical entity. Its precise place as a disease category is therefore controversial.

Objective

The objective of this study was to further examine this issue by comparing the phenotypes of LADA and type 1 diabetes in a predominately minority population.

Patients and Methods

We studied 126 subjects who were anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody-positive in two separate studies — 63 subjects in an outpatient study (study 1), and 63 inpatients after resolution of ketoacidosis (study 2). Clinical and biochemical phenotyping was performed in all patients in each group.

Results

Few significant differences were found in the clinical or biochemical phenotypes in patients classified as LADA when compared with type 1 diabetes. Adiposity, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, fasting plasma C-peptide, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were all similar. The only distinguishing feature was a history of hypertension (study 1) or systolic blood pressure (study 2). Also, a history of ketoacidosis did not influence the phenotype of LADA in the outpatients in any discernable way.

Conclusions

We conclude that LADA and type 1 diabetes are phenotypically indistinguishable in this predominantly minority population with a mean duration of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody-positive diabetes of about 8 yr.

### Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults is perched between type 1 and type 2: evidence from adults in one region of Spain [^9984d282]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical characteristics and insulin secretion in adults with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). We also compared these characteristics in subjects with antibody-negative type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or adult-onset type 1 diabetes (T1DM) to subjects with LADA.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 82 patients with LADA, 78 with T1DM and 485 with T2DM were studied. Clinical and metabolic data, in particular those that related to metabolic syndrome, fasting C-peptide and islet-cell autoantibodies [glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADAb) and IA2 (IA2Ab)] were measured.

Results

The frequency of metabolic syndrome in patients with LADA (37.3%) was higher than in those with T1DM (15.5%; p = 0.005) and lower than in patients with T2DM (67.2%; p < 0.001). During the first 36 months of the disease, the C-peptide concentration in LADA patients was higher than in subjects with T1DM but was lower than in T2DM patients (p < 0.01 for comparisons). Glycemic control in LADA patients (HbA1c 8.1%) was worse than in patients with T2DM (HbA1c 7.6%; p = 0.007). An inverse association between GADAb titers and C-peptide concentrations was found in subjects with LADA (p < 0.001). Finally, LADA patients rapidly progressed to insulin treatment.

Conclusions

As in other European populations, patients with LADA in Spain have a distinct metabolic profile compared with patients with T1DM or T2DM. LADA is also associated with higher impairment of beta-cell function and has worse glycemic control than in T2DM. Beta cell function is related to GADAb titers in patients with LADA.

### GAD65 autoantibody responses in Japanese latent autoimmune diabetes in adult patients [^ca1c1df6]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — To determine whether development of insulin requirement in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is accompanied with the emergence of a type 1 diabetes–like autoimmune response.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We correlated β-cell–specific autoimmunity reflected in autoantibodies to the 65-kDa isoform of GAD (GAD65) with insulin requirement. We determined GAD65Ab epitope specificities in type 1 diabetic patients, LADA patients without insulin requirement (nonprogressed), and LADA patients that had developed insulin requirement (progressed).

RESULTS — Recognition of a type 1 diabetes–specific GAD65Ab epitope was more pronounced in type 1 diabetic patients than in nonprogressed (P < 0.001) or progressed (P < 0.01) LADA patients, with no significant differences between the two LADA cohorts. These differences were particularly pronounced in samples with GAD65Ab titers < 1,000 units/ml, with no differences in epitope specificities in samples with higher GAD65Ab titers. Disease duration (initial diabetes diagnosis until sample collection or development of insulin requirement) in nonprogressed and progressed LADA patients, respectively, was not correlated with epitope specificity, suggesting lack of epitope maturation. This was supported by epitope analyses of longitudinal samples from LADA patients during progression to insulin requirement.

CONCLUSIONS — First, the GAD65Ab-specific autoimmune reaction in type 1 diabetic patients with low and moderate GAD65Ab titers differs from that in LADA patients, irrespective of insulin requirement. Second, the GAD65Ab-specific autoimmune response in LADA patients does not change after their initial diabetes diagnosis. Finally, LADA patients with high GAD65Ab titers resemble type 1 diabetic patients in their GAD65Ab epitope specificity.

### Prevalence and correlates of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults in tianjin, China: a population-based cross-sectional study [^f245b85d]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in the adult (LADA) is a slowly progressive form of autoimmune diabetes and is characterized by diabetes-associated autoantibody positivity. Patients with LADA have an insidious onset of hyperglycemia and clinical presentation similar to that of type 2 diabetes at onset. Epidemiological studies suggest that LADA may account for 2–12% of all cases of diabetes.

The prevalence of LADA in western countries varies from 2.8 to 10% in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Outcomes Progression Trial recently reported that GAD antibody (GADA) positivity is 4.2% in North America and 3.7% in Europe among individuals with type 2 diabetes. In China, two clinical studies have shown that the estimated prevalence of LADA in patients with type 2 diabetes is ∼7%. The etiology of LADA is unclear, and it is not known whether LADA is due to the same underlying disease process as childhood type 1 diabetes. A recent study has suggested that the patients with LADA share genetic features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. In addition, several studies have reported that metabolic disorders, such as hypertension and obesity, and a family history of diabetes are associated with the risk of LADA.

Accumulating clinical evidence has shown significant overlap between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The disease process in patients with classic type 1 diabetes is believed to be autoimmune in nature, whereas the disease process in classic type 2 diabetes is not. The treatment for patients with LADA may need to be different from that used for patients with type 2 diabetes. Because LADA is frequently misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes, identification of LADA is of clinical importance. In this population-based cross-sectional study, we sought to investigate the prevalence of LADA and further to explore whether familial, vascular, and psychosocial factors are associated with the occurrence of LADA.

### Diabetic neuropathy in patients with "latent autoimmune diabetes of the adults" (LADA) compared with patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^463a81eb]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

In previous studies, a lower incidence of diabetes-related complications such as diabetic neuropathy has been reported in patients with early stages of type 1 diabetes compared with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy in patients with manifestation of a slow onset type 1 diabetes in adulthood - latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) - with classical type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients.

Research Design and Methods

Altogether, 37 patients (14 LADA, 9 type 1 and 14 type 2 diabetes) with short term diabetes (duration < 5 years) were investigated for diabetic neuropathy on the basis of clinical and neuroelectrophysiological evaluations. The neurological functions were evaluated by a standardized questionnaire and clinical examination. In electrophysiological evaluations the different nerve fibres were investigated using motor and sensory nerve conduction studies, quantitative thermotesting, vibratometry and autonomic function tests (heart rate variability).

Results

LADA patients had a significantly lower clinical examination score (p = 0.008), cardiorespiratory reflex index (p = 0.009) and cold perception threshold index (p = 0.004). The neurological symptom score, the indices of motor and sensory nerve conduction, the index of thermotesting (warm perception threshold) and the vibratometry showed a trend to higher values in LADA patients than in type 2 diabetes patients. There were no significant differences between LADA and type 1 diabetes patients.

Conclusions

LADA patients had fewer features of diabetic neuropathy than type 2 diabetes patients in the early stages of disease, thus being more similar to classical type 1 diabetes patients who normally develop diabetic neuropathy rather late.

### Heterogeneity of patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: linkage to autoimmunity is apparent only in those with perceived need for insulin treatment: results from the nord-Tr ø ndelag health (HUNT) study [^ce53bf80]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — Subjects with the diagnosis of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) are more prone to need insulin treatment than those with type 2 diabetes. However, not all patients with LADA develop the need for insulin treatment, indicating the heterogeneity of LADA. We investigated this heterogeneity by comparing phenotypes of LADA with and without perceived need for insulin treatment (data obtained at times when diagnosis of LADA was not investigated) and also compared LADA and type 2 diabetes phenotypes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We used data from the all population–based Nord-Trøndelag Health study (n = 64,931), performed in 1995–1997. Data were assembled for individuals with LADA (n = 106) and type 2 diabetes (n = 943).

RESULTS — In the comparison of individuals with LADA both with and without the need for insulin, insulin-treated subjects had higher titers of GAD antibodies (P < 0.001) and lower fasting C-peptide levels (P < 0.001). GAD antibodies and C-peptide correlated negatively (r = −0.40; P = 0.009). In the comparison of individuals with LADA and type 2 diabetes, all without the need for insulin, markers of metabolic syndrome were equally prevalent and pronounced. Age, C-peptide, and glucose levels were also similar. In the comparison of insulin-treated individuals with LADA and type 2 diabetes, more patients with LADA received insulin (40 vs. 22%, P < 0.001) and C-peptide levels were lower (P < 0.001). Patients with LADA were leaner but were still overweight (mean BMI 28.7 vs. 30.9 kg/m 2 in type 2 diabetes, P < 0.001). In the comparison of type 2 diabetic patients with and without insulin, insulin-treated subjects were more obese and had higher A1C and lower C-peptide levels (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS — Our conclusions are that 1) the need for insulin treatment in LADA is linked to the degree of autoimmunity and β-cell failure, 2) subjects with LADA and type 2 diabetes without the need for insulin treatment are phenotypically similar, and 3) insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients is associated with both insulin resistance and β-cell insufficiency.

### Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes in Europe is prevalent with a broad clinical phenotype: action LADA 7 [^f3286b1e]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Specific autoantibodies characterize type 1 diabetes in childhood but are also found in adult-onset diabetes, even when initially non–insulin requiring, e.g. with latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA). We aimed to characterize adult-onset autoimmune diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We consecutively studied 6,156 European diabetic patients attending clinics within 5 years of diagnosis (age range, 30–70 years) examined cross-sectionally clinically and for GAD antibodies (GADA) and antibodies to insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2A) and zinc-transporter 8 (ZnT8A).

RESULTS

Of 6,156 patients, 541 (8.8%) had GADA and only 57 (0.9%) IA-2A or ZnT8A alone. More autoantibody-positive than autoantibody-negative patients were younger, leaner, on insulin (49.5 vs. 13.2%), and female (P < 0.0001 for each), though LADA patients (9.7% of total) did not show categorically distinct clinical features from autoantibody-negative type 2 diabetes. Similarly, more GADA patients with high (> 200 World Health Organization IU) (n = 403) compared with low (n = 138) titer were female, lean, and insulin treated (54.6 vs. 39.7%) (P < 0.02 for each). Autoantibody-positive patients usually had GADA (541 of 598; 90.5%) and had LADA more often than type 1 autoimmune diabetes (odds ratio 3.3).

CONCLUSIONS

Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes emerges as a prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes. Our results indicate that adult-onset autoimmune diabetes in Europe encompasses type 1 diabetes and LADA in the same broad clinical and autoantibody-positive spectrum. At diagnosis, patients with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes are usually non–insulin requiring and clinically indistinguishable from patients with type 2 diabetes, though they tend to be younger and leaner. Only with screening for autoantibodies, especially GADA, can they be identified with certainty.

### Serious life events and the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes [^ef215df8]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

It has been suggested that experiencing serious life events may promote Type 1 diabetes in children. Studies in adults are lacking, as are studies on the interaction of life events with genetic factors. We aimed to investigate life events and the risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and Type 2 diabetes while taking into account HLA genotype.

Methods

Analysis was based on 425 incident cases of LADA, 1417 incident cases of Type 2 diabetes and 1702 population-based controls recruited in Sweden between 2010 and 2016. Self-reported information on life events including conflicts, divorce, illness/accidents, death and financial problems experienced during the 5 years preceding diagnosis/index year was used. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, family history of diabetes, smoking, physical activity and education.

Results

Overall there was no association between experience of any life event and either LADA (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68–1.08) or Type 2 diabetes (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83–1.21). The results were similar for individual events as well as in separate analysis of men and women. Similar results were seen in more autoimmune LADA (glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies > median) [OR (any life event) 0.88, 95% CI 0.64–1.21] and in LADA carriers of the high-risk HLADR4-DQ8 genotype (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61–1.29).

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that experience of a serious life event, including the death of a family member, divorce or financial problems, is not associated with an increased risk of LADA, overall or in genetically susceptible individuals.

### High levels of education are associated with an increased risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: results from the nord-Tr ø ndelag health study [^04cb8e04]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

There is some evidence indicating that socioeconomic conditions during early life can affect the incidence of autoimmune diabetes. Lower rates of childhood diabetes have been reported in more materially deprived areas, and children in families with a high socioeconomic position seem more prone to develop type 1 diabetes. It has been hypothesized that these associations result from differences in environmental factors, such as feeding patterns, hygiene standards, and lack of infections in early life, conditions that may affect the immune system and trigger an autoimmune reaction. Whether socioeconomic factors associate with autoimmune diabetes that develops at adult age is, however, not known. Contrasting with data on childhood type 1 diabetes, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is more pronounced in lower socioeconomic groups. This association can be explained, at least in part, by traditional risk factors such as overweight and physical inactivity.

Autoimmune diabetes in adults comprises latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) as well as "classical" type 1 diabetes. Autoimmunity is indicated by the presence of antibodies against β-cell–associated antigens, such as GAD. LADA is by far the most common form of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes and is estimated to account for 2–12% of all diabetes cases. As indicated by the name, onset of LADA is slower than type 1 diabetes, and insulin treatment is typically not required at the time of diagnoses. Even though it is characterized by autoimmunity, LADA patients also display features of type 2 diabetes with risk associations to being overweight and physical inactivity.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the risk of developing autoimmune diabetes in adults differs between socioeconomic groups and to compare such risk with that for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we aimed to analyze whether evidence could be found for a role of autoimmunity and whether associations found could be explained by traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as family history of diabetes, being overweight, physical inactivity, or smoking.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Anthropometric and clinical characteristics

At diabetes manifestation, the data of 36 959 individuals were analysed. The majority of individuals were diagnosed with T2D (n = 35 272, 61.6% male). A total of 940 people had T1D (57.6% male) and 747 people had LADA (69.3% male) (Table 1).

### Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes: comparative analysis of classical and latent presentation [^572a05ed]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetes treatment

In what concerns to diabetes treatment at the last evaluation, in our sample all T1DM patients were under insulin therapy, mainly basal-bolus regimen. Most LADA patients were under basal-bolus therapy: a total of 58.6%, which seems lower than other series. The mean TDD adjusted for weight was very similar between both groups (0.58 IU/kg in T1DM and 0.57 IU/kg in LADA).

Although LADA has distinct pathophysiological mechanisms of disease comparing to T1DM (less pronounced insulinopenia and significant insulin resistance), with the progression of the disease most patients eventually need insulin therapy. Most studies on LADA compare these patients with T2DM and describe a faster progression to insulin therapy, mainly in patients with higher GADA titles. Nevertheless, in our sample four LADA patients (8.7%) were not under insulin treatment, with no episodes of ketosis (three of them with good glycaemic control). On the other hand, 54.3% of LADA patients were under non-insulin antidiabetics (comparing to 20.5% of T1DM group), which seems lower than other series.

### GAD65 autoantibody responses in Japanese latent autoimmune diabetes in adult patients [^42beb5d3]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our results confirmed previous observations of different GAD65-specific humoral immune responses in type 1 diabetic patients and nonprogressed LADA patients. Progressed LADA patients exhibited a GAD65Ab epitope pattern intermediate between type 1 diabetic patients and nonprogressed LADA patients. This may indicate that the GAD65Ab response matures in patients as they progress toward insulin requirement. We tested this possibility by analyzing longitudinal samples obtained from a small group of LADA patients during their development of insulin requirement. While some of the patients showed changes in their epitope binding specificities, no overall trend was observed.

In the progressed LADA patients the disease duration before insulin requirement varies from 0.5 to 27 years. We analyzed whether LADA patients who progressed faster to disease showed different GAD65Ab epitope specificities from patients that progressed slower. However, no correlation between GAD65Ab epitope specificities and length of the prodomal period was observed. These findings together with our earlier observations of longitudinal changes in GAD65Ab epitope specificities in healthy adult individuals during their progression to type 2 diabetes lead to our hypothesis that the autoimmune response in LADA patients remains constant after type 2 diabetes onset.

Some of the nonprogressed LADA patients showed a very long disease duration without developing insulin requirement (up to 27 years since initial diabetes diagnosis). While the presence of GAD65Ab in LADA patients is considered as a risk factor for subsequent insulin requirement, one autoantibody alone confers only a low risk for progression in the general population. One could therefore assume that some LADA patients show signs of β-cell autoimmunity but are unlikely to develop insulin requirement. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed GAD65Ab epitope specificities in correlation with disease duration. However, no correlation between disease duration and epitope specificity was observed. These data are in agreement with the longitudinal study of LADA patients in the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study 77, reporting stagnant GAD65Ab epitope reactivities.

### GAD65 autoantibody responses in Japanese latent autoimmune diabetes in adult patients [^f5753d69]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether development of insulin requirement in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is accompanied with the emergence of a type 1 diabetes-like autoimmune response.

Research Design and Methods

We correlated beta-cell-specific autoimmunity reflected in autoantibodies to the 65-kDa isoform of GAD (GAD65) with insulin requirement. We determined GAD65Ab epitope specificities in type 1 diabetic patients, LADA patients without insulin requirement (nonprogressed), and LADA patients that had developed insulin requirement (progressed).

Results

Recognition of a type 1 diabetes-specific GAD65Ab epitope was more pronounced in type 1 diabetic patients than in nonprogressed (P < 0.001) or progressed (P < 0.01) LADA patients, with no significant differences between the two LADA cohorts. These differences were particularly pronounced in samples with GAD65Ab titers < 1,000 units/ml, with no differences in epitope specificities in samples with higher GAD65Ab titers. Disease duration (initial diabetes diagnosis until sample collection or development of insulin requirement) in nonprogressed and progressed LADA patients, respectively, was not correlated with epitope specificity, suggesting lack of epitope maturation. This was supported by epitope analyses of longitudinal samples from LADA patients during progression to insulin requirement.

Conclusions

First, the GAD65Ab-specific autoimmune reaction in type 1 diabetic patients with low and moderate GAD65Ab titers differs from that in LADA patients, irrespective of insulin requirement. Second, the GAD65Ab-specific autoimmune response in LADA patients does not change after their initial diabetes diagnosis. Finally, LADA patients with high GAD65Ab titers resemble type 1 diabetic patients in their GAD65Ab epitope specificity.

### Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes in Europe is prevalent with a broad clinical phenotype: action LADA 7 [^424fa523]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Specific autoantibodies characterize type 1 diabetes in childhood but are also found in adult-onset diabetes, even when initially non-insulin requiring, e.g., with latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA). We aimed to characterize adult-onset autoimmune diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We consecutively studied 6,156 European diabetic patients attending clinics within 5 years of diagnosis (age range, 30–70 years) examined cross-sectionally clinically and for GAD antibodies (GADA) and antibodies to insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2A) and zinc-transporter 8 (ZnT8A).

Results

Of 6,156 patients, 541 (8.8%) had GADA and only 57 (0.9%) IA-2A or ZnT8A alone. More autoantibody-positive than autoantibody-negative patients were younger, leaner, on insulin (49.5 vs. 13.2%), and female (P < 0.0001 for each), though LADA patients (9.7% of total) did not show categorically distinct clinical features from autoantibody-negative type 2 diabetes. Similarly, more GADA patients with high (> 200 World Health Organization IU) (n = 403) compared with low (n = 138) titer were female, lean, and insulin treated (54.6 vs. 39.7%) (P < 0.02 for each). Autoantibody-positive patients usually had GADA (541 of 598; 90.5%) and had LADA more often than type 1 autoimmune diabetes (odds ratio 3.3).

Conclusions

Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes emerges as a prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes. Our results indicate that adult-onset autoimmune diabetes in Europe encompasses type 1 diabetes and LADA in the same broad clinical and autoantibody-positive spectrum. At diagnosis, patients with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes are usually non-insulin requiring and clinically indistinguishable from patients with type 2 diabetes, though they tend to be younger and leaner. Only with screening for autoantibodies, especially GADA, can they be identified with certainty.

### Metabolic syndrome and autoimmune diabetes: action LADA 3 [^d27516c0]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — The purpose of this study was to estimate whether prevalence of metabolic syndrome in adult European diabetic patients is associated with type of diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A consecutive series of patients attending hospital-based diabetes clinics were assessed for the frequency of metabolic syndrome and compared with population-based control subjects as part of the Action LADA study. In total, 2,011 subjects (aged 30–70 years) were studied, including 1,247 patients with recent-onset type 2 diabetes without glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADAs), 117 non–insulin-requiring patients with GADAs who had not received insulin therapy for at least 6 months after diagnosis (designated latent autoimmune diabetes of adults [LADA]), 288 type 1 diabetic patients, and 359 normal subjects.

RESULTS — Frequency of metabolic syndrome was significantly different in patients with type 1 diabetes (31.9%) and LADA (41.9%) (P = 0.015) and in both conditions was less frequent than in type 2 diabetic patients (88.8%) (P < 0.0001 for each). Eliminating glucose as a variable, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was similar in patients with autoimmune diabetes (type 1 diabetes and/or LADA) (17.3%) and control subjects (23.7%) but remained more common in type 2 diabetic patients (47.8%) (P = 0.001 for all groups). In both type 1 diabetic patients and those with LADA, individual components of metabolic syndrome were similar but less common than in type 2 diabetic patients (P < 0.0001 for each).

CONCLUSIONS — The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients than in patients with LADA or adults with type 1 diabetes. Excluding glucose as a variable, metabolic syndrome is not more prevalent in patients with autoimmune diabetes than in control subjects. Metabolic syndrome is not a characteristic of autoimmune diabetes.

### Frequency, immunogenetics, and clinical characteristics of latent autoimmune diabetes in China (LADA China study): a nationwide, multicenter, clinic-based cross-sectional study [^883ef43c]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This report is the first multicenter study in China to assess GADA in a large number of diabetic case subjects (4,880 patients) across a large group of centers (25 cities and 46 hospitals) throughout China. The study is also distinct in reporting the clinical, metabolic, and immunogenetic features of LADA in China. From these analyses, autoimmune diabetes and LADA emerge as a prevalent form of diabetes with features remarkably similar to those in adult-onset autoimmune diabetes and LADA in Europe and North America.

Differences in the prevalence of LADA worldwide can be ascribed to age at diagnosis, mode of ascertainment, number of autoantibodies tested, risk of false positivity for autoantibodies, disease duration at study, and the numbers of patients progressing to insulin treatment. When defined as LADA using the IDS criteria, the prevalence of LADA was 5.9% by GADA. Although several diabetes-associated autoantibodies can be used for LADA diagnosis, in Caucasians GADA is the most prevalent autoantibody, as has been noted by us in a small Chinese study of a similar cohort (Z.Z. manuscript in preparation). It is noteworthy that GADA positivity was defined as a titer above the 99.5th centile of the healthy background population so that only 1 of 200 subjects could have a false-positive result. Further, in this study, we centralized the assays and retested to confirm all positive results, further decreasing false positivity. There may be a bias toward transient early insulin therapy in the hospital-based clinics used in this study (vs. community-based clinics), so we ascertained cases with insulin independence at 6 months postdiagnosis. It is likely we excluded GADA-positive patients who started on insulin within 6 months, although a recent small population-based study of Tianjin in the northern part of China found LADA in 9.2% of adult-onset diabetic patients who were initially non–insulin requiring from a local community-based study. Age at diagnosis also has a major effect on GADA frequency, which was higher (11.7%) in younger patients (aged 15–30 years at diagnosis) — ascertained as part of this study but not reported here (data not shown) — than in those diagnosed later, in whom there was no age effect.

### Heterogeneity of patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults: linkage to autoimmunity is apparent only in those with perceived need for insulin treatment: results from the nord-Tr ø ndelag health (HUNT) study [^fe24cf6f]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Subjects with the diagnosis of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) are more prone to need insulin treatment than those with type 2 diabetes. However, not all patients with LADA develop the need for insulin treatment, indicating the heterogeneity of LADA. We investigated this heterogeneity by comparing phenotypes of LADA with and without perceived need for insulin treatment (data obtained at times when diagnosis of LADA was not investigated) and also compared LADA and type 2 diabetes phenotypes.

Research Design and Methods

We used data from the all population-based Nord-Trøndelag Health study (n = 64,931), performed in 1995–1997. Data were assembled for individuals with LADA (n = 106) and type 2 diabetes (n = 943).

Results

In the comparison of individuals with LADA both with and without the need for insulin, insulin-treated subjects had higher titers of GAD antibodies (P < 0.001) and lower fasting C-peptide levels (P < 0.001). GAD antibodies and C-peptide correlated negatively (r = -0.40; P = 0.009). In the comparison of individuals with LADA and type 2 diabetes, all without the need for insulin, markers of metabolic syndrome were equally prevalent and pronounced. Age, C-peptide, and glucose levels were also similar. In the comparison of insulin-treated individuals with LADA and type 2 diabetes, more patients with LADA received insulin (40 vs. 22%, P < 0.001) and C-peptide levels were lower (P < 0.001). Patients with LADA were leaner but were still overweight (mean BMI 28.7 vs. 30.9 kg/m2 in type 2 diabetes, P < 0.001). In the comparison of type 2 diabetic patients with and without insulin, insulin-treated subjects were more obese and had higher A1C and lower C-peptide levels (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our conclusions are that 1) the need for insulin treatment in LADA is linked to the degree of autoimmunity and beta-cell failure, 2) subjects with LADA and type 2 diabetes without the need for insulin treatment are phenotypically similar, and 3) insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients is associated with both insulin resistance and beta-cell insufficiency.

### Prevalence and factors associated with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA): a cross-sectional study [^3e5651c8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Comparison of characteristics between patients with LADA and type 2 diabetes mellitus

The mean BMI of LADA patients was 28.5 (SD, 3.9), and the mean BMI for Type 2 patients was 27.4 (SD, 5.4) (p- value = 0.39). Underweight was observed in 7 (4.7%) of Type 2 diabetics and none of LADA patients. The normal weight was observed in 2 (25%) of LADA patients and 43 (29.1%) of Type 2 diabetic patients. The obese and overweight groups in the LADA and Type 2 diabetic patients were observed in 6 (66.2%) and 96 (75%) (Table 1). The study also enabled LADA patients' stratification by their age groups to show its distribution among the study population (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Distribution of LADA patients by age group

Diabetes risk factors were examined, of which 4 (50%) of LADA patients had a history of alcohol intake, which is higher than 55 (37.2%) of Type 2 diabetes (p = 0.478). The proportion of history of cigarette smoking was 1 (12.5%) for LADA and 23 (15.5%) for Type 2 diabetes (p = 1.00). Family history of first-degree relatives with diabetes among Type 2 diabetes had a higher proportion of 69 (46.6%) and 3 (37.5%) was observed in LADA patients which was not statistically significant (Table 1).
