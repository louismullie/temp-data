## Question

How would you counsel a caregiver of an ICU survivor about the expected benefits of The Caregiver Pathway at 3 months?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel a caregiver of an ICU survivor about the expected benefits of The Caregiver Pathway at 3 months. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the intervention components and the strength of evidence. Then, I should verify which outcomes were measured and how they were analyzed. Next, I will examine the magnitude of benefit in the subgroup of caregivers of survivors, and I should double-check whether effects persisted beyond 3 months. After that, I need to consider limitations and generalizability. Finally, I will translate this into practical, empathetic counseling points and note what to do if the patient did not survive, since the RCT found no benefit for bereaved caregivers at 3 months [^a59a3f98] [^e72f6841].

> Let me first confirm the intervention and its evidence base. The Caregiver Pathway is a four-step, nurse-led model: a structured needs assessment and conversation early in the ICU stay, a supportive card at ICU discharge, an offer of a phone call after transfer or discharge, and a structured 3-month follow-up conversation; nurses delivering the intervention were trained in communication and the model was delivered with fidelity in a single-center RCT at Oslo University Hospital, which is the highest-quality evidence we have for this specific program [^5d0193ce] [^4a702828].

> Wait, let me verify the outcomes and analysis. The RCT measured PTSD symptoms with the IES-R, anxiety and depression with HADS, health-related quality of life with SF-12, and hope with the Herth Hope Index at baseline and 3 months; importantly, the primary analysis across all caregivers showed no significant difference, but a prespecified subgroup analysis restricted to caregivers of patients who survived the ICU stay found significant benefits, which is the key result for counseling here [^a59a3f98] [^e72f6841].

> I will now examine the magnitude of benefit for caregivers of survivors at 3 months. PTSD symptoms were about 8 points lower on the IES-R in the intervention group versus controls, which is a clinically meaningful reduction, and the proportion scoring above 33 (a high-risk threshold) dropped from 55% in controls to 24% in the intervention group; anxiety and depression subscores on HADS were also about 2.2 and 1.5 points lower, respectively, and physical functioning on SF-12 improved by roughly 10 points, while hope increased by about 2.4 points, all favoring the intervention in survivors' caregivers [^e72f6841] [^a59a3f98].

> Hold on, I should verify durability beyond 3 months. The long-term RCT follow-up shows that PTSD symptoms remained about 10 points lower at 6 and 12 months in caregivers of survivors who received the intervention, with sustained improvements in anxiety at 6 and 12 months and in depression at 6 months, along with gains in hope and HRQoL subdomains, which strengthens confidence that the 3-month signal reflects a durable benefit rather than a transient blip [^a87213b0] [^e9cbeb5a].

> But wait, what if the patient did not survive? I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. The RCT found no significant benefit for bereaved caregivers at 3 months, and the authors note that bereaved caregivers may need different, more intensive supports and longer timelines to show improvement; therefore, counseling should be tailored and, when relevant, connect bereaved caregivers with palliative care and grief resources rather than promising the same 3-month outcomes seen in survivors' caregivers [^a59a3f98] [^c4285910] [^936a27d3].

> Next, I should review limitations to set expectations. This is a single-center study with modest sample sizes in subgroup analyses, and although the intervention was delivered with fidelity, replication in other centers and systems is needed; moreover, the control group still received standard ICU family support, so the observed differences reflect added value of the structured pathway rather than care versus no care, which is reassuring but still warrants cautious interpretation [^e00d7d5a] [^4a702828].

> Let me translate this into practical counseling. I would explain that The Caregiver Pathway provides structured, individual follow-up from ICU admission through 3 months, including early needs assessment, a supportive card, an offer of a check-in call, and a 3-month conversation to process experiences and connect with resources; in caregivers of survivors, this approach has been linked to fewer PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms, better physical functioning, and more hope at 3 months, with benefits persisting at 6 to 12 months, which can help caregivers cope with the ongoing demands of supporting an ICU survivor [^5d0193ce] [^a87213b0] [^e9cbeb5a].

> I should confirm the clinical significance in plain language. For PTSD, moving from an average score around 32 to 23 and cutting the proportion with high-risk scores by more than half is a meaningful change that can translate into less intrusive memories, less avoidance, and better sleep; similarly, 1–2 point reductions in anxiety and depression on HADS can shift many caregivers from probable disorder to borderline or nonclinical ranges, and a 10-point gain in physical functioning can reflect less fatigue and better ability to manage daily tasks and caregiving duties [^e72f6841] [^706b6da8].

> Hold on, I should verify what to say if the caregiver is already experiencing high distress. Exploratory analyses suggest caregivers with more severe baseline depressive symptoms may not show the same short-term PTSD benefit, so I would emphasize that the pathway can still help and that additional supports — such as referral to psychology, social work, or community services — can be integrated if symptoms persist or worsen, aligning with the model's flexibility and the authors' recommendations [^bbd02333] [^c4285910].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling is balanced and realistic. I would note that while many caregivers benefit, not everyone will experience large improvements by 3 months, and the intervention complements — but does not replace — standard ICU family support; I would also screen for anxiety, depression, and PTSD using validated tools like HADS and IES-R at follow-up and connect caregivers with local resources, peer support, and post-ICU clinics when available, reinforcing that recovery is a trajectory and that ongoing support is appropriate and expected [^706b6da8] [^73682fd6] [^bd4da707].

The Caregiver Pathway is associated with **significant improvements at 3 months** for caregivers of ICU survivors, including **reduced PTSD, anxiety, and depression** [^a59a3f98] and improved physical functioning and hope [^e72f6841]. These benefits are most pronounced in caregivers of patients who survived the ICU stay [^cbc5f88e] and are supported by a randomized controlled trial [^a59a3f98]. Counsel caregivers that participation can **lower distress and improve well-being** [^ff5ff58d], but emphasize that effects may vary and that ongoing support remains important [^c4285910].

## Key benefits at 3 months

### Primary outcomes: PTSD, anxiety, and depression

- **PTSD symptoms**: Significant reduction in PTSD symptoms (IES-R) in caregivers of survivors (B = -8.2; 95% CI, -14.2 to -2.2; p = 0.008) [^a59a3f98] [^e72f6841].
- **Anxiety and depression**: Significant reductions in anxiety (B = -2.2; 95% CI, -4.0 to -0.5; p = 0.014) and depression (B = -1.5; 95% CI, -2.9 to -0.1; p = 0.035) on HADS [^a59a3f98] [^e72f6841].
- **Clinical significance**: PTSD scores moved from a mean of 31.7 (control) to 23.0 (intervention), with the proportion scoring > 33 dropping from 55% to 24% [^e72f6841].

---

### Secondary outcomes: health-related quality of life and hope

- **Physical functioning**: Improved SF-12 physical component scores (B = 9.7; 95% CI, 0.3–19.0; p = 0.043) [^a59a3f98] [^e72f6841].
- **Hope**: Increased hope scores on the Herth Hope Index (B = 2.4; 95% CI, 0.4–4.3; p = 0.017) [^a59a3f98] [^e72f6841].

---

## Clinical significance and practical implications

The observed reductions in PTSD, anxiety, and depression are **clinically meaningful** and likely to improve daily functioning and quality of life [^e72f6841]. Improved physical functioning and hope further support **better adaptation to caregiving roles** and reduced burden [^4fe0b1f5].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: Single-center study; results may vary in other settings [^e00d7d5a].
- **Bereaved caregivers**: No significant benefit at 3 months; additional support may be needed [^a59a3f98] [^c4285910].
- **Implementation**: Requires trained staff and resources; feasibility depends on local capacity [^4a702828] [^e00d7d5a].

---

## Counseling points for caregivers

When counseling caregivers, **emphasize the following**:

- **Expected benefits**: Reduced PTSD, anxiety, and depression; improved physical functioning and hope at 3 months [^a59a3f98] [^e72f6841].
- **Variability**: Benefits may vary; ongoing support and follow-up are important [^c4285910].
- **Active participation**: Engaging in the pathway's steps (early assessment, supportive card, phone call, 3-month conversation) is key to realizing benefits [^5d0193ce].
- **Additional support**: Caregivers with high baseline distress or bereavement may need extra resources [^c4285910] [^4909bd73].

The Caregiver Pathway is associated with **significant improvements at 3 months** for caregivers of ICU survivors, including reduced PTSD, anxiety, and depression, and improved physical functioning and hope [^a59a3f98]. These benefits are most pronounced in caregivers of patients who survived the ICU stay [^cbc5f88e] and are supported by a randomized controlled trial [^a59a3f98]. Counsel caregivers that participation can lower distress and improve well-being, but emphasize that effects may vary and that ongoing support remains important [^c4285910].

KEY POINTS

Question: Could "The Caregiver Pathway" model improve follow-up of family caregivers to critically ill patients and help reduce Post-Intensive Care Syndrome-Family (PICS-F) symptoms for these caregivers?

Findings: A randomized controlled trial at 3 months showed "The Caregiver Pathway" to be associated with reduced symptoms of PICS-F in terms of reduced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression for caregivers of surviving patients, compared with controls with surviving patients.

Meaning: Structured, individual follow-up of family caregivers of critically ill patients can reduce PICS-F symptoms for family caregivers of patients surviving ICU stays.

Family caregivers of critically ill patients are in a dire situation and at risk for developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, symptoms known as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome-Family (PICS-F). These symptoms can profoundly impact their quality of life in the time after the incident. PICS-F is of major concern for critical care medicine, as the number of people being treated for critical illness is increasing, accompanied by the number of subsequent family caregivers. While efforts have been made to meet these dire challenges, models to follow-up family caregivers are urgently needed. "The Caregiver Pathway" was developed to meet this disparity, with the model innovatively introducing follow-up of family caregivers in an individual and structured way.

The current study sought to test short-term (i.e. 3-mo) efficacy of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), with the aim of reducing the symptoms of PICS-F among family caregivers who received the intervention, compared with family caregivers in the control group. The primary outcomes are symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression and secondary outcomes health-related quality of life (HRQoL), self-efficacy, and hope.

Objectives

Explore short-term effects of "The Caregiver Pathway", an intervention for family caregiver follow-up, on Post-Intensive Care Syndrome symptoms among families (PICS-F).

Design

A randomized controlled trial.

Setting

A medical ICU at a Norwegian University Hospital.

Participants

One hundred ninety-six family caregivers of critically ill patients randomized to an intervention (n = 101) or control group (n = 95).

Interventions

"The Caregiver Pathway" four-step model offers individual and structured follow-up, including: 1) mapping family caregivers' needs and concerns with an assessment tool followed by a conversation with an ICU nurse within the first days at the ICU, 2) a supportive card when leaving the ICU, 3) offer for the family caregivers to receive a phone call after ICU patient discharge, and 4) a follow-up conversation within 3 months.

Measurements and Main Results

Data were collected at baseline and after 3 months and analyzed using linear regression. No significant effects were detected when comparing all participants completing 3-month outcome measurements (n = 144). A subgroups analysis stratified on patient survival, however, showed statistically significant effect for family caregivers of patients surviving the ICU stay receiving the intervention compared with controls. Caregivers of surviving patients reported improved symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder, measured by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (B = -8.2 [95% CI, -14.2 to -2.2]; p = 0.008), anxiety (B = -2.2 [95% CI, -4.0 to -0.5]; p = 0.014), and depression (B = -1.5 [95% CI, -2.9 to -0.1]; p = 0.035); measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, subscore physical functioning in health-related quality of life (B = 9.7 [95% CI, 0.3–19.0]; p = 0.043); measured by Short Form 12-Item Health Survey; and hope (B = 2.4 [95% CI, 0.4–4.3]; p = 0.017) and measured by the Herth Hope Index. At 3-month, the model did not appear to improve the outcomes for family caregivers of nonsurviving patients.

Conclusions

"The Caregiver Pathway" intervention was associated with reduced symptoms of PICS-F in family caregivers of surviving ICU patients compared with controls.

### The caregiver pathway intervention can contribute to reduced post-intensive care syndrome among family caregivers of ICU survivors: a randomized controlled trial [^cbc5f88e]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

At 3 months, considering the sample as a whole, no statistically significant differences between family caregivers receiving the intervention and those in the control group where identified. Subgroup analyses stratified on whether the patients survived the critical illness or not, did detect significantly lower symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression for family caregivers receiving the intervention compared with those who did not, when the patient survived. As the elements of PICS-F (i.e. symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression) can have long-lasting negative impact not only on the family caregivers but on the entire family, profoundly impacting their quality of life, interventions to alleviate this overwhelming impact are of great importance. There are also indications that hope plays an important role in preventing PICS-F, and levels of hope did increase among family caregivers to patient who survived and received "The Caregiver Pathway" intervention.

### The caregiver pathway intervention can contribute to reduced post-intensive care syndrome among family caregivers of ICU survivors: a randomized controlled trial [^5d0193ce]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics South-East Norway (Approval number: 199446; Approval date: March 15, 2021; Title: Pårørende til kritisk syke — Veien videre) and the Institutional Review Board at OUH (21/03594) and registered in(NCT04839406) prior to study enrollment.

Intervention

"The Caregiver Pathway" four-step model offers individual and structured follow-up of family caregivers of critically ill patients (Fig. 1; and Supplement 1). In step 1, within the first days at the hospital, the family caregivers are offered an individual conversation through a digital assessment tool, assisted by an ICU nurse, where the family caregivers can articulate how they are doing and mark their needs and concerns. The assessment tool generates a summary to be used in a conversation with the ICU nurse, who then can support and provide follow-up from a social worker, priest, or psychiatrist if required or appropriate. In step 2, the family caregivers receive a preprinted card with information and support when leaving the ICU. In step 3, family caregivers receive a text message offering a phone call if the patient is transferred to a step-down unit. Step 4 entails an individual follow-up conversation with an ICU nurse, following a template, within 3-month post-ICU discharge. Family caregivers are given the opportunity to talk about their ICU experiences, clarify any potential misunderstandings, and eventually process challenging situations. If required or deemed beneficial, a physician is invited to the follow-up conversation. The family caregivers are also asked about their current situation and information about available resources for support locally or nationally are provided if needed.

The tailored approach in "The Caregiver Pathway" seeks to ensure appropriate steps are offered to each family caregiver. The clinical course, the length of stay, and the outcome may vary considerably, and all four steps from the model may not be suitable in all cases. For example, in this study, the first conversation (step 1) was not offered if the patient was about to pass away after a short stay at the ICU. The discharge conversation (step 3) was only offered to family caregivers of patients transferred to step-down units. However, the supportive card (step 2) and the follow-up conversation (step 4) were offered to all family caregivers, bereaved or not (Fig. 1; and Supplement 1).

Psychosocial Outcomes

No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in primary and secondary outcomes after 3 months (n = 144) (Table 2). However, subgroup analyses stratified by patient survival revealed statistically significant differences between the intervention and control group among family caregivers of patients who survived (Table 3). For symptoms of PTSD, adjusted analyses showed that the intervention group (mean IES-R total: 23.0) scored on average eight points lower (B = –8.2 [95% CI, –14.2 to –2.2]; p = 0.008) compared with the control group (mean IES-R total: 31.7). Among caregivers of patients who survived, 24% (13/55) in the intervention group reported IES-R greater than 33, compared with 55% (29/53) in the control group. In addition, statistically significant lower symptoms of anxiety (B = –2.2 [95% CI, –4.0 to –0.5]; p = 0.014) and depression (B = –1.5 [95% CI, –2.9 to –0.1]; p = 0.035), as well as statistically significant higher (PCS-12) (B = 9.7 [95% CI, 0.3–19.0]; p = 0.043) and levels of hope (B = 2.4 [95% CI, 0.4–4.3]; p = 0.017) were detected in favor of the intervention group. No significant differences in symptoms of PTSD were detected among the bereaved caregivers (Table 4), although level of PTSD symptoms were high in both groups (IES-R total intervention group: 37.3; control group: 34.6).

Intervention group

The Caregiver Pathway model consists of 4 steps. Step 1, within the first days at the hospital, the family caregivers are offered a get-to-know conversation where they can mark their needs, concerns, and preferences through a digital assessment tool. The assessment tool generates a summary to be used in a subsequent conversation with an ICU nurse. Step 2 is a card containing information and support, handed out upon patient discharge from the ICU or death. Step 3 is a text message offering a phone call a few days after discharge to clarify any questions, concerns, or needs for information. Step 4 is an individual follow-up conversation offered within 3 months after the hospital stay. This conversation is semi-structured, and the family caregivers are encouraged to talk about their experiences and process situations if necessary. If considered beneficial or needed, a physician who knew the patient from the admission is invited to participate.

Through the model, the family caregivers are also informed about available resources locally or nationally if considered appropriate and beneficial. See Fig. 1 for a model overview and electronic supplementary material 2 for details.

Fig. 1
4 steps of The Caregiver Pathway intervention adapted from Watland et al.

The individual approach ensures appropriate adjustments based on the situation at hand. For example, if the patient is deemed close to death shortly after ICU admission, Step 1 would not be offered. Also, Step 3 is not offered for bereaved caregivers.

Data collection

Demographic questions (e.g. age, education, relationship to patient, patient age, gender, and reason for ICU admission) were collected at baseline, and study variables at baseline, 3 (i.e. reported elsewhere), 6, and 12 months, and submitted through a secure server (i.e. Services for Sensitive Data, University of Oslo).

Purpose

A long-term evaluation of The Caregiver Pathway, a model to follow up family caregivers on Post-intensive Care Symptoms among Family (PICS-F).

Methods

A single-center non-blinded randomized controlled trial including 196 family caregivers to critically ill patients randomized to intervention (n = 101) or control group (n = 95). The Caregiver Pathway intervention consists of: (1) a digital assessment followed by a conversation with a nurse in the first days at the ICU, (2) a supportive card when leaving the ICU, (3) an offer to receive a phone call following patient transfer to a step-down unit, and (4) a follow-up conversation within 3 months after discharge. Outcome measures were collected at 6 and 12 months, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL), hope, and self-efficacy.

Results

The Caregiver Pathway was associated with a significant effect for symptoms of PTSD after 6 months compared with controls, mean IES-R score: 25.8 [95% CI 21.9–29.7] versus 30.9 [95% CI 26.7–35.0], p = 0.009, and a trend toward an effect after 12 months: IES-R score: 25.0 [95% CI 21.3–28.7] versus 28.4 [95% CI 24.1–32.7], p = 0.057. Subgroup analyses at 12 months showed a significant intervention effect among family caregivers of patients who survived compared to controls for PTSD, IES-R score: 19.8 [95% CI 15.3–24.2] versus 29.1 [95% CI 23.5–34.6], p = 0.001, and anxiety, HADS-A score: 4.3 [95% CI 3.1–5.4] versus 6.8 [95% CI 5.2–8.4], p = 0.003.

Conclusions

The Caregiver Pathway has the potential to reduce the symptoms of PICS-F, especially among family caregivers whose patient has survived.

Data Collection and Outcome Measurements

Demographic data included family caregiver gender, age, and education. The family caregivers also provided information about their relationship to the patient and the patient's age, gender, and reason for admission to the ICU. Outcome measurements were collected at baseline and after 3 months. The intervention group received the 3-month measurements median 30 days (range, 0–83 d) after the follow-up conversation.

Primary Outcomes

Symptoms of PTSD were measured by the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), with the subscales Intrusion (eight items), Avoidance (eight items), and Hyperarousal (six items). Each item has a score range from 0 to 4, resulting in a total score of 0–88. Higher scores indicate more symptoms of PTSD. Although IES-R was not designed for a universal cutoff, a score above 24 has been found to indicate PTSD symptoms as a clinical concern, and scores above 30 or 33 have been proposed as a cutoff for high-risk PTSD.

Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a 14-item measure of psychological distress divided into two subscales: anxiety (HADS-A) (seven items) and depression (HADS-D) (seven items), with a score range of 0–21 for each subscale. Scores below 8 are considered nonclinical, scores from 8 to 10 as suggestive, and scores of 11 and above as probable presence of mood disorder.

Secondary Outcomes

HRQoL was measured by the Short Form 12-Item Health Survey. The scale has a Mental Component Score-12 and a Physical Component Score-12 (PCS-12). Summary scores range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate better health. Self-efficacy was measured by the General Self-Efficacy (GSE) scale. Total score ranges from 10 to 40, and higher scores indicate higher perceived GSE. Hope was measured by the Herth Hope Index, total scores range from 12 to 48, and higher scores indicate a higher level of hope. Reliability and validity were established for all outcome measurements (.).

Symptoms of depression at baseline appeared to have an impact, as exploratory analyses, stratified on baseline HADS-D scores revealed family caregivers with HADS-D less than or equal to 11 (mean HADS-D: 6.1) in the intervention group, compared with the control group, to have significantly lower symptoms of PTSD (Supplement 2, Table S1). No such differences were observed among family caregiver with HADS-D greater than 11 (mean HADS-D: 14.8).

Introduction

Family caregivers of critically ill patients are in a challenging situation. Their experience can be traumatic, and they often feel scared, helpless, and vulnerable. They are therefore at risk of developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and prolonged grief, symptoms also known as Post-intensive Care Symptoms-Family (PICS-F). Advice on how to support family caregivers has been presented in the Patient and Family Centered Care guidelines. Attempts to diminish the negative long-term consequences for family caregivers have included information leaflets, diaries, participation in patient care, communication facilitators, condolence letters and an online information tool about PTSD, all with varying success and impact. Actual models to support family caregivers of critically ill patients are therefore called for.

The Caregiver Pathway model was developed with an emphasis on individual and structured follow-up from ICU admission until after homecoming. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation of the model after 3 months (i.e. short term) showed no overall significant differences between the intervention and control groups. However, family caregivers of patients who survived the ICU stay and received the intervention had significantly fewer symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression, and reported higher Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) for physical functioning and hope compared to controls.

The current study sought to evaluate 6 and 12 months (i.e. long-term) effects of The Caregiver Pathway intervention through a continuation of the ongoing RCT. Symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression (i.e. primary outcomes) and HRQoL, hope, and self-efficacy (i.e. secondary outcomes) were measured.

### The caregiver pathway intervention can contribute to reduced post-intensive care syndrome among family caregivers of ICU survivors: a randomized controlled trial [^c4285910]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

"The Caregiver Pathway" aims to improve strategies for effective, structured communication between staff and the family caregivers with emphasis on empathy and acknowledging emotions as this have been suggested to reduce the risk of developing PICS-F. The ICU nurses offering "The Caregiver Pathway" in this study were trained in communication. The bedside manner: to be aware of nonverbal interaction as showing empathy, listen actively, and attentive to each individual person, has been described as important for communication with family caregivers, all values and skills well-integrated among the ICU nurses delivering the intervention in this study.

When a patient dies at the ICU, the family caregivers are at special risk for developing psychological challenges, including major depressive disorder, complicated grief, and PTSD. This naturally indicates a more complicated and distressing situation and could be at least part of the reason why the results in the current study were more impactful for family caregivers whose patient survived. For the bereaved family caregivers, additional steps could be included in "The Caregiver Pathway" model in the future, as a recent study showed how a three-step support strategy decreased the level of complicated grief after six months among bereaved family caregivers after patient critical illness. It is also possible that the bereaved family caregivers in the current study might have benefited from more time to recover after the loss, and new measurements (e.g. after 6 or 12 mo) might have captured this improvement. Family caregivers in the intervention group with baseline symptoms of depression above 11 also appeared to have had no statistically significant effect of the intervention in terms of reduced symptoms of PTSD. This could indicate that more severe symptoms may require more extensive follow-up. As such, the "The Caregiver Pathway" may not be enough support for all family caregivers and should perhaps be combined, for example, with follow-up from local community services or referral to other additional support (e.g. general practitioner, social worker, priest, psychiatrist) if needed.

### Effects of the caregiver pathway intervention on symptoms of post-intensive care syndrome among family caregivers to critically ill patients: long-term results from a randomized controlled trial [^4fe0b1f5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows how The Caregiver Pathway can be associated with long-term effects in terms of reduced symptoms of PTSD for family caregivers of critically ill patients over the course of 12 months. No significant between-group differences were found for anxiety, depression, HRQoL, or hope, but a trend was detected toward significance for self-efficacy.

For family caregivers whose patients survived, the significant decrease in symptoms of PTSD and anxiety (i.e. 6 and 12 months) and in symptoms of depression (i.e. 6 months), along with an increase in HRQoL, sub-score physical functioning (i.e. 6 months), mental functioning, and hope (i.e. 12 months) underlines the potential effect and importance of The Caregiver Pathway for this group of caregivers. The findings also reveal a sustainability of the previously published 3-month results.

The reduction of PICS-F symptoms seen may have a vital impact for family caregivers as well as their patients as the patient is often in need of support from the family caregivers in the process of recovery. While a number of studies have described attempts to reduce the symptoms of PICS-F, few have proven successful. For example, use of diaries has shown some indications of reducing symptoms of PTSD, whereas a family participation program, nurse facilitators or an online information tool about PTSD has not been able to establish effect on psychosocial outcomes.

The strength of The Caregiver Pathway may be in the emphasis on individual and structured follow-up from admission to after discharge. The model starts by paying attention to the family caregivers by listening, showing empathy, acknowledging emotions, and enabling them to articulate their concerns and process situations if needed (Step 1). This is an acknowledged approach, with talking about frightening situations potentially reducing anxiety and diminishing fear, which in turn might reduce symptoms of PTSD. The model continues with including a supportive card (Step 2) and offering a discharge conversation (Step 3), both underlining the importance of caring. In the follow-up conversation (Step 4), the family caregivers can receive support in processing the experiences from the ICU if needed. Processing, along with exposure to the circumstances associated with the traumatic event, could be therapeutic in terms of symptoms of PTSD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design

Family caregivers were recruited to a single-center RCT from the medical ICU (MICU) at Oslo University Hospital (OUH), Norway, from April 2021 to August 2023. The inclusion criteria were being able to understand and speak Norwegian, being between 18 and 70 years old, and with the patient expected to be invasive ventilated for at least 48 hours. For each patient, one to three family caregivers could be included. ICU bedside nurses identified potential participants and asked if they would like to receive information about the study. Those interested were introduced to the study by the first author (i.e. an ICU nurse) by phone or face-to-face if present at the ICU. If willing to participate, the family caregivers received an e-mail with a link to the informed consent form or a paper-based form if preferred. When the informed consent was signed and the baseline outcome measurements completed, the first author randomized family caregivers to the intervention or control groups using a computerized randomization program (R-tool: RNGCryptoServiceProvider in Microsoft.net, Block size: 10; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). If more than one family caregiver for a patient were included in the study, all were allocated to the same group (i.e. intervention or control). The intervention was initiated 1–3 days after randomization.

All family caregivers received standard care, including spontaneous conversations with the ICU nurses and meetings with the physicians. If needed, all participants could be referred for additional support at the hospital (e.g. the social worker). In addition, the intervention group received follow-up in line with "The Caregiver Pathway" delivered by one of 11 dedicated ICU nurses from the MICU. The 11 ICU nurses were trained in communication skills, such as the mnemonic VALUE method; Value family contribution, Acknowledge emotions, Listen, Humanity, and the Eliciting of information, received an introduction course (3 hr) about "The Caregiver Pathway" model and participated in regular meetings for education and support three to four times a year. Other staff at the MICU did not know the content of "The Caregiver Pathway".

Future directions

The most vulnerable family caregivers with complex issues might require even more intensive and prolonged types of support than the support given through The Caregiver Pathway. Future studies and clinical care of family caregivers should take this aspect into consideration, perhaps particularly for family caregivers whose patients pass away. The Caregiver Pathway also facilitates expansion of care when deemed necessary, for example through involvement from psychology/psychiatry, a notion that should be taken into account by future research. The emotional strain and resources demanded for ICU nurses should also be further explored, as should the potential impact of such caregiver models on the participating ICU nurses themselves.

### Effects of the caregiver pathway intervention on symptoms of post-intensive care syndrome among family caregivers to critically ill patients: long-term results from a randomized controlled trial [^150f9229]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The high symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression for the bereaved family caregivers in the intervention group underline the need for palliative care and follow-up. The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine has outlined guidelines for care and future research concerning palliative care at the ICU. End-of-life care has, for example, shown to be improved by communication facilitators conversations following a template, and including a bereavement leaflet, and a three-step support strategy with special awareness of the family caregiver's needs and reactions. Further support at the ICU and a broader collaboration with external agencies and organizations, for example, through religious support, could also be beneficial.

The Caregiver Pathway model was led by ICU nurses during this RCT. More than 40% of ICU professionals report high levels of burnout, and recognized programs supporting healthcare providers are unfortunately currently lacking. Adding new tasks to their workload must therefore be thoroughly deliberated. However, follow-up of patients and family caregivers has also been found to be rewarding for the ICU staff. Considering the potential impact of caregiver support programs such as The Caregiver Pathway, it does however appear crucial for hospital management to, while encouraging the ICU nurses to manage family caregiver follow-up, also provide the necessary support, time, and resources for such support. Short- and long-term findings from this RCT indicating reduction in symptoms of PTSD underline the importance of such care. The Caregiver Pathway has been recognized as showing distinct promise and is currently being implemented into regular care at the hospital ICU of project initiation.

### The caregiver pathway intervention can contribute to reduced post-intensive care syndrome among family caregivers of ICU survivors: a randomized controlled trial [^e00d7d5a]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As the ICU nurses often handle family crises combined with providing close monitoring and care to critically ill patients, identifying family caregiver in need of more support is vital for the family caregivers as well as for the ICU nurses. For models such as in this intervention to succeed; however, it is important for managers and employers to provide resources to the ICU nurses to implement and conduct the model in otherwise hectic work environments.

"The Caregiver Pathway" was built on the value of narrative along with individual and structured care. The ICU nurses were aware of the need for articulation of family caregivers' needs, concerns, and emotions, and as a part of the model took family caregivers aside in the middle of the chaotic ICU environment and simply asked them how they were doing. Being met in such a structured, personalized way both at the hospital and in the time after were shown to be associated with reduced symptoms of PICS-F among family caregivers to patients who survived.

This study has some limitations. First, there is sparse information about the potential eligibility of family caregivers during the study as the ICU nurses only forwarded information of those interested. Second, all family caregivers in the ICU received standard care, which is influenced by the physicians and ICU nurses' bedside and differences in standard care could have been present. Third, three family caregivers were included from each patient in the current study to capture the experiences of a broad sample of caregivers, independent of relation. Analyses with only one caregiver per patient (e.g. partner) could have impacted the results. However, excluding caregivers already included in the study from the analysis could introduce bias and were, therefore, not conducted. Finally, as this is a single-center study using complete cases, and subgroups analyses were based on small sample sizes, potentially impacting the precision of the estimates (e.g. increasing possibility of type II errors), findings should be interpreted bearing these issues in mind.

Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analyses comparing family caregivers of patients who survived the stay at the ICU revealed significant between-group differences in favor of the intervention group. For symptoms of PTSD at 6 and 12 months, intervention group caregivers of patients who survived scored on average 10 points lower compared to the control group (IES-R MD 6 months − 10.3 [95% CI − 16.3; − 4.3], p = 0.001; IES-R MD 12 months − 9.9 [95% CI − 15.8; − 4.0], p = 0.001). See Table 3 for details. Between-group differences from baseline to 6 and 12 months were also statistically significant for symptoms of anxiety at 6 and 12 months and for depression at 6 months (Table 3). Regarding secondary outcomes, this study revealed significant between-group differences with increased levels of hope and HRQoL, sub-score physical functioning after 6 months, and increased levels of mental functioning and hope after 12 months for intervention group caregivers of patients who survived (Table 4, electronic supplementary material 3). No such effects were detected for bereaved family caregivers (Table 3 and Table 4, electronic supplementary material 3).

Limitations

This study has some limitations. First, ICU nurses only forwarded information about those family caregivers interested in the intervention, resulting in somewhat limited information about the potential eligibility of family caregivers and reasons for not becoming involved. Second, while blinding was attempted, and The Caregiver Pathway content was kept confidential among the nurses delivering the intervention, other ICU staff could have become aware of group allocation based on their presence at the ICU. Caregivers included may also have realized the difference between intervention and standard care follow-up. Third, differences in standard care could have been present, potentially impacting group differences, as standard care for family caregivers in the ICU might vary depending on the physicians and ICU nurses present. The nurses delivering the intervention also provided standard care to participants in the control group, which could have impacted the delivery of standard care. Fourth, the lower participation at 12 months in the control group (60%) compared to the intervention group (82%) may also have impacted the outcomes, and findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of bereaved family caregivers completing final measures in the control group. Similarly, while drop-out analyses revealed no significant differences in demographic characteristics between completers and non-completers, most bereaved caregivers in the intervention group managed to complete the study, while several bereaved participants in the control group did not. This difference in group participation may also have impacted the results and potentially the intervention effect. Finally, further process evaluation of The Caregiver Pathway, including experiences from ICU nurses and family caregivers to better understand the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, could provide vital information for future implementations.

### Recovery after critical illness: putting the puzzle together-a consensus of 29 [^3c9cc875]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Systematic post-ICU follow-up may assist patients and family caregivers with their perspective of recovery. They need to know what to expect, so as to understand the path to recovery, to acknowledge uncertainties, and to be equipped to adjust to the later sequelae. More research is needed to help determine what interventions can usefully be implemented in ICU follow-up clinics and the appropriate physical intervention programs. Furthermore, patients' and family members' experiences should be used to guide effective interventions to provide the best comfort and holistic care, to better address the needs of patients and their families, and improve our ability to alleviate the post-ICU burden for surviving patients and their loves ones, as well as the grief symptoms of bereaved family members. Finally, elements of palliative care need to be integrated early into the care of the sickest critically ill patients, whatever the goals of care, with the sole aim of improving the ICU experience for those who are dying and for those who will face the challenging period of post-ICU recovery. ICU clinicians should be trained in structured communication approaches, multidisciplinary interventions to increase the emphasis on patient values for supporting preference-sensitive decisions in the face of uncertainty, delivery of support aids such as printed materials and diaries, and dignity-conserving care.

### Post-intensive care syndrome and caregiver burden: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^826fd9eb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In our post hoc exploratory analysis of a multicenter RCT, we assessed the reciprocal association between patient PICS and caregiver burden using SEM. While we did not observe longitudinal relationships between latent PICS and caregiver burden, we found significant associations within each time point, which is aligned with previous findings.

Our findings revealed significant cross-sectional but not longitudinal associations between PICS and caregiver burden, suggesting a short-term association that does not persist to 12 months. While overall PICS scores did not correlate with longitudinal caregiver burden, individual domains related to ADL/IADL and PTSD did. Specifically, ICU survivors' physical impairments consistently contributed to caregiver burden over time, with significant correlations between ADL/IADL at 3 months and caregiver burden at 12 months. The physical demands and time investment required to support patients with ADL/IADL limitations, along with their higher medical needs, may explain this association. Caregivers often assume demanding roles after ICU discharge without adequate preparation, significantly amplifying burden. Despite practice guidelines for family engagement in patient care from ICU admission to improve caregiver readiness, there remains no consensus on effective engagement strategies. Additionally, while patients and families typically receive home health and rehabilitation services in the initial weeks to months postdischarge, coverage often becomes limited despite ongoing impairments. Effective integration of comprehensive caregiver assessments into routine clinical practice to tailor caregiver preparation for supporting patients' physical and psychological functioning, along with access to longitudinal caregiver resources, may alleviate burden.

While up to 30% of survivors experience post-ICU impairment at 6 months, caregiver burden and emotional effects of critical illness (ie, PICS-family) can persist for years. Our study found that PICS and caregiver burden at 3 months were associated with these outcomes at 12 months, with no linear improvement over time. This finding underscores the critical need for early and longitudinal assessment of caregiver needs and health outcomes to provide timely resources, including financial, social, and mental health support. Caregiver experiences are influenced by various contextual factors such as the patient-caregiver relationship, socioeconomic status, and cultural context. Therefore, it is imperative to develop support approaches tailored to the unique needs of each individual. By considering the ICU survivor-caregiver as a unit of care, these strategies can help mitigate the long-term repercussions of critical illness on caregivers while supporting patient recovery. Given the infancy of research on the complexity of patient and caregiver outcomes, further studies are warranted to deepen our understanding of post-ICU caregiving and its role in ICU survivorship.

Statistical analysis

All variables were analyzed for outliers and unusual observations. Baseline socio-demographic and background characteristics were presented as means and SDs for normally distributed variables and counts and percentages for categorical data. Chi-square and independent t-tests were used to assess potential crude between-group differences for demographics and background variables at baseline.

To explore potential between-group differences of outcome measures, data were analyzed using generalized linear models (GLM) for repeated measures with time (measurement points), group (intervention vs. comparison group), and interaction term (group*time) as covariates.

More family caregivers were living together with the patient in the control group compared to the intervention group, which is a risk factor for PICS-F. The variable was therefore included in the analysis as a possible confounder. As patient survival during the ICU stay can impact outcomes, this variable was also included as a possible confounder in the model. Possible dependencies within individuals were controlled for using an unstructured covariance matrix. The GLM analysis was adjusted for clusters as 1–3 family caregivers could belong to the same patient. All measured time points for outcome variables were considered. All analyses were conducted according to intention to treat principles, independent of how many steps of the intervention participants received. Between-group differences for symptoms of PTSD (IES-R) were calculated at 6 and 12 months. For outcomes with baseline measures, between-group differences are reported as the intervention group change from baseline to 6 and 12 months, minus the control group change from baseline.

To explore how patient survival during the ICU stay impacted outcomes at 6 and 12 months, GLM models described above were fitted separately for family caregivers of patients who survived or died. The customary significance level alpha of 0.05 was used for all statistical analyses, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 29 (SPSS Inc.)) and STATA/SE (version 18).

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^05fcdde0]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The profile of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivorship has been brought into sharp focus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a critical illness, patients can experience clinically important physical, emotional and cognitive symptoms. These problems can have major implications for the patient and healthcare system.

Less focus has been placed on family members and caregivers of ICU survivors. This vulnerable group often have a challenging trajectory during the critical care recovery period and are known to experience emotional and social problems. For example, recent evidence has shown that over two thirds of caregivers may experience symptoms of depression, up to 80% can experience symptoms of anxiety and more than half can experience caregiver strain in the months following critical care discharge.

To address this pressing issue, we designed a multi-centre health and social care intervention to support caregivers recovery following critical care discharge. Specifically, we sought to understand what impact this intervention had on emotional outcomes and social disruption for the caregiver.

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^20876fc3]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This evaluation of a multicentre integrated health and social care intervention demonstrated a positive impact on the emotional health of ICU survivor caregivers at 12 months. As far as we can establish, this is the first multicentre intervention internationally to report benefit for caregivers during the post-ICU recovery phase.

The InS:PIRE intervention was designed as a peer supported, multi-disciplinary programme for both patients and caregivers. Previous research has described multiple benefits of peer support for both patients and caregivers in the post-ICU setting such as reduced anxiety, improved external validation of progress and support with expectation management. A further mechanism which we hypothesise has driven improvements, is the intentional focus on caregiver outcomes, rather than caregiver outcomes being viewed as a biproduct of patient treatment. Intentional use of separate caregiver education sessions alongside the integration of local community services which focused on caregiver needs was available at every site. However, it is important to recognise that targeted treatments for both patients and caregivers are likely to have had a bidirectional effect across the family unit. That is, a patient knowing a caregiver is receiving the support they require will potentially have a positive effect on their recovery, and likewise a caregiver seeing the patient receiving the necessary support to recover will likely reduce anxiety and mental health problems.

Carer strain also significantly reduced for those caregivers who attended the programme. The Carer Strain Index is a tool which examines all the global aspects of caring responsibilities (Additional file 1: S1). This includes domains such as return to employment, physical and financial strain. Caregivers had access to social, financial and welfare advice for the duration of the programme; this may well have been the driver for the reduction in carer strain seen. This finding is consistent with work from primary care in the UK; improving the social and financial situation of people, by co-locating social and welfare services in health centres resulted in improvements in mental health. Moreover, recent evidence has demonstrated a direct correlation between emotional and social outcomes in ICU survivors. Future interventions aimed at addressing outcomes in this group must ensure that all aspects of an individual's wellbeing are considered.

### Can a dyadic resiliency program improve quality of life in cognitively intact dyads of neuro-ICU survivors and informal caregivers? Results from a pilot RCT [^5d13e0f9]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuro-ICU hospitalization for an acute neurological illness is often traumatic and associated with heightened emotional distress and reduced quality of life (QoL) for both survivors and their informal caregivers (i.e., family and friends providing unpaid care). In a pilot study, we previously showed that a dyadic (survivor and caregiver together) resiliency intervention (Recovering Together [RT]) was feasible and associated with sustained improvement in emotional distress when compared with an attention placebo educational control. Here we report on changes in secondary outcomes assessing QoL.

Methods

Survivors (n = 58) and informal caregivers (n = 58) completed assessments at bedside and were randomly assigned to participate together as a dyad in the RT or control intervention (both 6 weeks, two in-person sessions at bedside and four sessions via live video post discharge). We measured QoL domain scores (physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental), general QoL, and QoL satisfaction using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Abbreviated Instrument at baseline, post treatment, and 3 months' follow-up. We conducted mixed model analyses of variance with linear contrasts to estimate (1) within-group changes in QoL from baseline to post treatment and from post treatment to 3 months' follow-up and (2) between-group differences in changes in QoL from baseline to post treatment and from post treatment to 3 months' follow-up.

Results

We found significant within-group improvements from baseline to post treatment among RT survivors for physical health QoL (mean difference 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39–3.06; p = 0.012), environmental QoL (mean difference 1.29; 95% CI 0.21–2.36; p = 0.020), general QoL (mean difference 0.55; 95% CI 0.13–0.973; p = 0.011), and QoL satisfaction (mean difference 0.87; 95% CI 0.36–1.37; p = 0.001), and those improvements sustained through the 3-month follow-up. We found no significant between-group improvements for survivors or caregivers from baseline to post treatment or from post treatment to 3 months' follow-up for any QoL variables (i.e., domains, general QoL, and QoL satisfaction together).

Conclusions

In this pilot study, we found improved QoL among survivors, but not in caregivers, who received RT and improvements sustained over time. These RT-related improvements were not significantly greater than those observed in the control. Results support a fully powered randomized controlled trial to allow for a definitive evaluation of RT-related effects among dyads of survivors of acute brain injury and their caregivers.

### Post-intensive care syndrome and caregiver burden: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^9eb2ecff]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

After critical illness, patients often experience significant physical, cognitive, and psychological health consequences, collectively known as post–intensive care syndrome (PICS). These symptoms can profoundly impact both patients and their caregivers. Family members often find themselves unprepared for caregiving demands, with insufficient time to adapt to their new roles. A lack of preparedness can render it challenging to manage care and navigate formal support resources. Caregivers of patients with functional impairments are at heightened risk of caregiver burden, emotional distress, poor sleep, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), lifestyle adjustments, and diminished health-related quality of life.,

In the broader context of caregiving, caregiver burden can persist throughout the patient's recovery, adversely affecting care quality and impeding patient recovery and rehabilitation. Conversely, positive emotional functioning support from caregivers contributes to favorable rehabilitation outcomes, such as improved physical function and occupational and social integration for patients. This interdependence between patient health outcomes and caregiver burden may extend to critical illness and its long-term recovery. Previous studies have identified associations between patient PICS and caregiver burden. For instance, cohort studies conducted in Sweden and Spain found significant associations between patients' physical impairment and mental health problems, such as anxiety and PTSD, and higher caregiver burden and mental health at 3 months after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge.

However, little is known about longitudinal and reciprocal associations between PICS and caregiver burden. Given that caregiver involvement is integral to ICU survivors' recovery and rehabilitation, further investigations are warranted to explore the potential interdependent associations. Understanding how patient impairments and caregiver burden affect each other throughout recovery can enable the development of more effective support strategies for the dyads following critical illness.

To address this gap, we examined the associations between patient PICS and caregiver burden at 3- and 12-month follow-up time points for participants in an ICU-based randomized clinical trial (RCT). We hypothesized that (1) higher levels of PICS at each time point would be associated with higher levels of caregiver burden at the same time point, (2) higher levels of PICS at 3 months would be associated with higher levels of caregiver burden at 12 months, and (3) higher levels of caregiver burden at 3 months would be associated with higher levels of PICS at 12 months.

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^5feab1ce]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Although there were less symptoms of depression in the InS:PIRE cohort, the intervention did not significantly improve symptoms of depression for caregivers at 12 months. Previous literature has demonstrated that symptoms such as depression improve over the first year of recovery for most critical care survivors. We hypothesise that caregivers have a different recovery trajectory to patients and thus may require targeted interventions at different time periods. There is limited evidence describing the trajectories of symptoms beyond 2 months for caregivers following exposure to critical care illness. Given the large volume of informal, unfunded care provided by this caregiver group in the months following hospital discharge, it is crucial that health services offer adequate support to this cohort. More research is urgently required in this area, in order to fully understand how best to support this vulnerable group, in relation to symptoms of depression.

### Post-intensive care syndrome and caregiver burden: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^23ff5ded]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

While early postdischarge caregiver burden was not associated with long-term PICS in our study, broader caregiving literature suggests that other caregiver factors may influence patient health and rehabilitation outcomes. For example, positive caregiver involvement in poststroke care enhances patient participation in rehabilitation and improves physical function, while caregiver preparedness and confidence in heart failure improves patient self-care. However, little is known about caregiver factors influencing recovery trajectories of ICU survivors. Prospective evaluation of caregiver health and its impact on patient outcomes, including care quality, patient recovery, and readmission rates will advance our understanding of the reciprocal effects between patient and caregiver outcomes and support policy changes and interventions to better support caregivers throughout the patient's recovery.

### Patient and caregiver-derived health service improvements for better critical care recovery [^a9e58785]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To engage critical care end-users (survivors and caregivers) to describe their emotions and experiences across their recovery trajectory, and elicit their ideas and solutions for health service improvements to improve the ICU recovery experience.

Design

End-user engagement as part of a qualitative design using the Framework Analysis method.

Setting

The Society of Critical Care Medicine's THRIVE international collaborative sites (follow-up clinics and peer support groups).

Subjects

Patients and caregivers following critical illness and identified through the collaboratives.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Eighty-six interviews were conducted. The following themes were identified: 1) Emotions and experiences of patients-"Loss of former self; Experiences of disability and adaptation"; 2) Emotions and experiences of caregivers-"Emotional impacts, adopting new roles, and caregiver burden; Influence of gender roles; Adaptation, adjustment, recalibration"; and 3) Patient and caregiver-generated solutions to improve recovery across the arc of care-"Family-targeted education; Expectation management; Rehabilitation for patients and caregivers; Peer support groups; Reconnecting with ICU post-discharge; Access to community-based supports post-discharge; Psychological support; Education of issues of ICU survivorship for health professionals; Support across recovery trajectory". Themes were mapped to a previously published recovery framework (Timing It Right) that captures patient and caregiver experiences and their support needs across the phases of care from the event/diagnosis to adaptation post-discharge home.

Conclusions

Patients and caregivers reported a range of emotions and experiences across the recovery trajectory from ICU to home. Through end-user engagement strategies many potential solutions were identified that could be implemented by health services and tested to support the delivery of higher-quality care for ICU survivors and their caregivers that extend from tertiary to primary care settings.

### Beyond survival: identifying what matters to survivors of critical illness [^67d7dca6]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

We propose a framework to identify a hierarchical ranking of domains of recovery in the order of perceived importance by survivors (and caregivers) and following them over 3 and 6 months to assess their stability or shift following discharge (Fig. 1). For example, allowing survivors and caregivers of acute respiratory failure to assess trade-offs and rank recovery domains identified in prior Delphi work would help establish their perception of optimal recovery and ascertain relative importance of the components. The potential benefits of this approach include:
Direct identification of patients' and caregivers' priorities which could be used to shape future research agendas.
Preliminary identification of "patient phenotypes" based on their order of preference. For example, patients with certain baseline characteristics may favor cognitive recovery over physical function and vice versa.
Individualization of endpoints based on "patient phenotypes". The approach of individualized endpoints within the framework of trials is a viable strategy. In addition to its patient-centeredness this has been hypothesized to increase overall power by reducing the signal/noise ratio. Arguably this framework may not necessarily fit into the framework of biological interventions but represents a viable option for testing supportive or rehabilitative strategies.

Eliciting a hierarchy of priorities relies on patients considering trade-offs between various aspects of recovery. Multiple approaches, some adopted from market research strategies could be applied to elicit such trade-offs. These methods range from using simple visual analogue scales, ranking, spending weights to more sophisticated approaches such as discrete choice experiments, standard gamble or time trade-off. Eliciting responses from survivors could be difficult in the setting of new or worsened cognitive impairments. Similarly, when forced to hypothetically rank, survivors may find it challenging to distinguish between domains with overlap (for example physical function and return to work) or discriminate between major domains (such as cognition and physical function). It is conceivable that preferences elicited may be influenced by patient's baseline functional status and socioeconomic considerations which by themselves may be informative. Finally, since predictive models are not necessarily accurate in predicting trajectories of individual patients following critical illness, these phenotypes identified may not be useful for advance care planning.

### Feasibility and efficacy of a resiliency intervention for the prevention of chronic emotional distress among survivor-caregiver dyads admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit: a randomized clinical trial [^96c41836]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Advanced technologies have transformed the quality of care for patients with critical neurologic illness admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), contributing to increased survival and more favorable discharge dispositions. However, as more and more patients survive their neuroscience ICU stays, the long-term psychiatric sequelae associated with the sudden, life-threatening, and often traumatic onset of acute neurological injury (ANI) are becoming increasingly recognized. These psychiatric sequelae affect not only the survivors but also the informal caregiverswho support and attend to them through their hospitalizations and beyond. Rates of clinically significant anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress (PTS) are high for both patients (43%, 24%, and 21%, respectively) and caregivers (46%, 8%-24%, and 17%, respectively) during hospitalization and remain high 3 and 6 months later. This trajectory of emotional distress is concerning given the deleterious effect that long-term distress has on patients' physical recovery as well as patients' and caregivers' morbidity and mortality. Early interventions that prevent chronic psychiatric illness in at-risk patients and caregivers are therefore an urgent priority.

The critical care community has responded to this need, but to our knowledge, no interventions have been successful in addressing this problem. A recent systematic review and meta-analysisshowed potential for ICU diaries to reduce the risk for depression and anxiety in ICU survivors but not in informal caregivers and not for PTS. Unfortunately, only 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with very small samples were included in the review, diminishing generalizability. Recently, Wade et alreported on a large, multicenter, cluster RCT of a nurse-led cognitive behavioral therapy intervention among at-risk ICU survivors that showed no significant reduction in PTS symptom severity 6 months after discharge. White and colleaguesreported on a large stepped-wedge cluster RCT of a nurse-delivered family support intervention for surrogates of critically ill patients from 5 ICUs and found no effect on improvement in emotional distress when compared with control.

### Beyond survival: identifying what matters to survivors of critical illness [^27322434]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-mortality endpoints in clinical trials

Surviving an ICU stay matters overwhelmingly. Conditional on survival, there are multiple other facets which matter substantially. A study among survivors demonstrated that some perceived the burden of survivorship as " worse than death ". Although a minority hold this view, most patients and caregivers are accepting of tragic trade-offs associated with survival. From a practical standpoint, "affective forecasting" in the setting of new disabilities remains challenging and is unpredictably influenced by patients' resilience and adaptation. This underpins the importance of looking beyond mortality and derived measures. So how do we identify areas which deserve prioritization in terms of developing and testing treatment strategies based on patients' perspectives?

Current critical care literature is rife with trials which have not demonstrated meaningful mortality reduction, while this could be attributed to trials being under-powered or study populations being heterogeneous, the trend remains disappointing. A systematic review of 212 trials provided no conclusive evidence of any single pharmacological intervention translating to mortality benefit. Interestingly, another meta-analysis concluded that patient-important outcomes other than mortality were seldom primary outcomes and commonly used surrogates did not directly matter to patients. With this background, our current framework affords a limited insight into the impact of various interventions in this growing population. These issues are being increasingly recognized, culminating in calls for more efficient, patient-centered research.

Substantial work has been done in this area leading to development of core-outcome sets and validated measures to encourage standardized reporting and comparability between trials. Although work on this topic engaged patients and caregivers, overall representation of such groups has been low. Patients who do not survive for long are naturally excluded. For survivors, a single interview far removed from index episode introduces biases and is incapable of tracking "response shifts". Our current understanding therefore remains primarily reflective of the perception of stakeholders other than patients or care-givers.

The key question remains: What matters most to survivors of critical illness and their caregivers and how could these priority areas be identified reliably?

Recovery is multidimensional with its extent varying across multiple domains, such as cognitive, physical, mental health, return to work or residence, and therefore identification of order of prioritization is a key initial step.

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^0ca927ec]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Study limitations are notable. Firstly, we do not know if the caregivers included in this study had pre-existing mental health problems. As such, we are unable to account for an important baseline characteristic in our analysis. Secondly, this was not a randomised control trial. While there was substantial overlap in baseline characteristics between the intervention and usual care cohorts, they were not randomly assigned to either usual care or the intervention; as such, this limits the ability to draw casual inference from the results. Moreover, we experienced attrition over the course of the 12 months, common with other studies in the field, which may have also influenced the reported outcomes. We also do not have data on caregivers who attended the InS:PIRE intervention but did not consent to recruitment in this study. Their experience of the programme may be distinctly different from those represented in this analysis.

It could be argued that the patients and caregivers who attended the InS:PIRE programme were more engaged and motivated about improving their health, thus, accounting for the improved outcomes seen in the intervention cohort. However, there was diversity in the cohort across the socio-economic gradient. Moreover, 40% of patients in the intervention cohort had multi-comorbidities and over a quarter had pre-existing mental health issues. This would suggest that the intervention arm did include patients with significant chronic issues, who often have challenging trajectories following critical illness.

The method of data collection varied across the two cohorts (in person or telephone vs. postal completion). This could have influenced how the outcomes were recorded and reported for each cohort. Finally, we only have data at one time point for the control cohort. As such we cannot fully understand the symptom trajectory for caregivers, which limits the interpretability of some of the results.

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^96a8aecb]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

Using a multicentre cohort design, we compared caregivers who attended an integrated health and social care intervention aimed at improving outcomes for ICU survivors, with a contemporary, usual care cohort (caregivers who had been exposed to critical care and were currently caring for a critical care survivor) who did not attend the programme. Previous work has described the outcomes of patients who participated in this intervention, alongside a detailed process evaluation.

A caregiver was defined as the individual who provided most of the financial, emotional and physical support for the patient, or the individual primarily responsible for caring for the patient on an unpaid basis.

We report a cohort study, as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.

Approval

Ethical approval was granted by the Northwest (Liverpool Central) Research Ethics Committee (reference number: 17/NM/0199). All participants provided written consent.

### Reported burden on informal caregivers of ICU survivors: a literature review [^5b4e505c]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Possible benefits of post-ICU clinics for ICU survivors are mentioned before. However, we did not find any recommendations on screening informal caregivers in post-ICU care, though there are recommendations on inviting the informal caregiver to the patient's post-ICU care. Considering the high prevalence of a wide range of burdens in informal caregivers, we highly recommend assessing the informal caregiver as part of the post-ICU care so they can be referred to the appropriate healthcare provider(s) if necessary.

There is a large resemblance between a recently published systematic review about the psychosocial outcomes informal caregivers of ICU patients can suffer and our study, as 11 articles were included in both studies. However, a strength of our study is that we did not restrict our literature search to psychosocial outcomes and could include 17 additional articles. Consequently, we also report on other burdens such as anxiety, loss of employment, financial problems and healthcare consumption. Recognition of these additional types of burden is important for referral to the appropriated healthcare provider.

Another strength of our review is that we included both quantitative and qualitative studies describing burdens informal caregivers can suffer. This means that we could identify additional burdens such as sleeping disorders and negative impacts on social life and relationships.

Our study also has some limitations. Two pairs of articles describe the same data from samples of 57 and 284 informal caregivers. Both pairs of articles report on results obtained using the same instruments at the same time points. Since we did not perform a meta-analysis, we believe that the influence of these duplicate data is limited. In addition, the methodological quality of the 24 observational studies was low and the three randomized studies moderate to fair. Although all of the studies report similar results, more high-quality studies are needed to obtain accurate assessments of the prevalence and severity of burdens informal caregivers suffer.

### ICU recovery interventions: is It time for a personalized medicine approach? [^9f30b189]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, the optimal "dose" and timing of interventions remain an area of uncertainty. In the study by Bakhru and colleagues, the brief intervention, consisting of two telephone calls, both approximately 30 minutes each, delivered early after hospital discharge, seems unlikely to have added value to the patients. Future interventions should align the intensity and timing of the interventions with individual patient characteristics. For instance, patients with complex chronic conditions or limited social resources may well require intensive multidisciplinary support, whereas those with high health literacy and strong support networks may benefit from lighter-touch strategies and anticipatory guidance. To better determine who benefits from what, the ICU recovery field needs to consider robust codesign with patients and family members as well as high-quality prospective data capable of defining precise recovery subphenotypes. Just as the RECOVER (Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery) initiative in Long COVID has used platform trial designs to evaluate tailored interventions across diverse populations, the ICU recovery field would benefit from a similar infrastructure to test multiple strategies in parallel and adapt to emerging evidence (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Highlights of key areas of uncertainty and future directions for ICU recovery research. Created in BioRender. McPeake, J. (2025).

Furthermore, as healthcare systems shift from volume-based to value-based care, there will be pressure to design cost-effective, sustainable, equitable models of post-ICU recovery care. Although highly specialized interdisciplinary post-ICU programs at quaternary care centers will likely continue to drive the innovations in the art of post-ICU recovery care, they are unlikely to adequately address the broader public health needs of the growing population of ICU survivors. Scalable, personalized models of care must also be developed and tested rigorously. Such innovation must be grounded in robust conceptual frameworks and shaped by the needs of patients, families, and frontline providers. When we get there, we hope cost-effectiveness outcomes will include not only healthcare use costs but also labor market participation, informal caregiving demands, and broader societal costs.

Bakhru and colleagues have taken a meaningful step in testing a real-world solution. The path forward now lies in refining our approach: building stronger conceptual models of ICU recovery, deeper personalization, and aligning interventions more closely with what survivors truly need. Through innovation and collaboration, we can meaningfully improve the clinical and personal recovery of ICU survivors.

### Can in-hospital or post discharge caregiver involvement increase functional performance of older patients? A systematic review [^f3f1c50e]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventions

The caregiver interventions ranged from including the caregiver in the decision-making process of discharge planning, to letting the caregiver deliver exercises. All interventions were initiated in the hospital, but their duration ranged from 2 hours to 8 weeks and in three studies the intervention continued after discharge. Studies were grouped into three different types of caregiver intervention.

Care pathway

One study was categorized in the care pathway group and focused on the process of care. Patients and their caregiver are actively involved in the triage decisions (discharge to a geriatric rehabilitation facility and discharge back to the community) and in the establishment of their care and treatment plan.

Education and bed-side handling skills

Four studies evaluated caregiver education and teaching bed-side handling skills, such as education regarding stroke (consequences and prevention) and teaching skills for day-to-day management of stroke survivors like positioning in bed and transfers. The duration of these in-hospital interventions was a two-hour meeting, 3–5 sessions of 30–45 min, or 4 times 45–60 min, Gräsel et al. conducted additional telephone counseling up to 3 months after discharge.

Caregiver mediated exercises

Three studies reported on caregiver mediated exercises, were caregivers assist the patient with a self-administered exercise program supported with a booklet or an app. Galvin et al. studied exercises to strengthen lower limb with the intention of improving balance and gait velocity. Harris et al. focused on improving functionality of the upper limb. Van den Berg et al. studied the exercises aiming to improve gait and gait-related mobility. The duration of these interventions was 4 weeks 60 min a day 6 times per week, 8 weeks 35 min a day or 8 weeks ≥ 5 times per week 30 min. In two studies the intervention continued after discharge.

Impact of intervention types

Care pathway

Everink et al. reported significant improvements for basic functional performance (FAI) and psychological well-being (SRCB) at 3 months, but not at 6 months or 9 months. More intervention patients (83% versus 58%, p = 0.004) could be discharged home.

### Effect of a standardized family participation program in the ICU: a multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial [^65c0fe94]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: What are the effects of a standardized program for family participation in essential care activities in the ICU?

Findings: This multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial found that application of a family participation program led to increased clarity, knowledge, and skills regarding family participation in essential care activities among relatives and ICU healthcare providers, but did not lead to a relevant change in post-intensive care syndrome-family symptoms nor satisfaction levels.

Meanings: Use of a family participation program improves and facilitates family participation, but does not change post-intensive care syndrome-family symptoms nor satisfaction levels in relatives at three months post ICU discharge.

ICU stay is commonly experienced as stressful by patients and relatives. Also, ICU survivors report long-term physical, cognitive, and/or mental impairments, also known as "post-intensive care syndrome" (PICS). Relatives may experience mental health symptoms, defined as PICS-family (PICS-F), possibly impacting their life for years.

Enabling relatives to participate in essential care activities may decrease relatives' stress and anxiety and prepare them for their role as informal caregivers after ICU discharge. Though most relatives are willing to participate in essential care, currently a minority participates, suggesting that additional efforts from ICU healthcare providers (HCPs) may be necessary. Although most HCPs are willing to facilitate family participation, currently, practical guidance is lacking, and the fundamental evidence base for the benefits and limitations of family participation in adult ICU patient care is scarce.

Recently, the application of a standardized program to facilitate family participation in daily ICU practice was pilot-tested in three centers. Both HCPs and relatives considered the use of such a program feasible and applicable. Important conditions were individual tailoring and provision of sufficient time for HCPs. However, the effects on patients', relatives', and HCPs' outcomes and experiences remain unclear.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of a standardized family participation program in the ICU on satisfaction and mental health of relatives. We also studied HCP perceptions and experiences related to the program.

### Beyond survival: identifying what matters to survivors of critical illness [^ff81dc24]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, critical care research should emulate the paradigm of patient and family-centered care. Elucidation of priorities from survivors and caregivers represents a pragmatic approach towards designing more patient-centered trials. Understanding priorities should be a crucial factor in prioritizing future research agendas. Once identified, these constructs could be added to trial endpoints to ascertain how they interface with proposed interventions. Further, new support interventions could be developed drawing from the perspective of survivors and their caregivers. Broader impact of our interventions should be eventually measured vis-à-vis patient and caregivers' preferences.

### One-year outcomes in caregivers of critically ill patients [^f1b6dfc4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Few resources are available to support caregivers of patients who have survived critical illness; consequently, the caregivers' own health may suffer. We studied caregiver and patient characteristics to determine which characteristics were associated with caregivers' health outcomes during the first year after patient discharge from an intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 280 caregivers of patients who had received 7 or more days of mechanical ventilation in an ICU. Using hospital data and self-administered questionnaires, we collected information on caregiver and patient characteristics, including caregiver depressive symptoms, psychological well-being, health-related quality of life, sense of control over life, and effect of providing care on other activities. Assessments occurred 7 days and 3, 6, and 12 months after ICU discharge.

Results

The caregivers' mean age was 53 years, 70% were women, and 61% were caring for a spouse. A large percentage of caregivers (67% initially and 43% at 1 year) reported high levels of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms decreased at least partially with time in 84% of the caregivers but did not in 16%. Variables that were significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes in caregivers were younger age, greater effect of patient care on other activities, less social support, less sense of control over life, and less personal growth. No patient variables were consistently associated with caregiver outcomes over time.

Conclusions

In this study, most caregivers of critically ill patients reported high levels of depressive symptoms, which commonly persisted up to 1 year and did not decrease in some caregivers. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00896220.).

### Feasibility and efficacy of a resiliency intervention for the prevention of chronic emotional distress among survivor-caregiver dyads admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit: a randomized clinical trial [^9fb8a0f6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Findings from this pilot study support a fully powered RCT of RT vs control. Given that, to our knowledge, there are no evidence-based interventions to prevent chronic emotional distress in this population, there is a tremendous opportunity to reduce suffering and implement RT in the care of dyads in neuroscience ICUs across the country.

### The challenge of designing a post-critical illness rehabilitation intervention [^1c3fc849]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Post-ICU morbidity is an important issue for patients, families, and the health-care system. Elliott and colleagues outlined the results from their novel report of the very first home-based physiotherapy program to be tested in survivors of critical illness. The authors described an explicit intervention, which included a self-instruction exercise manual, trainer visits, and telephone follow-up, with excellent internal validity and yet no difference in outcome measures at 26-week follow-up. These results are discussed in the context of risk stratification/individual tailoring of post-ICU programs to patient and family needs and suggest that the collection of multiple simultaneous outcome measures across functional, neuropsychological, caregiver, and health-care utilization domains may offer additional insight into the benefits of post-rehabilitation programs.

### Post-intensive care syndrome and caregiver burden: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^f62cd6cd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Understanding the reciprocal association between post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and caregiver burden is crucial for optimal care of patients and caregivers following critical illness.

Objective

To evaluate the associations between patient post-intensive care impairments and caregiver burden.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis of the MIND-USA study, a multicenter randomized clinical trial, which enrolled patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) from 16 academic medical centers across the US (December 2011 to August 2017), included 148 patient-caregiver dyads. Patients were adults aged 18 years or older with ICU delirium randomized to receive haloperidol, ziprasidone, or placebo. A caregiver who provided unpaid assistance to the patient was identified at enrollment. PICS and caregiver burden were assessed at 3 months and 12 months after randomization. Statistical analysis was performed from March 2023 to April 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

ICU survivors were assessed for PICS domains, including physical and cognitive function, and posttraumatic stress disorder using the Katz Activities of Daily Living, the Functional Activities Questionnaire, the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian version, respectively. Caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview. The associations between patient PICS and caregiver burden at 3 and 12 months were examined using structural equation modeling.

Results

Of 148 patients included in this study with a median (IQR) age of 58 (48–65) years, the majority identified as male (79 patients [53.4%]), and there were 16 (10.8%) Black, 139 (93.9%) non-Hispanic, and 127 (85.8%) White patients. PICS and caregiver burden at 3-month follow-up was positively associated with these outcomes at 12-month follow-up (PICS: β = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.88; P < .001; caregiver burden: β = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.82; P < .001). However, contrary to the study hypotheses, significant associations between 3-month PICS and 12-month caregiver burden and between 3-month caregiver burden and 12-month PICS were not observed (PICS→caregiver burden: β = 0.82; 95% CI, -0.02 to 1.66; P = 0.09; caregiver burden→PICS: β = 0.00; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.03; P = 0.95). There was significant covariance between PICS and caregiver burden at each time point.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of ICU survivors and their caregivers, patient PICS and caregiver burden were associated at concurrent time points but were not associated with each other longitudinally.

### Recovery after critical illness: putting the puzzle together-a consensus of 29 [^74881030]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Family-centered care

Family outcomes are also of paramount importance. Increasing attention is being given to improving clinicians' skills with regard to eliciting and exchanging information, non-verbal communication, conflict prevention and resolution, end-of-life care, and grief counseling. Unfortunately, to date, the results of interventions to improve family outcomes have been mixed.

In a single-center, before–after study design, a day-3 family conference reduced the number of days without consensus between ICU clinicians and family members and decreased ICU length of stay. A multicenter, randomized trial indicated that a proactive communication strategy that includes end-of-life family conferences and a bereavement leaflet significantly reduces, in family members, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress 3 months after a patient's death. Participation of a nurse or social worker trained for 2 days to facilitate communication within the ICU team and address communication needs and conflicts has been associated with reduced symptoms of depression at 6 months, as well as reducing ICU length of stay and costs. However, a multi-faceted, nurse-focused, interprofessional quality improvement intervention on end-of-life care proved ineffective in one of the largest and most generalizable studies to date.

In a multicenter randomized clinical trial among patients receiving 7 days of mechanical ventilation, one or two structured family meetings led by palliative care specialists (without formal palliative care consultation) demonstrated no benefits, and possibly greater post-traumatic stress symptoms in the intervention group. Another trial investigated the effects of an eight-session, simulation-based communication skills intervention for internal medicine and nurse practitioner trainees on patient- and family-reported outcomes. The intervention was associated with no change in the quality of communication, but significantly increased patient depression scores. Finally, increased rates of post-traumatic stress and depression symptoms were found in bereaved relatives randomized to receive a condolence letter. These studies highlight the need to better identify those family members in need of intra and post-ICU interventions, to identify measures of caregiver outcomes that are responsive to intervention, and to continue to evaluate both short- and long-term outcomes of our interventions before including them in the standard of care. Finally, an extended family visitation policy in the ICU can be associated with reduced occurrence of delirium and shorter length of delirium/coma and ICU stay.

### Mental health interventions to improve psychological outcomes in informal caregivers of critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7a644fae]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Mental health interventions (n = 32 total; n = 15 [47%] in adult ICUs) significantly decreased depression within 3 months of ICU discharge (RoM, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–0.99; I² = 97.09%; n = 3,650 caregivers). No effect on depression after 3 months was observed (RoM, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83–1.20; I² = 98.44%; n = 2,870 caregivers) (Fig. 3 B). Six RCTs observed significant improvement, four evaluation trials within 3 months discharge and two single-site studies targeting caregiver experience and caregiver support at 4 and 6 months postdischarge, respectively. All six RCTs but the piloting and feasibility trial by Samuel et al, a Pediatric Intensive Care Follow-Up Clinic, reported significant improvements in anxiety. Conversely, increased depression after 3 months postdischarge was reported by four trials. Kentish-Barnes et al found in relatives of patients who died in ICU, condolence letters failed to alleviate psychologic distress and worsened depression and symptoms of PTSD. In addition to increased depression, the multisite evaluation RCT by Bohart et al reported increased anxiety and decreased courage at 12 months postdischarge for their 3-month Recovery Programme.

Outcomes for informal caregiver PTSD were inconsistent and meta-analysis of 21 RCTs (n = 14 [67%] in adult ICUs) demonstrated no significant effect of interventions on PTSD symptoms at any time (Supplemental Fig. 3 a). Four studies on caregiver experience interventions reported significantly decreased PTSD symptoms within 3 months discharge from adult mixed ICU, adult medical-surgical ICU, or NICU, while two studies reported significantly increased PTSD symptoms in adult medical ICU and NICU. Studies with longer-term follow-up reported conflicting results. Two of 21 trials tested ICU Family Diaries to reduce risk of PTSD symptoms; the piloting and feasibility trial by Jones et al informed the evaluation trial across four adult medical-surgical ICUs by Nielsen et al. Among studies reporting on symptoms of PTSD, only the evaluation RCT by Lautrette et al that assessed end-of-life conferences and bereavement leaflets across 22 adult mixed ICUs observed a consistent reduction in anxiety, depression, and PTSD at 3 months postdischarge.

### Post-intensive care syndrome and caregiver burden: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^9fc4f715]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study has several strengths. We used longitudinal data for both patients and their caregivers. By including data from 3- and 12-month follow-up time points, we reduced potential confounding effects that could result from a between-group study design due to interindividual differences. Additionally, using SEM allowed us to include multiple indicators of the PICS construct in our model simultaneously while accounting for measurement error.

Our study has limitations inherent to post hoc analysis of an RCT. First, our analytic sample included only a small proportion of patients and caregivers from the parent study with complete data at both time points, which might have introduced bias. The missing values may not be random, and many losses to 12-month follow-up were likely due to patient death and severe medical conditions, leading overwhelmed caregivers to refuse follow-up, potentially excluding the highest burden patients and caregivers. The small sample size also limited our ability to explore confounding factors, reduced statistical power, and affected generalizability. Second, our sample characteristic may limit the generalizability of the findings. Our analysis uniquely evaluated post-ICU trajectories in patients who all experienced ICU delirium. Given that many patients with ICU delirium have preexisting neurocognitive deficits, and caregiver adjustment may precede the critical illness, the lack of cognitive function manifestation as PICS and its minimal contribution to caregiver burden may be due to our sample characteristics. Further studies are needed to replicate our findings in other ICU survivor and caregiver cohorts. Third, our PICS measures do not align with current recommendations. The parent study, designed before the publication of PICS stakeholder consensus, solely used patient-reported measures, potentially introducing response bias. Although the core outcome set for PICS is yet undefined, it is recommended to use both patient-reported and performance-based measurements (eg, timed up-and-go and handgrip strength). Additionally, the parent study did not include measures for depression and anxiety for long-term psychological outcomes. Therefore, our PICS latent variable lacks these indicators. Fourth, information on caregiver characteristics was not available in the parent study. Various caregiver factors (eg, age, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health, preparedness for caregiving, and medical conditions) and caregiving characteristics (eg, relationship to the patient, caregiving hours, duration, tasks performed, quality of the patient-caregiver relationship, and living situation) are closely related to perceived burden. Furthermore, we lacked information on the levels of postdischarge support provided to caregivers, which may have influenced our results. Greater levels of caregiver support, tailored to the severity of PICS impairments, could have mitigated burden more effectively compared with lower levels of support provided to caregivers of patients with fewer impairments. The lack of this information limited our ability to interpret the results within the caregiving context. Lastly, with 86% of patients being White and 94% non-Hispanic, the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority groups limits the generalizability of our findings.

### Communicating to patients and families about post-intensive care syndrome [^b8224fef]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The field of critical care rapidly expanded starting in the 1950s, with advancing life support that reduced mortality for previously fatal organ dysfunction; however, research into the long-term consequences of surviving these extremes of physiology did not begin in earnest until the 1990s. Since then, a large body of evidence has documented the impairments, disabilities, symptom burden, and health care costs associated with ICU survivorship, which can last for years. In 2012, the term post - intensive care syndrome (PICS) was first described to facilitate communication and research into impairments following critical illness — originally categorized into physical, cognitive, and mental health-related domains. Despite a quarter century of improvement in our understanding of the epidemiology of PICS, there is still poor awareness of the problem and infrequent communication between the medical team and patients.

Incidence

Although the incidence of PICS varies based on patient population, data from cohort studies suggest that it is common, occurring in up to 1 of every 2 ICU patients who survive to discharge. An analysis of 406 ICU survivors (median age, 61 years) found that only 44% were considered "PICS-free" at 12 months. At 3 months, 38% had cognitive impairment, 26% had physical disabilities with new limitations in activities of daily living, and 33% experienced symptoms of depression. A questionnaire-based study analyzed by ICU admission type showed the incidence of PICS at 1 year to be 43% for elective surgery requiring ICU admission, 58% for medical ICU admission, and 64% for urgent surgical ICU admission. Additionally, the term PICS-Family describes the wide-ranging and often underrecognized effects that an ICU admission can have on a patient's caregivers and family. These include mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD at rates similar to or exceeding those of the ICU survivor.

### Critical care education and the ICU care continuum [^d04b7bdc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The persistence of functional impairment after critical illness has been described in patients and their caregivers for years after hospital discharge. The consequences of critical illness extend across multiple domains, including cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric and mood disorders, neuromuscular weakness, frailty, caregiver burnout, and return to work. Post-ICU clinics were established to simultaneously evaluate outcomes after critical illness and to provide clinical intervention, advocacy, and supportive care to patients and families. Although research may have been the initial goal of these clinics, we believe they now allow a more fulsome clinical view of critically ill patients. The characteristics of these clinics are varied, ranging from ICU nurse–led models to comprehensive multidisciplinary clinics. The inclusion of trainees within these clinics is uncommon in North America, potentially depriving trainees of important learning opportunities and exposure to long-term complications of critical illness. By comparison, a survey of ICU residents in Spain demonstrated that 40% of residents had participated in a post-ICU follow-up program, with 96% favoring ongoing involvement within their training with post-ICU patient and family assessments. The benefits of attending these clinics include developing an understanding of chronic critical illness, the complexities of care transitions, and varied recovery trajectories and applying this knowledge to facilitate patient- and family-centered approaches to care during and after episodes of critical illness. Several clinic networks have been established worldwide, including the RECOVER (Rehabilitation and Recovery in Survivors of Critical Illness) program in Canada, the THRIVE network in the United States, and the InS:PIRE (Intensive Care Syndrome: Promoting Independence and Return to Employment) program in Scotland. Although generally not a primary outcome of studies, patient and family satisfaction has been shown to be high among those who attend clinics.

### Evaluating physical functioning in critical care: considerations for clinical practice and research [^1badce36]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Impairment in physical functioning among ICU survivors results in significant morbidity and burden to patients, caregivers, and society. With a growing population of ICU survivors, greater utilization and standardization of physical functioning instruments is needed. This article has provided a framework and recommendations for practice. Measuring physical functioning early and longitudinally in the ICU is important to determine patients at risk of poor physical outcomes, monitor intervention efficacy, and inform recovery trajectories. These insights are important to improving the outcomes of critically ill patients.

### Clinician-and patient-identified solutions to reduce the fragmentation of post-ICU care in Australia [^3c7cd335]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Critical care survivors experience multiple care transitions, with no formal follow-up care pathway.

Research Question

What are the potential solutions to improve the communication between treating teams and integration of care following an ICU admission, from the perspective of patients, their caregivers, intensivists, and general practitioners (GPs) from diverse socioeconomic areas?

Study Design and Methods

This study included a qualitative design using semi-structured interviews with intensivists, GPs, and patients and caregivers. Framework analysis was used to analyze data and to identify solutions to improve the integration of care following hospital discharge. Patients were previously mechanically ventilated for > 24 h in the ICU and had access to a video-enabled device. Clinicians were recruited from hospital networks and a state-wide GP network.

Results

Forty-six interviews with clinicians, patients, and caregivers were completed (15 intensivists, eight GPs, 15 patients, and eight caregivers). Three higher level feedback loops were identified that comprised 10 themes. Feedback loop 1 was an ICU and primary care collaboration. It included the following: (1) developing collaborative relationships between the ICU and primary care; (2) providing interprofessional education and resources to support primary care; and (3) improving role clarity for patient follow-up care. Feedback loop 2 was developing mechanisms for improved communication across the care continuum. It included: (4) timely, concise information-sharing with primary care on post-ICU recovery; (5) survivorship-focused information-sharing across the continuum of care; (6) empowering patients and caregivers in self-management; and (7) creation of a care coordinator role for survivors. Feedback loop 3 was learning from post-ICU outcomes to improve future care. It included: (8) developing comprehensive post-ICU care pathways; (9) enhancing support for patients following a hospital stay; and (10) integration of post-ICU outcomes within the ICU to improve clinician morale and understanding.

Interpretation

Practical solutions to enhance the quality of survivorship for critical care survivors and their caregivers were identified. These themes are mapped to a novel conceptual model that includes key feedback loops for health system improvements and foci for future interventional trials to improve ICU survivorship outcomes.

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^7e48c5f9]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Participants

Participants were invited to the programme between 4 and 12 weeks after hospital discharge. Patient inclusion criteria were any patient receiving level three care (multiple organ support and / or invasive respiratory support) or more than seven days of level two care (single organ support or postoperative care). There was no upper age limit for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were any patient who was terminally ill, had suffered a traumatic brain injury or was an in-patient under psychiatric services. Caregiver inclusion criteria were: paired consented patient data had to be available and caregiving responsibilities occurred in an informal, non-paid basis. We limited inclusion in the research to one caregiver per patient; however, multiple caregivers could attend InS:PIRE.

Intervention cohort

Five sites provided the InS:PIRE programme as part of a quality improvement collaborative (intervention cohort) over 2 years. Caregivers in the intervention cohort were consecutively recruited to this study between May 2016 and October 2018 (follow-up completed December 2019). Caregiver outcome measures were completed via a pre-planned 12-month follow-up appointment. Participants were given the opportunity to complete questionnaires at InS:PIRE attendance or via telephone. Fidelity of the intervention was assessed by the number of patients who completed the three 'core' interventions: medical/nursing consultation; pharmacy; and physiotherapy review. As such, only the caregivers of patients who completed these core interventions were included in this final analysis.

Usual care cohort

We recruited a contemporary usual care cohort from sites who had no active follow-up or rehabilitation for ICU survivors. Patients in the usual care cohort were recruited from eight hospitals in Scotland between 10 and 16 months post-hospital discharge. Patients were identified by searching the local electronic records system and were recruited by postal survey. Questionnaire packs were sent to eligible patients with pre-paid return envelopes. Alongside these patient packs, we asked the patient's primary caregiver (or closest family member) to complete a separate pack. Reminder questionnaire packs were sent if the pack was not returned after one month. Participants were also given opportunity to call to discuss issues or recruitment with researchers. The usual care cohort was recruited between July 2017 and March 2020. Ethical approval was in place to continue beyond March 2020; however, the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was unknown; thus, recruitment to this study was closed in an attempt to reduce any confounding effect.

### Reported burden on informal caregivers of ICU survivors: a literature review [^73682fd6]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that critical illness and problems faced after ICU discharge have long-term effects on informal caregivers of ICU survivors. Psychosocial symptoms of PICS-F, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and decreased health-related quality of life are the most commonly reported burden.

We recommend screening for these burdens and recommend a follow-up period of at least 6 months. Screening could be done by the ICU department or rehabilitation department of the hospital where the patient was admitted. Screening on symptoms of PICS-F could be integrated in the post-ICU care, if offered, for ICU patients. The screening could be performed with a telephone consultation, or as part of a visit to a post-ICU clinic by the ICU survivor; thus combining aftercare for patients and their informal caregivers. In the absence of an ICU aftercare programme, it is important that the family physician should be aware of the risk for PICS-F symptoms in informal caregivers of former ICU patients. Informal caregivers can be screened using validated tools such as the HADS, IES, CES-D and SF-36.

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^6eb52fe3]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Caregivers and family members of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors can face emotional problems following patient discharge from hospital. We aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-centre integrated health and social care intervention, on caregiver and family member outcomes.

Methods

This study evaluated the impact of the Intensive Care Syndrome: Promoting Independence and Return to Employment (InS:PIRE) programme across 9 sites in Scotland. InS:PIRE is an integrated health and social care intervention. We compared caregivers who attended this programme with a contemporary control group of ICU caregivers (usual care cohort), who did not attend.

Results

The primary outcome was anxiety measured via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 12 months post-hospital discharge. Secondary outcome measures included depression, carer strain and clinical insomnia. A total of 170 caregivers had data available at 12 months for inclusion in this study; 81 caregivers attended the InS:PIRE intervention and completed outcome measures at 12 months post-hospital discharge. In the usual care cohort of caregivers, 89 completed measures. The two cohorts had similar baseline demographics. After adjustment, those caregivers who attended InS:PIRE demonstrated a significant improvement in symptoms of anxiety (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20–0.89, p = 0.02), carer strain (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16–0.98 p = 0.04) and clinical insomnia (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17–0.77 p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in symptoms of depression at 12 months.

Conclusions

This multicentre evaluation has shown that caregivers who attended an integrated health and social care intervention reported improved emotional health and less symptoms of insomnia, 12 months after the delivery of the intervention.

### Greater recovery after critical illness (GRACE): a call to action to create a new roadmap for critical illness research [^e0e094e1]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

For decades, most critical care patients have survived hospitalisation, supporting increased attention on the long-term critical illness recovery. The term 'Post-Intensive Care Syndrome' was coined in 2012 to raise awareness of long-term impairment in physical, cognitive and/or mental health after critical illness. However, the incidence of these impairments has persisted over the past decade, reaching as high as 60% and remains a major public health problem. Aiming to set a research agenda to address evidence gaps in critical illness recovery over the next 10 years, we invited key international opinion leaders from diverse clinical and methodological backgrounds to a roundtable meeting in June 2024 to assess the progress of post-critical illness recovery research and outline a future research agenda to address the unmet needs of critical illness survivors over the next decade. An early outcome from the meeting was to conduct a thematic analysis of critical care recovery literature, which highlighted the need for effective expectation management, ongoing patient support and education throughout recovery, integration between inpatient and community care, caregiver support and opportunities to reconnect with the intensive care unit. Participants identified conceptual challenges concerning current terminology and scope, population heterogeneity and phenotyping, and outcome definitions. Methodological challenges were identified around study design, with a call to shift to contemporary trial designs, incorporating qualitative methods. Translation into clinical practice will require interdisciplinary engagement. The roundtable concluded that a roadmap should be developed to guide clinical and research efforts over the coming decade, with the aim of developing a precision recovery approach.

### Informal caregivers in cancer (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^ec88e27d]. NCI (2010). Low credibility.

- 73% were involved in discussions about care during hospitalization; however, only about half of them were asked what help was needed after discharge.
- 72% assisted with medical tasks.
- 43% reported needing help to manage emotional and physical stress.
- 40% wanted help making end-of-life decisions.
- Closer relationships with others, including partners and children.
- Greater appreciation of life.
- Clarification of life priorities.
- Increased faith.
- More empathy for others.
- Better health habits. These common themes are more quantitatively measured by using the Benefit Finding Scale. Six domains of caregivers' personal growth have been identified and are consistent for both caregivers of survivors and those in bereavement: The process begins with the primary appraisal, which is a judgment about the relevance of the health threat and any demands on the caregiver.

A demand that is judged to be relevant receives a secondary appraisal to evaluate the likelihood that available resources have the potential to reduce or overcome the demand. Burden is perceived to be high when the difficulty of the demand outweighs the available resources. Coping strategies may also determine whether the psychological consequences of the perceived burden are negative or positive. The Transactional Model of Stress and Coping shown above has not been validated and serves to organize the rest of the summary. Another group of investigators interviewed six patients with head and neck cancer and their spouses within 6 months of completing treatment. Thematic analysis identified several unmet needs, including the following:

- Better preparation for side effects.
- Clearer timeline of recovery.
- Strategies to deal with the emotions experienced by patients and spouses during treatment.
- Support in managing fears about the patient's condition.
- Receiving disease-related information.
- Receiving emotional support for themselves. There were no strong predictors of caregiver needs. However, unmet patient needs and caregiver anxiety were modestly associated with unmet needs in caregivers. Similarly, the SCNS–P&C was administered to 166 lung cancer patient–caregiver dyads in Taiwan. The top unmet needs were information needs.
- Recognition by health care providers of the informal caregivers' roles, responsibilities, and challenges.
- Information about treatment plans, goals, anticipated complications or side effects, and likely outcomes.
- Guidance for how to respond to changes in patients' physical and emotional health over the disease trajectory.
- Support in coping with the stress of caregiving.

### Effects on health-related quality of life of interventions affecting survival in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^f2f62a58]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study is the first to evaluate the impact on QoL of the interventions which showed a significant effect on survival in critically ill patients. We found that: (1) only 7 (2.9%) studies assessed QoL among the 239 RCTs reporting a significant effect on survival; (2) interventions improving survival can have not only a positive or null but also a negative effect on QoL.

Our findings raise the ethical need to establish if the improvement in survival outweighs the negative effect on QoL. Ideally, the single patient should be the judge: Therapeutic decisions should be shared with every patient, or, when not feasible, with his/her family and loved ones, addressing the expected impact of interventions not only on survival but also on QoL.

ICU survivors suffer from medium- and long-term impairments in mental health, cognition and physical function, because of premorbid conditions, severity of the acute illness and complications associated with treatments during the ICU stay. Only in 2010, the set of all these impairments was defined "Post-Intensive Care Syndrome". Implications of PICS are multidimensional and touch not only patients but also caregivers and society. For all these aspects described above, long-term QoL is compromised among ICU survivors when compared with general population.

### Availability of family caregiver programs in US cancer centers… [^702e4f59]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Survey questions about the availability of 11 types of family caregiver programs were developed after literature review, assessment of similar program evaluation surveys, and discussions among a 13-member national expert advisory committee. Family caregiver programs were defined as structured, planned, and coordinated groups of activities and procedures aimed at specifically supporting family caregivers as part of usual care. Survey responses were tabulated using standard descriptive statistics, including means, proportions, and frequencies. Yet despite providing complex medical and nursing care, a large proportion of caregivers receive little to no formal support or training. 1, 2 Cancer caregivers can provide up to an average of 8 hours of daily assistance to care recipients, 3 including managing and monitoring symptoms, coordinating care, communicating with the health care team, partnering in.

health care decision making, managing medications, and offering psychological and emotional support. 1, 4, 5 In recognition of this wide variation in and complexity of caregiver tasks, legislative action such as the CARE Act has been passed in most US states. Recognizing the lack of and critical need for caregiver support, numerous effective interventions to train cancer caregivers have been developed and tested over the past 2 decades. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of cancer caregiver support interventions have cataloged approximately 75 interventions that have been developed and tested. 8, 9 Furthermore, these interventions have been found to positively affect both caregiver and patient outcomes. 10–12 Yet despite development of effective caregiver interventions, there are few system-level data on whether they have been adopted and implemented in US cancer centers.

A medical oncologist, a palliative care physician, and a clinical psychologist associated with the UAB Center for Palliative and Supportive Care provided additional feedback. The survey was subsequently field-tested for readability, face validity, and survey completion time with 2 psycho-oncology counseling clinicians. The final survey consisted of 19 items asking about cancer center and family caregiver program details, including types of programs offered, how they were developed and funded, and the support needed to develop caregiver programs. To address this, the survey instructions encouraged individuals to ask for help from their work colleagues to answer the survey or to refer the study team to another individual in the cancer center who might be better suited to complete it. Third, cancer centers with caregiver programs and champions to support them may have been more likely to respond to the survey.

### Communicating to patients and families about post-intensive care syndrome [^92e241ff]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 4
A2F bundle framework. A2F bundle = ABCDEF bundle; SAT = spontaneous awakening trial; SBT = spontaneous breathing trial.

For those patients in the ICU who survive their initial critical illness and have increasing likelihood of hospital survival, we begin to counsel patients and families on the recovery that lay ahead. Here, plain language and awareness of both health literacy and cultural differences is key in effective communication. We share that many ICU survivors face impairments or challenges after the hospital. We personalize these conversations to show empathy for the individual and an eye toward survivorship:

I'm so glad that your father has improved from his critical illness. We're hopeful that he'll continue progressing towards leaving the ICU, but it's important to be aware he might not immediately be capable of playing bridge or pickleball again because of the concentration and mobility problems many patients face after the ICU. We've been diligent about keeping him awake and walking daily to help him keep his muscles and brain as strong as possible so he'll have less of these challenges.

We include similar language in any major update to the family. As ICU discharge draws closer, we introduce more details while taking care to avoid jargon or overburdening the family. We review the various domains of PICS and emphasize that, although severity varies, these problems can occur in up to one-half of ICU survivors so that we normalize any impairments that may occur. We help prepare families by using the risk factors above to give qualitative assessments of possible recovery trajectories and take into consideration the patient's initial characteristics — age, frailty, recent functional trajectory, and comorbidities — and in-hospital risk factors of delirium, sepsis, shock, mechanical ventilation and ICU LOS (Fig 1). We also emphasize that not every patient experiences PICS, and PICS-related symptoms can improve over months and years, admitting to the uncertainty inherent to predicting how any individual may recover. PICS affects more than patients, and we share with caregivers that they too may experience mental health difficulties and financial strain in primary caregiver roles. Before discharge, we discuss with patients and families the importance of post-hospital follow-up to address PICS and other challenges during the recovery period. We give anticipatory guidance to ease the transition of leaving the hospital and to help align expectations for what might be a new quality of life.

### Geriatric trauma management [^f421966f]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Caregiver support interventions and ICU preparation — Burden on family caregivers can be immense, and interventions that improve preparedness and comfort include nurses engaging in "transition coaching" to teach patient and caregiver skills for postoperative care, promoting continuity of care, and patient care teams offering options for postoperative support after discharge; caregivers report that the worst part is seeing their loved one in the ICU for the first time just after surgery, and nurses can guide patients and caregivers through the ICU or geriatric surgical ward before surgery, explaining what to expect, since familiarity with the environment can help buffer the caregiver's shock of seeing their loved one postoperatively.

### Mental health interventions to improve psychological outcomes in informal caregivers of critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4e8560a7]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Meta-analysis of 22 trials (n = 7 [32%] in adult ICUs) identified no significant effect of on psychologic distress at any time (Supplemental Fig. 3 b). Two studies reported significantly improved caregiver distress within 3 months discharge while two reported increased distress; all studies conducted in NICUs. No study reported significant improvement after 3 months discharge.

Interventions pooled across five RCTs (n = 3 [60%] in adult ICUs) significantly increased caregiver burden [feeling need to do more] within 3 months of ICU discharge (RoM, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05–1.12; I² = 6.96%; n = 819 caregivers) (Fig. 4 A). There was no significant effect after 3 months across four trials that reported long-term outcomes (RoM, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.81–1.06; I² = 0.00%; n = 127 caregivers). The single study that reported significantly increased burden was the Creating Opportunities for Parent Engagement evaluation trial by Melnyk et al in two NICUs.

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^7b35056f]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention

The intervention is described in accordance with the Template for intervention Description and Replication checklist (Additional file 1: S1).

The Intensive Care Syndrome: Promoting Independence and Return to Employment (InS:PIRE) programme is a complex intervention and has been described previously. InS:PIRE is an integrated health and social care intervention aimed at improving outcomes for ICU survivors and their caregivers in the year following hospital discharge.

Briefly, all patients receive individual reviews with different members of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) including: an ICU nurse and doctor; pharmacist; and physiotherapist. These specialists offer a debrief of the ICU stay, an assessment of ongoing problems, goal setting and patient-directed management plans. Clinical Psychology services, alongside occupational therapy, was also available. Peer support was embedded throughout InS:PIRE through the use shared waiting areas and group sessions. Patient and caregiver volunteers further along the recovery trajectory also attended the programme and provided peer support.

Several group sessions were set up for caregivers, including the clinical psychological support. Every site involved local community organisations who provided welfare advice including information on relevant government benefits and housing. This support was delivered through a combination of individual appointments, drop-in sessions or group discussions. Support for caregivers from local agencies was also integrated at every site. In contrast with other ICU recovery services which often include a single clinical appointment, InS:PIRE was designed as a recovery programme; patients and caregivers attend each week for five weeks and are followed up for 1 year after initial attendance. During the intervention period, the InS:PIRE service took place in the hospital setting.

InS:PIRE was co-designed with local patients and caregivers. During this process, patients and caregivers both described the necessity for a specific and deliberate focus on caregivers within any rehabilitation service. This is also consistent with previous evidence is this field. Initial single-centre work showed that supporting caregivers was feasible, safe and acceptable; thus, this support was included in this multi-centre scale up. Caregivers could attend all sessions and were eligible to receive the same support as patients. This only differed with the physiotherapy and pharmacy sessions which were aimed specifically at patient recovery.

### Reported burden on informal caregivers of ICU survivors: a literature review [^9f11fcb0]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Critical illness and the problems faced after ICU discharge do not only affect the patient, it also negatively impacts patients' informal caregivers. There is no review which summarizes all types of burden reported in informal caregivers of ICU survivors. It is important that the burdens these informal caregivers suffer are systematically assessed so the caregivers can receive the professional care they need. We aimed to provide a complete overview of the types of burdens reported in informal caregivers of adult ICU survivors, to make recommendations on which burdens should be assessed in this population, and which tools should be used to assess them.

Method

We performed a systematic search in PubMed and CINAHL from database inception until June 2014. All articles reporting on burdens in informal caregivers of adult ICU survivors were included. Two independent reviewers used a standardized form to extract characteristics of informal caregivers, types of burdens and instruments used to assess these burdens. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa and the PEDro scales.

Results

The search yielded 2704 articles, of which we included 28 in our review. The most commonly reported outcomes were psychosocial burden. Six months after ICU discharge, the prevalence of anxiety was between 15% and 24%, depression between 4.7% and 36.4% and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) between 35% and 57.1%. Loss of employment, financial burden, lifestyle interference and low health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were also frequently reported. The most commonly used tools were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression questionnaire, and Impact of Event Scale (IES). The quality of observational studies was low and of randomized studies moderate to fair.

Conclusions

Informal caregivers of ICU survivors suffer a substantial variety of burdens. Although the quality of the included studies was poor, there is evidence that burden in the psychosocial field is most prevalent. We suggest screening informal caregivers of ICU survivors for anxiety, depression, PTSD, and HRQoL using respectively the HADS, IES and Short Form 36 and recommend a follow-up period of at least 6 months.

### Post-intensive care syndrome and caregiver burden: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^e4144e7d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In our secondary analysis of a clinical trial, patient PICS and caregiver burden were associated at concurrent time points but not associated with each other over time. Our findings suggest promising directions for future research into the interplay between PICS and caregiver burden in recovery after ICU discharge considering their recognized interdependence.

### Hierarchy of preferred patient outcomes among survivors of acute respiratory failure [^cafba4d5]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Surviving acute respiratory failure (ARF) in the ICU is often a life-changing event. Most survivors face endure impairments across several domains, termed as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). There is limited investigation on how survivors and their caregivers perceive recovery from their own lived experiences. The objective of this study was to characterize which domains of recovery matter most to ARF survivors and their caregivers. Methods: A single-center, prospective observational study nested within 2 contiguous cohort studies: Addressing Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (APICS)-01 and APICS-COVID that enrolled ARF survivors who were admitted to ICU and discharged home. Survivors and caregivers were asked to prioritize following 9 domains of recovery using a custom-made survey: cognition, pain, physical function, pulmonary function, muscle/nerve function, mental health, fatigue, return to work or prior activities, and survival. These domains were chosen based on prior literature and modified based on input from a patient and family advisory council at the study site. The order of prioritization of domains of recovery was assessed at hospital discharge and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results: Forty eligible study subjects and 10 caregivers were recruited between 2019 and 2022. Mean age was 51.0 (SD 13.8) years, more than two thirds were male, and approximately one-third were non-white. Of the 9 domains surveyed, survival was consistently ranked the highest at each of the 3 time points. Cognitive recovery and physical function were ranked as the next 2 most important domains of recovery. Conclusions: ARF survivors who were discharged to home prioritized survival and then physical and cognitive recovery over 6 other domains. Understanding what matters most to survivors is a key step toward identifying priority areas for care in ICUs and rehabilitation after critical illness. Future studies should include survivors and caregivers from diverse backgrounds to obtain a comprehensive assessment of their perspective of recovery.

### Reported burden on informal caregivers of ICU survivors: a literature review [^423aab61]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Results

We retrieved 2704 articles using the search strategy described in Table 1. After removing duplicates, we assessed the title and abstract of 2311 articles and excluded 2264 articles based on title and abstract. Figure 1 summarizes the inclusion process and provides the reasons for exclusion. We assessed the full text of 47 articles and excluded another 21 articles. We hand searched the references of the 26 included articles and included two additional studies. Nine authors were contacted to complete the data for 12 articles and six authors responded.

Fig. 1
Flow diagram of literature search results, the inclusion process and the reason for exclusion

Study characteristics and quality

There is a wide variety in study and informal caregiver characteristics (Table S1 in Additional file 1). Fourteen studies were conducted in northern America, 12 in Europe, one in Australia and one in Botswana. The follow-up period ranged from 2 weeks after hospital discharge to 4 years after ICU discharge. Most of the informal caregivers were female (47–100%) and most of them were the partner/spouse of the ICU survivor (24–100%).

We present the results of the quality assessment of the included articles in Table 2. The NOS scores for the 24 observational studies ranged from two to three on a scale of zero to nine, indicating low quality. The PEDro scale score for the three randomized controlled trials ranged from four to seven on a scale of zero to ten, indicating moderate to fair quality.

### Reported burden on informal caregivers of ICU survivors: a literature review [^c64d4158]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

We performed a literature review to assess the burdens experienced by informal caregivers of adult ICU survivors have been documented, how they are assessed and to make recommendations on which burdens should be assessed. We have shown that informal caregivers of ICU survivors have extensive burdens following the patient's ICU admission. This is reflected in psychosocial status, quality of life, lifestyle, employment and financial status. The most frequently used assessment tools were the HADS, the CES-D, the IES and the SF-36.

Psychosocial burdens are most commonly reported and, in this review, we described these in depth. Generally, the prevalence was highest during and shortly after the ICU admission, decreased over time, but remained higher compared to control groups. In contrast, the prevalence of PTSD increased over time. Although different measurement tools were used, the prevalence of depression among informal caregivers of ICU survivors was higher than among informal caregivers of patients with colorectal cancer and following coronary bypass surgery, stroke, hip fracture, congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction. We found that, 3 months after ICU discharge, between a quarter and two-thirds of informal caregivers reported anxiety. This is similar to the prevalence reported in a systematic review on anxiety in informal caregivers of people with dementia. Burdens such as insomnia, concentration problems, fear of death and spiritual problems were only described by few authors in low-quality, observational studies. However, these burdens can influence informal caregivers substantially. Further research on the scope of these problems and the appropriated assessment tools is necessary.

A range of assessment tools can be used to quantify the burdens on informal caregivers. However, these tools use different cut-off points to quantify the burden. For example, the HADS uses two different cut-off points. Scores of eight to ten on the anxiety or depression subscale potentially indicate pathology and scores of 11 or more are considered more definite. However, these tools can be used as screening instruments, but are not valid methods for obtaining a clinical diagnosis and cannot predict which informal caregivers will need professional treatment to recover.

Correct use of the questionnaires is crucial, but not always found. For example in the article by McAdam the IER-R is used for informal caregivers during ICU admission of their relative and refers to the outcome as PTSD. However, according to the definition of PTSD, PTSD cannot be evaluated during the event. Symptoms have to be present for at least 1 month after the event of interest in order to be diagnosed as PTSD.

### Feasibility and efficacy of a resiliency intervention for the prevention of chronic emotional distress among survivor-caregiver dyads admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit: a randomized clinical trial [^7ec8cc0c]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

We observed excellent feasibility as evidenced by the ability to recruit participants quickly and randomize and retain them with low attrition rates. Participants believed RT would help improve their recovery trajectory and experienced high satisfaction with the program at both posttreatment and 12-week follow-up. Both intervention and control were delivered with high fidelity, and most survivors and caregivers attended at least 4 sessions. These findings suggest that RT content and delivery (in-person and video) is appropriate for this population.

Across the main outcomes of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS, those randomized to RT showed better outcomes at posttreatment assessment than those randomized to control. Improvement in these outcomes were clinically meaningful and maintained at the 3-month follow-up visit. Improvements were observed for both survivors and caregivers. Of note, survivors randomized to RT continued to show significant improvement in PTS symptoms after the intervention ended. These results suggest that RT has durable effects over and above the time and attention from a clinician and general education information. This pilot trial successfully demonstrated the usefulness of this type of resilience intervention for patients with ANI and their caregivers. Across the intervention target outcomes, we observed improvement in positive dyadic interpersonal interaction for survivors. These improvements remained stable during the 3-month follow up. The observed improvement in dyadic interpersonal interaction supports RT content of teaching interpersonal communication skills.

Significant strengths of the study include strong measures of feasibility, including recruitment, retention, and fidelity, and significant improvement in outcomes. RT was developed to directly address limitations of prior negative trials in similar settings and with similar populations.

### Reported burden on informal caregivers of ICU survivors: a literature review [^1a4553d0]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Critical illness and the problems faced after ICU discharge do not only affect the patient, it also negatively impacts patients' informal caregivers. There is no review which summarizes all types of burden reported in informal caregivers of ICU survivors. It is important that the burdens these informal caregivers suffer are systematically assessed so the caregivers can receive the professional care they need. We aimed to provide a complete overview of the types of burdens reported in informal caregivers of adult ICU survivors, to make recommendations on which burdens should be assessed in this population, and which tools should be used to assess them.

Method

We performed a systematic search in PubMed and CINAHL from database inception until June 2014. All articles reporting on burdens in informal caregivers of adult ICU survivors were included. Two independent reviewers used a standardized form to extract characteristics of informal caregivers, types of burdens and instruments used to assess these burdens. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa and the PEDro scales.

Results

The search yielded 2704 articles, of which we included 28 in our review. The most commonly reported outcomes were psychosocial burden. Six months after ICU discharge, the prevalence of anxiety was between 15% and 24%, depression between 4.7% and 36.4% and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) between 35% and 57.1%. Loss of employment, financial burden, lifestyle interference and low health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were also frequently reported. The most commonly used tools were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression questionnaire, and Impact of Event Scale (IES). The quality of observational studies was low and of randomized studies moderate to fair.

Conclusions

Informal caregivers of ICU survivors suffer a substantial variety of burdens. Although the quality of the included studies was poor, there is evidence that burden in the psychosocial field is most prevalent. We suggest screening informal caregivers of ICU survivors for anxiety, depression, PTSD, and HRQoL using respectively the HADS, IES and Short Form 36 and recommend a follow-up period of at least 6 months.

### Transitions of care after critical illness-challenges to recovery and adaptive problem solving [^8828ed91]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Investigate the challenges experienced by survivors of critical illness and their caregivers across the transitions of care from intensive care to community, and the potential problem-solving strategies used to navigate these challenges.

Design

Qualitative design-data generation via interviews and data analysis via the framework analysis method.

Setting

Patients and caregivers from three continents, identified through the Society of Critical Care Medicine's THRIVE international collaborative sites (follow-up clinics and peer support groups).

Subjects

Patients and caregivers following critical illness.

Interventions

Nil.

Measurements and Main Results

From 86 interviews (66 patients, 20 caregivers), we identified the following major themes: 1) Challenges for patients-interacting with the health system and gaps in care; managing others' expectations of illness and recovery. 2) Challenges for caregivers-health system shortfalls and inadequate communication; lack of support for caregivers. 3) Patient and caregiver-driven problem solving across the transitions of care-personal attributes, resources, and initiative; receiving support and helping others; and acceptance.

Conclusions

Survivors and caregivers experienced a range of challenges across the transitions of care. There were distinct and contrasting themes related to the caregiver experience. Survivors and caregivers used comparable problem-solving strategies to navigate the challenges encountered across the transitions of care.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on family-centered care for adult ICUs: 2024 [^442694df]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bereavement support for ICU families — evidence synthesis and implementation notes indicate that different meta-analyses found no statistically significant improvements in family satisfaction outcomes with bereavement support initiatives, with a nonsignificant trend toward higher general family satisfaction in controls; meta-analyses of family anxiety ranged from no statistically significant association at first follow-up, to a trend supporting the intervention at 1 mo, to statistically significant benefit at 6 mo, and despite limited quantity and quality of evidence, bereavement support was considered worthy of recommendation and should be tailored to local resources, unit-based champions, and staff burden.

### Piloting an ICU follow-up clinic to improve health-related quality of life in ICU survivors after a prolonged intensive care stay (PINA): feasibility of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^e333242e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 5
Characteristics of other ICU follow-up pilot studies compared to our study

Henderson et al. performed a single-centre feasibility cohort trial on a five-week multidisciplinary peer support rehabilitation programme for ICU survivors (complex intervention) and measured its impact on HRQOL, anxiety, depression, pain and caregiver strain through surveys. The intervention contained a de-brief of the ICU stay, physical assessment and dedicated physiotherapy, review of medication, advice on social care support and peer support groups. Inclusion criteria were a minimum duration of mechanical ventilation of 48 h and a prolonged ICU stay (no further details provided). 27 participants (67% male, median age 66 years) were followed-up 12 weeks, three and 12 months after ICU discharge. The intervention showed to be feasible and safe in the clinical environment with a participation rate of 24% and an attrition rate of 4%. The initial visit at the clinic was 12 weeks after discharge compared to 20 weeks in our study. In contrast to our study, HRQOL was measured at three points (baseline, after 3 and 12 months) with the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS). The mean baseline value was 70 (52 in our study) and improved to 78.

The feasibility study on a paediatric ICU follow-up clinic from Samuel et al. measured the risk for posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression of parents whose children stayed on ICU for at least 12 h and evaluated if a follow-up clinic appointment two months after discharge decreased this risk. Half of the approached parents (52%) participated in their study. Randomisation worked and they did not observe significant differences between intervention and control group. The authors report a similar completeness of outcome measurement instruments to our study (75% vs. 77%). Uniquely, the study group included a low-risk group of parents (n = 131) which was not involved into the randomised trial but assessed in lights of acceptability measures. E.g. they were asked if the lack of invitation to the follow-up clinic was upsetting, which they denied. Further, 56% parents in the control group would have liked to visit the follow-up clinic. Identified barriers to visit the follow-up clinic were e.g. difficulties arranging time off work, travel costs or distance from hospital. In lights of signals for effectiveness, no significant differences were found between the intervention group and the control group six months after discharge.

### Translating evidence to patient care through caregivers: a systematic review of caregiver-mediated interventions [^d23588f9]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted and reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria (see Additional file 1 for the checklist). An a priori protocol was published online through PROSPERO (registration number CRD42016052509; Additional file 2). Ethical approval was not required, as previously published data were used.

Patient and stakeholder involvement

Our methods were informed by our stakeholders: a 2-day stakeholder (patients, families, researchers, care providers) engagement meeting was held (November 17–18, 2016, Calgary, Canada) to determine relevant, patient-oriented priorities. Attendees included three former intensive care unit (ICU) patients, four family members of former ICU patients, 19 researchers, and 10 care providers. Patients and family members were asked to identify relevant and important patient-oriented priorities in critical care medicine; the discussion was open and guided by an experienced facilitator. Study findings will be presented to these patients and family members at the next stakeholder engagement meeting planned for the Fall of 2018.

Outcome measures

Based on feedback from stakeholders, the primary research question was: Are caregiver-mediated interventions effective in improving patient, caregiver, provider, or health system outcomes? Secondary research questions were the following: (1) What types of interventions have been deemed effective? (2) Does effectiveness vary according to the intervention type, patient population, caregiver group, contextual factors, or implementation strategy? (3) How have these interventions been evaluated?

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on family-centered care for adult ICUs: 2024 [^936a27d3]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bereavement support in adult intensive care — Recommendation: We suggest providing bereavement support to families of patients who have died in the ICU (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). There are not sufficient data to formally recommend a specific intervention; described interventions include brochures or booklets, condolence letters, and meetings with specific care teams such as palliative care, psychologists, or specially trained nurses. The recommendation is informed by eight RCTs, with low quality evidence, little evidence for potential harm, and perceived high potential for benefit, and reported outcomes varied across trials including family anxiety, depression, PTSD, grief, and comprehension.

### Education and support needs during recovery in acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors [^be7c6f13]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Needs that occur outside of the ICU and general ward phases have not yet been articulated in the existing research. Our research provides guidance for future interventions because we consider a broad spectrum of needs as they occur across the recovery trajectory. Through our interviews we found a persistent need for information regarding the diagnosis and prognosis of ARDS throughout all the phases of recovery. This finding suggests that critical information needs that are not met early on in the recovery period persist throughout the care continuum until they are appropriately met. In the later phases of recovery, disease-specific information lessens and is replaced by needs surrounding resources on access to community care. Inconsistencies in the delivery of information were common suggesting that the delivery or transfer of knowledge from the health care team to the patients is variable. Emotional needs during the later phases were mixed. The anticipation of returning home brought with it challenges including difficulty coping with independent living, having unrealistic expectations for recovery, and coping with change in the relationships with their family caregivers. Re-integration back into the community ultimately determined the success of this phase. Instrumental needs during the later recovery phases focused on rehabilitation, vocational training, and access to care. Many survivors required ongoing reassurance about their health status and believed that in the future, there would be a need for more rehabilitation, psychological counseling, and medical follow-up. These qualitative findings are consistent with quantitative data of lower functional status and quality of life in ARDS survivors.

### Guidelines for family-centered care in the neonatal, pediatric, and adult ICU [^9d07a3f2]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Intensive care unit (ICU) diary programs for relatives — evidence, safety, and feasibility: Two randomized trials show that, in family members, receiving an ICU diary can reduce the risk of post-traumatic stress 3 months and 12 months after the patient's discharge or death, with the quality of evidence low and sample sizes of 36 and 143, respectively, from single-center or two-site studies. No harm has been described and relatives mostly describe improved communicative, emotional, and humanizing experiences. The overall quality of evidence for ICU diaries is low, and there is a potential time investment to hospitals and ICUs for development of diary programs.

### A multicentre evaluation exploring the impact of an integrated health and social care intervention for the caregivers of ICU survivors [^bed4b841]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Demographics

Two hundred and six patients attended InS:PIRE across the five participating sites and consented to participation in the study. Of these patients, 136 attended with caregivers who consented to participation in the study at baseline (initial InS:PIRE attendance). Eighty-one (60%) of these caregivers completed outcomes measures at 1 year and were eligible for inclusion in this analysis (intervention cohort).

In the usual care cohort, 452 patients were sent questionnaire packs across the four usual care cohort sites; 115 patients returned the packs for analysis in the study. Of these, 89 (77%) paired caregivers also completed outcome measures at 1 year and were included in the caregiver usual care cohort.

The caregiver intervention and usual care cohort was similar in all baseline demographics. Both cohorts were predominantly female (intervention: 49 (60.5%) vs. usual care: 57 (64%)) and had similar age profiles (intervention:58 (IQR: 48.0–66.3) vs. usual care 58 (IQR: 47.7–69.0) years (Table 1). There was also a similar spread across the socio-economic gradient in both groups. Patient and caregiver demographics are shown in Table 1.

### Psychosocial outcomes in informal caregivers of the critically ill: a systematic review [^1b01d31b]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the review was to evaluate and synthesize the prevalence, risk factors, and trajectory of psychosocial morbidity in informal caregivers of critical care survivors.

Data Sources

A systematic search of MEDLINE, PsychInfo, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, PILOTS, EMBASE, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database was undertaken between January and February 2014.

Study Selection

Citations were screened independently by two reviewers for studies that investigated psychosocial outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, burden, activity restriction, and health-related quality of life) for informal caregivers of critical care survivors (mechanically ventilated for 48 hr or more).

Data Extraction

Data on study outcomes were extracted into a standardized form and quality assessed by two independent reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and the National Health and Medical Research Council Hierarchy of Evidence guide. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines were followed.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen studies of 1,491 caregivers were included. Depressive symptoms were the most commonly reported outcome with a prevalence of 75.5% during critical care and 22.8–29% at 1-year follow-up. Risk factors for depressive symptoms in caregivers included female gender and younger age. The greatest period of risk for all outcomes was during the patient's critical care admission although psychological symptoms improved over time. The overall quality of the studies was low.

Conclusions

Depressive symptoms were the most prevalent in informal caregivers of survivors of intensive care who were ventilated for more than 48 hours and persist at 1 year with a prevalence of 22.8–29.0%, which is comparable with caregivers of patients with dementia. Screening for caregiver risks could be performed during the ICU admission where intervention can be implemented and then evaluated. Further high-quality studies are needed to quantify anxiety, stress, caregiver burden, and posttraumatic stress disorder outcomes in informal caregivers of long-stay patients surviving ICU.

### A novel approach to ICU survivor care: a population health quality improvement project [^5ae0fc62]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Deliver a novel interdisciplinary care process for ICU survivor care and their primary family caregivers, and assess mortality, readmission rates, and economic impact compared with usual care.

Design

Population health quality improvement comparative study with retrospective data analysis.

Setting

A single tertiary care rural hospital with medical/surgical, neuroscience, trauma, and cardiac ICUs.

Patients

ICU survivors.

Interventions

Reorganization of existing post discharge health care delivery resources to form an ICU survivor clinic care process and compare this new process to post discharge usual care process.

Measurements and Main Results

Demographic data, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV scores, and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores were extracted from the electronic health record. Additional data was extracted from the care manager database. Economic data were extracted from the Geisinger Health Plan database and analyzed by a health economist. During 13-month period analyzed, patients in the ICU survivor care had reduced mortality compared with usual care, as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method (ICU survivor care 0.89 vs usual care 0.71; log-rank p = 0.0108) and risk-adjusted stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (hazard ratio, 0.157; 95% CI, 0.058–0.427). Readmission for ICU survivor care versus usual care: at 30 days (10.4% vs 26.3%; stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratio, 0.539; 95% CI, 0.224–1.297) and at 60 days (16.7% vs 34.7%; stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratio, 0.525; 95% CI, 0.240–1.145). Financial data analysis indicates estimated annual cost savings to Geisinger Health Plan ranges from $247,052 to $424,846 during the time period analyzed.

Conclusions

Our ICU survivor care process results in decreased mortality and a net annual cost savings to the insurer compared with usual care processes. There was no statistically significant difference in readmission rates.

### Feasibility and efficacy of a resiliency intervention for the prevention of chronic emotional distress among survivor-caregiver dyads admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit: a randomized clinical trial [^ee1dc97f]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Feasibility Markers

Feasibility Markers appear in Table 3. They include the feasibility of recruitment, ie, the percentage of dyads who screened in and agreed to participate among those who were approached in the neuroscience ICU; feasibility of randomization (acceptability), ie, the percentage of patients who were started within 1 group (ie, intervention or control) and completed posttreatment assessment among those randomized; feasibility of data collection, ie, the percentage of dyads who provided posttreatment and 3-month follow-up among those randomized; and adherence to session (adherence), ie, the percentage of dyads who completed 4 of 6 sessions among those randomized. Fidelity to condition was defined in 2 ways. First, it was defined as the percentage of clinicians who self-reported adherence to each study component using a predetermined session checklist among all clinicians. Second, it was defined as the percentage of clinicians whom 2 independent raters judged were adherent among a randomly selected 20% of the recorded sessions across all clinicians. Satisfaction was assessed at postintervention with the 3-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, (CSQ-3; range, 0–12). Treatment expectancy and rationale credibility were assessed with the 6-item Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ), which has 2 subscales: cognitively based credibility and affectively based expectancy (range, 3–27).

### Trajectories of burden or benefits of caregiving among informal caregivers of older adults: a systematic review [^7444e3a8]. Innovation in Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Informal caregiving for older adults can be both burdensome and beneficial. Given that the informal caregiving situation may evolve over time, and care needs of older adults can result from diverse health conditions, it is valuable to understand the trajectories of burden or benefits of caregiving and how these trajectories vary across health conditions common among older care-recipients. This review is the first to summarize the literature on trajectories of burden or benefits of caregiving, including caregiver and care-recipient characteristics associated with the trajectories.

Research Design and Methods

We reviewed longitudinal observational quantitative studies, from 5 bibliographic databases, that assessed burden or benefits of caregiving at 3 or more time points among informal caregivers of older adults (60 years or above).

Results

The narrative synthesis included 41 studies, with only 7 (17%) considering trajectories of benefits. A stable average trajectory of burden or benefits of caregiving was the most common pattern over time across various care-recipient health conditions. However, an increasing burden over time was primarily observed among caregivers of persons with dementia, while a decreasing burden was noted among caregivers of persons discharged from the hospital after an acute health event. Only 6 (10%) studies, which reported heterogeneity in the progression of burden or benefits separately or jointly, identified distinctive trajectories within the same set of caregivers. Risk factors consistently identified to be associated with trajectories indicating persistently higher burden or persistently lower benefits included more care-recipient functional limitations and behavioral problems, being a non-spousal caregiver, being a solo caregiver, and perceiving less self-efficacy or competence.

Discussion and Implications

Future studies should focus on the trajectories of benefits of caregiving, untangle heterogeneity in trajectories of burden or benefits of caregiving, and consider both burden and benefits concurrently to identify factors that both enhance benefits and alleviate burden over time.

### Feasibility and efficacy of a resiliency intervention for the prevention of chronic emotional distress among survivor-caregiver dyads admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit: a randomized clinical trial [^3f55d3fa]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is participation in a dyadic resiliency intervention associated with a measurable reduction in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress (PTS) compared with participation in an educational control?

Findings

In this pilot, single-blind, randomized clinical trial of 58 dyads of survivors of the neuroscience intensive care unit and their informal caregivers, survivors and caregivers who received the active intervention experienced a significant reduction in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTS.

Meaning

In this pilot randomized clinical trial, the dyadic resiliency intervention was feasible, and the findings suggest that it may prevent chronic emotional distress in survivors of acute brain injury and their caregivers.

### Education and support needs during recovery in acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors [^60935296]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The TIR framework provides structure for the development of a support program that encompasses the care continuum.

- ARDS patients have changing support needs throughout the recovery process.

- ARDS patients and their family caregivers have significant educational needs during and after the acute critical illness.

- Education and preparation throughout the course of recovery may decrease the negative health outcomes of ARDS.

### Guidelines for family-centered care in the neonatal, pediatric, and adult ICU [^383a431a]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Impact of critical illness on families — decision-making and psychosocial burden highlights that stressful decision making often falls to family members because most patients in the ICU are too ill to participate, that family members bear a significant caregiving burden to the more than 50% of critical illness survivors who have postdischarge disability, and that approximately one quarter to one half of family members of critically ill children or adults experience psychological symptoms including acute stress, post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety, and depression; this has been termed "Post-Intensive Care Syndrome-Family", and support for family caregivers can also improve patient outcomes.

### Part 11: post-cardiac arrest care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^16acd153]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Post–cardiac arrest survivorship — emotional distress and psychosocial/rehabilitative interventions — notes that approximately one fourth of survivors and caregivers experience emotional distress, symptoms can begin during hospitalization and can linger from months to years, and psychosocial interventions show benefit. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared a psychosocial intervention between 2 groups of survivor–caregiver pairs and reported improvements in survivors' emotional distress in both groups, with the survivor–caregiver intervention group having the greatest benefit and greater improvements in caregiver burden; Two other RCTs in survivors also showed improvements in emotional distress compared with control. One RCT found improved quality of life with an early, cognitive-focused screening, self-management, and referral program versus treatment as usual, and Three other preliminary trials demonstrated feasibility of residential physical rehabilitation, cardiac rehabilitation, and telephone-based occupational therapy with preliminary benefits; The evaluation prior to discharge is important to facilitate care coordination and referral.

### Fatigue in family caregivers of adult intensive care unit survivors [^e31039b4]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Family caregivers are a vital resource in the recovery of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. Of concern, the stress associated with this role can negatively affect caregiver health. Fatigue, an important health indicator, has been identified as a predictor of various illnesses, greater use of health services, and early mortality. Examining the impact of fatigue on caregivers' physical health can assist in identifying critical time points and potential targets for intervention.

Objectives

To describe self-reported fatigue in caregivers of ICU survivors from patients' ICU admission to ≤ 2 weeks, two- and four-months post-ICU discharge.

Methods

Patient-caregiver pairs were enrolled from a medical ICU. Caregiver fatigue was measured using the Short-Form 36 Health Survey Vitality subscale (SF-36 Vitality). Caregiver psychobehavioral stress responses included depressive symptoms, burden, health risk behaviors, and sleep quality. Patient data included self-reported physical symptoms and disposition (home vs. institution).

Results

Forty-seven patient-caregiver pairs were initially enrolled. Clinically significant fatigue (SF-36 Vitality ≤ 45) was reported by 43%-53% of caregivers across the time points, and these caregivers reported worse scores in measures of depressive symptoms, burden, health risk behaviors and sleep quality, and patients' symptom burden. In 26 caregivers with data for all time points (55% of the total sample), SF-36 Vitality scores showed trends of improvement when the patient returned home and greater impairment when institutionalization continued.

Conclusion

In caregivers of ICU survivors, fatigue is common and potentially linked with poor psychobehavioral responses. Worsening fatigue was associated with greater symptom distress and long-term patient institutionalization.

### Evaluation of a health and social care programme to improve outcomes following critical illness: a multicentre study [^ad4bd905]. Thorax (2023). Medium credibility.

Intervention

The InS:PIRE programme is a complex intervention which has been described previously. Briefly, all patients receive individual reviews with: (1) ICU doctor and nurse; (2) Pharmacist; and (3) Physiotherapist. These reviews offer a debrief of the ICU stay, an assessment of ongoing problems, goal setting and patient-directed recovery plans. Patients were considered to have completed the intervention if they received these three 'core' reviews. Clinical neuropsychology input is available at every site via group sessions and individual reviews as required. Peer support is embedded in the programme through the use of shared waiting areas, group sessions, and the presence of patient and caregiver volunteers further along the recovery trajectory. Vocational (occupational) rehabilitation and support for caregivers is also integrated. Patients attend InS:PIRE longitudinally, initially attending for 5 weeks, with return appointments at 3 months and 12 months.

The intervention involved local community organisations, determined by local clinical teams. Specifically, financial and social care advice was available to patients, including advice on welfare benefits and housing. These sessions were delivered through a combination of individual appointments, drop-in sessions or group discussions.

During the expansion of InS:PIRE, each new site conducted focus groups involving local ICU patients and caregivers. These groups ensured that the model was feasible and responsive to local care needs. The groups also helped establish and refine the outcome measures used.

Participants are invited between 4 weeks and 12 weeks after hospital discharge. Inclusion criteria were: patients receiving level 3 care (multiple organ support and/or invasive respiratory support) or more than 7 days of level 2 care (single organ support or postoperative care). In contrast to the feasibility work from InS:PIRE, there was no upper age limit for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were any patient who was terminally ill, had suffered a traumatic brain injury or was an inpatient under psychiatric services. We provide further information and a conceptual overview in online supplemental material S1.

Intervention cohort

Five sites implemented the InS:PIRE programme as part of a quality improvement collaborative (intervention cohort) over 2 years. The intervention cohort were consecutively recruited to this study during the initial InS:PIRE programme attendance. Intervention cohort recruitment occurred between May 2016 to October 2018 (follow-up completed December 2019). Participants completed outcome measures at a preplanned 12-month follow-up. Participants were given the opportunity to complete questionnaires inperson or via telephone.

### Reported burden on informal caregivers of ICU survivors: a literature review [^ab688320]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

We searched for articles describing burden on informal caregivers of adult ICU survivors, using PubMed and CINAHL from database inception to June 2014. The search strategy is presented in Table 1. Only English and Dutch articles were included.

Table 1
Search strategy

Two authors (IvB and FBR) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of 50 randomly selected articles to ensure that the inclusion criteria were not ambiguous. For 47 (94%) of these articles the inclusion criteria were applied identically. After discussing the differences, consensus was reached. We considered the consistency between the two authors sufficient and made no alterations to the inclusion criteria. We included original studies if: the subject of the study was an informal caregiver of an adult ICU patient; the ICU patient was discharged from hospital alive; at least one of the measurements of the burden took place after hospital discharge; and the burden on the informal caregiver was a main outcome of the study. We excluded studies on deceased ICU patients, studies on the needs or satisfaction of the informal caregiver, presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and involvement in end-of-life decisions, because we hypothesized that informal caregivers of these groups would suffer different burdens.

One author (IvB) evaluated the titles and abstracts of all articles. The abstracts were either included, excluded or marked as doubtful. Another author (FBR) read the title and abstract of articles marked as doubtful and both authors discussed these articles to reach consensus on inclusion. We supplemented our searches by scanning the reference lists of previously included articles. The full text of all eligible articles was read by two authors (IvB and one of FBR, NdK, MvdS, or DAD). Both authors extracted data on the study type, characteristics of the informal caregivers, hospital and setting, type of burden and instruments used to assess the burden. If information could not be extracted from the article or online appendices, we e-mailed the corresponding author for additional information. We assessed the quality of the quantitative articles, using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for observational studies and the PEDro scale for randomized trials.

### Mental health interventions to improve psychological outcomes in informal caregivers of critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f68216f7]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Determine effect of mental health interventions on psychologic outcomes in informal caregivers of critically ill patients.

Data Sources

Searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases from inception to October 31, 2019.

Study Selection

Interventions for informal caregivers of critically ill patients in adult ICU, PICU, or neonatal ICU.

Data Extraction

Two independent, blinded reviewers screened citations and extracted data. Random-effects models with inverse variance weighting pooled outcome data when suitable. Psychologic outcomes categorized: 1) negative (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, distress, and burden) or 2) positive (courage, humanity, justice, transcendence, temperance, and wisdom and knowledge). Stratification according to intervention type and patient population was performed.

Data Synthesis

Of 11,201 studies, 102 interventional trials were included (n = 12,676 informal caregivers). Interventions targeted caregiver experience (n = 58), role (n = 6), or support (n = 38). Meta-analysis (56 randomized controlled trials; n = 22 [39%] in adult ICUs; n = 34 [61%] in neonatal ICU or PICU) demonstrated reduced anxiety (ratio of means = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87–0.97) and depression (ratio of means = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–0.99), but not post-traumatic stress disorder (ratio of means = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.80–1.04) or distress (ratio of means = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95–1.07) among informal caregivers randomized to mental health interventions compared with controls within 3 months post-ICU discharge. Increased humanity (ratio of means = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07–1.15), transcendence (ratio of means = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07–1.15), and caregiver burden (ratio of means = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05–1.12) were observed. No significant effects of mental health interventions observed after 3 months postdischarge.

Conclusions

Mental health interventions for caregivers of critically ill patients improved short-term anxiety, depression, humanity, and transcendence while increasing burden. Clinicians should consider short-term prescriptions of mental health interventions to informal caregivers of critically ill patients with capacity to manage interventions.

### Determinants of depressive symptoms at 1 Year following ICU discharge in survivors of ≥ 7 days of mechanical ventilation: results from the RECOVER program, a secondary analysis of a prospective multicenter cohort study [^ea73d59c]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Moderate to severe depressive symptoms occur in up to one-third of patients at 1 year following ICU discharge, negatively affecting patient outcomes. This study evaluated patient and caregiver factors associated with the development of these symptoms.

Methods

This study used the Rehabilitation and Recovery in Patients after Critical Illness and Their Family Caregivers (RECOVER) Program (Phase 1) cohort of 391 patients from 10 medical/surgical university-affiliated ICUs across Canada. We determined the association between patient depressive symptoms (captured by using the Beck Depression Inventory II [BDI-II]), patient characteristics (age, sex, socioeconomic status, Charlson score, and ICU length of stay [LOS]), functional independence measure (FIM) motor subscale score, and caregiver characteristics (Caregiver Assistance Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale) by using linear mixed models at time points 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results

BDI-II data were available for 246 patients. Median age at ICU admission was 56 years (interquartile range, 45–65 years), 143 (58%) were male, and median ICU LOS was 19 days (interquartile range, 13–32 days). During the 12-month follow-up, 67 of 246 (27.2%) patients had a BDI-II score ≥ 20, indicating moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Mixed models showed worse depressive symptoms in patients with lower FIM motor subscale scores (1.1 BDI-II points per 10 FIM points), lower income status (by 3.7 BDI-II points; P = 0.007), and incomplete secondary education (by 3.8 BDI-II points; P = 0.009); a curvilinear relation with age (P = 0.001) was also reported, with highest BDI-II at ages 45 to 50 years. No associations were found between patient BDI-II and comorbidities (P = 0.92), sex (P = 0.25), ICU LOS (P = 0.51), or caregiver variables (Caregiver Assistance Scale [P = 0.28] and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [P = 0.74]).

Conclusions

Increased functional dependence, lower income, and lower education are associated with increased severity of post-ICU depressive symptoms, whereas age has a curvilinear relation with symptom severity. Knowledge of risk factors may inform surveillance and targeted mental health follow-up. Early mobilization and rehabilitation aiming to improve function may serve to modify mood disorders.

### Post-intensive care unit clinics: models and implementation-a systematic review [^bd4da707]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Advances in critical care have led to a paradigm shift from merely ensuring survival to improving post-discharge functionality and long-term outcomes for patients and their families. Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) describes new or worsening problems in physical, cognitive, or mental health status that arise following a critical illness and persist beyond hospitalisation. Various strategies have been proposed to support ICU survivors, including nurse navigators, pulmonary rehabilitation, ICU diaries, peer support networks, and post-ICU clinics, also known as ICU recovery clinics.

Post-ICU clinics are crucial in assessing PICS symptoms, providing consultations with clinicians specialised in PICS, reviewing ICU courses (including ICU diaries where available), and connecting patients to appropriate support services such as psychiatry, cognitive or occupational therapy, and physical rehabilitation. The first PICS follow-up clinic, "Intensive aftercare after intensive care", was established in Reading in 1993. Approximately 30% of ICUs in the UK conduct outpatient follow-ups, with national guidelines recommending reviews two to three months post-discharge. In the U.S. the first PICS follow-up clinic was launched in 2011. Notwithstanding the equipoise within the scientific community over the impact of these services on patient outcomes, with studies reporting a reduced mortality, physical benefit, no effect on QOL, to worsening QOL the concept is gaining traction in both high and low middle income countries (HICs and LMICs)with the Dutch and Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine recently issuing a position statement.

Post-Sepsis Care and Return to Community

Post-sepsis care focuses on supporting survivors' recovery and reintegration into the community. Key interventions include screening for economic and social challenges that may hinder recovery, providing written and verbal sepsis education to empower patients and caregivers, and referring survivors to peer support groups and psychosocial resources. These measures address the physical, cognitive, and emotional consequences of sepsis, including post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), and align with the recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 guidelines. Sepsis survivors are at risk for PICS, a condition that encompasses a range of physical, cognitive, and emotional difficulties. PICS can manifest as physical limitations, such as muscle weakness and fatigue, cognitive impairments including memory and attention deficits, and emotional challenges like anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Physical limitations associated with PICS often include persistent muscle weakness, joint stiffness, and chronic pain, which can significantly impact a patient's ability to perform daily activities and reduce their overall quality of life. Rehabilitation strategies aimed to improve physical function are essential components of post-sepsis care. Early mobility may have potential benefits in sepsis recovery; however, current evidence is mixed. Post-sepsis care and follow-up are crucial for survivors and their families. Comprehensive post-sepsis care includes proper nutrition, physical rehabilitation, psychologic support, and management of sequelae such as post-sepsis syndrome (persistent physical symptoms or psychologic challenges). Clinics that focus on the post-hospital needs of patients who have been critically ill can facilitate recovery. Primary healthcare providers should be familiar with the needs of a post-ICU patient and tailor the frequency and nature of visits to the patient/family needs and available resources. Healthcare personnel and family members should monitor for complications such as recurrence of infection, organ dysfunction, or physiologic sequelae and be empowered to actively aid in recovery. Knowledgeable family members and caregivers can be important advocates for community-based education on recognizing and managing sepsis in the community. Critically ill patients who have been in the ICU may have psychologic problems such as mood changes, difficulty sleeping, altered cognition, and anxiety/depression as a part of the post-ICU syndrome. Recognition, counseling, and psychologic support are needed for patients and families or caregivers. This support helps in coping with the emotional and psychologic effects of the situation, reduces stress, and promotes overall well-being. Activities could include debriefing sessions, access to mental health resources, and ongoing support, as needed, but should be contextualized to the system, the individual, and the resources.
