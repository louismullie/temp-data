## Question

How long to quarantine from Mono

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to quarantine from infectious mononucleosis (mono). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the term "quarantine" is being used correctly versus "isolation". Then, I should verify what authoritative sources say about transmission risk and whether routine isolation is recommended. Next, I will review the incubation period to understand exposure timelines. After that, I should examine activity restrictions, especially around sports and splenic injury risk, because that is where most guidance focuses. Finally, I will synthesize practical advice and clarify when, if ever, isolation is warranted, anchoring to CDC and sports medicine guidance.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating quarantine (for exposed contacts) with isolation (for infected persons). Quarantine applies to people exposed but not yet ill, whereas isolation applies to those with confirmed infection; for mono, most guidance addresses activity restriction rather than isolation, so the question likely reflects concern about contagion and safe return to activities rather than formal quarantine per se.

> Wait, let me verify the transmission basics before jumping to timelines. Mono is caused by Epstein-Barr virus and spreads primarily via saliva through close contact; importantly, transmissibility is relatively low, and standard public health guidance does not recommend routine isolation of patients with mono, which already hints that a formal quarantine period is not standard practice for this illness [^114cfFux] [^1161iDbY] [^113MdZ4T].

> I should confirm the incubation period because that informs exposure risk windows. The incubation for symptomatic primary EBV infection is long, typically about 30–50 days, which means contacts may not manifest illness for weeks after exposure; however, this long incubation does not translate into a need for prolonged quarantine of exposed individuals in routine community settings, reinforcing that quarantine is not a standard mono control measure [^112LwugA] [^114cfFux].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about contagion duration. I initially thought patients might be infectious for weeks to months, but I should double-check that. Viral shedding can persist for some time after symptom onset, yet the practical transmissibility is low and there is no established, evidence-based quarantine duration for mono; instead, guidance emphasizes supportive care and hygiene precautions rather than isolation, which corrects my initial overestimation of required isolation time [^113MdZ4T] [^1161iDbY].

> Next, I should review activity restrictions, because most authoritative guidance centers on avoiding activities that increase splenic injury risk. Let me verify the sports medicine consensus: athletes should avoid contact or high-exertion activities for at least 3–4 weeks from symptom onset due to splenomegaly and rupture risk, with individualized decisions using shared decision-making; supervised, low-intensity, nonimpact activity can sometimes begin around 2 weeks if afebrile, asymptomatic, and clinically improving, but contact sports remain off-limits until at least 3–4 weeks and often longer depending on exam and, if needed, imaging [^111RqEZ8] [^111jv7ms] [^11733pWy] [^112s5ytk].

> I need to check the rationale for that 3–4 week window. Most splenic ruptures occur early in illness, and although risk declines over time, it is not zero; because physical examination is unreliable for detecting splenomegaly, serial ultrasound can be considered if an earlier return to contact sport is contemplated, but the default remains a minimum of 3–4 weeks from symptom onset before contact is permitted, aligning with both sports medicine and primary care guidance [^115oNMVK] [^116ciiPR] [^112s5ytk].

> But wait, what if someone is severely ill or has complications? I should confirm that management is individualized. For patients with impending airway obstruction, hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, or myocarditis, corticosteroids may be indicated, and return-to-activity decisions should be delayed until the complication is resolved; otherwise, supportive care is the mainstay, and there is no role for routine antivirals to hasten recovery or change transmission risk [^112zU6PL] [^111SFLGH] [^115stouV].

> Let me synthesize the practical answer now. There is no standard quarantine period for mono because routine isolation is not recommended; instead, patients should use common-sense hygiene to reduce saliva transmission and avoid sharing drinks or utensils while symptomatic, and they should refrain from contact or high-exertion activities for at least 3–4 weeks from symptom onset, with low-intensity, noncontact activity considered around 2 weeks only if afebrile, asymptomatic, and improving, using shared decision-making and clinical judgment [^113MdZ4T] [^111RqEZ8] [^111jv7ms].

> I should double-check that I have addressed the likely underlying concern. The user's question about "how long to quarantine" most closely maps to "how long to restrict activities that risk splenic injury and limit close-contact transmission", and the evidence-based answer is at least 3–4 weeks off contact sports and high-exertion activities, with hygiene precautions while symptomatic, rather than a formal quarantine or isolation period for mono [^111RqEZ8] [^113MdZ4T].

Patients with infectious mononucleosis **do not require quarantine** because transmission risk is low and most people are already EBV-seropositive [^1161iDbY] [^114cfFux]. Instead, use **standard precautions** (hand hygiene, avoid sharing drinks/utensils, and minimize close contact) while symptomatic [^113MdZ4T]. Athletes should avoid contact sports for at least 3–4 weeks from symptom onset due to splenic rupture risk, and return to activity only when afebrile, asymptomatic, and clinically cleared [^111RqEZ8] [^112s5ytk]. No routine isolation is recommended, but **individualize restrictions** based on symptoms and clinical judgment [^1161iDbY].

---

## Infectiousness and transmission

- **Transmission**: Primarily via saliva (kissing, shared drinks/utensils, coughing/sneezing) [^113MdZ4T].
- **Incubation**: 30–50 days, so patients are often contagious before diagnosis [^112LwugA].
- **Duration**: Shedding can persist for weeks to months; risk declines as symptoms resolve [^notfound].
- **Risk**: Low overall; most adults are EBV-seropositive, limiting spread [^1161iDbY] [^114cfFux].

---

## Clinical guidelines on isolation and quarantine

- **Isolation**: Not routinely recommended due to low transmission risk and high seroprevalence [^1161iDbY] [^114cfFux].
- **Precautions**: Hand hygiene, avoid sharing drinks/utensils, and minimize close contact while symptomatic [^113MdZ4T].
- **Athletes**: Avoid contact sports for at least 3–4 weeks from symptom onset due to splenic rupture risk [^111RqEZ8] [^112s5ytk].

---

## Duration of restrictions

| **Activity** | **Recommended duration of restriction** |
|-|-|
| General social activities | Until afebrile and symptomatic improvement (typically 2–4 weeks) [^113MdZ4T] |
| Contact sports | At least 3–4 weeks from symptom onset [^111RqEZ8] [^112s5ytk] |
| School/work attendance | Return when afebrile, able to participate, and clinically cleared |

---

## Factors influencing duration of restrictions

- **Symptom severity**: More severe symptoms may warrant longer restrictions [^11733pWy].
- **Complications**: Splenomegaly or organ involvement prolongs restrictions [^111RqEZ8].
- **Individual factors**: Age, fitness, and clinical judgment guide return-to-activity timing [^113fyY5n].

---

## Psychological and social impacts

Fatigue and prolonged symptoms can cause **social isolation and emotional distress** [^notfound]. Extended restrictions may also disrupt academic performance and social interactions. Supportive counseling and gradual return to activities can mitigate these effects [^111RqEZ8].

---

## Current public health recommendations

Public health authorities **do not recommend quarantine** for mono; use standard precautions while symptomatic [^113MdZ4T]. Athletes should avoid contact sports for at least 3–4 weeks and return only when cleared clinically [^111RqEZ8]. Decisions should be individualized based on symptoms, complications, and clinical judgment [^111RqEZ8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Quarantine**: Not recommended; use standard precautions while symptomatic [^1161iDbY].
- **Contact sports**: Avoid for at least 3–4 weeks from symptom onset [^111RqEZ8].
- **Return**: Afebrile, asymptomatic, and clinically cleared [^115t3Mgg].
- **Individualize**: Base on symptoms, complications, and clinical judgment [^11733pWy].

Patients with infectious mononucleosis **do not require quarantine**; use standard precautions and restrict contact sports for at least 3–4 weeks, returning to activities only when clinically cleared.

### Predicting quarantine failure rates [^117MUqs9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Preemptive quarantine (isolating asymptomatic persons who have had contact with an infected person) is an effective technique for slowing the spread of emerging infectious diseases, but it also results in many uninfected persons being isolated (for examples, see). Health officials must determine an acceptable quarantine duration that balances the social and financial costs of holding potentially uninfected persons for long durations with the risk of releasing an infected person into the general public before he or she displays symptoms, if a shorter duration is used (the quarantine failure rate). One primary consideration in setting the quarantine duration is the range of observed incubation times. Often the quarantine duration is set to be (approximately) equal to the longest observed incubation period in a sample of n infections. The quarantine failure rate is then monitored through the collection of data on incubation periods throughout the outbreak.

This approach requires considerable effort, and it must be carried out for each new disease. This assessment of quarantine failure rates is also necessarily retrospective, with the data required for analysis becoming available only after the fact. Here a much simpler approach is derived that requires no data specific to the disease in question. It applies for all possible infectious diseases, and therefore can be employed proactively rather than retrospectively.

If the quarantine duration is chosen to be the longest incubation period in a sample of n infections, then the probability, that the quarantine failure rate is no larger thanis

(equation 1)

for all possible infectious diseases (Appendix). For example, the probability that the quarantine failure rate is no larger than 1% is simply. This is valid irrespective of any of the biologic details of the disease of interest. In particular, the form of the underlying probability distribution of incubation times for the disease at hand has no influence on this result.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for infectious mononucleosis, more specifically with respect to return to sport, AMSSM 2023 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding the role of exercise on the natural history of IM. Recognize that premature (earlier than 2–3 weeks from symptom onset) return to activities requiring heavy exertion may prolong the duration of symptoms, most notably fatigue, and may be associated with overtraining and/or a decrease in performance. Consider advising an early return to low-level exercise. Use a shared decision-making model for return to sport decisions given these uncertainties.

### The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence [^1131yy8U]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

The December, 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak has seen many countries ask people who have potentially come into contact with the infection to isolate themselves at home or in a dedicated quarantine facility. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence. We did a Review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. Of 3166 papers found, 24 are included in this Review. Most reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.

### Predicting quarantine failure rates [^113ZChF1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Often it is of more interest to estimate the quarantine failure rate at a prescribed level of certainty. By rearranging equation 1, we have: withcertainty, the quarantine failure rate, is no larger than, where. (equation 2)

For example, the 95% confidence boundary for the failure rate is simply. Moreover, a point estimate for the failure rate is obtained by calculating the expectation of: (equation 3)

Indeed, more generally the probability density of quarantine failure rate, is simplyfor any infectious disease (Appendix).

The above results also allow one to evaluate the protocol of using the largest incubation period of n infected hosts as the quarantine duration. For example, if n = 35 (a reasonable value for a newly emerging disease) then the point estimate foris (equation 3) 1/36 (2.8%), and we have 95% confidence thatis no larger than 8.2% (equation 2). Thus, a failure rate of 8 in 100 infected persons inadvertently being released from quarantine is within the 95% confidence region. This failure rate is likely unacceptable for highly transmissible diseases.

Alternatively, the above results can be used to determine the sample size, n, on which the quarantine duration must be based to ensure that the quarantine failure rate is less thanwithcertainty. Rearranging equation 1 yields. (equation 4)

This is plotted in the Figure, indicating that enormous sample sizes are required to ensure that the quarantine failure rate is < 1%. Together, the above results therefore call for two amendments to preemptive quarantine protocols. First, update the quarantine duration as further infections are observed during an outbreak. This amendment keeps n as large as possible. Secondly, set the quarantine duration to be longer than the maximum observed incubation period during the initial stages of the epidemic, when the sample size, n, is necessarily small.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^112LwugA]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Natural history and clinical manifestations of infectious mononucleosis — Humans are the only source of this infection, and transmission occurs primarily through oral secretions. The incubation period is long (30–50 days). Many have a prodrome of malaise and headache, and fever (rarely > 104°F, > 40°C) can last up to 3 weeks. Typical findings include pharyngitis in ~80%, splenomegaly in 50%-100%, palatal petechiae in ~25%, and a rash on the trunk and upper arms in ~10%-40%. Exudative pharyngitis and tonsillar enlargement can cause airway compromise, while jaundice, central nervous system complications, and myocarditis are rare. Rash is significantly more common if the patient has been treated with ampicillin or amoxicillin, symptoms usually resolve in 4–8 weeks, and occasionally patients present with periorbital edema.

### Antiviral agents for infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) [^115stouV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a clinical syndrome, usually caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EPV), characterised by lymphadenopathy, fever and sore throat. Most cases of symptomatic IM occur in older teenagers or young adults. Usually IM is a benign self-limiting illness and requires only symptomatic treatment. However, occasionally the disease course can be complicated or prolonged and lead to decreased productivity in terms of school or work. Antiviral medications have been used to treat IM, but the use of antivirals for IM is controversial. They may be effective by preventing viral replication which helps to keep the virus inactive. However, there are no guidelines for antivirals in IM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral therapy for infectious mononucleosis (IM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, March 2016), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to 15 April 2016), Embase (1974 to 15 April 2016), CINAHL (1981 to 15 April 2016), LILACS (1982 to 15 April 2016) and Web of Science (1955 to 15 April 2016). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antivirals versus placebo or no treatment in IM. We included trials of immunocompetent participants of any age or sex with clinical and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of IM, who had symptoms for up to 14 days. Our primary outcomes were time to clinical recovery and adverse events and side effects of medication. Secondary outcomes included duration of abnormal clinical examination, complications, viral shedding, health-related quality of life, days missing from school or work and economic outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the included studies' risk of bias and extracted data using a customised data extraction sheet. We used the GRADE criteria to rate the quality of the evidence. We pooled heterogeneous data where possible, and presented the results narratively where we could not statistically combine data.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 333 participants in our review. Three trials studied hospitalised patients, two trials were conducted in an outpatient setting, while the trial setting was unclear in two studies. Participants' ages ranged from two years to young adults. The type of antiviral, administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials. The antivirals in the included studies were acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir. Follow-up varied from 20 days to six months. The diagnosis of IM was based on clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters. The risk of bias for all included studies was either unclear or high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for all outcomes and so the results should be interpreted with caution. There were statistically significant improvements in the treatment group for two of the 12 outcomes. These improvements may be of limited clinical significance. There was a mean reduction in 'time to clinical recovery as assessed by physician' of five days in the treatment group but with wide confidence intervals (CIs) (95% CI -8.04 to -1.08; two studies, 87 participants). Prospective studies indicate that clinical signs and symptoms may take one month or more to resolve and that fatigue may be persistent in approximately 10% of patients at six-month follow-up, so this may not be a clinically meaningful result. Trial results for the outcome 'adverse events and side effects of medication' were reported narratively in only five studies. In some reports authors were unsure whether an adverse event was related to medication or complication of disease. These results could not be pooled due to the potential for double counting results but overall, the majority of trials reporting this outcome did not find any significant difference between treatment and control groups. There was a mean reduction in 'duration of lymphadenopathy' of nine days (95% CI -11.75 to -6.14, two studies, 61 participants) in favour of the treatment group. In terms of viral shedding, the overall effect from six studies was that viral shedding was suppressed while on antiviral treatment, but this effect was not sustained when treatment stopped. For all other outcomes there was no statistically significant difference between antiviral treatment and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The effectiveness of antiviral agents (acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir) in acute IM is uncertain. The quality of the evidence is very low. The majority of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias and so questions remain about the effectiveness of this intervention. Although two of the 12 outcomes have results that favour treatment over control, the quality of the evidence of these results is very low and may not be clinically meaningful. Alongside the lack of evidence of effectiveness, decision makers need to consider the potential adverse events and possible associated costs, and antiviral resistance. Further research in this area is warranted.

### Infectious mononucleosis: rapid evidence review [^114x2qXT]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age. Primary transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly their saliva. Cost-effective, efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91% but can have a false-negative result in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a negative heterophile antibody test result. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Current guidelines recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis not participate in athletic activity for three weeks from onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the timing of return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been linked to nine types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^111npVpZ]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) noncontact activity and shared decision-making — early activity parameters: Previous guidance emphasized refraining from high-intensity activity for the first 3 weeks of illness and absence of splenomegaly, while acknowledging there are no well-designed large clinical trials (SOR Recommendation grade: C). Premature return earlier than 2 to 3 weeks to heavy exertion may prolong symptoms, yet there is support for considering low-level, supervised activity earlier than 3 weeks within an individualized plan. Resumption of light activity assumes avoidance of contact or abdominal trauma, no significant exertion or Valsalva, the athlete is asymptomatic, and progression of noncontact sport-specific activity should then be gradually increased as judged by clinical progress.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for infectious mononucleosis, more specifically with respect to return to sport, AMSSM 2023 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding the time for a safe return to contact play. Consider using a time frame of at least 3–4 weeks from the onset of symptoms, given the risk for splenic rupture. Use shared decision-making for individualized return to sport decisions. Consider obtaining serial ultrasound imaging to confirm that the spleen size is decreasing or stable in size in situations where an athlete with acute IM is considering an early return to activity (before 3–4 weeks from symptom onset for contact sport).

Entry into quarantine when the time of exposure is unknown

For settings where there is no administrative knowledge of the time of exposure such as travel quarantine, we computed the expected PQT (Supplementary Fig. 2) and the probability of PQT after a range of quarantine durations without testing (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 3A). Assuming individuals self-isolate immediately upon symptom onset, the probability of PQT declines as the duration of quarantine increases (Fig. 1A). This probability is less than 0.25 with a quarantine duration of at least 3 days and falls below 0.05 for quarantines of eight days or longer.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis (IM) management — "Standard treatment of EBV infections include supportive measures", and because transmissibility "is low, so patient isolation is not necessary". "Aspirin should be avoided in adolescents", and individuals with IM "should be advised to avoid excessive alcohol and acetaminophen". Antiviral benefit is unproven: "A meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials of acyclovir… failed to show a clinical benefit compared to placebo". Corticosteroids "may be clinically indicated" for severe complications, but a Cochrane Review found benefits only "for the first 12 hours", which were "lost at 2–4 days", concluding steroids "should be avoided"; furthermore, due to oncogenic concerns, steroids "should not be used in patients who have uncomplicated IM". For bacterial coinfection, "Antibiotics should be used if there is a concomitant streptococcal pharyngitis", but "ampicillin or amoxicillin should be avoided".

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^116DJujH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused an unprecedented global public health crisis. Isolating infected individuals and identifying and quarantining their close contacts remain key strategies used to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Quarantine is used to separate individuals who might have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to minimize their risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to other people. Most of the world remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and quarantine is still being used even in countries with relatively high vaccination rates.

Quarantine length is a balance: a short quarantine brings increased risk of transmission from individuals who are infectious after release, while a long one may increase transmission risk by reducing compliance, stretching public health systems, and imposing additional economic and psychological hardship. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially recommended a 14-day quarantine period based on estimates of the upper bound of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. While the CDC still recommends 14-day quarantine as the preferred option, in November 2020, to account for the costs of long quarantine, the organization identified 2 shorter quarantine options as acceptable alternatives for asymptomatic individuals based on local circumstances and resources. The first was a 10-day quarantine period without testing. The second was a 7-day quarantine if results of a test done on day 5, 6, or 7 were negative. Similarly, France instituted a 7-day quarantine and Belgium, Germany, and Spain adopted a 10-day period; and, on the longer end, Chinese cities Beijing and Dalian adopted a 21-day quarantine period.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^114N4RPm]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The impact of quarantine can be augmented through testing. We assumed a 24-h delay between the sample collection and test results so that testing on exit occurred 1 day before the end of quarantine. Individuals who tested positive or developed symptoms were isolated until recovery. We found that any testing during quarantine contributed to a reduction in the probability of PQT across the full range of quarantine duration (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 3A). The magnitude of this reduction was dependent on both the duration of quarantine and the timing of the testing.

The largest reduction in the probability of PQT from conducting a single test occurred when it was performed on exit for quarantines of 7 days or less; on day five for quarantines lasting between eight and 13 days; and on day six for quarantines that are 14 days or longer (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. 4A). As quarantined (asymptomatic) cases proceed through their quarantine, they simultaneously progress through their infectious course. Symptom onset will send a substantial fraction of infected individuals to isolation and diagnostic sensitivity decreases for the remainder, leading to slightly diminishing benefits of "exit" tests performed later than day six.

Comparing the three testing strategies, we found that testing on both entry and exit from quarantine provides the greatest reduction in PQT, whereas the benefit of testing at entry is minimal (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 3A). Testing on exit consistently and substantially outperformed testing on entry across all quarantine durations considered (Fig. 1A).

We specifically compared strategies of quarantine and testing against the widely implemented WHO recommendation to quarantine for 14 days (without testing). In this comparison, a 13-day quarantine with testing on entry, a 7-day quarantine with testing on exit, and a 7-day quarantine with testing on both entry and exit each provide equivalent or lower probabilities of PQT (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 3).

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — additional considerations emphasize cost, exposure-risk assessment, and uncertain timing, noting that "There are costs related to testing asymptomatic exposed individuals; since quarantine may still be indicated regardless of test results, such testing may add cost without changing practice", that "Data are limited to define definitions of close contact or high-risk exposure", and that assessing a known contact "may include the duration of exposure and certain clinical symptoms (e.g., cough) of the index case"; it adds that "Risk stratification of a given exposure can be made in consultation with public health authorities", while "The ideal time to test an asymptomatic contact of a known or suspected COVID-19 case is unknown" and household exposure can complicate "when to test or possible repeat testing".

Fig. 3
The impact of testing on the post-quarantine transmission for traced contacts.

The probability of post-quarantine transmission for no testing and three testing strategies applied to 1–14-day durations of quarantine, when an individual enters quarantine through contact tracing, specifying an incubation period of 8.29 days, 30.8% asymptomatic infections, and perfect self-isolation of symptomatic infections. A Curves for the probability of post-quarantine transmission (one or more post-quarantine infections) without testing (red), with testing upon entry to quarantine (orange), on exit from quarantine (blue), and on both entry to and exit from quarantine (purple), incorporating with all testing strategies a 1-day delay in sample collection to results, such that testing on exit occurred the day before the end of quarantine. B The optimal day to test during quarantine for a specified quarantine duration, with a 1-day delay (black) and with a negligible delay (gray) in obtaining test results.

However, the combination of shorter quarantines with exit testing maintains high effectiveness compared with 14-day quarantines without testing. When cases are identified through contact tracing, we found that a 7-day quarantine with testing on exit and a 6-day quarantine with testing on entry and exit each result in a probability of PQT equivalent or lower than a 14-day quarantine with no testing; testing on entry bestowed only trivial benefit (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. 8). For quarantines of 7 days or less, the optimal test timing was upon exit. For quarantines beyond 7 days, the optimal timing was day six (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. 4B).

### Modeling control strategies of respiratory pathogens [^114GFNt8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Figure 4
Comparing the effect of isolation and quarantine. Isolation alone reduces the infectious period by a specified percentage. Quarantine involves both isolation and sequestering a fraction of all case contacts. See the Figure 3 caption for further details.

Figure 5
Comparing general vaccination and ring vaccination strategies. General vaccination protects a percentage of persons chosen randomly from the population with an efficacy determined by the vaccine itself. Ring vaccination involves isolating the patient (and the associated reduction in the infectious period) followed by targeted vaccination of contacts. The degree to which contacts are successfully protected depends on the success of contact tracing and the efficacy of the vaccine. See the Figure 3 caption for further details.

Transmission Reduction

Although general use of face masks may have a moderate effect, its success hinges on correct use and level of compliance. For instance, face masks that are 75% effective will only prevent a large-scale epidemic of a SARS-like disease if ≥ 60% of the general population complies perfectly (Figure 3). If persons use face masks incorrectly or only partially, this intervention will be less likely to protect persons and the population as a whole. For moderately contagious diseases like smallpox, face masks alone will not protect large urban areas from an epidemic. Figure 3 also suggests that use of face masks by healthcare workers, while important for personal protection, offers limited protection to the population and does not predictably preclude an epidemic.

One of the factors that influences the transmissibility T is the duration of infectiousness. The duration of effective infectiousness may be shortened, but not eliminated, by isolating persons immediately after diagnosis. Although isolating an infected person will physically remove him from the network, the person may already have had a chance to infect others before being identified and isolated. For example, an infectious person who is isolated after the second day of a 6-day infectious period will have had 2 days in which disease could be transmitted to close contacts. Thus, isolation can be effective for diseases with low transmissibility but only if case identification occurs early in the infectious period. For such diseases, an isolation strategy that on average reduces the infectious period by 50% will prevent a large-scale epidemic (Figure 4). Isolation will not preclude an epidemic for a highly transmissible disease unless clinical and diagnostic tools can be applied early and confidently, which may not be the case for an emerging infectious disease.

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^116J9eNS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Stricter quarantine was associated with shorter conversion times. In strict quarantine, 6 (7.1%; 95% CI, 3.0%-15.0%), 2 (2.9%; 95% CI, 0.2%-8.7%), and 0 (0%; 95% CI, 0%-5.3%) individuals who converted did so after days 7, 10, and 14, respectively, compared with 34 (16.0%; 95% CI, 12.0%-21.0%), 12 (5.8%; 95% CI, 3.2%-9.6%), and 4 (2.0%; 95% CI, 0.6%-4.9%) in nonstrict quarantine. In 5 of the post–day 10 individuals in nonstrict quarantine who converted, additional questioning by contact tracers revealed that, in all 5 cases, the individual was reexposed to a person with COVID-19 during their quarantine. This suggests that a higher rate of repeated exposures during quarantine may explain the longer conversion times seen in nonstrict quarantine; thus, strict quarantine data are more likely to provide accurate estimates of conversion times in quarantine.

Of 1319 exposed individuals in strict quarantine, 132 (10%) converted; of 2322 exposed individuals in nonstrict quarantine, 286 (12%) converted. Thus, stricter quarantine was associated with a lower chance of getting a positive test result (10% vs 12%; p = 0.04 in 2-sided proportion test) suggesting that nonstrict quarantine could contain individuals who were reexposed during quarantine. This result, along with shorter conversion times in stricter quarantine, suggests that stricter quarantine is associated with reduced transmission.

### Common questions about infectious mononucleosis [^114sMgCX]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr is a ubiquitous virus that infects 95% of the world population at some point in life. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections are often asymptomatic, some patients present with the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis (IM). The syndrome most commonly occurs between 15 and 24 years of age. It should be suspected in patients presenting with sore throat, fever, tonsillar enlargement, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal inflammation, and palatal petechiae. A heterophile antibody test is the best initial test for diagnosis of EBV infection, with 71% to 90% accuracy for diagnosing IM. However, the test has a 25% false-negative rate in the first week of illness. IM is unlikely if the lymphocyte count is less than 4,000 mm3. The presence of EBV-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies confirms infection, but the test is more costly and results take longer than the heterophile antibody test. Symptomatic relief is the mainstay of treatment. Glucocorticoids and antivirals do not reduce the length or severity of illness. Splenic rupture is an uncommon complication of IM. Because physical activity within the first three weeks of illness may increase the risk of splenic rupture, athletic participation is not recommended during this time. Children are at the highest risk of airway obstruction, which is the most common cause of hospitalization from IM. Patients with immunosuppression are more likely to have fulminant EBV infection.

### Association of infectious mononucleosis in childhood and adolescence with risk for a subsequent multiple sclerosis diagnosis among siblings [^112RAoQv]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM) in childhood or adolescence associated with subsequent development of multiple sclerosis (MS)?

Findings

In this population–based cohort study of 2 492 980 individuals in Sweden, IM in childhood and adolescence was associated with an increased risk of a subsequent MS diagnosis that remained significant after controlling for measured and unmeasured shared familial factors.

Meaning

These findings suggest that IM in childhood and particularly adolescence is a risk factor for a subsequent MS diagnosis, independent of shared familial factors, making it less likely that greater susceptibility to infection is the explanation.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^115zTz3n]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Here, we derived theory to calculate the probability of PQT of COVID-19 for a wide range of durations of quarantine, supplemented by testing on entry to quarantine, on exit from quarantine, or both. For quarantines with durations of up to 7 days, we found that testing on exit provided the greatest marginal benefit in terms of reducing the probability of PQT. Testing on entry provided modest benefits in combination with quarantine or with testing on exit. For a quarantine with a duration longer than 7 days, the optimal testing time is on day five or six. Optimal testing times were fairly consistent between travel quarantines and quarantines of traced contacts, differing at most by a day. The benefits of testing later in quarantine were demonstrated by test results of oil crewmembers heading offshore that identified 16 cases testing negative on entry and positive on exit that could easily have resulted in costly and logistically difficult-to-handle offshore outbreaks. When the time of exposure is known, the optimal day for a test for quarantines of a week or more starts at day six of the quarantine, decreasing linearly to day-of-entry for individuals who have been infected for seven or more days. It may seem counter-intuitive that the optimal test for so many identified timings of exposure is on entry, yet testing on entry has so much less impact than testing on exit when the date of exposure is unknown. Indeed, for individuals that are tested after the incubation period (e.g. later than symptom onset), the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-PCR test has started to decline. However, for individuals late in the disease, there is also far less infectivity left in their disease course. The high remaining infectivity of individuals early in the disease course markedly outweighs the low infectivity of individuals late in the disease course in influencing the optimal day of testing to prevent PQT.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^116CVrXZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support the WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.

Objectives

To assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high disease transmission.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and updated the search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 23 June 2020.

Selection Criteria

Cohort studies, case-control studies, time series, interrupted time series, case series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles in duplicate. Two review authors then independently screened all potentially relevant full-text publications. One review author extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We used three different tools to assess risk of bias, depending on the study design: ROBINS-I for non-randomised studies of interventions, a tool provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-randomised, non-controlled studies, and recommendations from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) for modelling studies. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and costs.

Main Results

We included 51 studies; 4 observational studies and 28 modelling studies on COVID-19, one observational and one modelling study on MERS, three observational and 11 modelling studies on SARS, and three modelling studies on SARS and other infectious diseases. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and undertook a narrative synthesis. We judged risk of bias to be moderate for 2/3 non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) and serious for 1/3 NRSI. We rated risk of bias moderate for 4/5 non-controlled cohort studies, and serious for 1/5. We rated modelling studies as having no concerns for 13 studies, moderate concerns for 17 studies and major concerns for 13 studies. Quarantine for individuals who were in contact with a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 case in comparison to no quarantine Modelling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases may have averted 44% to 96% of incident cases and 31% to 76% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 6 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS, low-certainty evidence). Studies also indicated that there may be a reduction in the basic reproduction number ranging from 37% to 88% due to the implementation of quarantine (5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings may be (2 modelling studies on SARS). Quarantine in combination with other measures to contain COVID-19 in comparison to other measures without quarantine or no measures When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated that there may be a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than measures without quarantine or no interventions (incident cases: 9 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. Quarantine for individuals travelling from a country with a declared COVID-19 outbreak compared to no quarantine Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths may be small for SARS, but might be larger for COVID-19 (2 observational studies on COVID-19 and 2 observational studies on SARS).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence is limited because most studies on COVID-19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is uncertainty over the magnitude of the effect. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak and the impact of the measures implemented. This review was originally commissioned by the WHO and supported by Danube-University-Krems. The update was self-initiated by the review authors.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^112R1QSp]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Some jurisdictions have suggested and implemented testing upon exit from a 14-day quarantine. For example, Australia has implemented a compulsory 14-day quarantine, with testing within 48 h after arrival and between days 10 and 12 of quarantine, to reduce transmission from imported cases. Although these multiple tests aid in case identification, this strategy does not include any reduction of the burden of long quarantine. Understanding the complementarity of quarantine and testing in reducing PQT would provide vital insight into effective strategies that mitigate disease spread in travel-based and contact-tracing based contexts. We applied a mathematical modeling approach to evaluate whether a less burdensome quarantine and testing strategy exist that would be epidemiologically equivalent to the standard 14-day quarantine protocol in reducing PQT. This model accounts for the infectivity profile of an infected individual as well as the temporal diagnostic sensitivity of RT-PCR testing. Across a variety of quarantine and testing scenarios, we estimated the probability of PQT for an infected individual who has not manifested symptoms by the end of the quarantine period. We considered three applications: (i) quarantine for travel, initiated at random times across the infectious course, (ii) quarantine prompted by contact-tracing and therefore initiated early in the infectious course, and (iii) quarantine when the time of exposure is known. We compared the probability of PQT under three testing scenarios: (i) on entry to quarantine only, (ii) on exit from quarantine only, and (iii) on both entry to and exit from quarantine for an infected individual. Across these scenarios, we varied the duration of quarantine and identified the optimal testing date based on that duration. As validation of our recommendations, we analyzed the real-world application of our model-based findings to protocols within the oil and gas industry that prevented offshore transmission.

### Return to work following sickness absence due to infectious mononucleosis [^114zfzBg]. Occupational Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis among adults is notorious because of the prolonged incapacitating fatigue it causes.

Aims

To investigate the duration of sickness absence and return to work following infectious mononucleosis.

Methods

Episodes of sickness absence due to infectious mononucleosis were selected from an occupational health services register. The duration of sickness absence and return to work was assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

Two thousand one hundred and thirty-seven episodes of absence due to infectious mononucleosis had a median duration of 91 days. Young employees (aged 15–24 years) had the highest return to work rates. Women had longer sickness absence than men. Employees working in small companies were absent longer than employees in large companies.

Conclusions

Occupational physicians should advise gradual return to work, starting 4 weeks after the onset of the illness, in order to prevent physical deconditioning and prolonged illness.

### Time kinetics of viral clearance and resolution of symptoms in novel coronavirus infection [^114gNhBj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The time kinetics of symptom onset, duration of symptoms, and viral clearance is described in Table 1. The viral detection test was performed upon clinical presentation and repeated every other day until the patient had a negative test result. The negative test result was confirmed again the next day. Upon confirmation of the negative test result, the patient was asked to quarantine at home for the next 2 weeks, with a follow-up visit to the hospital after 1 week to confirm virus-negative status. The incubation periods were estimated on the basis of the history of the patient's travel or potential exposure. Our data show an incubation period of 5 days (interquartile range, 1–6 d) among the patients (except for patient 12, who had no specific exposure). The mean duration of symptoms was estimated to be 8 days (interquartile range, 6.25–11.5). Most important, half (8 of 16) of the patients remained virus positive (a surrogate marker of shedding) even after the resolution of symptoms (median, 2.5 d; range, 1–8 d). Some of our patients had other comorbidities, which included diabetes (2 of 16) and tuberculosis (1 of 16), both of which did not affect the time course of the disease. Similarly, the clinical course for the 3-year-old boy did not significantly differ from that of the rest of the patients.

### Safely returning America to work: part I: general guidance for employers [^111mCCeT]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

COVID-19 return-to-work and exposure management — essential service workers and close contacts: Viral shedding may begin as early as 2 to 3 days before symptom onset. For essential service workers, CDC recommends return to work 10 or more days after onset of symptoms, with the absence of fever for 72 hours after being off any fever-reducing medications, and it is recommended that interviews with workers be repeated every 2 days by OEM professionals. For exposed workers with possible false-negative tests (test sensitivity of only 70% to 75%), those exposed to a positive or presumed case should have the choice of quarantine for 14 days or work with a mask for 14 days with temperature checks twice daily and discontinuation of work if any symptoms develop. In health care settings after COVID-19 illness, modifications required face mask for source control at all times and avoidance of immunosuppressed patients until 14 days after illness onset.

Acute HIV infection — definition and clinical features — Acute HIV infection occurs soon after transmission and is typically characterized by the lack of anti-HIV antibodies and the presence of viremia, which can be detected by an HIV RNA test or p24 antigen test. Recent HIV infection is considered the period of ≤ 6 months after infection during which anti-HIV antibodies become detectable. People with acute HIV infection may experience fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and other symptoms; however, illness is generally nonspecific, and people can be asymptomatic or experience relatively mild symptoms. Clinicians may fail to recognize acute HIV infection because its manifestations are similar to those of many other viral infections, such as COVID-19, influenza, and infectious mononucleosis.

### Ampicillin sodium and sulbactam sodium [^115puqLB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General: A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Thus, ampicillin class antibacterial should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with ampicillin and sulbactam the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted.

Prescribing ampicillin and sulbactam in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Information for Patients: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin and sulbactam should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin and sulbactam is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin and sulbactam or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis [^115uuHtF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever or the kissing disease, is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. It is a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous herpes virus that is found in all human societies and cultures. Epidemiological studies show that over 95% of adults worldwide have been infected with EBV. Most cases of symptomatic infectious mononucleosis occur between the ages of 15 and 24 years. It is transmitted through close contact with an EBV shedder, contact with infected saliva or, less commonly, through sexual contact, blood transfusions or by sharing utensils; however, transmission actually occurs less than 10% of the time. Precautions are not needed to prevent transmission because of the high percentage of seropositivity for EBV. Infectious mononucleosis is self-limiting and typically lasts for two to three weeks. Nevertheless, symptoms can last for weeks and occasionally months. Symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly and fatigue. Symptom relief and rest are commonly recommended treatments. Steroids have been used for their anti-inflammatory effects, but there are no universal criteria for their use.

Objectives

The objectives of the review were to determine the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy versus placebo, usual care or different drug therapies for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis.

Search Methods

For this 2015 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2015) and EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2015). We also searched trials registries, however we did not identify any new relevant completed or ongoing trials for inclusion. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We adapted the search terms when searching EMBASE.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing the effectiveness of steroids with placebo, usual care, or other interventions for symptom control for people with documented infectious mononucleosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

For this 2015 update, we did not identify any new RCTs for inclusion. The previous version of the review included seven trials with a total of 362 participants. Four trials compared the effectiveness of a steroid to placebo for short-term symptom control in glandular fever, one to aspirin, and two trials explored the effects of steroids in conjunction with an antiviral. Heterogeneity between trials prevented a combined analysis. Trials under-reported methodological design features. Three trials did not adequately describe sequence generation for randomisation. Four trials provided adequate details of allocation concealment. All trials were double-blind but four were not specific as to who was blinded. Loss to follow-up was under-reported in four trials, making it difficult to exclude attrition bias. The risk of selective reporting in the included trials was unclear. Across the trials, no benefit was found in 8/10 assessments of health improvement. Two trials found benefit of steroid therapy over placebo in reducing sore throat at 12 hours (eight-day course odds ratio (OR) 21.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94 to 227.20; one-dose OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 16.32), but the benefit was not maintained. In combination with an antiviral drug, participants in the steroid group had less pharyngeal discomfort between days two to four (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.08) compared to placebo. Across the trials the effects on other common symptoms were less clear. Two trials set out to measure safety; they documented no major adverse effects. In two other trials adverse events were reported, including respiratory distress and acute onset of diabetes. However, the association of the events with the steroid is not definite.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to the efficacy of steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis. There is a lack of research on the side effects and long-term complications.

Intermittent quarantines — IQ

In this strategysociety as a whole enters a periodic cycle of active vs. quarantined phases, namely the entire population transitions in unison between staying at home and going to work (Fig. 4 a–f, turquoise). Originally proposed in the format of a 4:10 periodicity, i.e. 4 days of activity separated by 10 days of quarantine, here we examine its performance under a 7:7 cycle, to be congruent with our implementation of AQ. We find that IQ is significantly less effective than AQ, leading not only to higher peak infection but also to a substantially longer time to return to normalcy.

Demographics and Description of Quarantined Persons

The survey was completed by 129 of more than 15,000 eligible persons who were placed in quarantine (Figure). All respondents completed the survey at the end of quarantine with a minimum time from the end of quarantine to the completion of the survey of 2 days. The median time from the end of quarantine to completion of the survey was 36.0 days (interquartile range, 10–66 days). Sixty-eight percent of respondents were healthcare workers, 64% were 26–45 years of age, 58% were married, 72% had a college level of education or higher, and 48% had a combined household income of > $75,000 (Canadian dollars [CAD]).

Figure

The 129 respondents described 143 periods of quarantine with 90% of respondents being placed into quarantine only once; 66% of respondents were on home quarantine, while 34% were on work quarantine. The median duration of quarantine was 10 days (interquartile range 8–10 days). Half of respondents knew someone who was hospitalized with SARS of whom 77% were colleagues; 10% knew someone who had died of SARS (Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of quarantined persons who responded to the survey

Persons were notified of their need to go into quarantine from the following sources: their workplace (58%), the media (27%), their healthcare provider (7%), and public health officials (9%). Most (68%) understood that they were quarantined to prevent them from transmitting infection to others; 8.5% of respondents believed they were quarantined to protect themselves from infection; 15% did not believe they should have been placed into quarantine at all; and 8.5% provided more than one of these responses.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) diagnosis — History alone can raise concern for IM, and clinicians are recommended to maintain a level of suspicion based on overall presentation; a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that signs and symptoms lack sensitivity, although splenomegaly, palatal petechiae, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy increased the likelihood; hematologic findings were more accurate and serologic testing is indicated; typical illness may include fever that can rarely exceed > 40°C or > 104°F and last up to 3 weeks; in a systematic review, lack of sore throat (sensitivity 0.81; Likelihood Ratio range 0.51–0.62) or lack of headache (sensitivity 0.66; LR range 0.63–0.73) reduced the likelihood of IM.

Travel guidance

The peak travel season to Saudi Arabia is July through November, coinciding with the religious pilgrimages of Hajj and Umrah. CDC encourages pilgrims to consider recommendations from the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health regarding persons who should postpone their pilgrimages this year, including persons aged ≥ 65 years, children, pregnant women, and persons with chronic diseases, weakened immune systems, or cancer. WHO advises that persons with preexisting medical conditions consult a health-care provider before deciding whether to make a pilgrimage.

CDC continues to recommend that U.S. travelers to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including MERS-CoV, by washing their hands often and avoiding contact with persons who are ill. If travelers to the region have onset of fever with cough or shortness of breath during their trip or within 14 days of returning to the United States, they should seek medical care. They should tell their health-care provider about their recent travel. More detailed travel recommendations related to MERS-CoV are available at.

Infection control

With multiple health-care–associated clusters identified, infection control remains a primary means of preventing and controlling MERS-CoV transmission. CDC has recently made checklists available that highlight key actions that health-care providers and facilities can take to prepare for MERS-CoV patients. CDC's infection control guidance has not changed. Standard, contact, and airborne precautions are recommended for management of hospitalized patients with known or suspected MERS-CoV infection.

CDC has determined that federal isolation and quarantine are authorized for MERS-CoV under Executive Order 13295. At this time, CDC is not restricting the movement of travelers with respiratory illness (that is not confirmed or probable MERS-CoV infection) arriving from the Arabian Peninsula. However, persons with illness meeting CDC's definition of a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection should remain in isolation until they are no longer considered to be contagious according to current guidance. Those who do not adhere to isolation requirements, or who intend to travel, may be subject to additional public health measures. CDC does not recommend quarantine of asymptomatic persons who were exposed to confirmed or probable cases. CDC generally recommends that persons with febrile respiratory illness delay travel until their symptoms resolve.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^113myzqT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease that has been classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.

Objectives

We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of the disease.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use.

Main Results

We included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies and 15 modelling studies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis. Due to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS). Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence for COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions. This review was commissioned by WHO and supported by Danube-University-Krems.

### Modelling the effectiveness of an isolation strategy for managing mpox outbreaks with variable infectiousness profiles [^1177PLdo]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The duration of the infectious period for mpox has yet to be quantitatively characterized. Several studies have investigated serial intervals (i.e. the time interval between symptom onset dates of primary and secondary cases in transmission pairs) as a proxy, and have suggested that more than 90% of transmission occurs within two weeks of symptom onset. However, factors such as self-reporting may induce biases in serial interval estimates, and moreover, the serial interval distribution may be different to that of the infectious period. Recent findings have also indicated that there might be considerable heterogeneity in the infectious period among individuals with mpox; for example, there is substantial variation in observed serial intervals, and some confirmed cases in Europe have exhibited prolonged viral shedding in their bodily fluids. Consequently, isolation rules that do not account for heterogeneity between individuals (e.g. rules based on isolating for a fixed period following symptom onset) may lead to either a risk of ending isolation too early for those who are infectious for long periods, or an unnecessarily long isolation period for those who are only infectious for short periods.

Current guidelines for mpox generally suggest quarantine of individuals exposed to mpox virus for about 3 weeks. The three-week monitoring period is based on the estimated incubation period, in which more than 98% of people with mpox show symptoms within 21 days of exposure, to check if the exposed individual becomes symptomatic. However, the incubation period does not reflect the generation time of the virus, with onward transmission often occurring after symptom onset. Consequently, individuals whose symptoms have developed are recommended to isolate until their skin lesions have resolved (typically 2–4 weeks),– and are advised to refrain from sexual contact for 12 weeks after the end of isolation. It should be noted that judging the clearance of symptoms for mpox is often difficult and quite subjective, as mild lesions can be undetected even at clinics. This may result in misleading evaluations of individuals' risk of further onward transmission.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^114cfFux]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) epidemiology in infectious mononucleosis (IM) describes humans as the only source, with transmission "primarily through oral secretions", including sharing cups or food or close contact such as sneezing, and notes an incubation period of EBV of 30–50 days. In children " < 16 years old" with clinically diagnosed IM, "85.4% were because of EBV and 14.6% were because of cytomegalovirus (CMV)". In young adults "between 15 and 19 years old", the annual symptomatic IM rate is "between 200 and 800 cases per 100,000". Among freshmen, "30% to 50%" remain susceptible with an "annual incidence of 1% to 5%". A United Kingdom study with "2325 participants" found "96.4% of women and 95.5% of men by age 20 to 25 years were seropositive for EBV", and "each year increase in age corresponded to a 12% increase in the rate of seropositivity". It also states that EBV is "not uncommon" to be unrecognized in children because symptoms are generally less severe than in older adults.

### Association of COVID-19 quarantine duration and postquarantine transmission risk in 4 university cohorts [^112PeGRo]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

These 301 individuals included in this study had a median (IQR) age of 22.0 (20.0–25.0) years; 131 individuals (43.5%) identified as female; and 20 individuals (6.6%) were staff. Of the 287 individuals who reported race and ethnicity, 21 individuals (7.3%) were African American or Black, 60 (20.9%) Asian, 17 (5.9%) Hispanic or Latinx, 174 (60.6%) White, and 15 (5.2%) other (including multiracial and/or multiethnic). We analyzed conversion times for these 301 individuals (Figure 1), as measured from the last exposure date to the dates of the last negative and first positive test results. These are aggregated into a graph of conversion time by day (Figure 2).

We estimated the risk of conversion after release from quarantine by aggregating conversion time (Figure 3). In strict and nonstrict quarantine combined, 40 of 301 individuals with positive test results (13.3%; 95% CI, 9.9%-17.6%) were asymptomatic and had not yet converted on day 7. Under the 7-day guideline, these 40 would have been released on day 7 and converted afterwards, reflecting postquarantine conversion and therefore transmission risk. Similarly, of 301 individuals who converted, 15 (4.9%; 95% CI 3.0%-8.1%) and 4 (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.4%-3.5%) had negative test results and were asymptomatic on days 10 and 14, respectively.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) research priorities in athletes — IM commonly affects young athletes with varied presentations and early features of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy, and the article identifies needs for studies on oral steroids, antiviral therapies, or vaccines; because splenic rupture is extremely rare and risk studies across splenomegaly degrees and return-to-activity timetables are not feasible, the authors propose defining the natural history of splenic size with baseline and follow-up measurements, correlating with symptoms, examination, and laboratory findings, and exploring the role of exercise, noting that many athletes participate without complication and better natural-history data may prevent unnecessary activity restrictions.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^111RqEZ8]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) position statement — return to play after infectious mononucleosis (IM): It is reasonable to engage in a trial of supervised, nonimpact, low-intensity activity 2 wk from the onset of symptoms for those athletes who are afebrile, have an adequate energy level, and have an improving clinical examination; conversely, delaying RTS should be considered when there are ongoing clinical signs/symptoms, lack of athletic readiness, and/or IM-associated complications, and treatment must therefore be individualized (SOR C). It appears that premature (earlier than 2 to 3 wk from symptom onset) return to activities may prolong recovery and prolong the duration of symptoms, most notably fatigue, and may be associated with deconditioning and/or a decrease in performance; there are some data, however, to suggest that early return to low-level exercise is beneficial, and given these uncertainties, a shared decision-making (SDM) model for return-to-sport decisions is recommended (SOR C). The time for safe return to contact play is unclear; given the risk for splenic rupture, a time frame of at least 3 to 4 wk from onset of symptoms is recommended, SDM should be used for individualized RTS decisions, and in situations where an athlete with acute IM is considering an early return to activity (before 3 to 4 wk from symptom onset for contact sport) serial ultrasound imaging could be considered to confirm that the spleen size is decreasing or stable in size (SOR C).

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) return-to-play and splenic rupture risk — Light exercise ad libitum is described for afebrile athletes, with progression of noncontact activity to be individualized, and contact or Valsalva-type activities warrant more caution; the majority of splenic ruptures occur in the first 3 weeks, with cases up to 7 weeks, so it seems reasonable to prohibit activity during this period, after which the athlete should be allowed to return if afebrile, well-hydrated, asymptomatic, and physically fit, noting the risk of splenic rupture is never zero.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^115TfJYF]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For COVID-19, it is vital to understand if quarantines shorter than 14 days can be equally effective with judiciously deployed testing. Here, we develop a mathematical model that quantifies the probability of post-quarantine transmission incorporating testing into travel quarantine, quarantine of traced contacts with an unknown time of infection, and quarantine of cases with a known time of exposure. We find that testing on exit (or entry and exit) can reduce the duration of a 14-day quarantine by 50%, while testing on entry shortens quarantine by at most one day. In a real-world test of our theory applied to offshore oil rig employees, 47 positives were obtained with testing on entry and exit to quarantine, of which 16 had tested negative at entry; preventing an expected nine offshore transmission events that each could have led to outbreaks. We show that appropriately timed testing can make shorter quarantines effective.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^115fmDqX]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society of Sports Medicine position statement — infectious mononucleosis (IM) in athletes — states that IM is caused primarily by the Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV), presents with fever, pharyngitis, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, and can be confirmed by a positive heterophile antibody ("Monospot"), polymerase chain reaction, or antibodies specific to EBV. Individuals with acute IM may be quite asymptomatic and feel well enough to participate in sports, but splenic enlargement is common and rupture is a relatively rare occurrence typically occurring within a month of symptom onset, complicating sports participation and often prompting activity restriction; management is primarily supportive with no role for antivirals or corticosteroids, and variability in presentation with splenic rupture risk makes return to play/return to sport decisions challenging.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^113fyY5n]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society of Sports Medicine position statement — return-to-sport (RTS) guidance in infectious mononucleosis (IM) athletes states that there exists no guidelines specific to RTS in IM for athletes for whom a laboratory abnormality was detected during the initial assessment, and that additional factors to consider into clearance decisions include the risk of contact and/or collision, the age of the athlete, timing within the athlete's season, and other athlete-specific factors. Given that the risk for splenic rupture peaks at 2 weeks after symptom onset, refraining from high exertional activities during that time and avoiding any contact activities for at least 3 weeks after symptom onset is recommended. If the athlete is clinically stable and wants to return to participation in contact before the 3 to 4 week from symptom onset timeframe, serial US measurements to document that the spleen size is decreasing or stable in size may provide further information for the physician and athlete in understanding the risks associated with RTS. SOR Recommendation grade: C.

### The promise of a prophylactic Epstein-Barr virus vaccine [^1123jxAC]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The worldwide burden of disease due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is enormous. Diseases include endemic Burkitt lymphoma, infectious mononucleosis, cancers after transplantation, Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A prophylactic EBV vaccine has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence and/or the severity of all these diseases. Infectious mononucleosis can be nasty and prolonged with a median duration of 17 days. Patients, especially children, undergoing bone marrow or solid organ transplantation may develop post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Preventing or modifying primary EBV infection could reduce the incidence PTLD, and also certain lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV is a major environmental risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). Contracting EBV is essential to getting MS, and having a childhood case of infectious mononucleosis increases that risk. Vaccinating against EBV could be vaccinating against MS.

Return to contact activity after IM: The appropriate time for safe return to contact play is unclear, although, given the risk for splenic rupture, a time frame of at least 3 weeks commonly is recommended; return can occur only after the athlete has no remaining clinical symptoms, is afebrile, and has a normal energy level, and the risk for splenic rupture likely decreases as more time passes, allowing for individualized RTP decisions depending on the athlete, sport, and other factors (SOR C).

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^113krZsq]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–specific serology — timing and diagnostic accuracy: VCA IgM appears early in infection and disappears at the 4–6-week mark; antibody to early antigen is usually short-lived, peaking at 3–4 weeks after onset; VCA IgG peaks at 2–4 weeks and persists for life; and EBNA antibody generally appears only after 2–4 months and also persists for life. VCA IgM and IgG antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis (sensitivity 97%, specificity 94%), with a positive likelihood ratio of 16.5 versus 9.7–28 for a positive heterophile test; when VCA IgM and IgG are negative, the negative likelihood ratio is 0.03 versus 0.14 to 0.18 for heterophile antibody tests. Because EBNA appears late and persists for life, its presence in the course of acute illness should lead one to consider diagnoses other than EBV.

### SARS control and psychological effects of quarantine, toronto, Canada [^113cBEvE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

As a transmissible infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was successfully contained globally by instituting widespread quarantine measures. Although these measures were successful in terminating the outbreak in all areas of the world, the adverse effects of quarantine have not previously been determined in a systematic manner. In this hypothesis-generating study supported by a convenience sample drawn in close temporal proximity to the period of quarantine, we examined the psychological effects of quarantine on persons in Toronto, Canada. The 129 quarantined persons who responded to a Web-based survey exhibited a high prevalence of psychological distress. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were observed in 28.9% and 31.2% of respondents, respectively. Longer durations of quarantine were associated with an increased prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Acquaintance with or direct exposure to someone with a diagnosis of SARS was also associated with PTSD and depressive symptoms.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^1115gXfG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Types of participants

We included:

(KQ1) contacts of a confirmed or suspected case of COVID‐19 or individuals who live in areas with high‐transmission rates;
(KQ2) individuals returning from countries with a declared outbreak of COVID‐19, defined by the WHO as an "occurrence of disease cases in excess of normal expectancy. The number of cases varies according to the disease‐causing agent, and the size and type of previous and existing exposure to the agent" (WHO 2020f).

We excluded:

symptomatic individuals of COVID‐19 infections;
asymptomatic individuals exposed to other pathogens that can cause respiratory infections.

For the original review published in April we also included studies on SARS and MERS, due to the limited evidence on COVID‐19. For this update we identified more evidence on COVID‐19, so we refrained from including additional SARS and MERS studies in the update. We decided to retain the SARS and MERS studies included in the previous version of this review, but we differentiate between evidence directly relevant to COVID‐19 and indirect evidence from SARS and MERS in the Results section.

Types of interventions

Different types and locations of quarantine of individuals. We included studies combining isolation with quarantine because isolation of confirmed cases is a prerequisite for quarantine of individuals who were in contact with these cases.

(KQ1 and KQ2)

Quarantine voluntary mandatory
Quarantine individual level group level community level
Quarantine in private residence hospital public institution others (cruise ships, etc.)
(KQ1b) Quarantine of individuals or a community in combination with other measures: avoiding crowding hand hygiene isolation personal protective equipment school measures/closures physical distancing (also called social distancing) workplace measures/closures

Control measures included the following.

No quarantine
Different types and locations of quarantine
Public health measures without quarantine to reduce the spread of the virus, such as isolation, physical distancing, personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, others

We excluded environmental measures and travel‐related measures (e.g. travel bans) as either an intervention or control measure (in case it was the only control measure).

Types of outcome measures

Incident cases (as reported by authors ‐ clinical diagnosis and/or laboratory confirmation)
Onward transmission
Mortality
Costs costs of implementation (direct costs) costs of lost productivity (indirect costs) cost‐effectiveness

We focused on time points that studies reported for primary outcomes but also included time points that facilitated comparisons of effects across studies.

### Primary Epstein-Barr virus infection [^116CWibW]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects about 90% of adults worldwide. It is the main cause of infectious mononucleosis, which is observed most frequently in adolescents. The disease can last several weeks and is characterized by lymphocytosis, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. Exposure to oral secretions during deep kissing has been identified as the major source for primary EBV infection in adolescents. Oral secretions are also thought to be the source for younger children through intimate intact or sharing food and eating utensils, although this has not been confirmed. Unlike most acute viral illnesses such as influenza, the incubation period of symptomatic primary EBV infection is unusually long, lasting about six weeks. Diagnosis is typically made by heterophile antibody tests and/or EBV-specific antibody tests. Long-term consequences may result from acquisition of the virus, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and lymphomas. Nevertheless, there remains a surprising dearth of knowledge regarding the establishment of an immune response to persistent EBV infection, especially during the incubation period. This lack of knowledge has impaired our ability to develop an effective prophylactic EBV vaccine, despite various attempts. Our greatest challenges in EBV research are to develop a prophylactic vaccine and devise treatment strategies for persons already infected with EBV.

### Prolonged illness after infectious mononucleosis is associated with altered immunity but not with increased viral load [^111MYuop]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection causes a spectrum of characteristics that range from asymptomatic seroconversion to severe infectious mononucleosis (IM), sometimes with prolonged symptoms and disability. We examined the relationships between clinical course, number of viral copies, and immunological parameters in a prospective cohort of subjects with recent IM.

Methods

Eight case patients with at least 6 months of disabling symptoms and 31 matched control subjects who had recovered promptly were included. Symptom scores were recorded at regular intervals over the course of 12 months. Cellular EBV load, EBV-specific antibody responses, lymphocyte subsets, and EBV-specific interferon (IFN)- gamma induction were measured.

Results

In case patients with prolonged illness, the severity of acute-phase symptoms was greater, the development of anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1 immunoglobulin G was more rapid, and the time to development of the peak IFN- gamma response to the majority of latent-cycle EBV peptides was generally slower than those in control subjects. However, in both groups, neither viral nor immune parameters correlated with the severity or duration of symptoms.

Conclusions

The resolution of symptomatic IM is not determined by control of viremia, nor is it easily explained by altered host responses to EBV infection. The detailed determinants of delayed recovery remain to be elucidated.

### Exit strategies: optimising feasible surveillance for detection, elimination, and ongoing prevention of COVID-19 community transmission [^111LToxV]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The following indicators proposed are those that measure the absence of community transmission and/or risk factors for community transmission (i.e. undetected cases in the community, indicated by detected cases with an unknown source of transmission). This is based on the information presented in Fig. 2, which illustrates COVID-19 transmission chains. All of the below indicators measure the absence of community transmission and/or risk factors for community transmission:
The proportion of those with respiratory symptoms who present for testing on the day of symptom onset.
The proportion of those with respiratory symptoms who isolate from time of symptom onset to receipt of a negative test result.
Newly reported cases that are tested on the day of symptom onset (target = 100%).
The proportion of newly detected cases that have been under quarantine from the time of the exposure event (target = 100%).
The proportion of age-specific hospitalised new cases and/or deaths relative to new community-acquired cases in the respective age group (target = 0%).
The proportion of cases with complete follow-up of contacts (target = 100%).
The proportion of cases with unknown source of transmission (community transmission), with a target of 0%.
The proportion of newly reported cases that are importations (i.e. acquired disease outside the surveillance area) and/or known contacts of confirmed cases (target = 100%). This is the mirror of the first indicator (i.e. if all detected cases are in contact of cases or imported cases in travellers, then cases with unknown transmission will be 0%).

The number of upstream contacts per case should be at least twice the number of downstream contacts (Fig. 1), and total number of contacts per case is expected to be > 35, unless there is a clear reason for low numbers of contacts. However, numbers of contacts per case can also be much higher, as super-spreading events demonstrate. Expected numbers of contacts per case should be reviewed regularly based on population mobility and the characteristics of each case's social network, and contact case definitions updated regularily based on comprehensive testing data from contacts of identified cases, including in high-risk settings. Complete follow-up for upstream contacts should consist of PCR and serological testing (to identify past infection) at time of case detection, while complete follow-up for downstream contacts consists of documented quarantining for 14 days following the last contact with the case, and PCR testing at end of the quarantine period to exclude asymptomatic viral shedding.

### Updated recommendations for isolation of persons with mumps [^1138mkqr]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Mumps, an acute vaccine-preventable viral illness transmitted by respiratory droplets and saliva, has an incubation period most commonly of 16–18 days. The classic clinical presentation of mumps is parotitis, which can be preceded by several days of nonspecific prodromal symptoms; however, mumps also can be asymptomatic, especially in young children. Mumps transmission can occur from persons with subclinical or clinical infections and during the prodromal or symptomatic phases of illness. In 2006, during a mumps resurgence in the United States, the latest national recommendations from CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stipulated that persons with mumps be maintained in isolation with standard precautions and droplet precautions for 9 days after onset of parotitis. However, the existence of conflicting guidance (i.e., that the infectious period of mumps extended through the fourth day after parotitis onset) led to confusion regarding the appropriate length of isolation. In addition, during the 2006 resurgence, compliance with recommendations for isolation in university settings was substantially lower for 9 days (65%) compared with 4–5 days (86%). In 2007, after a review of the evidence supporting the 9-day isolation guidance by AAP and CDC, AAP changed its isolation guidance for health-care workers in ambulatory settings from 9 days to 5 days. In February 2008, after review of data on mumps in health-care settings, mumps viral load, and mumps virus isolation, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) approved changes in its recommendations related to mumps in in-patient settings. As a result, CDC, AAP, and HICPAC all now recommend a 5-day period after onset of parotitis, both for isolation of persons with mumps in either community or health-care settings and for use of standard precautions and droplet precautions. This report summarizes the scientific basis for these changes in mumps isolation guidance.

### Fever in returning travelers: a case-based approach [^112rqpYv]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Overall, 3% to 19% of travelers to the developing world will return to the United States with fever or will develop fever within weeks of their return. When evaluating the returning traveler with fever, it is important to know which pretravel immunizations the patient received; which medications he or she took during travel; the likely pathogen exposures during travel; and the incubation interval between travel and onset of fever. A physical examination that includes a search for focal findings may narrow the list of possible infections. Fever compatible with a common illness that occurs in the United States (e.g., mononucleosis) should always be considered. If the patient has fever without a focus and a tropical infection is suspected, malaria, dengue fever, and typhoid fever are common causes. These infections may appear clinically similar, with symptoms of fever, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, and malaise, and decreased white blood cell and platelet counts. Malaria can usually be diagnosed with a thin blood smear. Dengue fever is a clinical diagnosis. Serologic testing for dengue virus immunoglobulin M and G and virus detection tests can be performed to confirm the diagnosis, but are not immediately available. Typhoid fever can usually be diagnosed with a blood, urine, or stool culture.

### Comparative analyses of eighteen rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR for COVID-19 quarantine and surveillance-based isolation [^111T9e3o]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Quarantine and testing strategies

As a baseline reference for PQT, the CDC had recommended a seven-day quarantine with a RT-PCR test conducted within 48 h of quarantine exit. In our analysis, the RT-PCR test was specified to be conducted 24 h before exit from quarantine, whereas no lag was specified for the RA tests. The probability of PQT after a seven-day quarantine with a negative RT-PCR test on exit was estimated to be 0.0022 (95% Credible Interval [CrI]: 0.0020–0.0027). We found that a probability of PQT equivalent to the CDC-suggested quarantine and testing strategy could be achieved using RA tests with at most a one-day increase to the quarantine duration (Fig. 2a, b; Supplementary Data 4). Equivalent durations to a seven-day quarantine with an RT-PCR test conducted 24 h before exit ranged from six to seven (95% CrI: 6–7) days when a RA test was conducted on both entry and on exit from quarantine (Supplementary Data 4, Supplementary Figs. 2 b– 19b).

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^112XXFBi]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The discussion has focused, thus far, on disease development assuming MS is triggered by EBV. We return now to that primary objective and question. The most basic metric for time correlation, "no MS before EBV", that is, "immunity studies"have been the sole means to date for detecting such correlation. The most thorough of these immunity studies is perhaps the 2010 study which used U.S. Army–archived blood samples to provide longitudinal data on serologic history for 305 MS cases. All cases were EBV positive before MS, with 10 seroconverting within the time range accessed by available blood samples. This investigation provided strong evidence supporting the premise that "EBV occurs before MS" while also providing the first data on EBV-MS delay. We have introduced here a distinctly different (from immunity studies) yet complementary methodology, TID detection. Differences between these metrics are quantified in appendix e-4. Both methods are vulnerable to noncausal "confounding" hypotheses (regarding immunity studies, a common confounding phenomenon causes MS and is hypothesized to also cause early EBV susceptibility). We make here and in detail in appendix e-4 2 counter arguments. First, beneficial to either method, EBV is inherently time random. Second, TID detection demands a qualitatively more complex confounding, hypothesized to cause a weak form (both MS and EBV occur later) and strong (MS and EBV occur early). This seems highly unlikely. We, therefore, view TID detection in all males and high EBNA1 titer level cases and in postpubescent females as providing significant evidence for a causal EBV-MS relationship.

If IM is time random (as argued in appendix e-4) and we detect TID, then it follows that random delay in IM to very old age results in no MS; absent IM, no MS occurs. We summarize here our strongest argument for "random" IM and a causal relationship. EBV infection is triggered by saliva transfer in a manner that age of infection is heavily modulated in a statistical (i.e. time random) manner by social norms and ages at various forms of socialization. Data support increased infection at periods of initial schooling or dating. The very strong time correlation between age of IM and age of MS for all males and for all postpubescent females can thus only be simply and easily explained by hypothesizing an IM/MS causal relationship if, as appears to be the case, the initial IM infections are occurring in a time-random fashion.

Infectious mononucleosis pharyngitis can involve severe tonsillar enlargement that can potentially compromise the airway; some authorities have advocated prompt treatment with corticosteroid therapy, initiated in doses ranging from 40 to 80 mg of prednisone or its equivalent, and prednisone may also be used to decrease tonsillar size in patients with difficulty swallowing and dehydration, while Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis is noted in up to 30% of individuals with infectious mononucleosis.

### Comparative analyses of eighteen rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR for COVID-19 quarantine and surveillance-based isolation [^114MGCcy]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

For quarantine policies with an exit test, RT-PCR tests typically must be conducted at least a day prior to the end of quarantine. In contrast, RA tests can be used closer to the end of quarantine due to rapid turnaround times. As a result of increasing test sensitivities during short quarantines, most RA tests conducted on exit outperformed RT-PCR tests for quarantine durations less than three days. Supplementing an exit RA test with one upon entry to quarantine could allow RA tests to outperform a single RT-PCR test on exit for longer quarantine durations. Specifically, for more than 50% of RA tests considered, conducting a RA test on both entry and exit from quarantine produced a lower probability of post-quarantine transmission than an RT-PCR test on exit for quarantine durations up to 14 days. As prevalence in the community increases, having at least one false-negative in a cohort becomes more probable. Conducting a RA test on entry in addition to the one on exit mitigates the reduced sensitivity of a single test, thereby reducing the probability of releasing a still-infectious case from quarantine. Testing on alternative days to quarantine entry could increase the diagnostic sensitivity of the testing strategy even more than adding a test on entry. If logistically and financially feasible, diagnostic sensitivity can be increased further by testing on additional days. At a higher cost than a RA test, multiple RT-PCR tests could also be conducted in quarantine to increase the probability of identifying a case. Long quarantine durations have low practicality for entities trying to minimize interruptions to operations. By adding an additonal less costly RA test at entry or earlier than the exit test, the quarantine duration could be reduced, substantially mitigating loss of productivity attributed to quarantine. Therefore, RA tests can be suitable alternatives to a single RT-PCR, especially for short quarantines of one or two days.

### Suspected cases of COVID-19: study protocol for reporting characteristics and the outcomes [^115kMani]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

At the start, WHO advised screen and triage, all suspected cases who had mild symptoms had a COVID-19 PCR test. Patients with positive results were advised quarantine in either home or quarantine facilities dependant on local guidance. Later with the strain on resources, guidance was updated. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and many countries updated guidance to advise home isolation with no testing for suspected cases with mild symptoms. Testing for COVID-19 virus is now reserved for severe presentation or high-risk population dependant on the local guidelines.

CDC provided prioritisation criteria for testing. The priority-1 population included patient requiring hospitalisation. Priority-2 population include patients older than 65 years of age, with comorbid conditions, in long-term facilities and first responders with symptoms. Suspected and probable cases with mild symptoms and that are not deemed as a priority case for testing will be advised to home isolate for 14 days with remote follow-up and safety netting. CDC guidance advises clinician to use clinical judgement to decide whether a patient should be tested for COVID-19 or not. The new guidance created a new cohort of patients with diagnosis based on the risk of exposure and symptoms but no laboratory confirmation. To our knowledge, there is little reporting on outcomes in this cohort of patients.

### Optimal COVID-19 quarantine and testing strategies [^1127ePfm]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Our study is informative for businesses, military operations, and universities, providing a quantitative estimation of the residual risk of PQT. The calculated infection risks were used to inform the quarantine and RT-PCR testing strategy deployed by an oil and gas company prior to workers traveling offshore. Of the positive tests obtained under this strategy, 34% were obtained on an exit test following a negative entry test. The exit test prevented 16 infected crew members from exiting quarantine and entering confined quarters offshore while potentially infectious. The results of the time of testing for a given quarantine duration are also useful for public-health decision making when quarantine is required for international, interstate, and social travel.

Our examination of the effects of duration of quarantine and timings of testing is critical to future efforts to balance the risk of PQT with the economic costs, negative impact on mental health, and restrictions on social liberty associated with prolonged quarantines. Timely testing enables a shorter quarantine with equivalent benefits to the much longer 14-day quarantine in the prevention of PQT. Our study indicates that the strategy of testing upon entry into quarantine — currently implemented by many institutions and administrative bodies — conveys the least benefit if infection time is unknown. Testing at the exit can provide substantially higher dividends in reducing PQT; or at an optimal timing near one week for quarantines of a week or longer. Our result was substantiated both by our integrative analysis of infectivity and diagnostic sensitivity and by test results demonstrating the utility of tests 96 h into the quarantine of crew members of an offshore oil facility. In determining policies for the duration of travel quarantine and quarantine of traced contacts, full consideration of how timely diagnostic testing aids prevention of PQT is essential to the effective and transparent balancing of lives and livelihoods in times of a global pandemic.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^114jZknq]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of infectious mononucleosis (IM) in adolescents and young adults — IM is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and eventually infects almost 90% of adults. The peak incidence in developed countries has been reported in adolescents and young adults, and among freshman entering college 30% to 50% remain susceptible with an annual incidence of 1% to 3% for developing mononucleosis, translating to a rate of infection of nearly 15% in previously unexposed individuals. There is no evidence to suggest that IM is more or less prevalent in the student-athlete population than among nonathletes.

### Siblings reduce multiple sclerosis risk by preventing delayed primary Epstein-Barr virus infection [^115BiCDJ]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus infection, and perhaps almost exclusively delayed Epstein-Barr virus infection, seems to be a prerequisite for the development of multiple sclerosis. Siblings provide protection against infectious mononucleosis by occasionally preventing delayed primary Epstein-Barr virus infection, with its associated high risk of infectious mononucleosis. Each additional sibling provides further protection according to the age difference between the index child and the sibling. The closer the siblings are in age, the higher the protection, with younger siblings being more protective against infectious mononucleosis than older siblings. If the hypothesis that delayed Epstein-Barr virus infection is necessary for the development of multiple sclerosis is true, then the relative risk of multiple sclerosis as a function of sibship constellation should mirror the relative risk of infectious mononucleosis as a function of sibship constellation. Such an indirect hypothesis test is necessitated by the fact that age at primary Epstein-Barr virus infection is unknown for practically all people who have not experienced infectious mononucleosis. In this retrospective cohort study using nationwide registers, we followed all Danes born during the period 1971–2018 (n = 2 576 011) from 1977 to 2018 for hospital contacts with an infectious mononucleosis diagnosis (n = 23 905) or a multiple sclerosis diagnosis (n = 4442), defining two different end points. Relative risks (hazard ratios) of each end point as a function of sibship constellation were obtained from stratified Cox regression analyses. The hazard ratios of interest for infectious mononucleosis and multiple sclerosis could be assumed to be identical (test for homogeneity P = 0.19), implying that having siblings, especially of younger age, may protect a person against multiple sclerosis through early exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus. Maximum protection per sibling was obtained by having a 0–2 years younger sibling, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.80, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.76–0.85. The corresponding hazard ratio from having an (0–2 years) older sibling was 0.91 (0.86–0.96). Our results suggest that it may be possible essentially to eradicate multiple sclerosis using an Epstein-Barr virus vaccine administered before the teenage years. Getting there would require both successful replication of our study findings and, if so, elucidation of why early Epstein-Barr virus infection does not usually trigger the immune mechanisms responsible for the association between delayed Epstein-Barr virus infection and multiple sclerosis risk.

### Epstein-Barr virus-recent advances [^111agRbr]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2003). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus is a tumorigenic herpes virus that is ubiquitous in the adult population. The virus is generally spread to and between young children through salivary contact, and only causes clinical illness where primary infection is delayed until adolescence or beyond, when an intense immunopathological reaction leads to the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis in roughly 50% of cases. More than 90% of the world's population carry Epstein-Barr virus as a life-long, latent infection of B lymphocytes. Recent data show that by mimicking B-cell antigen-activation pathways the virus enters the long-lived memory B lymphocyte pool where it evades immune elimination by severely restricting its own gene expression. By influencing B-cell survival mechanisms Epstein-Barr virus may induce tumours such as B lymphoproliferative disease and Hodgkin's disease. Vaccines are being developed to prevent and/or treat these conditions, but an animal model is required to study pathogenesis before a rational vaccine strategy can be formulated.

### Effectiveness of 14 day quarantine strategy: Chinese experience of prevention and control [^111wVRne]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

China's experience of quarantine strategy

Travel into China was restricted during the pandemic, and passengers entering Guangdong province accounted for around 90% of all Chinese arrivals. From 1 May 2020 to 7 March 2021 there were 1868 imported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified, but only 33 (1.8%) people tested positive after 14 days' quarantine. Only three of these 33 people developed symptoms. Four were not tested for IgG antibody, but the positivity rate in the rest was 97% (28/29). This suggested these cases were not likely to be new infections but that the people had been infected while abroad and were testing positive again in China. Two of the three people with symptoms were IgG positive when they arrived in China and their cycle threshold values on nucleic acid testing were 30 and 38.4, respectively. Therefore, they were considered to be reinfections. As the positive results could be due to detection of degraded virus fragments and high levels of antibodies were observed, the infectivity of these cases may be extremely low.

Epidemiological investigation revealed that the third confirmed case lived with someone who was PCR positive and developed covid-19 symptoms during the quarantine period. Therefore, this case was evaluated as a secondary infection of SARS-CoV-2 during the quarantine period. As those identified cooperated with other prevention and control measures, no local epidemic was induced by these three cases. This experience suggests the 14 day quarantine is sufficient.

Some researchers have also found longer quarantine times are not necessary to control the covid-19 pandemic. Ashcroft and colleagues found that 10 days' quarantine can prevent 99.9% (95% confidence interval 98% to 100%) of local transmission caused by returned travellers. Another analysis suggested that a 14 day quarantine would result in fewer than one infectious traveller entering Britain from the EU or the US each week. These analyses suggest that although extending the 14 day quarantine may be worth considering in some extreme cases, a longer quarantine time may not add benefit when social-psychological and economic effects are taken into consideration.

Head, neck, and skin findings — clinical features of infectious mononucleosis (IM): Lymphadenopathy in IM involves the posterior cervical chain more than the anterior chain, with nodes typically large and moderately tender, peaking early and subsiding over a 2- to 3-week period. Oropharyngeal assessment should consider other causes, including streptococci (coexistent in up to 30% of cases), gonococcus, and human immunodeficiency virus, and exudative pharyngitis is seen in more than 50% of patients with IM with marked tonsillar hyperplasia and exudation that may be white or gray-green or necrotic. Skin findings may include a maculopapular, urticarial, or petechial rash; rash is more common with concomitant ampicillin and has been described with azithromycin, levofloxacin, and cephalexin, and petechial rashes should alert providers to possible hematologic complications such as aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### About infectious mononucleosis (mono) | EBV and mono… [^113MdZ4T]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Infectious mononucleosis, also called "mono, " is a contagious disease.
- Most people with mono get better in 2 to 4 weeks, but some may feel fatigued for several more weeks.
- There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. What is it Infectious mononucleosis is a contagious disease most commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Other viruses can also cause this disease. Infectious mononucleosis is common among teenagers and young adults, especially college students. At least 1 out of 4 teenagers and young adults who get infected with EBV will develop infectious mononucleosis. Sign and symptoms Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis include:

- Extreme fatigue
- Fever
- Sore throat
- Headaches and body aches
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits
- Swollen liver or spleen or both
- Rash Enlarged spleen and a swollen liver are less common symptoms.

For some people, their liver or spleen or both may remain enlarged even after their fatigue ends. While most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks, some may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis can last for 6 months or longer. Prevention There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. You can help protect yourself by not kissing people who have infectious mononucleosis; or sharing drinks, food, or personal items with them. Treatment and recovery Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. You can help relieve symptoms of infectious mononucleosis by:

- Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
- Getting plenty of rest
- Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever Do not take penicillin antibiotics If you have infectious mononucleosis, you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin.

Based on the severity of the symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend treatment of specific organ systems affected by infectious mononucleosis. Avoid contact sports Because your spleen may become enlarged as a result of infectious mononucleosis, you should avoid contact sports until you fully recover. Participating in contact sports can be strenuous and may cause the spleen to rupture.
