## Question

Hawthorn side effects in overdose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hawthorn side effects in overdose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which hawthorn species and products are implicated in overdose toxicity. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic mechanism that explains the clinical picture. Next, I will extract and synthesize the clinical manifestations from case reports. After that, I need to check for diagnostic pitfalls, especially digoxin assay interference. Finally, I will consider management principles, including when to use digoxin immune Fab, and outline key counseling points and uncertainties that would change practice if better data emerge.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. The overdose reports consistently involve Crataegus mexicana, marketed as "tejocote" or "raíz de tejocote", sold online as a weight-loss supplement, and not the European hawthorn leaf/flower extracts studied for heart failure, so I should not conflate these products or assume class-wide effects without evidence [^162da5a1] [^873743d5].

> I need to check the mechanism. Multiple sources indicate tejocote root contains cardiac glycoside–like compounds that exert digoxin-like effects, including Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition and positive inotropy, which mechanistically explains bradycardia and conduction disturbances; importantly, some commercial digoxin immunoassays cross-react, yielding falsely elevated digoxin levels that can mislead clinicians if interpreted at face value [^162da5a1] [^75c3a9c8] [^873743d5].

> Next, I should review the clinical manifestations. Mild presentations include flu-like symptoms with myalgias and dizziness, while moderate-to-severe overdoses feature sinus bradycardia, Mobitz type I second-degree AV block, and marked bradycardia down to the 30s–50s; gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea are common, and respiratory depression with hypopnea has been reported, particularly in pediatric exposures [^162da5a1] [^873743d5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about assay results. I should double-check the diagnostic caveat: detectable "digoxin" on immunoassay in tejocote overdose reflects assay interference rather than true digoxin exposure, so I must correlate with history, ECG, and clinical course; this is a classic example of a falsely elevated digoxin level due to structural similarity of plant glycosides to digoxin [^873743d5] [^75c3a9c8].

> I will now examine management. Supportive care with continuous cardiac monitoring, IV fluids, and correction of electrolytes is foundational; atropine can be tried for bradycardia, but in severe digoxin-like cardiotoxicity, digoxin immune Fab has been used despite uncertain benefit, with mixed clinical responses reported; given the lack of a validated antidote, early poison control consultation is prudent, and I should avoid overinterpreting a transient "response" as proof of efficacy [^873743d5] [^fb969d21].

> But wait, what if the patient is on real digoxin concurrently. I should confirm medication reconciliation because hawthorn extracts can interact pharmacodynamically with digoxin and interfere with some immunoassays, so concomitant use may potentiate toxicity and confound interpretation; counseling to avoid hawthorn with digoxin is reasonable even outside the tejocote context [^75c3a9c8] [^690c20c2].

> Let me consider population-specific risks. Pediatric patients appear vulnerable, with reported severe bradycardia and respiratory depression; therefore, I need to maintain a low threshold for telemetry, early specialty involvement, and consideration of Fab in life-threatening bradyarrhythmias, while recognizing that evidence is limited to case reports and expert opinion [^873743d5].

> I should confirm counseling points. Patients using weight-loss supplements should be screened for tejocote use, educated about its cardiac risks, and advised to stop immediately if symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, syncope, or gastrointestinal distress occur; clinicians should explicitly ask about internet-purchased "natural" products because patients often omit them in medication histories [^162da5a1] [^873743d5].

> Next, I should review uncertainties and research gaps. There is no established toxic dose, no validated assay for tejocote glycosides, and no high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of Fab; future work should define dose–response, characterize the active glycosides, and evaluate antidotal strategies, including whether Fab truly alters outcomes or simply provides supportive time for clearance [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to ensure I distinguish Crataegus mexicana tejocote from other hawthorn products. Overdose produces a digoxin-like toxidrome with bradycardia, conduction delay, GI symptoms, and occasional respiratory depression, with falsely elevated digoxin assays due to immunoassay cross-reactivity; management is supportive with consideration of Fab in severe cases, and prevention hinges on medication reconciliation and patient counseling about the risks of unregulated weight-loss supplements [^162da5a1] [^873743d5] [^75c3a9c8].

Hawthorn overdose can cause **bradycardia, hypotension, and conduction disturbances** (including AV block) [^162da5a1] due to cardiac glycoside–like effects, with symptoms such as dizziness, syncope, nausea, and fatigue [^873743d5]. Severe cases may present with **life-threatening arrhythmias** and hemodynamic instability [^162da5a1]. Management is supportive, with atropine for bradycardia, electrolyte correction, and consideration of digoxin immune Fab for severe cardiotoxicity [^873743d5]; activated charcoal may be used if ingestion is recent. Chronic use can also cause hepatotoxicity, so liver function should be monitored [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms underlying toxicity

Hawthorn contains flavonoids and oligomeric procyanidins that exert **cardioactive effects**, including positive inotropy, vasodilation, and beta-adrenergic antagonism [^690c20c2]. In overdose, these effects can cause bradycardia, hypotension, and conduction disturbances [^162da5a1].

---

## Clinical manifestations of hawthorn overdose

The clinical presentation of hawthorn overdose varies with the amount ingested, individual susceptibility, and co-ingestants. Common symptoms include:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Bradycardia, hypotension, conduction disturbances (e.g. AV block), and arrhythmias [^162da5a1] [^873743d5].
- **Neurological effects**: Dizziness, syncope, fatigue, and confusion [^162da5a1].
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort [^873743d5].
- **Respiratory effects**: Respiratory depression has been reported in severe cases [^873743d5].

---

## Severity and progression of symptoms

Symptom severity correlates with the ingested dose and individual susceptibility. Mild cases may present with dizziness and gastrointestinal upset, whereas severe cases can progress to **life-threatening bradyarrhythmias**, hemodynamic instability, and respiratory depression [^162da5a1] [^873743d5].

---

## Specific populations at increased risk

Certain populations are at **increased risk** of adverse effects from hawthorn overdose:

- **Elderly individuals**: Increased susceptibility to cardiovascular effects due to age-related physiological changes.
- **Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions**: Such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or conduction disorders [^690c20c2].
- **Pediatric populations**: Limited data suggest increased susceptibility to adverse effects [^873743d5].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Diagnosis of hawthorn overdose is primarily clinical, supported by patient history and ECG findings. Laboratory tests may reveal electrolyte disturbances (e.g. hyperkalemia) and elevated digoxin levels due to cross-reactivity with digoxin immunoassays, although this is not specific to hawthorn toxicity [^75c3a9c8].

---

## Management strategies

Management of hawthorn overdose is primarily supportive, with **no specific antidote** available:

- **Supportive care**: Continuous cardiac monitoring, oxygen therapy, and intravenous fluids to maintain hemodynamic stability [^fb969d21].
- **Pharmacological interventions**: Atropine for bradycardia, vasopressors for hypotension, and antiarrhythmic medications for arrhythmias.
- **Digoxin immune Fab**: Considered in severe cases with life-threatening cardiotoxicity, although its efficacy in hawthorn overdose is not well-established [^873743d5].
- **Activated charcoal**: May be administered if ingestion occurred within a few hours to reduce absorption.

---

## Long-term complications

Chronic hawthorn overdose or prolonged use may lead to **hepatotoxicity**, renal impairment, and persistent cardiovascular complications. Regular monitoring of liver and renal function is recommended in cases of chronic use or repeated overdose.

---

## Preventive measures and patient education

Preventive measures include:

- **Patient education**: Informing patients about potential risks, interactions, and symptoms of overdose.
- **Healthcare provider awareness**: Encouraging thorough medication history-taking, including herbal supplements [^4efa3ca9].
- **Regulatory oversight**: Stricter regulation and quality control of herbal products to prevent adulteration and mislabeling [^ec65cb47].

---

Hawthorn overdose can cause significant cardiovascular toxicity, including bradycardia, hypotension, and conduction disturbances. Management is supportive, with consideration of digoxin immune Fab in severe cases. Chronic use may lead to hepatotoxicity and renal impairment, emphasizing the need for patient education and regulatory oversight.

### Hawthorne root (crataegus mexicana) toxicity [^162da5a1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Here we present the case of a patient who purchased a Hawthorne root (Crataegus mexicana) product, Raiz de Tejocote, for weight loss purposes. She presented with diffuse myalgias, dizziness and a heart rate of 52 beats per minute. At triage and at initial evaluation, the patient denied taking any medications, but on iterative questioning concerning over-the-counter, over-the-internet and herbal medications, she reported taking Hawthorne root tablets in the three days prior to the emergency department (ED) visit for the purpose of weight loss. The product was purchashed through the internet. Her plasma digoxin concentration was 0.4 ng/ml the patient's constellation of symptoms, as well as the detectable plasma digoxin concentration, were consistent with hawthorne root toxicity. Hawthorne root has intrinsic cardiac glycoside activity. In addition, Hawthorne root may cause a range of toxicity. Mild symptoms can include flu-like syndrome with significant myalgias. However, in the more severe exposures the cardiac glycoside effects can result in bradycardia and hemodynamic instability. Symptoms resolved with ED observation. The heart rate normalized. This case reinforces the importance of asking a patient about all medications, including over-the-counter, over-the-internet and herbal medications.

### Crataegus mexicana (tejocote) exposure associated with cardiotoxicity and a falsely elevated digoxin level [^873743d5]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A species of hawthorn, Crataegus mexicana (tejocote), has been marketed as a weight-loss supplement that is readily available for purchase online. While several hawthorn species have shown clinical benefit in the treatment of heart failure owing to their positive inotropic effects, little is known about hawthorn, and tejocote in particular, when consumed in excess. We describe a case of tejocote exposure from a weight-loss supplement resulting in severe cardiotoxicity.

Case Report

A healthy 16-year-old girl presented to an emergency department after ingesting eight pieces of her mother's tejocote root weight-loss supplement. At arrival, she was drowsy, had active vomiting and diarrhea, and had a heart rate of 57 with normal respirations. Her initial blood chemistries were unremarkable, except for an elevated digoxin assay of 0.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range 0.5–2.0 ng/mL). All other drug screens were negative. She later developed severe bradycardia and multiple episodes of hypopnea that prompted a transfer to our institution, a tertiary pediatric hospital. Her ECG demonstrated a heart rate of 38 and Mobitz type 1 second-degree heart block. She was subsequently given two vials of Digoxin Immune Fab due to severe bradycardia in the setting of suspected digoxin-like cardiotoxicity after discussion with the regional poison control center. No clinical improvement was observed. Approximately 29 hours after ingestion, subsequent ECGs demonstrated a return to normal sinus rhythm, and her symptoms resolved.

Discussion

Tejocote root toxicity may cause dysrhythmias and respiratory depression. Similar to other species of hawthorn, tejocote root may cross-react with some commercial digoxin assays, resulting in a falsely elevated level.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for pain management — APAP, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent whose analgesic and antipyretic actions appear limited to the central nervous system and, for this reason, APAP is ineffective as an anti-inflammatory; research suggests that APAP may also act as a cannabinoid system modulator. The most commonly reported side effect is GI discomfort, and the most common severe effects are hepatotoxicity from significant overdose with hepatocellular damage and death; toxicity from a single administration < 150 mg/kg for adults or 200 mg/kg for children is rare, and care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and other patients with hepatic dysfunction where the maximum safe daily dose may not be known. APAP has the advantage of being lightweight and low bulk, is available in PO, PR, and IV formulations, and multiple studies comparing IV against PO and PR administrations have found clinical equipoise.

### Health effects of hawthorn [^690c20c2]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Hawthorn medicinal extract has long been a favored herbal remedy in Europe. The active components of this slow-acting cardiotonic agent are thought to be flavonoids and oligomeric procyanidins. The most studied hawthorn extracts are WS 1442 and LI 132. Reviews of placebo- controlled trials have reported both subjective and objective improvement in patients with mild forms of heart failure (New York Heart Association classes I through III). Other studies of hawthorn in patients with heart failure have revealed improvement in clinical symptoms, pressure-heart rate product, left ventricular ejection fraction, and patients' subjective sense of well-being. However, there is no evidence of a notable reduction in mortality or sudden death. Hawthorn is well tolerated; the most common adverse effects are vertigo and dizziness. Theoretic interactions exist with antiarrhythmics, antihypertensives, digoxin, and antihyperlipidemic agents. Proven conventional therapies for heart failure are still recommended until the safety and effectiveness of hawthorn has been proven in long-term studies.

What else should I know about taking RIVELSA?

Birth control pills do not protect you against any sexually transmitted infection, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Do not skip any pills, even if you do not have sex often.

Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.

You should stop RIVELSA at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it for at least two weeks after the surgery, due to an increased risk of blood clots.

If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like RIVELSA, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones pass into breast milk.

Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines and herbal products that you take. Some medicines and herbal products may make birth control pills less effective, including:

### Adverse effects of psychedelics: from anecdotes and misinformation to systematic science [^5daa38ed]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Overdose toxicity

Psychedelics are physiologically safe in humans when ingested at standard doses. Overdose deaths have occurred due to ingestion of very large doses, that is, more than 23 times the previously recommended LSD human dose or by mixing psychedelics with other drugs and/or alcohol. For a summary of overdose and toxicity events reported in the literature, please see Table 3.

Table 3.
Overdose and toxicity effects.

In rats, psilocybin has been reported to have an LD50 of 280 mg/kg (, as cited in). This is over 700 times the high dose of 25 mg used in clinical studies, for an average body weight of 70 kg. LSD has also been shown to be safe with very low physiological toxicity. However, there have been cases of death by overdose of psychedelics with the majority from LSD and psilocybin – probably because these are the most widely used.provides a summary of these and other case reports. Older reports of administration of LSD or mescaline in a clinically supervised setting have found adverse effects or death due to the person's underlying health conditions, such as, manic-depressive illness, acute asthma and depersonalisation syndrome (e.g.;). Yet, equally there are reports of ingesting large quantities of LSD with successful recovery and without long-lasting effects.

Long-term ritual consumption of ayahuasca is not toxic or harmful to adults or in adolescents.also found no foetal deaths or abnormalities in mothers who used ayahuasca during pregnancy. However, large, well-conducted longitudinal trials in pregnant women would be needed to confirm these findings. One feature of ayahuasca, enhancing its safety profile, is the side effect of nausea and vomiting, especially at high doses which may prevent continued drug administration and overdose.

### Interference of hawthorn on serum digoxin measurements by immunoassays and pharmacodynamic interaction with digoxin [^75c3a9c8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Hawthorn is an herb indicated for treating cardiac illness. Because a patient taking digoxin may also take hawthorn, we investigated potential interference of hawthorn in serum digoxin measurements using immunoassays as well as pharmacodynamic interaction between hawthorn and digoxin. Hawthorn contains alkaloids that are structurally similar to digoxin and may interfere with serum digoxin measurement using immunoassays. In addition, hawthorn has cardioactive properties similar to digoxin.

Objective

To study potential pharmacodynamic interaction between hawthorn and digoxin.

Design

The effects of hawthorn extract on serum digoxin measurements using Digoxin III (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois) and the Tina-Quant digoxin assay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana) were investigated using 2 different brands of extract. To study the pharmacodynamic interaction between hawthorn and digoxin, we used an isolated adult rat cardiomyocyte system, measuring calcium transients by real-time fluorescence spectrophotometry.

Results

Hawthorn interfered only with the Digoxin III immunoassay but had no effect on the Tina-Quant assay. Both hawthorn extracts increased intracellular calcium levels, but the lack of additive response with digoxin suggests both may bind to the same site of Na, K adenosine triphosphatase.

Conclusion

Because of interference of hawthorn with a digoxin immunoassay and pharmacodynamic interaction with digoxin, a patient receiving digoxin should avoid hawthorn.

### Levonorgestrel / ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (loJaimiess) [^39882a77]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Talk to your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects that concern you. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1‑800-FDA-1088.

No serious problems have been reported from a birth control pill overdose, even when accidentally taken by children.

What else should I know about taking LoJaimiess?

If you are scheduled for any lab tests, tell your healthcare provider you are taking LoJaimiess. Certain blood tests may be affected by LoJaimiess.
Do not skip any pills, even if you do not have sex often.
Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.
You should stop LoJaimiess at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it for at least two weeks after the surgery, due to an increased risk of blood clots.
If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like LoJaimiess, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones pass into breast milk, but this has not caused harmful effects in breastfeeding infants.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana er) [^18418610]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may cause serious problems when taken with OPANA ER, especially if they cause sleepiness (like sleeping pills, anxiety medicines, antihistamines, or tranquilizers).

Do not take any new medicines while using OPANA ER until you have talked to your healthcare provider or pharmacist and they have told you it is safe.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist.

How Should I Take OPANA ER?

Follow your healthcare provider's directions exactly. Your healthcare provider may change your dose based on your reactions to the medicine. Do not change your dose unless your healthcare provider tells you to change it. Do not take OPANA ER more often than prescribed.
Swallow OPANA ER tablets whole. Do not break, crush, dissolve, or chew OPANA ER tablets before swallowing. If a tablet is broken, crushed, dissolved, or chewed, the full 12 hour dose can be taken into your body all at once. This is very dangerous. You could die from an overdose of the medicine. If you cannot swallow tablets whole, tell your healthcare provider. You may need a different medicine.
Take OPANA ER every 12 hours or as instructed by your healthcare provider. OPANA ER should be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after meals. Talk to your healthcare provider if you feel sick taking OPANA ER on an empty stomach.
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once unless your healthcare provider tells you to. If you are not sure about your dosing call your healthcare provider.
If you take too much OPANA ER or overdose, call your local emergency number or poison control center right away.
Talk to your healthcare provider often about your pain. Your healthcare provider can decide if you still need OPANA ER.
If you have side effects that bother you or if you continue to have pain, call your healthcare provider.
Stopping OPANA ER. If your healthcare provider decides you no longer need OPANA ER, ask how to slowly reduce the dose of your medicine so you don't get uncomfortable (withdrawal) symptoms such as nausea, sweating, and pain. You should not stop taking OPANA ER all at once if you have been taking it for more than a few days without talking to your healthcare provider. OPANA ER can cause physical dependence. You can get sick with withdrawal symptoms if you stop OPANA ER all at once, because your body has become use to it.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol (Lo simpesse) [^9929b049]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

This is not a complete list of possible side effects. Talk to your healthcare provider if you develop any side effects that concern you. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

No serious problems have been reported from a birth control pill overdose, even when accidentally taken by children.

What else should I know about taking Lo Simpesse?

If you are scheduled for any lab tests, tell your healthcare provider you are taking Lo Simpesse. Certain blood tests may be affected by Lo Simpesse.
Do not skip any pills, even if you do not have sex often.
Birth control pills should not be taken during pregnancy. However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.
You should stop Lo Simpesse at least four weeks before you have major surgery and not restart it for at least two weeks after the surgery, due to an increased risk of blood clots.
If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Lo Simpesse, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones pass into breast milk, but this has not caused harmful effects in breastfeeding infants.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use another birth control method, like condoms or a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.

### Hawthorn extract for treating chronic heart failure: meta-analysis of randomized trials [^66d0f6e0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the evidence from rigorous clinical trials of the use of hawthorn extract to treat patients with chronic heart failure. We searched the literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, CISCOM, and AMED. Experts on and manufacturers of commercial preparations containing hawthorn extract were asked to contribute published and unpublished studies. There were no restrictions about the language of publication. Two reviewers independently performed the screening of studies, selection, validation, data extraction, and the assessment of methodological quality. To be included, studies were required to state that they were randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled, and used hawthorn extract monopreparations. Thirteen trials met all inclusion criteria. In most of the studies, hawthorn was used as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Eight trials including 632 patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association classes I to III) provided data that were suitable for meta-analysis. For the physiologic outcome of maximal workload, treatment with hawthorn extract was more beneficial than placebo (weighted mean difference, 7 Watt; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3 to 11 Watt; P < 0.01; n = 310 patients). The pressure-heart rate product also showed a beneficial decrease (weighted mean difference, -20; 95% CI: -32 to -8; n = 264 patients) with hawthorn treatment. Symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue improved significantly with hawthorn treatment as compared with placebo. Reported adverse events were infrequent, mild, and transient; they included nausea, dizziness, and cardiac and gastrointestinal complaints. In conclusion, these results suggest that there is a significant benefit from hawthorn extract as an adjunctive treatment for chronic heart failure.

### Diphenhydramine: time to move on? [^e82fd492]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine is one of the most widely available, longest-used antihistamine medications but has many side effects including sedation and risk of toxicity in overdose including cardiac toxicity. It is frequently inappropriately used when newer, more favorable antihistamine medications are available. Second-generation antihistamines are also widely available and affordable, with many of the same desired effects as diphenhydramine and fewer, if any, of the undesirable side effects. Because of the negative side effects and wide availability of alternative antihistamine medications, it is definitively time to move on from diphenhydramine.

### Hawthorn extract randomized blinded chronic heart failure (HERB CHF) trial [^31b67ae2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Hawthorn's efficacy when added to contemporary evidence-based heart failure therapy is unknown. We aimed to determine whether hawthorn increases submaximal exercise capacity when added to standard medical therapy.

Methods and Results

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 120 ambulatory patients aged ≥ 18 years with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III chronic heart failure. All patients received conventional medical therapy, as tolerated, and were randomized to either hawthorn 450 mg twice daily or placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was change in 6 min walk distance at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included quality of life (QOL) measures, peak oxygen consumption, and anaerobic threshold during maximal treadmill exercise testing, NYHA classification, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), neurohormones, and measures of oxidative stress and inflammation. There were no significant differences between groups in the change in 6 min walk distance (P = 0.61), or on measures of QOL, functional capacity, neurohormones, oxidative stress, or inflammation. A modest difference in LVEF favoured hawthorn (P = 0.04). There were significantly more adverse events reported in the hawthorn group (P = 0.02), although most were non-cardiac.

Conclusion

Hawthorn provides no symptomatic or functional benefit when given with standard medical therapy to patients with heart failure. This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00343902.

### Implementation of the quality management system improves postoperative pain treatment: a prospective pre-/ post-interventional questionnaire study [^5753bce1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Fig 4
Frequency of opioid-induced side-effects on the first postoperative day and on the day of discharge given as per cent from total number of patients in the survey; numeric values are absolute number of patients;✱ p < 0.0001; χ²-test.

It is likely that the 25–30% decrease in the POP level and the reduction in analgesic-related side-effects led to an improvement in daily activity, sleep, and enjoyment of life. However, the psychological effects of increased attention by medical staff cannot be ruled out. The patients' satisfaction with pain therapy had also improved after the implementation of the QMS.

These improvements in POP management can be partly attributed to the Hawthorne effect, when the act of measuring induces changes itself. However, the size of the Hawthorne effect is much smaller, than the effects found in our studyand it usually disappears within 8 weeks since the introduction of 'something new'. Moreover, in order to keep the Hawthorne effect (motivation of personnel, participating in QMS on POP treatment) working, the German quality and safety monitoring agency, TÜV Rheinland, incorporated special monitoring/quality assurance measures, including external and internal audits (see section 'Quality management system', statement x).

### When is a herb a drug? [^bcc685da]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

With the growing popularity and use of herbal remedies in the industrial countries there has been an increasing recognition and reporting of adverse reactions. Drug development represents discovery and characterization of naturally occurring plant metabolites or their synthetic analogues. Therefore, a herbal remedy should be considered a drug for all clinical purposes. The liver, being central to the metabolism of virtually all xenobiotics, is inevitably exposed to reactive metabolites and liver injury is a potential complication of nearly every medication, including herbal remedies. Recognition of herb induced hepatotoxicity depends on clinical awareness of the problem, a suspicion that a herbal preparation is involved, and detailed enquiry regarding the use of all supplements and remedies. Herbal medicines should be regulated more systematically and monitoring for adverse reaction should improve.

### Hawthorn extract for treating chronic heart failure [^bef238a0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hawthorn extract is advocated as an oral treatment option for chronic heart failure. Also, the German Commission E approved the use of extracts of hawthorn leaf with flower in patients suffering from heart failure graded stage II according to the New York Heart Association.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms as reported in double-blind randomised clinical trials of hawthorn extract compared with placebo for treating patients with chronic heart failure.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library (issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1951 to June 2006), EMBASE (1974 to June 2006), CINAHL (1982 to June 2006) and AMED (1985 to June 2006). Experts and manufacturers were contacted. Language restrictions were not imposed.

Selection Criteria

To be included, studies were required to state that they were randomised, double-blind, and placebo controlled, and used hawthorn leaf and flower extract monopreparations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently performed the selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of methodological quality. Data were entered into RevMan 4.2 software. Results from continuous data were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Where data were suitable for combining, pooled results were calculated.

Main Results

Fourteen trials met all inclusion criteria and were included in this review. In most of the studies, hawthorn was used as an adjunct to conventional treatment. Ten trials including 855 patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association classes I to III) provided data that were suitable for meta-analysis. For the physiologic outcome of maximal workload, treatment with hawthorn extract was more beneficial than placebo (WMD (Watt) 5.35, 95% CI 0.71 to 10.00, P < 0.02, n = 380). Exercise tolerance were significantly increased by hawthorn extract (WMD (Watt x min) 122.76, 95% CI 32.74 to 212.78, n = 98). The pressure-heart rate product, an index of cardiac oxygen consumption, also showed a beneficial decrease with hawthorn treatment (WMD (mmHg/min) -19.22, 95% CI -30.46 to -7.98, n = 264). Symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue improved significantly with hawthorn treatment as compared with placebo (WMD -5.47, 95% CI -8.68 to -2.26, n = 239). No data on relevant mortality and morbidity such as cardiac events were reported, apart from one trial, which reported deaths (three in active, one in control) without providing further details. Reported adverse events were infrequent, mild, and transient; they included nausea, dizziness, and cardiac and gastrointestinal complaints.

Authors' Conclusions

These results suggest that there is a significant benefit in symptom control and physiologic outcomes from hawthorn extract as an adjunctive treatment for chronic heart failure.

### Ferric maltol (Accrufer) [^a0b50396]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Taking ACCRUFER with certain other medicines may affect each other causing serious side effects.

Some medicines may need to be taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after you have taken your ACCRUFER dose. Ask your healthcare provider for a list of these medicines if you are not sure if you take one of these medicines.

Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take:

dimercaprol
other oral iron tablets or health supplements containing iron

Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you take one of these medicines.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

How should I take ACCRUFER?

Take ACCRUFER exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to.
Take ACCRUFER 2 times a day on an empty stomach 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.
Swallow ACCRUFER capsules whole. Do not open, break, or chew ACCRUFER capsules.
In case of accidental overdose, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

What are the possible side effects of ACCRUFER?

ACCRUFER may cause serious side effects, including:

Increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare. You should avoid taking ACCRUFER if you have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and are experiencing a flare.
Too much iron stored in your body (iron overload). Your healthcare provider should check the iron level in your blood before you start and during treatment with ACCRUFER.
Risk of overdose in children due to accidental swallowing. Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of death from poisoning in children under 6. Keep ACCRUFER in a safe place and out of the reach of children.

### Increasing uncertainty in CNS clinical trials: the role of placebo, nocebo, and hawthorne effects [^9c3cd6e8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

As modern research continues to unravel the details of the placebo phenomenon in CNS disorders, uncertainty about therapeutic outcomes in trials of treatments for several neurological conditions is growing. Advances in understanding the mechanisms of different placebo effects have emphasised the substantial challenges inherent in interpreting the results of CNS clinical trials. In the past few years, new mechanisms and concepts have emerged in the study of placebo, nocebo, and Hawthorne effects in CNS clinical trials. For example, the mere step of recruitment in a trial or social interaction among trial participants can change the baseline conditions and therefore affect the interpretation of therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, different genotypes have been shown to respond differently to placebos-eg, in studies of social anxiety, depression, and pain. Increasing recognition of these factors in the general population raises the question of whether attempts should be made to reduce placebo responses in CNS clinical trials. Both clinical trial design and medical practice could benefit from further investigation of these effects across a range of neuropsychiatric disorders.

### Bupropion hydrochloride (bupropion) [^c6854987]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Many medicines increase your chances of having seizures or other serious side effects if you take them while you are taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets.

How should I take bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets?

Take bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not change your dose or stop taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets without talking to your healthcare provider first.
Swallow bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets whole. Do not chew, cut, or crush bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets. If you do, the medicine will be released into your body too quickly. If this happens you may be more likely to get side effects including seizures. Tell your healthcare provider if you cannot swallow tablets.
Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets may have an odor. This is normal.
Take bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets at the same time each day.
Take your doses of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets at least 8 hours apart.
You may take bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets with or without food.
If you miss a dose, do not take an extra dose to make up for the dose you missed. Wait and take your next dose at the regular time. This is very important. Too much bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets can increase your chance of having a seizure.
If you take too much bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets, or overdose, call your local emergency room or poison control center right away.
Do not take any other medicines while taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets unless your healthcare provider has told you it is okay.
If you are taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets for the treatment of major depressive disorder, it may take several weeks for you to feel that bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets are working. Once you feel better, it is important to keep taking bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets exactly as directed by your healthcare provider. Call your healthcare provider if you do not feel bupropion hydrochloride extended-release (SR) tablets are working for you.

### Heroin overdose resuscitation with naloxone: patient uses own prescribed supply to save the life of a peer [^6f75e80e]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Opiate overdose is the primary cause of death among injection-drug users, representing a major public health concern worldwide. Opiate overdose can be reversed through timely administration of naloxone, and users have expressed willingness to carry the antidote for emergency use (take-home naloxone). In November 2014, new WHO guidelines identified that naloxone should be made available to anyone at risk of witnessing an overdose. We present the case of a 46-year-old man in opioid-maintenance treatment who used take-home naloxone to rescue an overdose victim. This is the first- ever account of a patient using dose titration of naloxone to restore respiratory function while minimising the risk of adverse effects. To improve the safety of take-home naloxone, the authors call for clinicians involved in the treatment of opiate users to: prescribe take-home naloxone to all patients; forewarn patients of potential side effects; and instruct patients in naloxone dose titration.

### Opioids for chronic noncancer pain: to prescribe or not to prescribe-what is the question? [^ae76db73]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The recent American Academy of Neurology position paper by Franklin, "Opioids for chronic noncancer pain", suggests that the benefits of opioid treatment are very likely to be substantially outweighed by the risks and recommends avoidance of doses above 80–120 mg/day morphine equivalent. However, close reading of the primary literature supports a different conclusion: opioids have been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to be highly effective in the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain; long-term follow-up studies have shown that this effectiveness can be maintained; and effectiveness has been limited in many clinical trials by failure to take into account high variability in dose requirements, failure to adequately treat depression, and use of suboptimal outcome measures. Frequency of side effects in many RCTs has been inflated by overly rapid dose titration and failure to appreciate the high interindividual variability in side effect profiles. The recent marked increase in incidence of opioid overdose is of grave concern, but there is good reason to believe that it has been somewhat exaggerated. Potential causes of overdose include inadequately treated depression; inadequately treated pain, particularly when compounded by hopelessness; inadvertent overdose; concurrent use of alcohol; and insufficient practitioner expertise. Effective treatment of pain can enable large numbers of patients to lead productive lives and improve quality of life. Effective alleviation of suffering associated with pain falls squarely within the physician's professional obligation. Existing scientific studies provide the basis for many improvements in pain management that can increase effectiveness and reduce risk. Many potentially useful areas of further research can be identified.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^50e8924d]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of APAP overdose

After a single‐time‐point APAP overdose, symptoms of nausea and vomiting ensue within 12–24 h, peaking at about 72 h, and resolving rapidly thereafter. The severity of necrosis is linked to the extent of excess dosing and can lead to hyperacute ALF because of its rapid onset. Administration of oral or intravenous NAC is an effective antidote, given as a loading dose followed by maintenance doses over several days. If NAC is administered within 12 h of ingestion, it virtually assures that the liver damage will be minimal. The characteristic laboratory profile of APAP hepatotoxicity includes very high aminotransferase levels with low bilirubin. The coagulopathy can be severe, and a prolonged INR is a bad prognostic sign.

Management in the early hours after an APAP overdose includes activated charcoal by ingestion or gavage, and certainly NAC, even if given more than 12 h after APAP ingestion. For unintentional cases, NAC is also given, although its efficacy may be limited. Development of signs and symptoms of liver failure (encephalopathy, primarily) are concerning, and once they are present, nearly one‐third of patients either die or require a liver transplant. The remaining patients make a full and complete recovery within 7 days.

Prognosis

Several prognostic scores have been developed and evaluated including the King's College Hospital score, Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease score, and the Acute Liver Failure Study Group prognostic index. In countries in which the over‐the‐counter sale of APAP has been restricted, the incidence of serious APAP toxicity has fallen. Outcomes have also generally improved over the past two decades, likely because of improvements in intensive care, with only 8% of patients undergoing transplantation.

Guidance statements

45 APAP is a dose‐dependent hepatotoxin that leads to acute pericentral liver injury when doses exceeding 4 g are ingested within a 24‐h period or excessive doses over several days.
46 APAP overdose is the leading cause of ALF among adults in the United States.
47 A diagnosis of APAP hepatotoxicity relies on a history of excessive APAP ingestion, detection of an elevated serum APAP level following single‐time‐point ingestion, and exclusion of competing causes of acute hepatocellular liver injury.
48 Gastric lavage and activated charcoal should be given to all patients presenting within 4 h of a single‐time‐point APAP overdose.
49 Intravenous or orally administered NAC can prevent liver injury nearly completely if given within 12 h of ingestion, but is also recommended for patients presenting later.
50 The prognosis in APAP‐related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

### The impact of marijuana policies on youth: clinical, research, and legal update [^f3c1cd4b]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Side effects and acute management of marijuana exposure — common physiologic effects include increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure; other side effects include conjunctival injection, dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension, increased appetite and thirst, drowsiness, insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, and ataxia. There is no specific antidote for intoxication; benzodiazepines may help for severe anxiety or panic, with supportive treatment for oversedation. Ischemic stroke in young people has been reported. No fatalities have been reported as solely attributable to a marijuana overdose, but in children ingestion can cause drowsiness, ataxia, nystagmus, hypothermia, and hypotonia, and respiratory depression or coma has rarely been reported. Activated charcoal may be helpful in specific severe situations if there is no concern about level of consciousness and if initiated well within 2 hours of ingestion onset, and children should not have access to medical marijuana except in unique circumstances discussed later.

### The "new" marijuana [^9067536d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Synthetic cannabinoid-induced toxicity is increasing in frequency across the US, with more than 1057 reported cases as of August 2010. There is a paucity of literature on synthetic cannabinoid toxicity; however, there are various reports of adverse effects including tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, chest pain, heart palpitations, hallucinations, racing thoughts, and seizures. While reports suggest that toxic symptoms last no longer than 3–4 hours, with no residual adverse effects in many cases, there is concern about serious acute and long-term toxicities. This article reviews the development, abuse, toxicity, treatment, and legal status of synthetic cannabinoids. It is important for health-care professionals to recognize and appropriately treat synthetic cannabinoid-induced toxicity.

### Cannabis and cannabinoids in adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^c5d8fe62]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Potential short- and long-term risks and dosing considerations — adults with cancer using cannabis and/or cannabinoids: Adverse effects were observed in a phase II study in which "participants reported sedation (19%), dizziness (10%), and disorientation (3%)", and clinicians should counsel that patients "should also be careful about stacking doses to avoid side effects (eg, dizziness, drowsiness, vertigo, hallucinations, mood changes)". With appropriate dosing and titration, these products "are well tolerated", but adults with cancer should be aware of "both common side effects (eg, dizziness, confusion, dry mouth, and fatigue) and more serious side effects (eg, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, severe confusion, and paranoia)", and "to minimize adverse effects, particularly in older adults and in those naive to cannabis and/or cannabinoids, products should be started at a low dose and slowly increased until the desired effect (eg, antiemesis) is achieved". Overdose-related considerations include that adults with cancer who ingest excessive cannabis and/or cannabinoids "are not at risk for respiratory depression as they might be with inappropriately dosed opioids", although "cannabis and/or cannabinoid overdoses can be distressing and multiple poorly controlled acute symptoms may place an individual at high risk for falls and health care utilization".

### Interactions with herbal products: what do we know? [^9db46440]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing use of herbal remedies by the general public presents several challenges to healthcare professionals who may be asked to give advice on the use of such products in conjunction with other medicines. In particular, the pharmacological properties and potential interactions of herbal products are often less well understood than those of conventional medicines, increasing the risk of adverse effects and drug interactions. In addition, good quality data on herbal medicines are often lacking. Here we highlight the problem of drug-herb interactions and consider the nature of the evidence supporting drug interactions with herbal products.

No serious unexpected side effects have resulted from studies involving megestrol acetate oral suspension administered in dosages as high as 1200 mg/day. In post-marketing experience, limited reports of overdose have been received. Signs and symptoms reported in the context of overdose included diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, cough, unsteady gait, listlessness, and chest pain. There is no specific antidote for overdose with Megace ES oral suspension. In case of overdose, appropriate supportive measures should be taken. Megestrol acetate has not been tested for dialyzability; however, due to its low solubility it is postulated that dialysis would not be an effective means of treating overdose.®

### Suzetrigine approval breaks a 25-year silence: a new era in non-opioid acute pain management [^4f9909a6]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain medications, while effective, have been associated with several drawbacks. Non-opioid analgesics, particularly NSAIDs, have been linked to gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects, including dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, peptic ulcer disease, and kidney complications such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Acetaminophen, though generally well-tolerated, has been found to cause hepatotoxicity when taken in excessive doses. Opioid analgesics, commonly prescribed for severe pain, have been associated with numerous central nervous system (CNS) side effects, including sedation, dizziness, confusion, and respiratory depression. GI-related side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation have also been prevalent. Opioids have been shown to cause urinary retention and may exacerbate conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia. Long-term opioid use may lead to tolerance, dependence, and addiction, with abrupt discontinuation resulting in withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, and flu-like symptoms. These adverse effects highlighted the need for new pain medications that are more effective and associated with fewer side effects.

In response to the escalating opioid crisis, the FDA has long supported the development of non-opioid analgesics for acute pain management as part of its Overdose Prevention Framework. On January 30, 2025, FDA approved Journavx (suzetrigine), a 50-milligram oral tablet, as the first non-opioid analgesic for treating moderate to severe acute pain in adults. This marks the approval of the first drug in this novel class in 25 years. Suzetrigine works by selectively inhibiting the Na V 1.8 sodium channel, which plays a crucial role in transmitting pain signals from peripheral nerves to the central nervous system (Figure 1). By binding to the second voltage-sensing domain (VSD2) of NaV1.8, suzetrigine stabilizes the channel in a closed state, preventing sodium influx, which would normally trigger pain signals. This targeted mechanism minimizes side effects and avoids the risks of addiction associated with opioid use, as it does not affect brain activity.

The guideline states, "Low dose therapy can be effective, with a reduction in the rate of complications, side effects, and adverse effects", particularly when combined with other modalities; dose escalation is individualized and "requires careful reassessment of pain and the risk of overdose and continued monitoring with evidence of improved patient care". It also notes, "Abuse-deterrent opioid formulations have been developed in order to decrease abuse, overuse, and overdose fatalities".

### Tasimelteon [^c7a445e9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There is limited premarketing clinical experience with the effects of an overdosage of tasimelteon. As with the management of any overdose, general symptomatic and supportive measures should be used, along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. Respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate vital signs should be monitored, and general supportive measures employed.

While hemodialysis was effective at clearing tasimelteon and the majority of its major metabolites in patients with renal impairment, it is not known if hemodialysis will effectively reduce exposure in the case of overdose.

As with the management of any overdose, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. Contact a poison control center for current information on the management of overdose.

### Functional foods and dietary supplements for the management of dyslipidaemia [^20c9889a]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidaemia is characterized by increased blood levels of total or LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, or decreased HDL cholesterol levels, and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Dyslipidaemia has a high worldwide prevalence, and many patients are turning to alternatives to pharmacotherapy to manage their lipid levels. Lifestyle modification should be emphasized in all patients to reduce cardiovascular risk and can be initiated before pharmacotherapy in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Many functional foods and natural health products have been investigated for potential lipid-lowering properties. Those with good evidence for a biochemical effect on plasma lipid levels include soy protein, green tea, plant sterols, probiotic yogurt, marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids and red yeast rice. Other products such as seaweed, berberine, hawthorn and garlic might confer some limited benefit in certain patient groups. Although none of these products can reduce lipid levels to the same extent as statins, most are safe to use in addition to other lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. Natural health products marketed at individuals with dyslipidaemia, such as policosanol, guggulsterone and resveratrol, have minimal definitive evidence of a biochemical benefit. Additional research is required in this field, which should include large, high-quality randomized controlled trials with long follow-up periods to investigate associations with cardiovascular end points.

Nefopam hydrochloride (Acupan) is a potent non-opioid analgesic widely used for the relief of moderate to severe postoperative pain. The drug is generally well tolerated, but it has a broad spectrum of side effects including tachycardia, sweating, nausea, seizures and hallucinations. When taken in overdose, nefopam has been reported to cause cardiac conduction abnormalities, cerebral oedema, fever and renal failure. The case is presented of a previously healthy 19-year-old man who presented to the emergency department in cardiac arrest following intentional nefopam overdose. It is only the fourth reported case of fatal nefopam overdose in the literature.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^fb969d21]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

### Emergent complications of the newer anticonvulsants [^6602bd27]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple new anticonvulsants have been introduced recently and they are supplanting the older medications. Whereas the older drugs have well-recognized side effects, both in typical therapeutic doses and in overdosage, the properties of the newer ones are unique and largely unknown to all but sub-specialists.

Objectives

This article gives a concise overview of the potential complications of these new medications in both therapeutic use and overdose.

Discussion

Clinically significant side effects of the new anticonvulsants, such as metabolic acidosis from topiramate, autoimmune reactions from lamotrigine, hyponatremia from oxcarbazepine, or psychosis from levitiracetam can cause serious morbidity and mortality if unrecognized. The effects of these medications in overdose are also largely unknown to most emergency physicians.

Conclusions

This article reviews the major potential side effects of the new seizure medications and the treatment of their overdoses for the practicing emergency physician.

### Should we consider the infusion of lipid emulsion in the resuscitation of poisoned patients? [^f62708ed]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Safety

Administration of ILE for its antidotal effect remains an 'off-label' indication. Much of what is known about ILE toxicity is derived from historic studies of use in parenteral nutrition situations. When administered for this indication, allergic phenomena, pancreatitis, induced bacteraemia, fat embolism, and myocardial failure are possible. Few reports of adverse events when administered in the context of life-threatening poisoning exist, with hyperamylasaemia, and adult respiratory distress syndrome being reported. Lipaemia-induced impairment in laboratory processing may hold considerable clinical significance, particularly for patients for whom laboratory data are pertinent to management, such as alkalinised tricyclic toxic patients. Early toxicity evaluation in rodents demonstrating a median lethal dose (LD50) of 67.72 ml/kg when administered as bolus therapy seemingly provides for a wide therapeutic margin. Further reporting of safety data is nevertheless required before final safety recommendations can be formalised.

### Cardiovascular effects of medical marijuana: a systematic review [^1a85eba7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Utilization of marijuana as a medicinal agent is becoming increasingly popular, and so far, 25 states have legalized it for medical purposes. However, there is emerging evidence that marijuana use can result in cardiovascular side effects, such as rhythm abnormalities, syncope/dizziness, and myocardial infarction, among others. Further, there are currently no stringent national standards or approval processes, like Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluation, in place to assess medical marijuana products. This review includes the largest up-to-date pooled population of patients with exposure to marijuana and reported cardiovascular effects. Although purported as benign by many seeking to advance the use of marijuana as an adjunctive medical therapy across the country, marijuana is associated with its own set of cardiovascular risks and deserves further definitive study and the same level of scrutiny we apply in research of all other types of medications. When used as a medicinal agent, marijuana should be regarded accordingly, and both clinical providers and patients must be aware of potential adverse effects associated with its use for early recognition and management.

### Azadirachtin poisoning: a case report [^cc4b85db]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

The use of neem-based products is widespread in the Indian Subcontinent. Neem-based pesticides obtained from neem kernels are considered natural and safe. The toxic effects of ingestion and overdose of this pesticide in adults have not been described in this literature. We report the case of a 35-year-old lady who had consumed Azadirachtin in an attempt of deliberate self-harm. The patient had features of neurotoxicity because of Azadirachtin requiring intensive medical care with mechanical ventilation. The patient survived the overdose with no long-lasting side effects of the toxin.

### Medicines associated with dependence or withdrawal: a mixed-methods public health review and national database study in england [^a16394cf]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

A fundamental principle in evidence-based clinical practice is to balance the likelihood of benefit for the patient against the risk of harms. Some medicines need to be titrated carefully (the classic example being strong opioid analgesics) and the risk of side effects, as well as any non-prescribed medication use and dependence (ie, drug use disorder) monitored and managed. In the short-term, opioids are effective for neuropathic (nerve damage), musculoskeletal, and cancer pain, but have little effectiveness for chronic non-cancer pain (pain lasting or recurring for more than 3 months). Since the mid-1990s, the incidence of fatal opioid overdoses has risen substantially in many countries.

Gabapentinoids (the γ-aminobutyric-acid [GABA] analogue medications pregabalin and gabapentin) were introduced in the late 1970s in the UK for seizure control and later for neuropathic pain, with pregabalin also introduced to treat anxiety. Early on, these medicines were known to cause reinforcing euphoria, sedation, and dissociation, but were initially believed to carry a relatively low risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Evidence now shows that when gabapentinoids are taken with opioids a dangerous respiratory depression can occur.

Benzodiazepines, which are effective for short-term treatment of severe anxiety and insomnia, also carry a risk of dependence. Prescribing in the UK (and globally) was widespread in the 1970s and 1980s, but evidence accumulated that longer-term treatment led to risks of adverse neurological effects, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. Although benzodiazepines have a relatively low toxicity profile, taking them alongside opioids increases the risk of overdose due to cumulative and synergistic effects on respiratory depression.

In the 1990s, three non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents — zopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem — were licensed in the UK for insomnia. Known as Z-drugs, these medicines were developed with the aim of preventing the over-sedation and daytime sleepiness associated with benzodiazepines, and were initially believed to carry a low risk of dependence.

Side effects of oral morphine

All opioids have similar side effects. The 'Standards, Options, and Recommendations' below relate to oral morphine.

There is wide inter- and intrapatient variation in the occurrence of side effects. The occurrence of side effects is not necessarily related to an overdose. Miosis is a sign of morphine usage, but it is not a sign of overdosage. The risk of overdose is low in patients with cancer pain, when they are followed-up and evaluated regularly and when they receive morphine continuously for a long period. Psychological dependence is rare in patients with cancer.

Tolerance and physical dependence are not problems in patients treated with oral morphine for cancer pain. The prescription should be uninterrupted. The coprescription of an opioid receptor agonist and an antagonist should be avoided to prevent physical dependence. Drowsiness occurs principally during the treatment titration phase and usually disappears within a few days. In patients with persistent or recurrent drowsiness, the presence of metabolic disorders or potentiation by other drugs should be considered (standard, expert agreement). However, if the morphine is found to be the cause, its dose should be reduced or the drug changed (rotation) (option, expert agreement). Dose reduction should be preferred if the pain is well controlled (recommendation, expert agreement).

With the exception of constipation, other side effects tend to disappear in the first few days or weeks of treatment with oral morphine. The patient should be informed about the possibility of side effects, particularly the most frequent: constipation, nausea, drowsiness (standard, expert agreement).

A laxative, to prevent constipation, should be prescribed during the treatment period and this should be associated with advice on diet and hydration (standard, expert agreement).

In patients with nausea and vomiting during treatment, other possible causes should be excluded first. If this persists, an antiemetic should be prescribed for a few days (standard, expert agreement).

There is no contraindication for the prescription of opioids in patients with asthma and/or respiratory failure (standard, expert agreement).

In patients receiving oral morphine who have resistant side effects, the options are either to change the administration route or to change the opioid (rotation, see below):
in the presence of very unstable, intense pain, preference should be given to intravenous or subcutaneous patient-controlled analgesia (option, expert agreement);
in other situations (stable and/or moderate pain), rotation and/or intravenous or subcutaneous patient-controlled analgesia are possibilities (option, expert agreement).

Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity — diagnosis and management for intentional versus unintentional overdose are contrasted by timing, dose patterns, coingestants, laboratory features, and treatments. Time course differs as "Single time point" versus "Several days of repeated use", and dosing descriptions include "Supratherapeutic (typically > 4 g over 24 h)" and "Repeated therapeutic (up to 4 g per day) or supratherapeutic dosing". Intentional cases show "24–72 h: rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L… total bilirubin is typically < 10 mg/dL" with peaks at "72–96 h", while unintentional cases are often delayed but still have a "rapid rise in ALT to > 1000 IU/L". Risk assessment states to "Use modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram to estimate risk of hepatotoxicity", whereas in repeated-use cases levels are "Often undetectable at initial presentation" and "APAP-protein adducts useful but assay not commercially available". Gastrointestinal decontamination for intentional overdose includes "Activated charcoal (1 g/kg, max dose 50 g) if within 4 h of ingestion", whereas for unintentional overdose it is "Usually not helpful nor recommended". N-acetylcysteine regimens include oral "140 mg/kg load followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h" and intravenous dosing with "150 mg/kg load over 15–60 min, followed by 50 mg/kg (12.5 mg/kg/h)… then 100 mg/kg (6.25 mg/kg/h) over 16 h (overall total 300 mg/kg over 24 h)", with continuation "at 6.25 mg/kg/h until ALT is decreasing and INR is < 2". For acute liver failure risk, the table advises "Close monitoring in intensive care unit and consider prompt referral to a liver transplant center". Coingestants differ, with "Diphenhydramine and other sedatives" in intentional cases and "Opioids often used in combination" in unintentional cases.

### Pentazocine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride (pentazocine and naloxone) [^2bcf70c0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose.

Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see OVERDOSAGE].

If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers:

How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose
To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency
To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings; Adverse Reactions].

Serotonin Syndrome

Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

Heart rhythm problems which can be serious and cause hospitalization have happened in people who take icosapent ethyl capsules, especially in people who have heart (cardiovascular) disease or diabetes with a risk factor for heart (cardiovascular) disease, or who have had heart rhythm problems in the past. Tell your doctor if you get any symptoms of heart rhythm problems such as feeling as if your heart is beating fast and irregular, lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or you faint.
Possible allergic reactions if you are allergic to fish or shellfish. Stop taking icosapent ethyl capsules and tell your doctor right away or get emergency medical help if you have any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.
Bleeding. Serious bleeding can happen in people who take icosapent ethyl capsules. Your risk of bleeding may increase if you are also taking a blood thinner medicine.

If you have liver problems and are taking icosapent ethyl capsules, your doctor should do blood tests during treatment.

The most common side effect of icosapent ethyl capsules include:

Muscle and joint pain.
Swelling of the hands, legs, or feet.
Constipation
Gout
Heart rhythm problems (atrial fibrillation).

### Digital analgesic comprising a second-generation digital health system: increasing effectiveness by optimizing the dosing and minimizing side effects [^301e40e0]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of chronic pain and loss of analgesic effects is a significant unmet need. Over 100 million individuals in the United States experience chronic pain, and approximately a quarter of them experience daily pain. Using opioid therapy for pain has increased in the past two decades. Concurrently, there is a significant increase in the misuse and abuse of prescribed opioids and inadvertent opioid overdoses. Opioid analgesics are essential therapeutic options for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) and cancer-related pain. Regular use of opioids in CNCP leads to increased all-cause mortality, thus highlighting the need for educated prescribing. Half of the patients with advanced malignancy experience chronic pain. Most subjects undergoing pharmacologic interventions do not experience the desired effect, and many develop drug tolerance or resistance.

Current regimens of opioid prescription lead to high morbidity and mortality. Abuse of opioids has a devastating influence on public health worldwide. This epidemic involves increased misuse and overdose of opioids, leading to increased mortality. Prescribers play a vital role in the ongoing opioid epidemics by overprescribing these medications. Unintentional drug overdose involving prescription opioids is increasing with marked heterogeneity in dosages. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it has become even more apparent that this at-risk group faces many challenges to recovery, including an increase in overdoses.

There are many causes of opioid dependence or lack of proper adherence to therapeutic regimens. A lack of standardization of use and the development of tolerance that leads to increasing dosages associated with increased severe side effects and risks of dependency are some of the challenges, further complicating beneficial and safe usage of opioids.

Opioids remain a vital part of the treatment regimens for chronic pain, making better methods for using them an unmet need. There remains a need for better approaches that balance treating chronic pain while minimizing risks for opioid abuse, misuse, and diversion. This paper introduces the digital analgesic, comprising an opioid or any other type of analgesic, including nerve stimulators, controlled by a second-generation digital health system to optimize the dose, reduce tolerance, and minimize side effects. The digital analgesic can overcome several of the challenges raised by the opioid epidemic, in an attempt to increase the safety and effectiveness of the use of these drugs.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^76a4041c]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Which encounter types should be included or excluded? Tyndall Snow and colleagues found that the frequency of subsequent encounters and sequelae among drug overdose codes found in any field were low among hospitalisation records across states and localities and lower among ED records. More important than the number of subsequent encounters and sequelae identified are the conceptual definitions of these encounter types and what they mean for drug poisoning incidence. According to the CMS-issued coding guidelines, subsequent encounters are 'encounters after the patient has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase'. Sequelae represent 'complications or conditions that arise as a direct result of a condition, such as scar formation after a burn'. In both cases, these visits do not represent new and acute overdose cases and will not help to approximate overdose incidence. CDC's guidance also excludes subsequent encounters and sequelae.

Which manners of injury/intent should be included or excluded? Underdosing codes make up a negligible proportion of drug T-codes, suggesting that the exclusion of these codes is unlikely to significantly affect rates. More importantly, underdosing, defined as 'taking less of a medication than is prescribed by a provider or a manufacturer's instruction', does not conceptually fit into drug overdose definitions. Adverse effect codes make up a considerable proportion of drug T-codes identified in Tyndall Snow and colleagues. The inclusion of adverse effects, which can represent clinical symptoms ranging from constipation to respiratory failure, has the potential to introduce a large number of false positives if included in the overdose definition. The exclusion of adverse effects from overdose definitions is in keeping with historical epidemiological practice, as well as conceptual definitions laid out by CMS coding guidelines. According to CMS coding guidelines, adverse effects codes should be used to describe 'an adverse effect of a drug that has been correctly prescribed and properly administered', while poisoning codes are used to describe 'a poisoning or reaction to the improper use of a medication (eg, overdose, wrong substance given or taken in error, wrong route of administration)'. The distinction between an adverse effect and an overdose does not rest on the clinical manifestation of symptoms but instead on how the drug was prescribed and administered. CDC's guidance excludes underdosing and adverse effect codes from overdose surveillance.

Motion sickness — pharmacologic countermeasures: Drugs are useful when habituation is impractical, such as single or infrequent journeys, and individuals should be advised that medication is most effective when taken before exposure rather than after symptom onset. Drug categories include antimuscarinics (e.g., scopolamine), antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate), and sympathomimetics (e.g., amphetamine), and all effective agents penetrate the blood–brain barrier and act centrally. The newer "minimally sedating" antihistamines (cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine) are not effective for treatment of motion sickness, and amphetamine or combinations of amphetamine plus scopolamine (or promethazine) are not available due to legal and drug abuse reasons. Other antiemetics such as ondansetron and granisetron are not effective against motion sickness because their sites of action are not at the central vestibular centers of the brain. Cannabis and constituents such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, but not cannabidiol (CBD), have shown anti-motion-sickness properties in animals, but controlled human trials are lacking so no firm recommendations can be made. All medications have side effects and possible specific contraindications, and the most common side effect is drowsiness or sedation.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^4af598e9]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acetaminophen overdose:

- **Definition**: Acetaminophen overdose is defined as the ingestion of a dose of acetaminophen that exceeds the recommended limit, typically > 4 g within a 24-hour period or excessive doses over several days.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acetaminophen overdose involves its action as a dose-dependent hepatotoxin, causing acute pericentral liver injury. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver, and in overdose situations, its toxic metabolite can cause hepatocellular necrosis. In some cases, renal insufficiency can also occur, attributed to cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes present in the kidney.
- **Epidemiology**: In 2021, US poison control centers recorded over 80,000 cases related to acetaminophen products. The incidence of acetaminophen overdose in Iceland is estimated at 16 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of acetaminophen overdose can include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, mental status changes. Hepatotoxicity is indicated by elevated liver enzymes, and in severe cases, it can lead to ALF, characterized by encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The severity of liver damage, as indicated by laboratory tests such as serum transaminases and coagulation profile, is a key determinant of prognosis. The prognosis in acetaminophen-related ALF is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.

### A tiered approach for the evaluation of the safety of botanicals used as dietary supplements: an industry strategy [^34ff04c5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Tier 2 — Exposure > TTC with documented history of significant human use

When the botanical ingredient used in a dietary supplement exceeds the TTC, a logical starting place in the safety assessment is determining whether a documented significant human use (SHU) exists. An SHU may be considered as a surrogate measure for safety in the absence of relevant toxicological data. However, one must consider the context of SHU relative to traditional uses. A comparison of the two is presented in Table 1. As outlined in Table 1, an SHU considers relevant information about historical use, including route of administration (e.g. oral ingestion) and a comparison of intake levels and patterns (frequency of use). A variety of resources can help confirm food uses or components of food as well as food exposure data, including Research Institute for Fragrance Materials and Flavor Extract Manufacturers Association databases and Generally Recognized as Safe and Everything Added to Food in the United States for the US Food and Drug Administration approved food uses. 15, 16, 17, 18 Additionally, a careful examination of the population that has traditionally used the botanical ingredient is also critical, including demographics, geographical location, method and purpose of use, and any associated side effects reported. 19

Table 1
Comparison between significant history of use and traditional use

A classic example of the importance of understanding traditional use of a botanical ingredient can be seen with Ephedra (ma‐huang). This Chinese shrub has been known in Traditional Chinese Medicine for at least 5,000 years. 20 The historical use of Ephedra was as a tea, taken for the treatment of respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough and congestion), with minimal reported side effects. Beginning in the 1990s in the United States, Ephedra was frequently used in weight‐loss and energy‐enhancement products taken chronically. During this same time period, serious adverse effects associated with Ephedra‐containing dietary supplements, including heart attack, stroke, seizure, high blood pressure, and heart rhythm problems were increasingly reported. Due to the serious nature of the adverse events, including several deaths in otherwise healthy individuals, the US Food and Drug Administration banned the use of Ephedra in dietary supplements in 2004. This example highlights the potential change in side effect profile that can occur when a botanical ingredient is used in a different form, indication, pattern of use, and population than its traditional use. In other words, no SHU was established for the new usage paradigm for Ephedra.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^854d5c18]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

APAP hepatotoxicity

APAP is used widely as a ubiquitous over‐the‐counter analgesic. In North America, APAP overdose is believed to result in 100,000 calls to poison control centers, 50,000 emergency room visits, and at least 500 deaths annually. The annual number of ALF cases from APAP dwarfs the number of ALF cases associated with all idiosyncratic reactions combined. The reason for this widespread toxicity is that, unlike drugs associated with idiosyncrasy, APAP is a dose‐related hepatotoxin, with all mammalian species susceptible to liver injury in doses only 2 to 3 times therapeutic dosing. Although APAP initially was noted to be a frequent cause of toxicity in attempts at self‐harm, increasing recognition of inapparent or unintentional overdosing has become apparent. Unintentional overdosing may occur in the setting of chronic pain or flu‐like symptoms because of the lack of awareness of dosing limitations and/or the simultaneous use of multiple APAP‐containing products. Other risk factors for APAP toxicity include fasting and malnutrition, which can lead to depletion of intrahepatic glutathione stores, as well as use of alcohol and other medications that can induce the cytochrome P‐450 system and lead to enhanced production of the toxic metabolite, N ‐acetyl‐p‐benzoquinone imine. Recent data suggest that APAP hepatotoxicity may occur even when therapeutic doses are used, but particularly in association with these other cofactors. Histologically, APAP toxicity is characterized by a variable degree of pericentral necrosis.

A diagnosis of APAP overdose is based on a history of ingestion of excessive doses (usually > 4 g as a single time point) that can then lead to variable severity of acute hepatocellular liver injury with towering transaminase levels (often > 1000 U/L) within the first 24 h of observation (Table 10). Measurement of a serum APAP level after a single‐time‐point ingestion can help identify the patients at greatest risk of developing liver injury. More recently, detection of serum APAP‐protein adducts has been proposed as a more specific way to diagnose APAP hepatotoxicity particularly in patients presenting late or with an unintentional overdose, but this assay is not commercially available.

### Safety issues in using complementary and alternative medicine [^2b05d253]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

A number of reports have documented the apparent increasing popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among cancer patients. Unfortunately, there are limited available published data regarding the potential toxicity of a variety of CAM strategies.

Methods

A review of the medical literature was undertaken to highlight the potential side effects of CAM.

Results

Although many CAM approaches are quite safe, both minor and major toxicities have been documented, including emesis, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiovascular events, neurologic dysfunction, hepatic and renal failure, and the development of malignant disease.

Conclusion

It is important that oncologists are aware of what nonprescription CAM medications are being taking by their patients and have a basic understanding of the potential toxicities of these agents.

### GLP-1 receptor agonist exposures are increasingly common and generally associated with mild symptoms: a single poison center experience [^c8d99ef1]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Available glucagon-like peptite-1 receptor agonists marketed in the United states (March, 2023)

Abbreviations: mg: Milligram; Tmax: Time to peak drug concentration

At therapeutic doses, gastrointestinal side effects are common for all GLP-1 RAs. Gastrointestinal symptoms developed in 56% of participants in one trial. The risk of hypoglycemia (blood sugar ≤ 70 mg/dL) is theoretically lower than other antidiabetic agents given insulin is released in a glucose-dependent manner. This low risk is further supported by clinical trial data reporting a low incidence (1–2%) of severe or major hypoglycemia, often defined as blood glucose < 56 mg/dL, hypoglycemia requiring therapeutic intervention, and/or hypoglycemia with severe symptoms. Minor hypoglycemia, which is also not universally defined by available clinical trials but typically involves symptoms of hypoglycemia in which the patient self-treated, is reported at a higher incidence of 0–15.9%. The rate of minor hypoglycemia has been shown to increase as high as 42% with concomitant sulfonylurea and/or insulin therapy.

Data regarding adverse effects of GLP-1 RAs in overdose are sparse and largely limited to case reports of intentional and supratherapeutic exposures. Published cases primarily describe gastrointestinal symptoms and episodes of relative hypoglycemia with patients receiving supportive therapies when admitted to the hospital. Currently, there is no consensus on observation time or management of patients who present after an acute overdose of a GLP-1 RA. We present a summary of GLP-1 RA exposure and overdose data obtained from a single poison center over an 18-year period.

Using the example of an HIV-positive adolescent who had been responding well to antiretroviral therapy but then experienced a sudden unexplained deterioration in her condition, we review (1) clinicians' obligation to inquire about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use when assessing, treating, and monitoring patients, (2) how clinicians' duty to warn about risks associated with treatment has evolved and expanded, and (3) patients' and parents' responsibility to disclose CAM use. It also addresses the responsibility of hospitals and health facilities to ensure that the reality of widespread CAM/NHP use is taken into account in patient care to effectively protect patients from harm.

### Herbal products and the liver: a review of adverse effects and mechanisms [^11d5bafb]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Herbal products have been used for centuries among indigenous people to treat symptoms and illnesses. Recently, their use in Western countries has grown significantly, rivaling that of prescription medications. Currently, herbal products are used mainly for weight loss and bodybuilding purposes but also to improve well-being and symptoms of chronic diseases. Many people believe that because they are natural, they must be effective and safe; however, these beliefs are erroneous. Few herbal products have been studied in well-designed controlled trials of patients with liver or other diseases, despite testimony to the contrary. Moreover, current highly effective antiviral drugs make efforts to treat hepatitis C with herbal products redundant. Herbal products are no safer than conventional drugs and have caused liver injury severe enough to require transplantation or cause death. Furthermore, their efficacy, safety, and claims are not assessed by regulatory agencies, and there is uncertainty about their reported and unreported contents. We review the history of commonly used herbal products, as well as their purported efficacies and mechanisms and their adverse effects.

### Clinical practice guideline: opioid prescribing for analgesia after common otolaryngology operations [^4d4bdd5d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Statement 9 — storage and disposal of opioids — clinicians should recommend that patients (or their caregivers) store prescribed opioids securely and dispose of unused opioids through take-back programs or another accepted method, a strong recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harms. The action statement profile highlights a quality improvement opportunity to reduce instances of accidental overdose, decrease opioid diversion, and reduce prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD); aggregate evidence quality Grade C from observational studies associating secure storage and disposal with diminished opioid misuse and diversion; level of confidence medium; benefits to reduce risk of opioid diversion, decrease risk of side effects (including overdose), and decrease risk of subsequent OUD; risk/harm/cost being cost of disposal; and a benefit–harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm.

### From cultural remedy to medical emergency: a case report of camphor toxicity in a one-year-old male patient [^60d9fa30]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Camphor (CMP) has a wide range of cultural and medicinal applications worldwide, underscoring its long-standing significance across various traditions. However, despite its widespread use, over-the-counter CMP products carry significant toxic risks, particularly in pediatric populations, where accidental poisonings have resulted in serious complications.

Early consideration of CMP exposure as a potential cause of seizures in otherwise healthy children and prompt treatment of CMP toxicity by clinicians are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Finally, further research is needed into the long-term effects of CMP toxicity, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women.

### Quality improvement programme reduces errors in oral medication preparation and administration through feeding tubes [^9388d9e4]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Another problem identified during oral medication preparation was not 'crushing and compressing to fine and homogeneous powder', due to a lack of equipment. This error on the technique may result in tube obstruction because the granules may adhere to the tube's lumen. It is essential to train nurses and provide adequate quality equipment, for the technique to be executed correctly, therefore, ensuring the patient's safety while using tubes for gavage.

Interventions on QI demand dedication and time to make the processes safe and efficient. Small PDSA cycles are recommended for testing interventions and, starting on the learning process (PDSA cycle), implementing and spreading changes in health environments. These must start at a local level, then regional, then national, to achieve our social compromise of providing safe and efficient care. An interactive learning cycle is established, for comparisons of collected data and building a knowledge which will serve as an entry point for the next cycles.

Lessons learnt

The good practice guidance for oral medication preparation and administration through NGT/NET and a printed table containing therapeutic alternatives for drugs that should never be crushed provided to prescribers at the prescribing room was pointed by the QI team as an important barrier for safe medication through NGT/NET. Before preparing and administering medications via NGT / NET, the nursing staff consults the chart to identify whether or not prescribed medications can be administered via NGT/NET. The lack of adequate equipment to crush the tablets to fine, homogeneous powder made the process worse, but the team itself recognised the need for the equipment and will be provided by the institution. Future PDSA cycles will be required to implement and test this change.

Limitations

The observation method for studying medication preparation and administration errors can influence the results because the presence of an observer may affect the nurse's behaviour at the beginning of the observations. The long-term approach helped to overcome the Hawthorne effect though, because nurses got used to being observed.

The results may not be generalisable to other departments or other hospitals because the study involved the medical ward of a general medium-sized hospital, thus the incidence of oral medication preparation and administration may be lower when compared with an intensive care unit or the medical ward of a large university hospital. Another aspect to be considered was the non-inclusion of patients and caregivers in the meetings, as they could have contributed to their perceptions about the process of drug administration by NGT/NET. Their concerns were addressed during the study period and they received information about safe medication administration.

### Geriatric trauma management [^5a5bc24f]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Medication management — opioids in older adults — Older adults are more susceptible to opioid-induced side effects, and with advancing age opioids are associated with a prolonged half-life and prolonged pharmacokinetics. Especially in opioid-naïve patients, begin with low initial doses and titrate gradually to decrease the risk of overdose. Compared with dosing for a healthy adult, decrease the initial dose by 25% in 60-year-old patients and by 50% for 80-year-old patients, while administering at the same intervals. Oral opioid administration is preferred over parenteral opioid administration.

### Tripping into the unknown: exploring the experiences of first-time LSD users through global drug survey insights [^27ac4954]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Expectations and experiences

Participants' expectations and experiences regarding the pleasurable effects and unwanted side effects of LSD were also assessed. Prior to their first-time use, respondents reported relatively high expectations of pleasure during the experience, with a mean score of 7.6 (out of 10, 10 being most positive) and standard deviation of 1.7. However, after experiencing LSD for the first time, respondents rated their actual high experiences with a slightly higher mean score of 7.8 and standard deviation of 2.1, indicating generally positive experiences. Regarding the expected severity of unwanted side effects before first-time use, respondents reported a mean score of 3.9 and standard deviation of 2.3 (out of 10, 10 being most severe). However, after the experience, the actual severity of unwanted side effects was rated lower, with a mean score of 2.9 and standard deviation of 2.3. Graphs illustrating the distribution of both positive and negative expectations and experiences are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.
Participant's expectations and experiences of using LSD. (a) Before you used LSD for the first time, how pleasurable were you expecting the experience to be while high? (b) After you used LSD for the first time, how would you rate the experience while high? (c) Before you used LSD for the first time, how bad did you expect the unwanted side effects to be? (d) After you used LSD for the first time, how bad did you expect the unwanted side effects to be?

Harm-reduction strategies

In terms of harm-reduction practices, participants were asked whether they had taken a small test dose of LSD before their first-time use. Less than a third (31.3%) of respondents indicated that they had taken a test dose, while the majority (67.5%) reported not doing so. A small proportion (1.2%) could not remember whether they had taken a test dose or not.

### Wooden chest syndrome: beware of opioid antagonists, not just agonists [^0180b5e7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In a constantly increasing world of opioid addiction, naloxone has become a topic of great discussion and use. With seemingly minimal side effects, naloxone has become one of the most wellknown and widely used reversal agents for opioid intoxication. While more common effects of using naloxone include agitation, abdominal cramps, piloerection, diarrhea, nausea, and yawning, lesser known side effects involve muscle spasms, flushing, hyperreflexia in neonates, and seizures. This case study demonstrates a side effect of rigidity secondary to IV naloxone that has not previously been documented.

Case

A 56 year old man was brought in by EMS after being found unresponsive in a car with a bag of drugs beside him. He was given 0.5 mg naloxone IV by EMS and immediately brought to the hospital. On arrival, the pt was noted to have tight rigidity of his upper extremities, with severe flexion. This presentation was not noted before the delivery of naloxone by EMS.

Conclusions

While this case highlights a patient with a rare side effect of naloxone, it reminds physicians that all medications come with a cost. Of course, ABCs remain the highest priority of resuscitation, however when administering a medication to reverse a drug overdose, it is important to keep in mind all possible consequences of said agent. Recognizing that complete muscle rigidity may remain a result of naloxone administration allows physicians to perhaps save patients from further medical workup.

### Possible unusual presentation of opioid side effect in a child: a case report [^f7b474ec]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our patient underwent cardiac surgery, after which she was maintained on the usual opioid regimen for sedation and analgesia post operatively, but her severe agitation, irritability and hysteria were pertinent since admission to the PICU. Our possible differential diagnosis were pain or suboptimal sedation and analgesia, ventilator induced agitation, LCOS, opioid side effects, opioid overdose/intoxication, OIN, withdrawal syndrome and intracranial bleeding post bypass surgery. Although her symptoms shared some similarities with OIN, they did not fully fit any of the previously mentioned differential diagnosis. The serial physical examinations, the measures and management taken, helped us excluding the possible diagnosis progressively. Finally, the complete and immediate reversal of her symptoms after naloxone administration, pointed toward a possible unusual opioid side effect. To better understand opioid related signs and symptoms, we can divide them to: opioid side effects, overdose or intoxication, OIN and withdrawal syndrome. Please refer to (Table 1) to differentiate between each category and its specific treatment. The metabolism of morphine might be influenced by cardiac surgeries due to their effect on hepatic and renal blood flow, leading to delayed clearance and accumulation of metabolites. Dagan et al. found that clearance was prolonged in children who required inotropic support as well. Our patient underwent cardiac surgery, required inotropic support for 3 days and suffered a transient AKI, all of which may have contributed to an altered metabolism of opioids. Although unusual agitation and delirium are not sure to be a side effect of opioid or an association but it still needs to be considered. In conclusion, this case highlights a possible atypical side-effect of opioids, thus the need to bring awareness about these differential diagnoses in children receiving opioids and not following an expected course during their hospital stay.

### Case report: a unique presentation of memantine overdose causing echolalia and hypertension [^772cf10c]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2020, nearly 4 million prescriptions for memantine were written, making it the 152nd most prescribed medication in the United States at that time and an increasingly prescribed medication worldwide. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that prevents overactivation of the glutamate system while allowing physiologic activity. It also exhibits antagonist activity at the serotonergic and acetylcholine receptors and reaches a maximum concentration in the body between 3 and 8 h with an elimination half-life of between 60 and 100 h. Its use has become widespread partly because unlike other NMDA receptor antagonists, it is reportedly well tolerated with few deleterious side effects. This has been reported to be due to differences in the timing of drug elimination, in transitions between blocked states of the receptor, and in the number of bound sites on NMDA receptors. Dizziness, confusion, and headaches are some of its most reported adverse effects. Our case uniquely highlights two important adverse effects in a patient who overused memantine. One is hypertension, which is commonly managed and easy to overlook as a medication side effect. It presented as hypertensive crisis in our patient. The other is echolalia, or meaningless repetitive speech. This is a sign that is usually seen in behavioural disorders or strokes, not medication overdose. To our knowledge, echolalia has not previously been published as an adverse effect of regular or overdose of this medication (Table 1).
