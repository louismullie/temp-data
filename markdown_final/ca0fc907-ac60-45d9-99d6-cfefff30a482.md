## Question

VZV lab

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about VZV laboratory testing, including when to test, which assays to choose, how to collect specimens, how to interpret results, and how to apply this in special populations and public health contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical question driving testing. Then, I should verify the optimal test modality and specimen type. Next, I will review performance characteristics and limitations of each assay. After that, I need to check interpretation nuances, including strain typing and avidity. Then, I will consider special populations and atypical presentations. Finally, I should integrate public health implications and summarize practical recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question categories because test selection hinges on them: assessing susceptibility or immunity, diagnosing acute varicella or herpes zoster, evaluating atypical or severe disease, and managing immunocompromised hosts or suspected antiviral resistance; I should also keep in mind that surveillance and outbreak investigation often require PCR confirmation and sometimes strain differentiation, so I need to ensure my plan aligns with these buckets before proceeding.

> For immunity assessment, I should confirm that VZV IgG is the appropriate test and that IgM is not useful for screening; wait, let me verify assay performance because many commercial EIAs underdetect vaccine-induced antibodies, which are lower titer than after natural infection, so a negative IgG in a vaccinated person does not reliably indicate susceptibility, and more sensitive methods like gpELISA or calibrated quantitative platforms improve detection, though they may not be universally available; in immunocompromised candidates for biologics or transplant, pre-treatment serostatus should be documented, and if history is uncertain, I should double-check with a sensitive IgG assay or plan vaccination when appropriate [^116ebQeH] [^113jiYh7] [^116tFCwj] [^1165cexG] [^115w7tW8].

> For acute disease diagnosis, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with serology; PCR is the gold standard and should be prioritized, especially for breakthrough varicella where clinical features are atypical and for herpes zoster when the diagnosis is uncertain or in atypical dermatomes; I should confirm that lesion swabs from the base of unroofed vesicles or scabs yield the highest sensitivity, and that DFA and culture are less sensitive and slower, so they should be reserved for select scenarios or when PCR is unavailable; saliva PCR can be supportive in some settings but is less reliable for zoster than for varicella, so I need to be cautious about relying on it [^114kPbjJ] [^115AteLp] [^115AiXXR] [^113fxfAE] [^113JL5ww].

> Next, I should review specimen collection technique because preanalytical steps drive diagnostic yield; I need to ensure vesicles are unroofed and the base is vigorously swabbed, avoid wooden shafts and calcium alginate tips that inhibit PCR, and collect scabs when present since they remain PCR-positive late in disease; for suspected CNS involvement, I should obtain CSF promptly for PCR and consider paired serum for intrathecal antibody synthesis; for ocular disease, I should send intraocular fluid for validated NAATs where available; for disseminated disease without rash, blood PCR can be informative, though I should interpret low-level viremia cautiously [^117LXLCy] [^114kPbjJ] [^113C9C9c] [^115SdVX1].

> I will now examine assay performance to avoid over- or under-calling results; real-time PCR on lesion swabs is highly sensitive and specific, with studies showing near-perfect agreement with composite references and marked superiority to culture and DFA; multiplex NAATs that include HSV and VZV increase detection of unsuspected cases and are preferred over DFA; rapid isothermal methods like LAMP can be useful where PCR is not available, but I should confirm their lower sensitivity, especially for breakthrough disease; for serology, I should remember that IgM is nonspecific and not recommended for acute diagnosis, and that avidity testing can help distinguish primary from reactivation when IgM is present, though it is rarely needed in routine practice [^113m5VrU] [^113fxfAE] [^115cuSX8] [^114kPbjJ] [^115AteLp].

> Let me think about interpretation next; a positive lesion PCR confirms VZV and should prompt appropriate antiviral therapy, whereas a negative early PCR does not exclude infection, so if suspicion remains high, I should repeat testing or obtain convalescent serology in 2–3 weeks; in vaccinated patients with suspected breakthrough varicella, I should request strain typing when available to distinguish wild-type from vaccine-type virus; in immunocompromised hosts, I should maintain a low threshold for blood PCR and early IV acyclovir given the risk of dissemination; for CNS disease, I should integrate CSF PCR with clinical and imaging findings and consider empiric acyclovir when suspicion is high, recognizing that anti-VZV IgG in CSF has the highest serologic sensitivity for vasculopathy but PCR can be negative early [^114kPbjJ] [^115GMjY2] [^111hnqoR] [^113c874T] [^114yWMVx].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or there is no rash; I should double-check for VZV in syndromes like zoster sine herpete, facial palsy, or stroke, where CSF PCR and intrathecal antibody can be decisive, and consider oropharyngeal swabs or saliva PCR when lesions are absent; I need to ensure I do not anchor on HSV in genital or perioral lesions, as VZV can mimic HSV and is detected in a meaningful minority of cases; in outbreaks or clusters, I should coordinate with public health for PCR confirmation and, when relevant, strain genotyping to support epidemiologic links [^112rwXUk] [^113JL5ww] [^111UGq64] [^116KTdWy].

> I should confirm special population nuances; in transplant candidates and recipients, pre-transplant serostatus guides prevention, and any acute eruption warrants lesion PCR with a low threshold for disseminated disease workup; in children with HIV or other immunocompromised states, PCR from lesions, blood, or CSF is preferred and serology has limited diagnostic value; in patients starting biologics or anti-TNF therapy, I need to verify immunity with sensitive IgG assays and vaccinate if nonimmune when safe; in pregnancy, I should avoid routine screening and rely on exposure risk stratification and post-exposure prophylaxis protocols rather than serologic testing for acute infection [^115w7tW8] [^113c874T] [^113TAjnu] [^1165cexG].

> Hold on, I should verify public health and surveillance implications; case definitions increasingly require laboratory confirmation, and expanded access to PCR has measurably increased confirmation rates and improved management of suspect cases; when PCR is not locally available, state public health laboratories or CDC can provide testing, including strain differentiation; I need to ensure timely reporting and specimen submission to support outbreak control and vaccine effectiveness evaluations [^116KTdWy] [^111BPRsv] [^115GMjY2].

> Let me reconsider and summarize practical recommendations to ensure internal consistency: use IgG to assess immunity when needed, recognizing assay limitations in vaccinated persons; use PCR on lesion swabs or scabs to diagnose acute infection, reserving DFA or culture for constrained settings; expand specimen types to CSF, blood, or saliva based on clinical syndrome; interpret negative early results cautiously and repeat or add convalescent serology if suspicion persists; request strain typing in breakthrough cases when available; and integrate clinical context, especially in immunocompromised hosts and atypical presentations, to avoid misclassification and delays in therapy [^114kPbjJ] [^115GMjY2] [^115AiXXR].

VZV laboratory testing relies on **PCR as the gold standard** for diagnosing active infection, with high sensitivity and specificity across lesion, blood, and CSF specimens [^114kPbjJ] [^113TAjnu]. Serology (IgG/IgM) is used for **immunity assessment and retrospective diagnosis**, not for acute infection [^116ebQeH] [^114kPbjJ]. For optimal PCR yield, collect lesion swabs or scabs at the vesicle base [^117LXLCy]; use CSF for CNS disease and blood for disseminated infection [^114kPbjJ] [^115fjkK2]. Rapid molecular assays enable same-day results, whereas culture is slow and insensitive [^115AteLp] [^114kPbjJ] [^111mtufz]. In immunocompromised patients, PCR is essential for early detection and management [^113c874T].

---

## Clinical indications for VZV laboratory testing

VZV testing is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Suspected active infection**: Atypical or severe varicella/zoster, breakthrough varicella, or immunocompromised hosts [^113c874T] [^115GMjY2].

- **Neurological complications**: Encephalitis, meningitis, or vasculopathy, including zoster sine herpete [^114yWMVx] [^115WDZHw].

- **Immunity assessment**: Pre-transplant, pre-biologic therapy, or occupational health screening [^115w7tW8] [^1165cexG].

- **Outbreak investigation**: Confirm cases and distinguish wild-type from vaccine-strain virus [^116KTdWy] [^115GMjY2].

---

## Specimen types and collection methods

| **Specimen type** | **Indication** | **Collection method** |
|-|-|-|
| Lesion swab/scraping | Acute varicella/zoster | - Unroof vesicle <br/> - Swab base vigorously <br/> - Use polyester swab [^117LXLCy] |
| Blood (plasma/serum) | Disseminated infection or immunocompromised patients | Collect in EDTA or serum separator tube [^notfound] |
| Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) | Neurological complications | Lumbar puncture [^114yWMVx] |
| Saliva/oropharyngeal swab | Non-invasive alternative or when lesions are inaccessible | Swab or saliva collection device [^113JL5ww] [^112rwXUk] |

---

## Laboratory methods for VZV detection

### Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

- **Gold standard**: High sensitivity/specificity; detects VZV DNA in lesions, blood, and CSF [^114kPbjJ] [^113m5VrU].

- **Rapid turnaround**: Results within hours; enables timely antiviral therapy [^113WiocE].

- **Strain differentiation**: Wild-type vs vaccine-strain detection [^111Y65zd].

---

### Serological assays

- **IgG testing**: Indicates past infection/vaccination; used for immunity assessment [^116ebQeH].

- **IgM testing**: Suggests recent infection but is nonspecific; not recommended for acute diagnosis [^114kPbjJ].

- **Limitations**: False positives/negatives; not reliable in immunocompromised patients [^113CsNwH] [^113GjtoX].

---

### Viral culture

Viral culture has **low sensitivity** and slow growth (5–14 days), making it less useful for acute management [^111mtufz]. It is mainly used for **research or epidemiology**, not routine diagnosis [^1129g4BK].

---

### Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining

Direct fluorescent antibody staining offers **rapid results** but has **limited sensitivity** compared with PCR [^113fxfAE]. It is not recommended for routine diagnosis [^115AteLp].

---

## Interpretation of laboratory results

| **Test** | **Positive result** | **Negative result** |
|-|-|-|
| PCR | Confirms active VZV infection | Does not exclude early/late infection; repeat if suspicion remains [^115AiXXR] |
| IgG | Prior infection/vaccination; immunity likely | Susceptible if no history/vaccination |
| IgM | Recent infection possible but nonspecific | Does not exclude infection; interpret cautiously [^114kPbjJ] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Assay variability**: Differences in sensitivity/specificity among platforms [^113jiYh7].

- **Specimen quality**: Improper collection reduces PCR yield [^114kPbjJ].

- **Immunocompromised hosts**: Atypical presentations and delayed seroconversion complicate diagnosis [^113GjtoX].

- **Coinfections**: HSV/VZV overlap can mislead clinical diagnosis [^113fxfAE].

---

## Recent advances and emerging technologies

- **Digital PCR**: Higher sensitivity for low-level VZV DNA detection [^notfound].

- **Multiplex assays**: Simultaneous HSV/VZV detection and differentiation [^113fxfAE].

- **Point-of-care LAMP**: Rapid, low-resource molecular testing under evaluation [^115cuSX8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **PCR preferred**: For acute infection, neurological complications, and immunocompromised patients [^114kPbjJ] [^113c874T].

- **Serology for immunity**: Pre-transplant, occupational health, and retrospective diagnosis [^115w7tW8] [^113CsNwH].

- **Avoid IgM for acute diagnosis**: Due to poor specificity and false positives [^114kPbjJ].

---

VZV laboratory testing centers on **PCR for acute infection** and serology for immunity, with assay selection and specimen quality critical to accuracy. Recent molecular advances improve sensitivity and speed, supporting timely diagnosis and management.

### Varicella-zoster virus testing in clinical practice in the U.S., 2016–2023 [^1121dVW7]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Varicella-zoster virus testing is increasingly needed for assessing immunity and diagnosis in the varicella vaccination era. Varicella-zoster virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) is recommended when assessing immunity; real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is recommended for varicella or herpes zoster diagnosis. The study objective was to describe varicella-zoster virus serologic and virologic testing in U.S. clinical practice.

Methods

Patients with serologic (IgG, immunoglobulin M [IgM]) or virologic (PCR, culture) varicella-zoster virus testing were identified in five administrative data sources (∼11–100 million enrollees; 2016–2023). Descriptive analyses were used to examine varicella-zoster virus testing frequency, patient characteristics, and rates by test type. The top 20 diagnostic codes associated with varicella-zoster test type were used as a proxy for reason for testing.

Results

Across data sources, the highest proportion of varicella-zoster virus testing was for IgG (43%-92%); most was in females (79%-82%) and those aged 20–39 years (62%-70%). Rates of serologic testing were 50–60/10,000 persons. Frequency of varicella-zoster virologic testing was considerably lower; PCR testing rates were ∼1/10,000 persons. Diagnostic codes associated with IgG or virologic testing were primarily categorized as routine care or acute illness, respectively. IgM testing was up to 11% of tests, despite not being recommended for screening or diagnostic purposes.

Conclusions

Varicella-zoster virus serologic testing rates were 50–60 times higher than PCR. Serologic testing was more common among females and young adults, likely due to screening. Most varicella-zoster virus testing appeared relevant to clinical management; however, inappropriate IgM testing was identified. Appropriate testing is important to guide clinical and public health management for varicella and herpes zoster.

### Use and limitations of varicella-zoster virus-specific serological testing to evaluate breakthrough disease in vaccinees and to screen for susceptibility to varicella [^116ebQeH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A plethora of tests for determining the presence of antibodies to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have been developed over the years, with a wide range of performance standards. There is general agreement that the presence of VZV antibodies in serum indicates immunity to varicella and protection from chickenpox, although the role of specific antibody in mediating protection remains unclear. Both antibodies and cellular immunity probably interact to mediate immunity to the virus. In any case, VZV-specific serum antibody is a useful indicator of protection against chickenpox in patients and persons at high risk of exposure, whether they have been immunized or naturally infected. Serological tests are also a useful implement for evaluating the length of time that immunity to varicella persists after vaccination and whether waning of vaccine-induced immunity occurs. The purpose of this review is to contrast the strengths and weaknesses of currently available VZV antibody assays. Although several of these methods are useful for various specific applications, simpler and more accurate tests to measure antibodies to VZV are a high priority for future research and development.

Summary

The U.S. varicella vaccination program, implemented in 1995, led to a > 97% decline in varicella incidence. Clinical diagnosis continues to be the primary means for diagnosing varicella, although the modified signs and symptoms of disease (fewer skin lesions, mostly maculopapular) occurring in persons who have received varicella vaccine pose diagnostic challenges. Laboratory confirmation of varicella is increasingly necessary to guide clinical and public health management, understand varicella epidemiology, and evaluate vaccine effectiveness. In June 2023, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists updated its varicella position statement to increase the specificity of confirmed varicella cases by including only cases with positive laboratory results or cases that have an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed varicella case or to a person with herpes zoster.

### Assessment of varicella surveillance and outbreak control practices-United States, 2012 [^113CcRzt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

National varicella surveillance data are important for monitoring trends in varicella epidemiology. In 2002, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists recommended that varicella be added to the list of nationally notifiable conditions by 2003 and that all states move to case-based reporting for varicella by 2005.

What is added by this report?

As of 2012, varicella has been a reportable condition in 44 of 51 jurisdictions; 38 jurisdictions were conducting statewide or sentinel site case-based surveillance for varicella. However, only 19 jurisdictions had the capability to send varicella-specific data to CDC through Health Level 7 electronic messaging. Among the 51 jurisdictions, 80.4% had the laboratory capacity to test specimens for varicella, and 60.8% of jurisdictions had guidelines for outbreak control. Additionally, all jurisdictions except one had either a 1-dose or 2-dose varicella vaccine school entry requirement.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Continued work by jurisdictions to collect and improve completeness of reporting of all relevant clinical and epidemiologic data, disease severity and outcomes, and vaccination status, along with full implementation of Health Level 7 systems to allow jurisdictions to send their varicella-specific data to CDC will be useful for continued monitoring of the varicella vaccination program and guiding future varicella vaccination policy.

As the varicella vaccination program matures and more cases occur among vaccinated persons, laboratory confirmation is increasingly necessary. Diagnosis of breakthrough disease (i.e. varicella in vaccinated persons) is challenging because disease is often mild and might resemble other rash illnesses or insect bites. PCR testing of lesion specimens has been shown to be the most sensitive and specific for diagnosing varicella. With the majority of jurisdictions now able to perform laboratory testing for varicella, laboratory confirmation of varicella cases is increasingly feasible and will improve the accuracy of surveillance data. A real-time PCR method was deployed to all state laboratories in 2002 for ruling out smallpox in suspected cases of bioterrorism. The permissible uses for this assay have now been expanded to include confirmation of varicella outbreaks and verification of suspected cases of severe varicella. Vaccine-preventable disease reference centers also are available in the state public health laboratories of Wisconsin, New York, Minnesota, and California for varicella-zoster virus PCR testing, discriminating between vaccine and wild-type strains, and varicella-zoster virus genotyping.

### Evaluation of laboratory methods for diagnosis of varicella [^115AiXXR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of varicella disease is declining as a result of vaccination, making clinical diagnosis more challenging, particularly for vaccine-modified cases. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of laboratory tests and specimen types to assess diagnostic performance and determine what role testing can play after skin lesions have resolved.

Methods

We enrolled patients with suspected varicella disease in 2 communities. Enrollees were visited at the time of rash onset and 2 weeks later. Multiple skin lesion, oral, urine, and blood or serum specimens were requested at each visit and tested for varicella zoster virus (VZV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA antibody by enzyme-linked immunoassay; for VZV antigen by direct fluorescent antibody; and/or for VZV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinical certainty of the diagnosis of varicella disease was scored. PCR results from first-visit vesicles or scab specimens served as the gold standard in assessing test performance.

Results

Of 93 enrollees, 53 were confirmed to have varicella disease. Among 20 unmodified cases, PCR testing was 95%-100% sensitive for macular and/or papular lesions and for oral specimens collected at the first visit; most specimens from the second visit yielded negative results. Among 27 vaccine-modified cases, macular and/or papular lesions collected at the first visit were also 100% sensitive; yields from other specimens were poorer, and few specimens from the second visit tested positive. Clinical diagnosis was 100% and 85% sensitive for diagnosing unmodified and vaccine-modified varicella cases, respectively.

Conclusions

PCR testing of skin lesion specimens remains convenient and accurate for diagnosing varicella disease in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. PCR of oral specimens can sometimes aid in diagnosis of varicella disease, even after rash resolves.

### Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection [^114oC6yP]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by VZV, the virus that causes chickenpox and herpes zoster, usually are diagnosed by the classic clinical presentations. In immunocompromised patients, however, the atypical presentation can make the diagnosis more challenging. Although varicella typically follows an uncomplicated course in children, adults and immunocompromised patients can develop complications involving several organs; some complications may be fatal. Prevention of disease with the vaccine is ideal. When varicella or zoster infection does occur, proper treatment should be initiated, depending on the age and immune status of the patient.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^113bz6At]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Highlights

- Varicella zoster virus reactivation causes serum antibody boosting.
- Antibody titres at 1, 3 and 6 months following zoster diagnosis reflect baseline varicella zoster virus load.
- Antibody titres could discriminate patients post shingles from healthy blood donors, 1–6 months after shingles. However, to achieve a sensitivity of 80%, the specificity is between 55 and 70%, whilst to achieve 80% specificity, the sensitivity is between 35 and 70%.

### Multicenter evaluation of the simplexa VZV direct assay for detection of varicella-zoster virus in cerebrospinal fluid and lesion-swab specimens [^113m5VrU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the etiologic agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles) infections commonly involving skin, mucous membranes, and less frequently the central nervous system. Traditional methods for the laboratory diagnosis of these infections are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often insensitive. As such, these tests are being replaced by more sensitive and rapid molecular methods. This study evaluated the performance of two different molecular assays, the Simplexa VZV Direct and Simplexa VZV Swab Direct, to detect VZV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lesion-swab specimens, respectively. The Simplexa VZV Direct and Simplexa VZV Swab Direct assays were compared against individual composite reference methods that varied depending on the sample cohort examined. A total of 883 CSF and 452 cutaneous and mucocutaneous prospective, retrospective, and contrived specimens were evaluated in this multicenter study. The results of this study showed that the Simplexa assays demonstrated near perfect agreement (k = 0.98) compared to the composite reference methods for the detection of VZV in CSF and lesion swab specimens. A further comparison between the standard of care molecular assays employed at the site of specimen collection and the Simplexa assays demonstrated excellent agreement (k = 1.0). The Simplexa assays offer rapid and reliable alternatives for the detection of VZV in certain clinical specimens without the need for nucleic acid extraction.

### Laboratory diagnosis of breakthrough varicella in children [^114ThVBf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Breakthrough varicella (BV) develops in vaccinated persons as a result of infection by wild-type varicella-zoster virus more than 42 days after varicella vaccination. The clinical symptoms are atypical, and clinical diagnosis can be difficult. We investigated laboratory-based diagnostic methods that are relatively simple and highly precise to conduct accurate surveillance.

Subjects and Methods

We enrolled 42 patients with suspected BV at 2 pediatric hospitals and performed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the skin lesions to confirm the BV diagnosis. We performed PCR on saliva and blood collected during the acute phase, as well as direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) imaging on lesions, and measured varicella-zoster virus immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM during the acute and convalescent phases.

Results

We confirmed the BV diagnosis in 31 of 42 enrolled patients. The sensitivity of DFA imaging of the lesion, and PCR of saliva and blood were 93.5%, 87.1% and 61.3%, respectively. IgM was detected in 12.9% of patients during the acute phase and in 65.5% during the convalescent phase. IgG increased more than 4-fold in 86.2% of patients between the acute and convalescent phases. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 83.9% and 81.8%, respectively, when the diagnostic criteria for IgG were set to greater than 20 during the acute phase.

Conclusions

The gold standard of laboratory-based diagnosis of BV has been the PCR of samples taken from lesions. However, DFA of the lesion showed equivalent sensitivity when compared with PCR. PCR using saliva samples is an effective, noninvasive method of diagnosis. We found that high values of IgG during the acute phase can aid in the diagnosis of BV.

### Calibration and evaluation of quantitative antibody titers for varicella-zoster virus by use of the bioPlex 2200 [^113jiYh7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most commercially available enzyme immunoassay-based methods have limited sensitivity to detect antibody responses to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in vaccinated individuals, who produce lower antibody levels than those with natural infection. However, more sensitive methods are either not commercially available or less amenable to high-throughput testing.

### Neurological complications of varicella zoster virus reactivation [^115WDZHw]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation results in zoster, which may be complicated by postherpetic neuralgia, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, and VZV vasculopathy. This review highlights the clinical features, laboratory abnormalities, imaging changes, and optimal treatment of each of those conditions. Because all of these neurological disorders produced by VZV reactivation can occur in the absence of rash, the virological tests proving that VZV caused disease are discussed.

Recent Findings

After primary infection, VZV becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. With a decline in VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity, VZV reactivates from ganglia and travels anterograde to the skin to cause zoster, which is often complicated by postherpetic neuralgia. VZV can also travel retrograde to produce meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and stroke. When these complications occur without rash, VZV-induced disease can be diagnosed by detection of VZV DNA or anti-VZV antibody in cerebrospinal fluid and treated with intravenous acyclovir.

Summary

Awareness of the expanding spectrum of neurological complications caused by VZV reactivation with and without rash will improve diagnosis and treatment.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^114kPbjJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) laboratory diagnosis emphasizes nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from lesion material and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); Evaluation for VZV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies is not recommended as a means to establish recent or acute infection; NAAT or culture is preferred. For dermal lesions, a culture transport swab should be vigorously rubbed on the base of the suspect skin lesion; the vesicle should be unroofed to expose the base, and the swab should then be placed in viral transport media and transported to the testing laboratory. Optimal handling from Table 57 includes Viral transport mediuma, RT, ≤ 24 h; Clot or SST tube, RT, ≤ 2 h; and Place in sterile container, RT, ≤ 24 h. When early serology is negative, negative results in suspected early VZV infection should be followed by testing a new serum specimen in 2–3 weeks. Culture may be slow, as it may take up to 14 days for cytopathic effect to be observed. VZV NAATs can be performed on CSF as an aid to the diagnosis of VZV central nervous system infection; CSF IgM can support meningoencephalitis but, if performed, should be completed alongside the evaluation of anti-VZV levels in serum and NAAT in CSF. A less sensitive method for diagnosis is detection of viral antigens by direct fluorescent antibody stain of lesion scrapings. Collection cautions include M4 or M5 media acceptable; do not use calcium alginate-tipped swab; swab with wood shaft, or transport swab containing gel due to inhibition of polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

### Laboratory diagnosis and characteristics of breakthrough varicella in children [^115eYhuq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The atypical features of varicella in vaccinated persons (breakthrough varicella [BTV]) present diagnostic challenges. We examined varicella-zoster virus (VZV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG serologic test results for confirming BTV cases. Among 33 vaccinated children with varicella-like rash, we identified wild-type VZV in 58% overall and in 76% of those with adequate tissue specimens; no vaccine-type virus was found. Of the 12 subjects with PCR-confirmed BTV and acute-phase serum samples, 9 had detectable IgM, and all had highly elevated acute-phase IgG titers. Six subjects with negative PCR results had lower IgG titers and negative IgM results. Although PCR is the preferred method for laboratory confirmation of BTV, a positive serum varicella IgM test result should also be considered to be diagnostic in a suspected BTV case; however, a negative IgM test result cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis. The value of highly elevated IgG titers needs further evaluation. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^116xkf6j]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

1 Background

Primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox, following which the virus establishes latency. It reactivates in up to 25% of individuals to cause the painful dermatomal rash known as shingles (herpes zoster). During chickenpox or shingles, viral DNA is detectable in skin lesions, blood and saliva. Viral replication is accompanied by boosting of VZV antibodies consistent with antigenic, or endogenous, boosting. Few data exist, however, confirming the relationship between viral load and antibody titres during, and following, acute clinical VZV disease.

The extent to which the presence of persisting viral DNA in blood or saliva indicates active viral replication likely to induce an immune response is also unclear. Immunocompetent children with chickenpox clear viral DNA rapidly so that it is no longer detectable two weeks after the rash has healed. In contrast, VZV DNA has been detected in blood for up to 6 months following shingles, albeit with falling loads. Asymptomatic shedding of VZV in saliva occurs more frequently in individuals who are immune disadvantaged. Better understanding of the spectrum of VZV reactivation is needed to inform use of biological markers of VZV reactivation in research.

Immune Responses to VZV

Immune responses to VZV after either varicella or immunization include development of both antibodies and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. Measurement of antibody titers in clinical laboratories require small amounts of blood and can be automated. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests are most commonly utilized but have poor sensitivity and are not as accurate as the FAMA test (which has not yet been automated) for assessing protective immunity to varicella after vaccination. The presence of antibodies in blood may play some role in preventing second attacks of varicella, although patients with agammaglobulinemia do not usually have second episodes of this disease. Antibodies, however, do not seem to play a role in recovery from VZV infection. Antibodies tend, nevertheless, to persist for the lifetime of an individual and are usually present in the blood when patients develop zoster. VZV is highly cell associated; antibodies cannot penetrate the infected cells and destroy the virions. Cellular immunity, which is directed against VZV-infected cells, is crucial for recovery from varicella and also for prevention of and recovery from zoster.

CMI to VZV is mediated by T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Testing for CMI to VZV is very complicated. Lymphocytes are needed so large amounts of blood are required. Many complicated steps are involved, the reagents are expensive, and the procedure takes several days, so this testing can only be performed in research laboratories. CMI to VZV decreases with age, especially after age 50; this decline is thought to be the reason that older individuals (in addition to immunocompromised patients) have a high incidence of zoster. Increasing CMI to VZV is the goal of zoster vaccines. Protective levels of CMI required to prevent zoster have not been determined.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for psoriasis, more specifically with respect to screening for viral infections, BAD 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain VZV antibody in patients with a negative or uncertain history of chickenpox before starting biologic therapy. Consider giving varicella vaccination before starting biologic therapy in varicella non-immune patients and seek expert advice. Be aware of the indications of post-exposure prophylaxis with varicella zoster immunoglobulin or oral aciclovir/valaciclovir in varicella zoster-susceptible patients taking biologics.

Preliminary Conclusions and Actions

These findings suggest that the clinical diagnosis of varicella can be unreliable, especially in vaccinated patients, and underscore the importance of laboratory confirmation of varicella. PCR testing of appropriately collected skin lesion specimens has demonstrated high reliability in detection of VZV in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Because recommended clinical and public health management of varicella differs from that of other rash illnesses, not performing testing can result in nonrecommended clinical management of suspected varicella cases and exposed contacts, as well as incorrect recommendations regarding the need for exclusion from school or work. Education and engagement with health care providers, partnership development and maintenance with schools and child care facilities, and opportunities for free testing and at-home specimen collection might have contributed to an increase in varicella testing and confirmation rates in Minnesota. This increase in varicella testing likely also contributed to an increase in appropriate clinical management and school exclusion recommendations for suspect varicella cases.

Genital lesions — pediatric and pregnancy considerations for VZV and mpox are noted as follows: In children presenting with genital lesions, providers should not assume HSV as the only etiology and should consider potential atypical presentations of herpes zoster virus (VZV) or even mpox depending on clinical and family history or exposure. FDA-cleared VZV NAATs are limited, but several reference laboratories offer these tests or LDT NAATs. Pregnant patients with a history of genital herpes should be assessed for active lesions at the time of delivery but screening with molecular assays is not appropriate.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) diagnosis in children with HIV — test performance and specimen options are summarized. VZV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing a VZV infection and can provide an etiologic diagnosis within 24 to 48 hours; in addition to lesion specimens (vesicular fluid or scabs), PCR can be applied to blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and pharyngeal and conjunctival swabs. Direct immunofluorescence for VZV antigen has only a 3-hour turnaround time but is significantly less sensitive, detecting < 75% of infections, while culture shows typical cytopathic effect only after 5 to 7 days and the shell vial method requires at least 48 hours and is less sensitive than PCR. PCR results are positive if scabs are used late in illness, PCR is critical for evaluating atypical presentations of HZ, and serologic tests are of little value in diagnosing active VZV infection in children either with or without HIV.

### Varicella-zoster virus and virus DNA in the blood and oropharynx of people with latent or active varicella-zoster virus infections [^1148Zabi]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can be detected in the blood from approximately 5 days before to 4 days after varicella. VZV DNA, primarily in T-lymphocytes, is detected as early as 8–10 days prior to rash and can persist for a week. The duration and magnitude of VZV DNAemia correlates with immune status and the efficacy of antiviral therapy. VZV DNA is also readily detected in the oropharynx just prior to rash and for 1–2 weeks thereafter. Detection of VZV DNA in blood and saliva has been useful for diagnosis and prognosis in atypical cases of varicella. Herpes zoster (HZ) is also characterized by VZV DNAemia at onset and for many weeks thereafter, and VZV DNA is present in the oropharynx shortly after HZ onset. Detection of VZV DNA in blood and saliva facilitates the diagnosis of zoster sine herpete and other atypical manifestations of VZV reactivation, such as neurologic syndromes when cerebrospinal fluid is not available, Bell's palsy, and atypical pain syndromes. VZV DNA is sometimes present in the blood and saliva of asymptomatic individuals. In total these observations extend understanding of the pathophysiology and epidemiology of VZV, and increasingly contribute to the clinical management of VZV infections.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) diagnosis in HIV — Varicella and herpes zoster are typically distinctive in appearance and can usually be clinically diagnosed, and varicella can also be diagnosed retrospectively by documenting seroconversion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) from antibody negative to positive. In immunocompromised persons, distinguishing varicella from disseminated herpes zoster may be aided by a history of VZV exposure, a rash that began with a dermatomal pattern, and VZV serologic testing to assess prior infection. When lesions are atypical or difficult to distinguish, swabs of vesicular fluid from a fresh lesion or tissue biopsies can be submitted for viral culture, direct fluorescent antigen testing, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and scabs may be adequate specimens for PCR testing. PCR of lesions is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of VZV infections, and histopathology and PCR of blood or fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or vitreous humor can aid with diagnosis of VZV infections of visceral organs including pneumonitis, encephalitis, and retinitis.

Public Health Intervention

In December 2016, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) established expanded laboratory testing for confirmation of varicella in Minnesota. A multipronged approach was used to promote testing. MDH implemented outreach to health care providers via newsletters, health advisories, webinars, and conferences describing the importance of laboratory testing for rash illnesses suspected to be varicella, the preferred testing method, and availability of free testing at MDH Public Health Laboratory (MDH-PHL). In addition, MDH implemented direct follow-up when needed with individual providers related to testing practices and provided specimen collection kits (containing a swab for collection of vesicular fluid and slides for collection of scabs or scraping of maculopapular lesions) to clinics interested in partnering with MDH-PHL. Through funding from CDC's Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity Cooperative Agreement, MDH-PHL provided free testing for persons with suspected varicella, including clinically diagnosed, school- or child care–reported, and self-diagnosed cases. MDH-PHL performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and enterovirus on all specimens received by MDH-PHL.

MDH also offered specimen collection kits directly to persons with suspected varicella identified through Minnesota's varicella case-based surveillance, allowing free access to testing across the state. Kits were also available to families through partnerships with schools and child care facilities. Lastly, MDH provided notification letters for families of children exposed to varicella, containing testing information to share with their providers. MDH describes the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed VZV, enterovirus, HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections among suspect varicella cases. SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for statistical analyses. This activity meets the regulatory definition of Public Health Surveillance as it seeks to improve varicella surveillance in Minnesota by way of PCR testing. * This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. †

### Laboratory characteristics of suspected herpes zoster in vaccinated children [^111c6g8R]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Varicella vaccination of children has decreased varicella disease incidence, but introduced the occurrence of herpes zoster (HZ) from vaccine-type virus. We identified 14 vaccinated children with suspected HZ and confirmed varicella virus by polymerase chain reaction in 6 cases. Two cases were due to vaccine-type virus. Serum varicella IgM and IgG were not useful for diagnosis of HZ among vaccinated children.

### The optimization and validation of the glycoprotein ELISA assay for quantitative varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody detection [^115E1mHK]. Journal of Medical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Varicella is a highly contagious viral disease found throughout the world. A live-attenuated Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (Oka/Merck strain), VARIVAXtrade mark, was licensed in the United States (US) in 1995 and was made a part of the US recommended childhood vaccination schedule in 1996. The immune response to VZV-containing vaccines has been measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies to glycoproteins from VZV. A correlate for protective immunity has been established between anti-VZV glycoprotein antibody levels and protection against breakthrough varicella in children, and this correlate is used as the primary immunogenicity endpoint in clinical trials with VZV-containing vaccines. The performance of the "first generation" validated version of the assay was recently reevaluated in order to identify areas for improvement. Specific format and reagent changes were implemented, with the goal of improving assay consistency by maintaining tighter control over assay processes and reagents. An extensive validation of the "second generation" gpELISA was undertaken in order to characterize the updated assay. In this article, we describe the gpELISA method, detail the procedures used to evaluate assay performance, and present the operating characteristics of the second generation gpELISA.

### Varicella-zoster virus infections of the central nervous system-prognosis, diagnostics and treatment [^116YuX3k]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Both varicella and herpes zoster that are caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), are associated with central nervous system disease. Since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction, the opportunity to detect the virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has improved dramatically. As a result VZV is diagnosed as one of the most common viruses causing CNS disease and it has become evident that this disease includes a wide spectrum of different CNS manifestations. The most evaluated CNS manifestations are encephalitis which is associated with both varicella and herpes zoster and, cerebellitis which occurs predominantly in children with varicella. Other manifestations have been less widely investigated. The incidence of cerebrovascular disease caused by VZV has been only scarcely studied and, in addition, some data indicate that vasculitis might also be involved in other VZV CNS manifestations such as herpes zoster-associated encephalitis. For this reason, VZV CNS infection must be suspected in several CNS syndromes and diagnostics should be based on CSF analysis for detection of VZV DNA by PCR and/or intrathecal antibody production. The prognosis is reported as favourable in children but few follow-up studies are available. Moreover, in adults, the prognosis is reported to be good in overall terms, but later studies indicate more serious neurological sequelae including cognition. Despite considerable mortality and morbidity, so far also in vaccinating countries, few treatment studies are available. Further treatment studies including assessments of neurological and cognitive sequelae, are warranted.

### Varicella zoster virus infection [^1122KzPq]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), which can be severe in immunocompromised individuals, infants and adults. Primary infection is followed by latency in ganglionic neurons. During this period, no virus particles are produced and no obvious neuronal damage occurs. Reactivation of the virus leads to virus replication, which causes zoster (shingles) in tissues innervated by the involved neurons, inflammation and cell death - a process that can lead to persistent radicular pain (postherpetic neuralgia). The pathogenesis of postherpetic neuralgia is unknown and it is difficult to treat. Furthermore, other zoster complications can develop, including myelitis, cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, stroke (vasculopathy), retinitis, and gastroenterological infections such as ulcers, pancreatitis and hepatitis. VZV is the only human herpesvirus for which highly effective vaccines are available. After varicella or vaccination, both wild-type and vaccine-type VZV establish latency, and long-term immunity to varicella develops. However, immunity does not protect against reactivation. Thus, two vaccines are used: one to prevent varicella and one to prevent zoster. In this Primer we discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of VZV infections, with an emphasis on the molecular events that regulate these diseases.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1139jdRS]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) prevention — pre-exposure measures in adults and adolescents with HIV specify that adults and adolescents with HIV who have CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and who do not have documentation of varicella vaccination, a history or diagnosis of varicella or herpes zoster, or laboratory confirmation of VZV disease are addressed, and anyone with HIV who is VZV seronegative should avoid exposure to persons with varicella or herpes zoster (CIII). Household contacts who are VZV-susceptible should be vaccinated to prevent potential transmission of VZV to at-risk people with HIV (BIII). In VZV-seronegative persons aged ≥ 18 years with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3, administer primary varicella vaccination in two doses (0.5 mL SQ) 3 months apart (BIII). If vaccination results in disease due to live-attenuated vaccine virus, treatment with acyclovir is recommended (AIII). If post-exposure VariZIG has been administered, wait ≥ 5 months before varicella vaccination (CIII), and if post-exposure acyclovir has been administered, wait ≥ 3 days before varicella vaccination (CIII). Administration of varicella vaccine to severely immunocompromised people with HIV (CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3) is contraindicated (AIII).

### Herpes zoster [^112t3SGV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Primary care providers and hospitalists frequently encounter older or immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster accompanied by debilitating pain. Atypical presentations and zosteriform herpes simplex may present diagnostic challenges to clinicians. This article summarizes the background, evidence, and guidelines for the diagnosis, complications, treatment, and prevention of herpes zoster. Diagnosis of challenging cases relies on polymerase chain reaction as the preferred test. Treatment focuses on optimal use of antiviral therapy and analgesics. Prevention emphasizes utilization of a new recombinant zoster vaccine, which reduces the incidence of herpes zoster by more than 90% and is preferred to the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine.

### Rapid detection of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infections by real-time PCR [^113WiocE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

The herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can cause life-threatening infections of the central nervous system and lead to severe infections in immunocompromised subjects and newborns. In these cases, rapid diagnosis is crucial. We developed three different real-time PCR assays based on TaqMan chemistry for the LightCycler instrument to detect HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV. When the TaqMan assays were compared to our in-house nested PCR assays, the test systems had equal sensitivities of ≤ 10 plasmid copies per assay. When clinical samples were investigated by TaqMan PCR to detect HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV DNA, 95, 100, and 96% of the samples determined to be positive by nested PCR, respectively, were positive by the real-time PCR assays. The specificities of all PCR assays were almost 100%. Furthermore, the TaqMan PCR assays could be performed within 2.5 h, whereas nested PCR results were available after 9 h. In addition to offering more rapid results, the TaqMan PCR assays appear to be less expensive than nested PCR assays due to less hands-on time. In summary, TaqMan PCR is an excellent alternative to conventional nested PCR assays for the rapid detection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV in clinical samples.

### Reliability of direct varicella zoster virus loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for rapid diagnosis of breakthrough varicella [^115cuSX8]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Since patients with breakthrough varicella (BV) have mild symptoms, clinical diagnosis is difficult. In high vaccine coverage area, as BV occurs sporadically, point of care test is required for controlling varicella outbreak. In this study, the reliability of varicella zoster virus (VZV)-loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was evaluated for the rapid diagnosis of BV.

Study Design

A total of 328 swab samples collected from patients with suspected varicella were analyzed. For the laboratory diagnosis of varicella, VZV real-time PCR was carried out using DNA extracted from swab samples. Swab samples without DNA extraction were used for VZV-LAMP(direct-LAMP).

Results

VZV infection was diagnosed by real-time PCR in 285 cases, including 105 natural varicella cases and 180 BV cases. VZV DNA was detected in 250 (87.8%) of the 285 cases by direct-LAMP. The presence and duration of fever, number of skin eruptions, and VZV DNA load were significantly lower in BV than natural varicella. The sensitivity of direct-LAMP for the diagnosis of varicella and BV was 93.3% and 84.4%, respectively.

Conclusions

Direct LAMP was considered to be useful for rapid diagnosis of BV as it has several advantages such as low cost, ease and rapidity, as compared to real time PCR.

### Varicella zoster encephalitis in an immunocompetent patient [^1123WDRS]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma, most often caused by viruses. Historically, data have shown herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 to be the most common causes of viral encephalitis, with cases due to varicella zoster virus (VZV) more often seen in older age and immunocompromised states. However, emerging data show VZV as an increasingly common culprit of encephalitis in young, immunocompetent patients. PCR analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid is the most accurate diagnostic modality for viral encephalitis. Appropriate and complete treatment hinges on accurate identification of the cause of encephalitis, underscoring the need for comprehensive testing. We present a case of VZV encephalitis in an immunocompetent male patient in his 40s.

### High prevalence of varicella zoster virus infection among persons with suspect mpox cases during an mpox outbreak in Kenya, 2024 [^1119uHzv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Kenya is experiencing a clade Ib mpox outbreak, with 28 confirmed cases reported by the Ministry of Health from July to December 2024. Polymerase chain reaction testing was performed for varicella zoster virus (VZV). Testing was also part of the differential diagnosis for mpox, and a subset of cases was genetically sequenced. Of 277 specimens tested for mpox, 170 (61%) tested positive for VZV, including instances of coinfection with both viruses in four cases. Genome analysis was used to identify clade 5 human alphaherpesvirus 3 in eight of the genetically sequenced cases. Expanding laboratory capacity during this outbreak enhanced disease intelligence by confirming another etiology of rash among patients who tested negative for mpox, underscoring the need for a broad differential diagnosis when diseases present with overlapping clinical signs and symptoms.

### Detection of varicella zoster virus in genital specimens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction [^111UGq64]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the relative proportions of varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex viruses in specimens obtained from the genital lesions of adults presenting with presumed genital herpes infection.

Methods

Swabs of genital lesions from 6210 patients attending general practices, infectious diseases clinics within hospitals, or sexual health centres for treatment of their genital lesions were tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. The multiplexed PCR was capable of detecting herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), VZV, and cytomegalovirus in a single sample.

Results

A total of 2225 patients had viruses detected by PCR. HSV-1 was detected in 36%, HSV-2 in 61%, and VZV in 2.9% of PCR positive samples. Of the 65 patients with VZV genital infection, many were thought to have HSV infection before laboratory testing.

Conclusions

The finding of VZV in nearly 3% of virus positive genital specimens demonstrates that this virus needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis for genital herpetic lesions. Advice provided to patients with VZV genital infection regarding the source of infection, likelihood of recurrence, and potential for transmission of the virus will be different from that given to patients with HSV infection.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^112WLCyL]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute varicella zoster virus (VZV) replication in shingles is accompanied by VZV antibody boosting. It is unclear whether persisting virus shedding affects antibody levels.

Objectives

To investigate the relationship between VZV viral load and antibody titres in shingles patients during six months following diagnosis and assess whether VZV antibody titre could discriminate patients with recent shingles from healthy population controls.

Study Design

A prospective study of 63 patients with active zoster. Blood samples were collected at baseline, one, three and six months to measure VZV DNA and IgG antibody titre. We compared VZV antibody titres of zoster patients and 441 controls.

Results

In acute zoster, viral load was highest at baseline and declined gradually over the following six months. Mean antibody titres rose fourfold, peaking at one month and remaining above baseline levels throughout the study. Antibody levels at one, three and six months after zoster were moderately correlated with baseline but not subsequent viral load. Regarding use of antibody titres to identify recent shingles, to achieve 80% sensitivity, specificity would be 23.4%, 67.7%, 64.8% and 52.6%, at baseline, visit 2, 3 and 4 respectively, whilst to achieve 80% specificity, sensitivity would be 28.3%, 66.1%, 52.6%, 38.6%, at baseline, visit 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

Conclusions

Clinical VZV reactivation boosted VZV antibody levels and the level of boosting was dependent upon baseline viral replication. While antibody titres could discriminate patients with shingles 1–6 months earlier from blood donor controls, there was a large trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

Ocular antimicrobial susceptibility testing — because systemic breakpoints are not applicable to ocular isolates, laboratories choosing to perform testing may report the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and range without interpretation, and no interpretation should be provided for bacteria, yeasts, and molds. Many drugs used to treat ocular infection, particularly topical agents, are not included on commercial susceptibility platforms, are not routinely tested in clinical labs, and lack interpretive breakpoints, while antiviral susceptibility testing is limited to specialized reference labs and may be helpful in refractory HSV, VZV, and CMV infections.

### Analysis of the reliability of rapid diagnostic tests for varicella, including breakthrough cases [^115ffmig]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the era of universal varicella vaccination, diagnosis of varicella is challenging, especially for breakthrough cases. We sought to clarify the reliability of direct varicella-zoster virus (VZV) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and DermaQuick® VZV using the immunochromatography technique as rapid diagnostic tests for varicella. In addition, the usefulness of saliva as a sample type for direct LAMP was investigated. Among the 46 enrolled patients with suspected VZV infection, 31 patients (67.3%) were positive for the nucleic acid test based on real-time PCR from skin swab samples. Direct LAMP of skin swabs was positive in 29 (63.0%) of 46 patients. DermaQuick® VZV was positive in 25 (54.3%) of 46 patients. VZV DNA was detected in only 48.4% of oral swabs with the direct LAMP method. With real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the standard for diagnosing varicella, the sensitivity and specificity of DermaQuick® VZV were 80.7% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of direct LAMP from skin swabs were 93.6% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR for DNA extracted from oral swabs were 74.2% and 93.3%, respectively. Thus, oral swab samples are not suitable for breakthrough varicella diagnosis. Although DermaQuick® VZV is considered the most convenient point-of-care test for varicella, its sensitivity and specificity were lower than those of direct VZV LAMP.

### Varicella zoster virus vasculopathy [^1133JpT6]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous, exclusively human alphaherpesvirus that produces varicella then becomes latent in ganglionic neurons. In elderly and immunocompromised individuals, VZV reactivates and typically produces herpes zoster. Studies of patients with VZV vasculopathy have identified key clinical, imaging, and laboratory features to assist in diagnosis and treatment. Complementary studies have further expanded the spectrum of VZV vasculopathy to include the extracranial circulation and identified mechanisms contributing to its pathogenesis. Given our increasing aging population and recognition that VZV reactivation manifesting as zoster is a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction, recognition of VZV as a potential cause of vascular disease with or without associated zoster rash is essential to decrease associated morbidity and mortality because VZV vasculopathy can be treated with antiviral therapy.

### Varicella-zoster virus CNS disease – viral load, clinical manifestations and sequels [^113kLKbi]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples has improved the diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS). The VZV viral load in the CSF obtained from VZV-related neurological syndromes is not known.

Objectives

To investigate VZV viral loads associated with VZV-related neurological syndromes, and to describe the clinical manifestations and sequels in patients with VZV DNA in the CSF.

Study Design

Patients in the Western Gotaland region of Sweden with CNS symptoms and VZV DNA in the CSF, during 1995–2006 were retrospectively identified. The diagnoses, laboratory tests (including virus quantity), antiviral treatment, and neurological complications were studied.

Results

Ninety-seven patients with VZV DNA in the CSF detected by PCR were identified. In 66 patients in whom VZV DNA levels were determined, significantly higher viral loads were found in those with encephalitis and acute aseptic meningitis compared to patients with cranial nerve affection (including Ramsay Hunt syndrome). Fifty patients had a follow-up; 34 (68%) had neurological symptoms 1 month after acute disease and 25 (50%) had neurological complications 3 months after discharge. A minimum yearly incidence of 1.8 per 100,000 of PCR diagnosed VZV CNS infections was estimated.

Conclusions

VZV was the most common alpha-herpesvirus detected in CSF samples from patients with CNS symptoms in the Western Gotaland region of Sweden. CSF viral loads were higher in patients with encephalitis and acute aseptic meningitis than in other CNS syndromes caused by VZV. A majority of the patients that were seen in follow-up had neurological symptoms and sequels.

### Polymerase chain reaction as a diagnostic adjunct in herpesvirus infections of the nervous system [^1144dHEq]. Brain Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful technique that allows detection of minute quantities of DNA or RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), vesicle and endoneurial fluids, blood, fresh-frozen, and even formalin-fixed tissues. Various infectious agents can be detected with high specificity and sensitivity, including bacteria, parasites, rickettsia and viruses. PCR analysis of CSF has revolutionized the diagnosis of nervous system viral infections, particularly those caused by human herpesviruses (HHV), and has now replaced brain biopsy as the gold standard for diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. PCR analysis of both CSF and nervous system tissues has also broadened our understanding of the spectrum of disease caused by HSV-1 and -2, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and HHV-6. Nonetheless, positive tissue PCR results must be interpreted cautiously, especially in cases that lack corroborating clinical and neuropathologic evidence of infection. Moreover, positive PCR results from tissues do not distinguish latent from productive (lytic) viral infections. In several neurological diseases, negative PCR results have provided strong evidence against a role for herpesviruses as the causative agents. This review focuses on the use of PCR tests to diagnose HSV and VZV infections of the nervous system.

### Varicella zoster virus quantitation in blood from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [^1119rmCr]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) occurs in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. Clinical and asymptomatic reactivation with shedding of infectious virus and viremia may occur. The prevalence of VZV viremia is unknown. The aim of this study was to detect VZV viremia and quantify VZV DNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in blood from different populations. A qPCR-based method using EvaGreen® was used to quantify VZV DNA in 491 samples, including whole blood, plasma and buffy-coat, from patients hospitalized with varicella-associated disease (Group 1, n = 10) and three groups with no VZV disease: individuals with a first clinical diagnosis of central nervous system demyelination (Group 2, n = 213) with their age and sex-matched controls (Group 3, n = 218); and HIV-infected individuals (Group 4, n = 50). VZV-specific IgG antibody titres were measured in Group 3. The proportion positive for viremia and mean detectable VZV DNA load (copies/ml) were: Group 1: 100% (10/10) and 4.6 × 10⁶ ± 1.4 × 10⁷; Group 2: 4% (9/213) and 1.5 × 10³ ± 1.8 × 10⁴; Group 3: 8% (17/218) and 1.1 × 10³ ± 7.8 × 10³; Group 4: 12% (6/50) and 7.7 × 10¹ ± 2.8 × 10². VZV DNA load and IgG titres were not significantly correlated (Group 3 only). VZV load in Group 1 was significantly elevated compared to Groups 2–4 (P < 0.001); the latter were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.05). VZV genotypes from clades 1–5 were identified in Group 1. VZV DNA was detected but at low frequency and viral load in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals asymptomatic for VZV infection, compared to individuals with active VZV infection.

### Routine use of a highly automated and internally controlled real-time PCR assay for the diagnosis of herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus infections [^116SXDvZ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Detection of herpes viruses can be significantly improved by PCR. The development of real-time PCR, which has overcome several limitations of conventional PCR, improved the prospects for implementation of PCR-based assays in diagnostic laboratory.

Objectives

To compare the diagnostic performance of an automated sample extraction procedure in combination with an internally controlled real-time PCR assay for detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to conventional shell vial culture.

Study Design

One hundred eighty-two consecutive specimens from patients suspected of HSV or VZV infection were examined by internally controlled PCR and shell vial culture. An internal control consisting of phocine herpes virus was processed along with the specimens during the entire procedure and permitted to monitor extraction and amplification efficiency, including inhibition.

Results

A total of 48 (26.4%) specimens were positive for HSV or VZV by culture, and 77 (42.3%) by real-time PCR. Thus, overall sensitivity increased by 60.4%. All culture-positive specimens were detected and typed correctly by PCR, except for a single specimen that contained PCR inhibitors. Specifically, the real-time PCR assay increased the detection rate for HSV-1 and HSV-2 by 43.9% and 62.5%, respectively. In PCR-positive specimens, lower levels of viral DNA were found in culture-negative than in culture-positive specimens. The increase of HSV detection rates by PCR varied with the origin of specimen and was particularly significant for skin specimens (7/14 versus 3/14 detected by culture) and bronchoalveolar lavages (8/8 versus 1/8). In addition, real-time PCR significantly increased the detection rate for VZV.

Conclusions

Compared to shell vial culture, our real-time PCR assay demonstrated a superior sensitivity and an added value of using internal control for checking the quality of examination of each specimen. These results provide a solid basis for implementation of real-time PCR in the routine diagnosis of HSV and VZV infections in various clinical specimens.

### Fulminant disseminated varicella zoster virus infection without skin involvement [^113Ngy2t]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) infection is potentially very serious in bone marrow transplant recipients, and may manifest as a disseminated visceral infection. This condition is generally accompanied by a vesicular rash.

Objectives

We review here a case of fulminant fatal disseminated VZV infection, not accompanied by skin involvement, and the laboratory approaches currently available to diagnose this disease.

Study Design

Post mortem tissue samples were subjected to histopathological examination, and tested for herpesviruses by electron microscopy and PCR.

Results

Intranuclear inclusions were noted by histological examination in the lungs, liver, kidneys and bone marrow. Particles with a herpesvirus morphology were visualized in liver tissue. VZV DNA was detected in liver and bone marrow by PCR followed by sequencing of the amplicons. Viremia was documented by retrospective testing of the serum by PCR.

Conclusions

A disseminated VZV infection which proved rapidly fatal was demonstrated in a case without skin manifestations. This rare presentation of VZV infection is potentially underdiagnosed. Testing for VZV viremia by PCR can at the very least suggest the diagnosis although whether plasma-associated viremia is truly pathognomonic of visceral disseminated infection remains to be established.

### A cluster of primary varicella cases among healthcare workers with false-positive varicella zoster virus titers [^113CsNwH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Five cases of primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) we re diagnosed among hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). All had complied with a pre-employment VZV screening program and had been considered immune.

Objectives

To summarize the investigation of VZV among un-immunized HCWs and to provide recommendations for avoiding false-positive serologic tests.

Design

Risk of transmission of VZV to susceptible HCWs is minimized through serologic screening. Varicella vaccine is recommended for susceptible HCWs. A commercially available latex bead agglutination assay (LA) is widely used because it is rapid and easy to perform. LA was compared with the whole-cell varicella ELISA standardized in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Herpes Laboratory.

Setting/Population

Large inner-city, tertiary-employee population.

Results

In a year, 5 HCWs presented with laboratory-confirmed primary varicella infection. Four had VZV exposures 2 weeks prior to presentation. All had documented positive VZV titers by LA performed at hire. None were offered VZV vaccination. The original LAs were judged false-positives. INTERVENTION/FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION: Fifty-three consecutive VZV LA samples from the hospital laboratory were retested at the CDC. Forty-four samples concurred. Of the remaining 9, 4 were positive by hospital LA but negative by CDC IgG ELISA. Four were equivocal by hospital LA but negative by CDC IgG ELISA and LA. One was positive by hospital LA but negative by LA and equivocal by ELISA at the CDC.

Conclusion

LA may be prone to false-positive results and inappropriate for screening hospital HCWs.

### Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections caused by herpesviruses [^111pws75]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Herpesviruses may be associated with various types of central nervous system (CNS) infections. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) has to be considered one of the most severe diseases. As effective antiviral drugs are available, rapid and reliable diagnosis has become important.

Objectives

To describe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serological methods for the detection of herpesvirus-induced CNS infections by the example of HSE.

Study Design

620 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 2400 serum samples from 2700 selected hospitalized patients with clinical suspicion of encephalitis were tested for herpes simplex virus (HSV) as well as varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA and HSV-specific antibodies, respectively.

Results

HSV-1 DNA could be detected in eight and HSV-2 in three patients with focal encephalitis. In addition, HSV-2 DNA was found in two newborns with encephalitis and two adults suffered from transverse lumbar myelitis. One VZV DNA-positive patient had developed herpes zoster accompanied by meningoencephalitis, and in the other an encephalitis without cutaneous rash was diagnosed. Intrathecal antibody synthesis could be measured when CSF was cleared from viral DNA.

Conclusions

The detection of viral DNA by PCR technique has become the "gold standard" method for laboratory diagnosis of herpesvirus infections of CNS. Serodiagnosis may be useful to confirm the diagnosis retrospectively.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113C9C9c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Molecular detection in ocular infections — intraocular fluids should be analyzed directly for infectious agents. There are no FDA-approved NAATs for ocular specimens, but commercial reference laboratories and a subset of hospital-based laboratories servicing large ophthalmology practices offer molecular testing using validated lab developed tests, some of which are FDA-approved for other specimen types. NAATs exhibit increased sensitivity for most ocular pathogens relative to traditional culture, with specificity for pathogens not part of the normal ocular surface microbiota (eg, C. trachomatis) being > 99%, whereas specificity drops considerably for commensals such as C. acnes. NAATs are particularly helpful in culture-negative intraocular infections with fastidious organisms; HSV and VZV NAATs are the most commonly used and exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for active infection, while detection of ubiquitous commensal viruses such as CMV, EBV, and HHV-6 requires careful clinical correlation.

### Viral encephalitis in england, 1989–1998: what did we miss? [^112LiZEB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Why are so few diagnoses in hospital episode statistics specific? Whether an appropriate investigation has been carried out, the extent to which a specific diagnosis is sought, and the quality of medical records affect the recording of specific diagnoses in hospital episode statistics. Appropriate investigation is limited by the diagnostic techniques available; virus isolation from cerebrospinal fluid or the brain can delay a diagnosis because culturing is slow, sensitivity may be poor, and obtaining specimens may require special techniques. Determining the virus causing the encephalitis may not be seen as essential if all patients diagnosed with viral encephalitis are routinely given acyclovir, regardless of the virologic diagnosis. Regional variation in the proportion of hospitalizations without a specific diagnosis suggests that local laboratory practice or investigation by clinicians may differ. A nonspecific diagnosis is recorded in hospital episode statistics if the laboratory results arrive after discharge. During the period of study, the rapid and highly sensitive PCR test was not widely used in England; however, as the test becomes more widely available, the proportion of cases with a specific diagnosis in hospital episode statistics may increase. In this study, we found that adults with a specific diagnosis were older than those without a diagnosis, which is likely to reflect the age distribution of herpes, VZV, and other specific viral encephalitis diagnoses. A lower case-fatality rate, however, and mean length of stay in hospital suggests that these infections without a specific diagnosis are less severe.

### Viral encephalitis in england, 1989–1998: what did we miss? [^116bWPCK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Routine laboratory reports and statutory clinical notifications of infectious diseases are a source of viral encephalitis surveillance in England; however, these methods are considered to be incomplete. Hospital episode statistics record hospital admissions of viral encephalitis; although not timely enough for surveillance, these statistics can be used to monitor the distribution of admissions attributed to viral encephalitis by hospital physicians.

Most cases of viral encephalitis in the U.K. are thought to be rare complications of common infections. Herpes simplex virus (hereafter referred to as herpes) is the virus most often associated with encephalitis. Other viruses known to cause encephalitis include varicella-zoster virus 1 (VZV), measles virus, rubella virus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and the adenoviruses. Cases of encephalitis attributed to arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are common in certain areas of the world, but only rare, imported cases have been reported in the U.K.

Clinical diagnosis of viral encephalitis is based on symptoms such as fever, headache, and altered mental state; however, a definitive diagnosis of viral encephalitis relies on detecting the virus in cerebrospinal fluid or brain. The use of virologic investigation has been inconsistent in England. Virus isolation, formerly the standard criterion for diagnosis, is steadily being replaced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is more sensitive and provides a more rapid result. However, PCR was not widely used at the time of this study.

The demonstration of specific intrathecal antibody, either by detecting a raised antibody index or by detecting specific oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid, provides evidence of recent neurologic infection. When combined with an appropriate clinical picture, this demonstration is considered diagnostic. A noninvasive investigation such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also diagnostic. Serologic confirmation based on a fourfold rise in the level of antibody to the virus in the acute- and convalescent-phase blood samples or the demonstration of an intrathecal antibody response also provides evidence of recent infection.

### Notes from the field: expanded laboratory testing for varicella-Minnesota, 2016–2023 [^111BPRsv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Investigation and Outcomes

After the expanded laboratory program was initiated, the proportion of laboratory-confirmed varicella cases doubled, from 17% (235 of 1,426) during January 2013–November 2016 to 36% (619 of 1,717) during December 2016–March 2023 (p < 0.001). The proportion of PCR-confirmed varicella cases increased 62%, from 29% in 2017 to 47% in 2022. Among the 619 patients who received a positive VZV PCR test result after program implementation, 157 (25%) had testing performed at MDH-PHL.

During December 2016–March 2023, MDH-PHL performed testing on specimens for 420 patients with suspected varicella; the median patient age was 5 years (range = 0–68 years), and 95 (23%) provided specimens collected at home. Nearly one half (194; 46%) of patients tested received a negative test result, including 108 (56%) who had received at least 1 dose of varicella vaccine, and two had indeterminate test results for all four viral targets. VZV was detected in 157 (37%) specimens, including 32 (20%) from patients who had received at least 1 dose of varicella vaccine; enterovirus was detected in 47 (11%), and HSV-1 in 20 (5%). No HSV-2 or viral coinfections were identified.

Among 208 patients with an in-person clinical diagnosis of varicella at a medical facility, 45% (93), 13% (26), and < 1% (one) received positive VZV, enterovirus, and HSV-1 test results, respectively. VZV detection was significantly lower in specimens from patients who had received varicella vaccine (22 of 100; 22%) than among those from patients who were unvaccinated (68 of 103; 66%) (p < 0.001, Bonferroni adjusted). The proportion of patients with positive enterovirus test results did not differ between patients who had received varicella vaccine (10%) and those who had not (16%) (p = 1.0, Bonferroni adjusted).

### Seroprevalence of varicella in the French population [^116ascJj]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the age-specific seroprevalence of varicella in the French population and to explore age-adjusted differences according to gender and geographic region.

Methods

Data were obtained from 1257 randomly selected, frozen serum samples, from subjects 1–30 years of age, that were sent to the Pasteur-Cerba laboratory in November 2003 to January 2004 for the following clinical indications: allergies, respiratory infections, herpes virus infections excluding varicella and endocrinologic tests. IgG concentrations were tested with an indirect enzyme immunoassay. Statistical analyses included use of locally weighted, scatterplot smoothers.

Results

Age-specific seroprevalence of varicella increased by > 6-fold between 1 and 8 years of age, ie, from 15.0% (95% confidence interval, 8.6–23.5%) for subjects 1–2 years of age to 89.0% (95% confidence interval, 81.0–94.3%) for those 7–8 years of age. The smoothed curve of age-specific seroprevalence suggested that the steepest rate of increase occurred between 1 and 8 years of age, followed by a considerable slowing in the rate of increase, reaching a prevalence of approximately 95% by age 30. Varicella seroprevalence rates were similar for the samples referred for the 4 clinical indications, as follows: allergies, 76.2%; respiratory infections, 74.0%; herpes virus infections excluding varicella, 73.3%; endocrinologic tests, 73.7% (P = 0.84).

Conclusions

Most varicella-zoster virus infections occur during early childhood. Seroprevalence rates reach approximately 50% by 4 years of age and approximately 90% by 8 years. Therefore, the best strategy to reduce the prevalence of wild-type varicella-zoster virus in the French population would be to immunize children 12–18 months of age, as is currently performed in the United States.

### Varicella-zoster virus reactivation is frequently detected in HIV-infected individuals presenting with stroke [^111V2acg]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Infections are an underappreciated cause of stroke, particularly in young and immunocompromised individuals. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation, particularly ophthalmic zoster, has been linked to increased risk of stroke but diagnosing VZV-associated cerebral vasculopathy is challenging as neither a recent zoster rash, nor detectable levels of VZV DNA are universally present at stroke presentation. Detection of VZV IgG in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-VZVG) presents a promising alternative, but requires evaluation of individual blood-CSF dynamics, particularly in the setting of chronic inflammatory states such as HIV infection. Consequently, its use has not been broadly adopted as simple diagnostic algorithms are not available. In this study looking at young adults presenting with acute stroke, we used an algorithm that includes testing for both VZV nucleic acids and CSF-VZVG which was corrected for blood-CSF barrier dynamics and poly-specific immune activation. We found that 13 of 35 (37%), including 7 with a positive CSF VZV PCR, young HIV-infected adults presenting with stroke, 3 of 34 (9%) young HIV-uninfected adults presenting with stroke, and 1 of 18 (6%) HIV-infected nonstroke controls demonstrated evidence of central nervous system reactivation of VZV.

### Rapid quantitative PCR assays for the simultaneous detection of herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus 6 DNA in blood and other clinical specimens [^114pdYpb]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnosis of human herpesvirus primary infections or reactivations is facilitated by quantitative PCRs. Quantitative PCR assays with a standard thermal cycling profile permitting simultaneous detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) DNA were developed and validated for diagnostic use. High specificity and sensitivity were achieved and the new PCR assays correlated well with commercial PCR assays. Twenty two thousand eight hundred sixty eight PCR tests were undertaken on specimens obtained from immunosuppressed patients. DNAemia was frequent with EBV (43.5%), HHV6 (32.4%), CMV (12.8%), and VZV (12.9%). As already described for EBV and CMV, high virus loads of HHV6 and VZV were associated with clinical symptoms and poor clinical outcome, for example, three of four patients with VZV virus loads > 10⁵ copies/ml died. A high proportion of lower respiratory specimens was positive for EBV- (38.8%), HHV6- (29.4%), and CMV-DNA (18.2%). For CMV, infection was confirmed in 66.7% of patients by virus isolation or positive pp65 antigenaemia. Differentiation of HHV6A, -B and HSV-1, -2 by melting curve analysis revealed that HHV6A and HSV-2 represented only 1.8% and 3.3% of all positive specimens, respectively. In conclusion, these results indicate significant improvements for the early diagnosis of primary infections or reactivations of five human herpesviruses especially in immunosuppressed patients. Detection of coinfections with multiple herpesviruses is facilitated. Quantitative results enable monitoring of virus load during antiviral therapy. A standard thermal cycling profile permits time and cost effective use in a routine diagnostic setting.

### Detection of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus by traditional and multiplex molecular methods [^113fxfAE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) that detect and differentiate herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) with traditional virologic assays.

Methods

The HSV ELVIS Test System (Quidel, San Diego, CA) and/or Light Diagnostics VZV direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) kit (Millipore Sigma, Billerica, MA), as well as an ARIES HSV 1&2/VZV assay (Luminex, Austin, TX) and the Solana HSV1 + 2/VZV Assay (Quidel), were performed on non-cerebrospinal fluid specimens.

Results

The sensitivities/specificities for the ELVIS, Aries, and Solana assays for HSV were 71.1%/93.2%, 94.9%/93.2%, and 94.7%/100%, respectively. The sensitivities/specificities for the DFA, Aries, and Solana assays for VZV were 71.4%/100%, 100%/96.0%, and 95.3%/100%, respectively. HSV and VZV were detected but clinically unsuspected in 5.4% and 4.2% of the specimens, respectively.

Conclusions

Both NAAT assays were comparable and more sensitive than traditional methods. The recovery of unsuspected HSV and VZV from clinical specimens supports the implementation of a combined HSV/VZV assay.

ANTIVIRAL RESISTANCE TESTING METHODS

Phenotypic assays

Antiviral resistance testing methods can be classified as phenotypic or genotypic (Fig. 1). The most basic phenotypic assays test for evidence of viral replication or host cell destruction (cytopathic effect), in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of drugs. An example of this is the plaque reduction assay traditionally used for HSV resistance testing. Titered virus is grown on a mammalian cell monolayer and overlaid with increasing concentrations of acyclovir or foscarnet. After incubation, plaques are counted at each drug concentration, and linear regression is performed to determine the drug concentration at which there is a 50% reduction in plaque formation compared to no-drug control wells [half-maximal inhibitory or effective concentration (IC50 or EC50)]. Plaque counting is labor-intensive and, in many labs, has been replaced by other indirect measures of viral replication/cell death that are easier to automate, such as dye uptake, chemiluminescence, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hybridization, or even quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays.

Other phenotypic assays that do not directly measure viral replication or cell death, but rather antigen levels or enzyme function in the presence or absence of drugs, can also be used. Enzyme immunoassays including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been described for HSV and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). These assays are set up similarly to plaque reduction assays, but after incubation of virus-inoculated monolayers with varying concentrations of the drug, virus-specific antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies are added to the wells, with subsequent measurement of absorbance. The quantity of viral antigen is used as a surrogate for viral replication, and an IC50 or EC50 is calculated. These ELISA-based assays demonstrated similar performance to plaque reduction assays with, in some cases, a twofold reduction in the turnaround time.

### Clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster in family practice [^116GzE41]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Family physicians usually diagnose herpes zoster on clinical grounds only, possibly resulting in false-positive diagnoses and unnecessary treatment. We wanted to determine the positive predictive value of the physicians' judgment in diagnosing herpes zoster and to assess the applicability of dried blood spot analysis for diagnosis of herpes zoster in family practice.

Methods

Our study population consisted of 272 patients older than 50 years with herpes zoster (rash for less than 7 days). Dried blood spot samples were collected from all patients and sent by mail to the laboratory. Baseline measurements included clinical signs (localization, severity, and duration of rash) and symptoms (duration and severity of pain). Varicella-zoster virus antibodies were determined at baseline and 5 to 10 days later. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between clinical variables and serological confirmation of herpes zoster.

Results

Dried blood spot analysis was possible in 260 patients (96%). In 236 the diagnosis of herpes zoster was confirmed serologically (positive predictive value of clinical judgment 90.8%; 95% confidence interval, 87.3%-94.3%). Independent clinical variables for serologically confirmed herpes zoster were severity and duration of rash at first examination.

Conclusion

Family physicians have good clinical judgment when diagnosing herpes zoster in older patients. Dried blood spot analysis is a logistically convenient method for serological investigation of patients in family practice, but it is rarely needed for diagnosing herpes zoster.

### Quantification of risk factors for herpes zoster: population based case-control study [^113qqYHP]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

This large study included all incident cases of zoster in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink over an 11 year period, providing high power to detect small effects, except for rare potential risk factors. We assessed a wide range of factors, allowing adjustment for many of the known as well as potential confounders, in addition to exploring interactions with age, which is of key public health relevance in terms of vaccination policy.

The study may be subject to ascertainment bias; regular general practice visits for a chronic condition such as diabetes may increase the likelihood of receiving a zoster diagnosis. However, we believe that most zoster cases would present to their general practice, owing to the extensive rash and considerable pain associated with zoster and free general practice attendance in the UK. A survey about immunisation practices in the United States among people aged 60 and over found that 95% of those who knew they had zoster sought care. Furthermore, we found little evidence to suggest that patients with epilepsy (who were visiting their general practice as frequently as patients with our risk factors of interest) were at increased risk of zoster.

As with any observational study, residual confounding may be present. For example, exposure to varicella contacts, hypothesised to naturally boost varicella zoster virus specific immunity in people with latent varicella zoster virus infection and thus protect against zoster, was not available.

Some misclassification of zoster is possible. In UK primary care, diagnosis of zoster is clinically based with no laboratory testing. Validation of zoster diagnoses in primary care in the Netherlands found that 90.8% of cases had raised antibodies indicating recent zoster infection, suggesting that diagnosis of zoster has a high positive predictive value. The frequency with which general practitioners wrongly reject the diagnosis of zoster has not, however, been investigated; this may be more common among younger patients in whom zoster is uncommon. However, the most common misclassification of zoster is as recurrent herpes simplex, which very rarely presents in a dermatomal distribution. Zoster is typically a straightforward clinical diagnosis, so the extent of misclassification is likely to be minimal. Any misclassification is likely to be non-differential with respect to exposure status, thus leading to an underestimation of associations.

Finally, excluding "inactive" controls to remove patients who would not attend their general practice if they did develop zoster, may have resulted in healthier controls not being included and led to an underestimation of the odds ratios.

### Calibration and evaluation of quantitative antibody titers for varicella-zoster virus by use of the bioPlex 2200 [^116tFCwj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Serosurveys of VZV IgG antibodies are conducted to determine the level of immunity of a population. They are instrumental in informing vaccine policy, whether for assessing immunity in the general population, subpopulations, e.g. recent immigrants from tropical climates, or immunosuppressed children who may benefit from VZV vaccination.

An ideal test for VZV serosurveys should be sensitive enough to detect antibodies produced after vaccination, which are of lower titer than antibodies produced by natural infection; it should allow for high throughput to handle large studies, and it should be quantitative to allow analyses of threshold of immunity and the levels of herd immunity.

The BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG test meets the criteria of automation and high throughput. Our results with a validation set (Fig. 3 and Table 1) demonstrate that the BioPlex 2200 can measure VZV IgG in a quantitative manner when calibrated using a serial dilution of the VZV IgG international standard (Fig. 1 and 2). Quantitation by the BioPlex 2200 correlates very well with the sensitive VaccZyme gpEIA method. On the basis of the results with a validation set, we have determined the optimal cutoffs (152 mIU/ml for a negative result and 190 mIU/ml for a positive result) for the quantitative BioPlex 2200 method, which provided 97.4% positive agreement and 100% negative agreement with the VaccZyme gpEIA. The positivity threshold of 190 mIU/ml for quantitative use of the BioPlex 2200 VZV IgG test corresponds to a 0.7 AI threshold for the qualitative test, lower than the 1.1 AI normally used for the FDA-approved BioPlex 2200 VZV IgG diagnostic test. Testing by the BioPlex 2200 of a set of residual serum specimens and retesting by the VaccZyme gpEIA confirm the positive and negative agreements observed with the validation set (Table 5) and confirm the linear relationship between the VZV IgG titers measured by the BioPlex 2200 and VaccZyme gpEIA (Fig. 5).

### Don't rash it! the clinical significance of positive varicella zoster virus PCR in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurological symptoms [^114t9rtQ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is among the leading pathogens causing meningitis and encephalitis. While VZV-PCR-positive CSF is considered a gold-standard for diagnosis, it is not-uncommon to detect VZV-DNA in CSF of patients with other acute or chronic illness. Our goal was to determine the clinical relevance of VZV-PCR-positive CSF when investigating patients with neurological symptoms.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort from the largest hospital in Israel, we collected demographic, clinical and laboratory data of patients with VZV-PCR-positive CSF, analyzing the significance of various parameters.

Results

During a 5-years study, 125 patient-unique VZV-PCR-positive CSFs were recorded, in which only 9 alternative diagnoses were noted. The commonest symptoms were headache (N = 104, 83%) and rash (N = 96, 76%). PCR-cycle-threshold (Ct), a surrogate of viral burden, did not significantly vary across the clinical manifestations; however, patients with rash and Ct < 35 were prone to develop stroke in the following year (N = 6, 7%). Empiric nucleoside-analogue treatment was not associated with a better outcome compared to treatment administered upon a positive-PCR result.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that in patients with neurological symptoms, detection of VZV-DNA in CSF renders VZV the probable culprit. Nevertheless, a systematic evaluation of treatment and follow-up algorithms of patients with suspected or proved VZV meningitis and encephalitis is needed. The benefits of a prompt treatment should be weighed against the potential complications of nucleoside-analogue. Conversely, the propensity for stroke in patients with higher viral-burden, necessitates further studies assessing VZV causal role, directing additional workup, treatment and monitoring policy.

### Molecular diagnosis of visceral herpes zoster [^115SdVX1]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Patients with disseminated herpes zoster may present with severe abdominal pain that results from visceral involvement of varicella-zoster-virus infection. In the absence of cutaneous eruptions of herpes zoster, visceral herpes zoster is extremely difficult to diagnose. This diagnostic difficulty has the potential to cause devastating delays in treatment. We report a case series of four patients with visceral herpes zoster in whom large concentrations of DNA from varicella zoster virus were detectable in blood by PCR before signs of infection appeared on the skin, thus enabling early diagnosis and treatment.

### Diagnostic usefulness of varicella-zoster virus real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA in saliva and plasma specimens from patients with herpes zoster [^113JL5ww]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the diagnostic usefulness of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for detecting varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection and reactivation of VZV, using DNA extracted from saliva and plasma specimens obtained from subjects with suspected herpes zoster and from healthy volunteers during stressful and nonstressful conditions.

Methods

There were 52 patients with a diagnosis of herpes zoster (group 1), 30 with a diagnosis of zoster-mimicking disease (group 2), and 27 healthy volunteers (group 3). Saliva and plasma samples were evaluated for VZV DNA by real-time PCR analysis.

Results

Among patients with suspected herpes zoster (ie, patients in groups 1 and 2), the sensitivity of PCR analysis of salivary DNA for detecting VZV (88%; 95% confidence interval, 74%-95%) was significantly higher than that of PCR analysis of plasma DNA (28%; 95% CI, 16%-44%; P < .001), whereas the specificity of PCR analysis of salivary DNA (100%; 95% CI, 88%-100%) was similar to that of PCR analysis of plasma DNA (100%; 95% CI, 78%-100%; P > .99). VZV DNA was not detected in saliva and plasma samples from group 3 (0%; 95% CI, 0%-14%).

Conclusions

Real-time PCR analysis of salivary DNA is more sensitive than that of plasma DNA for detecting VZV among patients with suspected herpes zoster. We found no subclinical reactivation of VZV in group 3 following exposure to common stressful conditions.

Varicella‑zoster virus (VZV) in immunosuppressed patients — serostatus and risk of zoster or dissemination: VZV is one of the 2 most frequent herpesviruses to cause cutaneous infection in immunosuppressed patients, and between 65% and 70% of adult patients are seropositive for VZV. Herpes zoster occurs most frequently during the first year following chemotherapy treatment or following receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or a solid organ transplant (SOT). Depending on the intensity of treatment or type of transplant, 25%–45% develop dermatomal zoster, with a 10%–20% risk of developing dissemination without prompt and effective antiviral therapy.

### Viral load and antibody boosting following herpes zoster diagnosis [^1129wV6F]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

5 Discussion

We showed that baseline, rather than subsequent viral load was the strongest predictor of antibody titre at one, three and six months after an acute shingles episode. Antibody titres remained persistently elevated in shingles patients compared to healthy blood donors for at least six months, with the greatest discrimination between groups occurring at one month post shingles. Antibody titres could discriminate patients with recent shingles from healthy controls, however there was a significant trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

Reactivation of latent VZV is largely kept in check through cell-mediated immunity, with antibodies playing very little role in VZV control. Individuals with severe clinical VZV reactivation including those who develop post-herpetic neuralgia often have high antibody titres, which are believed to correlate with more widespread VZV replication. Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis. The lack of association found between viral loads at one, three and six months and antibody titres at the same and subsequent time points suggests that persistence of serum VZV DNA after shingles may be a function of decay rather than ongoing replication, although this finding needs to be tested in other larger populations.

Antibody titre cut-off values could be used to identify patients with shingles 1–6 months previously, but with a large trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Whether researchers choose to set cut off values to achieve a high sensitivity e.g. when using antibody titre as an initial screening test for recent shingles, or to be highly specific e.g. in a test aimed at diagnostic confirmation, will depend on the nature and context of their research.

This study was limited by relatively small numbers of patients. Data on other potential confounding factors such as ethnicity and immune status in blood donors was lacking, so only age and sex were accounted for in the shingles patient-blood donor analysis. Nevertheless, as these factors were not associated with antibody titre in shingles patients, results are unlikely to have been notably affected.

In conclusion, there is evidence for endogenous boosting of VZV antibody levels by clinical VZV reactivation and the level of boosting is dependent upon baseline viral replication. Additionally, antibody titres could discriminate post-shingles patients from healthy controls, although whether to prioritise specificity or sensitivity would depend on the study question.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) vasculitis — diagnosis and initial management: Stroke associated with CNS infection should be considered a life-threatening emergency and should be triaged accordingly. VZV vasculitis may present with large and small artery strokes with arterial luminal irregularities, beading, or stenosis, and suspected cases should undergo lumbar puncture for anti-VZV immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and polymerase chain reaction; anti-VZV immunoglobulin G has the highest sensitivity of the 3 tests, and a negative VZV polymerase chain reaction does not rule out VZV vasculitis. If suspicion is high, it may be reasonable to treat empirically while awaiting confirmatory tests, and acyclovir is the drug of choice for treatment of VZV infection.

The collection of multiple lesion samples for this enhanced surveillance program allows for the detection of both MPX and VZV by PCR and the opportunity to detect coinfections. As this program continues, it will be important to continue these sample collection procedures to assess variations in the proportion of coinfected cases over time. In addition, an adjustment in the sample testing protocol in country may be prudent. If samples can be tested for both OPX/MPX and VZV at one time, it may help to provide a more comprehensive view of coinfection cases when combined with CDC laboratory results.

### Detection of herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2 and varicella-zoster virus in skin lesions. comparison of real-time PCR, nested PCR and virus isolation [^111kgxxu]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) cause a wide range of signs and symptoms, varying from trivial mucocutaneous lesions to life-threatening infections, especially in immuno-suppressed patients. Since antiviral drugs are available, rapid and sensitive laboratory diagnosis of these virus infections is important.

Objective

To set up and evaluate HSV-1, HSV-2 and VZV qualitative real-time PCR on the Lightcycler system and to compare the results with those of the 'in-house' nested PCR and virus isolation.

Study Design

110 consecutive samples from dermal or genital lesions from patients suspected of having HSV infections and another 110 samples from patients with suspected VZV infections were tested with real-time PCR, nested PCR and virus isolation.

Results

24 samples (22%) were positive for HSV-1 by virus isolation and nested PCR, whereas 26 (24%) were positive by real-time PCR. HSV-2 was detected in 28 samples (25%) by virus isolation, in 41 (37%) by nested PCR and in 40 (36%) by real-time PCR. VZV was isolated in 15 samples (14%) and VZV DNA was detected in 51 samples (46%) by nested PCR as well as by real-time PCR. Nucleic acid amplification increased the detection rate of HSV-2 and VZV DNA in particular compared to virus isolation. No significant difference in sensitivity was found between real-time PCR and nested PCR.

Conclusion

Real-time PCR has the advantage of rapid amplification, a reduced risk for contamination and it is a suitable method for diagnosis of VZV and HSV in specimens from skin lesions.

### A real-time PCR assay to identify and discriminate among wild-type and vaccine strains of varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus in clinical specimens, and comparison with the clinical diagnoses [^111Y65zd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

A real-time PCR assay was developed to identify varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA in clinical specimens from subjects with suspected herpes zoster (HZ; shingles). Three sets of primers and probes were used in separate PCR reactions to detect and discriminate among wild-type VZV (VZV-WT), Oka vaccine strain VZV (VZV-Oka), and HSV DNA, and the reaction for each virus DNA was multiplexed with primers and probe specific for the human beta-globin gene to assess specimen adequacy. Discrimination of all VZV-WT strains, including Japanese isolates and the Oka parent strain, from VZV-Oka was based upon a single nucleotide polymorphism at position 106262 in ORF 62, resulting in preferential amplification by the homologous primer pair. The assay was highly sensitive and specific for the target virus DNA, and no cross-reactions were detected with any other infectious agent. With the PCR assay as the gold standard, the sensitivity of virus culture was 53% for VZV and 77% for HSV. There was 92% agreement between the clinical diagnosis of HZ by the Clinical Evaluation Committee and the PCR assay results.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^1129LaiG]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Varicella zoster, commonly referred to as chickenpox, is a respiratory infectious disease that causes a characteristic red rash and pox on the skin surface. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) which also causes shingles, often referred to as herpes zoster. Chickenpox symptoms typically arise 1–3 weeks after exposure to an infected individual, and a newly infected individual is infectious for around a week starting 1–2 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Symptoms last approximately 2 weeks, when the virus then retreats to the nerve ganglia in the spine. By the age of 15, nearly all children have antibodies to VZV, whether from a natural infection or vaccine. In 10–30% of adults, the latent varicella virus will reactivate and manifest as shingles, typically in adults aged over 60. The VZV vaccine prevents infection with VZV in children while a booster dose, referred to as a shingles vaccine, later in life suppresses VZV reactivation in adults.

### Low sensitivity of commercial assays for varicella zoster virus seropositivity in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114cdtmg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric IBD guidelines recommend assessing varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunity prior to immune suppression. We evaluated the sensitivity of the commercial VZV assay relative to the more sensitive glycoprotein IgG ELISA.

Methods

We evaluated VZV immunity among 176 children with IBD using both commercial and glycoprotein ELISA tests.

Results

Using glycoprotein ELISA, 90% showed VZV immunity versus 69% on commercial assays. Commercial test sensitivity was 77% with 69% false-negative rate and 32% negative predictive value.

Discussion

As commercial VZV assays frequently fail to detect existing immunity in children with IBD, vaccination history should be used to assess VZV immunity.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^111kHZkF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Genital lesions — herpes simplex virus (HSV) diagnostics and typing are described as follows: For suspected cases of HSV genital lesions, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the standard of care (SOC), and NAATs are the preferred diagnostic method because they provide typing to specify HSV type 1 or 2 and are the most sensitive; although direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) can assess specimen adequacy and is more specific than a Tzanck preparation, it is labor-intensive and less sensitive than NAAT. All specimens if positive should be typed to determine if they are HSV-1 or -2 because 12-month recurrence rates are more common with HSV-2 (90%) than HSV-1 (55%). Serology cannot distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 unless a type-specific glycoprotein G (gG)–based assay is performed, and point-of-care tests for HSV-2 may yield false positive results in low-likelihood populations and in pregnant patients testing is not recommended. Most laboratories performing NAATs usually offer HSV-1 and -2 as well as VZV from the same specimen; typically, a generic lesion swab in universal transport medium (UTM) that can be transported at room temperature is acceptable, and consultation with the laboratory before specimen collection is appropriate.

The laboratory also conducts free testing for physicians and scientists participating in various epidemiologic and laboratory-based studies. Types of tests Polymerase chain reaction PCR is the most useful laboratory test for confirming suspected varicella and herpes zoster. PCR can detect VZV DNA rapidly and sensitively in skin lesions. Laboratory guidelines
- The preferred diagnosis method is a demonstration of VZV DNA by PCR tests from a clinical specimen, ideally scabs, vesicular fluid, or cells from the base of a lesion.
- PCR is also useful for confirming breakthrough varicella.

Other methods, such as DFA and culture, are available for diagnosis but are less sensitive and specific than PCR.
- Positive serologic test for varicella-zoster immunoglobulin M antibody when a varicella-like rash is present.
- Four-fold or greater rise in serum varicella immunoglobulin G antibody titer by any standard serologic assay between acute and convalescent sera.

Key points
- This varicella-zoster virus laboratory information applies to testing and diagnosis of both primary VZV infection and reactivation.
- The preferred diagnosis method is detecting VZV DNA by PCR from scabs, vesicular fluid, or cells from the lesion's base. Watch video illustrating methods for collecting specimens: Collection and shipping for VZV serologic assays Refer to the Infectious Disease Laboratories Test Directory entry for each test. Collection for VZV PCR/genotyping Refer to the Infectious Disease Laboratories Test Directory entry for each test. The preferred method for a laboratory diagnosis of VZV infection is a polymerase chain reaction test. Ideally, the presence of viral DNA should be demonstrated in vesicular fluid, maculopapular lesions, or scabs from lesions. Recommended methods Polyester swab This method is best suited for sampling vesicular lesions.
- Use a sterile needle to unroof the top of the vesicle.
- Use a sterile swab to vigorously wipe the base of the lesion to collect vesicular fluid. Apply enough pressure to collect epithelial cells without causing bleeding. Important: Collect infected epithelial cells from the base of the lesion which usually contain virus. Swab type: CDC recommends swabs made with polyester tips and plastic stems. Do not use swabs with wooden stems. Glass slide This method is critical for the collection of material from maculopapular lesions.
- Rake the edge of the slide over the selected lesion, abrading the lesion with sufficient vigor to ensure that skin cells are gathered onto the slide.
- Use a sterile polyester swab to scrub the abraded lesion and collect the material collected on the edge of the slide. Collecting scabs Scabs are excellent samples for PCR detection of VZV DNA.

Whenever present, lift scabs off the skin. Then transfer directly into break-resistant, snap-cap or screw-top tubes. Collecting other specimen types For some disease presentations with a suspected VZV etiology, samples of cerebral spinal fluid; blood; biopsy; or autopsy tissue may also be collected and shipped.

Laboratory Testing Laboratory testing can be useful, particularly in cases with less typical clinical presentations. PCR is the most useful test Polymerase chain reaction can detect VZV DNA rapidly and sensitively. PCR is the most useful laboratory test for confirming cases of herpes zoster. PCR testing and genotyping can also distinguish between wild-type and vaccine strains of VZV. Specimens for PCR testing.
- Swabs of unroofed vesicular lesions and scabs from lesions are ideal.
- During acute disease, the viral DNA can also be detected in saliva, but saliva specimens are less reliable for herpes zoster than they are for varicella.
- In cases involving atypical presentations, severe complications, or death, other specimen types can be useful. Other Tests Direct fluorescent antibody and Tzanck smear have rapid turnaround times but are not recommended because of their limited sensitivity.

DFA is substantially less sensitive than PCR, and Tzanck is not specific for VZV. Moreover, real-time PCR protocols can be completed within one day. Serologic methods have limited use for laboratory confirmation of herpes zoster and should only be used when suitable specimens for PCR testing are not available.
- Patients with herpes zoster can mount a transient IgM response and would be expected to mount a memory IgG response.
- However, a positive IgM ELISA result could indicate primary VZV infection, reinfection, or reactivation.
- Primary infection can be distinguished from reactivation or reinfection with VZV IgG avidity testing:

- High avidity IgG in the context of VZV IgM is indicative of a remote infection.
- Low avidity IgG indicates a primary infection. Measuring acute and convalescent sera also has limited value, since it is difficult to detect an increase in IgG for laboratory diagnosis of herpes zoster.

In instances where it is difficult to distinguish between varicella and disseminated herpes zoster in people with compromised immune systems, consider if the patient has a history of VZV exposure, history of a rash that began with a dermatomal pattern, and results of VZV antibody testing during or before the time of rash. This may help with diagnosis.
