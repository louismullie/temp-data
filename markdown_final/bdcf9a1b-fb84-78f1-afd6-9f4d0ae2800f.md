## Question

Are there any specific cardiac arrhythmias associated with energy drink consumption?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether specific cardiac arrhythmias are associated with energy drink consumption. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and whether we are talking about acute versus chronic effects. Then, I should verify the mechanistic plausibility, especially around repolarization and QT effects. Next, I will examine randomized and controlled human data for QTc changes and hemodynamics. After that, I should review case series and reports for concrete arrhythmia phenotypes. Then, I will consider vulnerable populations and co-ingestants. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and outline practical clinical implications and uncertainties that remain.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't overgeneralize. The question is about identifying specific arrhythmias temporally linked to energy drink exposure, distinguishing acute effects from chronic patterns, and separating the effects of caffeine alone from multi-ingredient energy drinks that also contain taurine, guarana, B-vitamins, and sugars, which may have distinct electrophysiologic interactions [^1122HwD8] [^117B81No].

> I need to check mechanistic plausibility before attributing causality. Energy drinks acutely increase sympathetic tone and catecholamines, raise blood pressure, and can prolong ventricular repolarization, which together lower arrhythmic thresholds; importantly, several randomized studies show reproducible QTc prolongation on the order of roughly 10–20 ms within 1–2 hours of high-volume intake, a magnitude that, while modest on average, crosses thresholds used in drug safety evaluation and can exceed 50 ms in susceptible individuals, which is clinically meaningful for torsades risk [^111Mid64] [^111SwnES] [^111y2LFM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about caffeine alone. I should double-check whether the QT effects are attributable to caffeine or to other ingredients. Controlled trials comparing energy drinks to matched-dose caffeine show greater QTc effects with energy drinks than with caffeine alone, supporting a class effect beyond caffeine; mechanistic work in whole-heart models also shows that taurine and caffeine can abbreviate action potential duration and effective refractory periods in ways that facilitate reentry, which is a plausible proarrhythmic mechanism in the right substrate [^113661df] [^111Mid64] [^111Mid64].

> Next, I should review the randomized and controlled human data to quantify effect sizes. In a crossover RCT of 34 healthy adults, 32 oz of energy drink increased Bazett-corrected QT by about 18–20 ms versus placebo over 4 hours, with sustained effects and concurrent rises in peripheral and central blood pressure; smaller studies using the same high-volume paradigm have shown similar directions of effect, and some noncontrolled cohorts even reported a high proportion with QTc > 500 ms, though those designs are more vulnerable to bias and should be interpreted cautiously [^111Mid64] [^1179s6Km] [^113GxSxJ].

> I will now examine case-based evidence to identify specific arrhythmia phenotypes. Case series and reports repeatedly document atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, and torsades de pointes in temporal proximity to energy drink consumption, often in adolescents and young adults without overt structural heart disease; some cases reveal previously unrecognized long QT syndrome or catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, suggesting energy drinks can unmask latent channelopathies or adrenergically mediated arrhythmias [^116K1FuD] [^113PTWKy] [^112S56Yc] [^111z9Ts4].

> Let me consider vulnerable populations and modifiers of risk. Individuals with congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, those on QT-prolonging drugs, patients with electrolyte disturbances, and people with structural heart disease appear at heightened risk; youth and caffeine-naïve individuals may also be more susceptible due to limited tolerance and higher exposure per kilogram, and co-ingestion with alcohol or other stimulants compounds risk through autonomic effects and pharmacokinetic interactions [^112S56Yc] [^1122HwD8] [^117YEfJq].

> But wait, what if the arrhythmias are just caffeine effects and not specific to energy drinks? I should confirm the distinction. Large observational cohorts generally do not show increased atrial or ventricular ectopy with habitual caffeinated coffee, and a recent randomized trial in patients with AF found fewer recurrences with caffeinated coffee versus abstinence, reinforcing that caffeine alone is not inherently proarrhythmic in most people; in contrast, the controlled energy-drink studies show effects beyond matched-dose caffeine, supporting a formulation-specific risk signal rather than a generic caffeine effect [^112t7Scs] [^1131QPEA] [^113661df].

> I should double-check the strength and consistency of evidence before concluding. Multiple randomized, placebo-controlled studies converge on acute QTc prolongation and blood pressure increases with energy drinks, case series consistently catalog serious arrhythmias including AF and VT/VF, and mechanistic data provide biologic plausibility; while causality cannot be proven definitively given ethical constraints, the triangulation of controlled physiologic changes, temporal clinical events, and mechanistic coherence supports a causal contribution in susceptible contexts [^111Mid64] [^1179s6Km] [^116K1FuD] [^11319CsV].

> Let me synthesize the specific arrhythmias most convincingly associated with energy drink consumption. The clearest signals are for atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation including torsades de pointes, and frequent premature ventricular contractions, with the unifying mechanism being repolarization instability from QTc prolongation and adrenergic surges, particularly when combined with substrate such as long QT syndrome, electrolyte derangements, or structural heart disease [^116K1FuD] [^112S56Yc] [^111Mid64].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are practical. For patients with palpitations, syncope, or documented arrhythmias, I should ask explicitly about energy drink use and counsel avoidance, especially in those with long QT risk, on QT-prolonging drugs, or with structural heart disease; for the general population, moderation is prudent, and high-volume, rapid ingestion should be discouraged pending better safety data, while clinicians should maintain vigilance for channelopathies in unexplained events after energy drink exposure [^117DH4Te] [^112S56Yc] [^1122HwD8].

> Hold on, I should verify uncertainties and future directions so we don't overstate certainty. Dose-response thresholds, individual ingredient contributions, and long-term chronic effects remain incompletely defined; ongoing and proposed studies using rigorous ECG phenotyping, positive controls, and stratification by genetic risk may clarify who is most vulnerable and whether regulatory thresholds for QT effects should be applied to these beverages, mirroring drug-safety standards [^111Mid64] [^111LGWbt] [^113fcgEA].

Energy drinks are associated with **QT prolongation** [^111Mid64] and **torsades de pointes** [^112S56Yc], especially in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or on QT-prolonging drugs [^116Yneh4]. They also increase risk of **atrial fibrillation** [^116K1FuD] and **ventricular arrhythmias**, including ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest, particularly with high intake or co-ingestion with alcohol or other stimulants [^116K1FuD] [^111z9Ts4]. Mechanisms include caffeine, taurine, and other stimulants that prolong repolarization, increase sympathetic tone, and destabilize cardiac electrophysiology [^11319CsV] [^111y2LFM]. Patients with underlying heart disease, channelopathies, or on QT-prolonging medications should avoid energy drinks [^116Yneh4].

## Specific cardiac arrhythmias associated with energy drinks

### QT prolongation and torsades de pointes

- **QT prolongation**: Energy drinks consistently prolong QTc by ~10–20 ms in healthy volunteers [^111Mid64] [^1179s6Km], with some reaching > 500 ms, a threshold linked to torsades risk [^113GxSxJ].

- **Torsades de pointes**: Case reports and a small RCT show torsades in patients with congenital long QT syndrome exposed to energy drinks [^112S56Yc] [^116Yneh4].

- **Mechanism**: Caffeine, taurine, and other stimulants prolong repolarization and increase sympathetic tone, destabilizing ventricular electrophysiology [^11319CsV] [^111y2LFM].

---

### Atrial fibrillation

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Energy drinks are linked to new-onset AF, particularly in young adults without prior heart disease [^11477735] [^114MJWfn].

- **Mechanism**: Acute effects include increased atrial ectopy, shortened atrial refractory periods, and autonomic imbalance favoring AF triggers [^11477735].

---

### Ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest

- **Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation**: Multiple case reports and series document VT/VF and sudden cardiac arrest temporally linked to energy drinks, often with high intake or co-ingestants [^116K1FuD] [^111z9Ts4].

- **Mechanism**: Sympathetic surge, QT prolongation, and ischemia from coronary spasm or demand ischemia contribute to malignant ventricular arrhythmias [^11319CsV] [^114CysrW].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting associations

| **Arrhythmia type** | **Evidence level** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| QT prolongation | High | - RCTs show consistent QTc prolongation (~10–20 ms) [^111Mid64] [^1179s6Km] <br/> - Some subjects exceed 500 ms [^113GxSxJ] |
| Torsades de pointes | Moderate | - Case reports and RCT in LQTS patients [^112S56Yc] [^116Yneh4] |
| Atrial fibrillation | Moderate | - Case reports and echocardiographic studies [^11477735] [^114MJWfn] |
| Ventricular arrhythmias | Moderate | - Case reports and series [^116K1FuD] [^111z9Ts4] |

---

## Populations at increased risk

Certain groups are at **higher risk** of energy drink–related arrhythmias:

- **Congenital long QT syndrome**: Energy drinks can unmask or exacerbate LQTS and provoke torsades [^112S56Yc] [^116Yneh4].

- **Patients on QT-prolonging drugs**: Additive QT effects increase torsades risk [^116Yneh4].

- **Structural heart disease**: Energy drinks can trigger arrhythmias in patients with cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease [^115BG72E].

- **Adolescents and young adults**: High consumption and caffeine naivety increase susceptibility [^114K1aFs] [^117YEfJq].

---

## Mechanisms underlying arrhythmias

Several **mechanisms** are implicated:

- **QT prolongation**: Direct effects of caffeine, taurine, and other stimulants on repolarization [^11319CsV] [^111Mid64].

- **Increased sympathetic tone**: Catecholamine surge from caffeine and stimulants lowers arrhythmic thresholds [^111y2LFM].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Caffeine-induced diuresis and metabolic effects can precipitate arrhythmias [^117P4yPt].

- **Coronary vasospasm**: Energy drinks can cause ischemia-related arrhythmias in susceptible patients [^114CysrW].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidance emphasizes **caution** and selective avoidance:

- **Avoid in high-risk patients**: Those with LQTS, on QT-prolonging drugs, or with structural heart disease should avoid energy drinks [^116Yneh4].

- **Limit intake**: General advice is to limit consumption, especially in adolescents and young adults [^114K1aFs] [^114M7uQT].

- **Monitor symptoms**: Patients with palpitations or syncope should be screened for energy drink use and underlying arrhythmias [^116K1FuD].

---

Energy drinks are associated with **QT prolongation**, **torsades de pointes**, **atrial fibrillation**, and **ventricular arrhythmias**, with risk modulated by dose, individual susceptibility, and co-ingestants. Clinicians should counsel high-risk patients to avoid these beverages and remain vigilant for energy drink–related arrhythmias in younger patients presenting with palpitations or syncope.

Energy drinks (ED) are increasingly popular, especially among adolescents and young adults. They are marketed as enhancers of energy, alertness, and physical performance. ED contain high doses of caffeine and other active ingredients. Their safety has come under question due to reports temporally linking ED consumption with serious cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In this article, we report 2 cases of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in young patients after consuming ED. We also review the ingredients of ED, the physiologic effects on the cardiovascular system, and the available evidence suggesting arrhythmogenecity.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia in the United States and worldwide. Caffeine, alcohol, and, more recently, energy drinks are the most commonly consumed beverages in daily living, especially by young individuals. Several questions have been raised about the implications of caffeine, alcohol, and energy drinks in cardiovascular health, especially in triggering AF. This review focuses on the role of these commonly consumed beverages as a cause of AF, with special emphasis of potential mechanisms and studies addressing this issue.

### Review of published cases of adverse cardiovascular events after ingestion of energy drinks [^116K1FuD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Energy drink (ED) consumption has been linked to several adverse event reports, but there is limited data on related cardiovascular (CV) complications. We describe clinical characteristics, ED consumption profile, co-ingestions, and results of cardiovascular testing in a series of cardiovascular event reports temporally related to ED consumption from the literature. We searched PubMed and Embase for case reports in peer-reviewed journals from January 1, 1980, to February 1, 2013, in which an acute CV event was associated temporally with ED consumption. We identified 14 eligible articles involving 15 cases (5 atrial arrhythmias, 5 ventricular arrhythmias, 1 QT prolongation, 4 ST-segment elevations). Two additional cases of cardiac arrest from our institution are included. Of these 17 cases of ED-related acute CV events (13 male cases; 15 cases aged < 30 years, age range 13 to 58 years), only 1 had minor previous cardiac disease. Cardiac investigations did not reveal any predisposing cardiac abnormality in the majority of cases. Of the 11 cases related to a serious event (i.e., cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmia, or ST-segment elevations), 5 reported acute heavy ED consumption, 4 reported co-ingestions with alcohol or other drugs, and 2 were found to have a channelopathy. Potential mechanisms of ED-related cardiac events are reviewed. In conclusion, several adverse CV events after consuming ED have been reported in the literature. Although causality cannot be inferred from our series, physicians should routinely inquire about ED consumption in relevant cases, and vulnerable consumers such as youth should be advised that caution is warranted with heavy consumption and/or with concomitant alcohol or drug ingestion.

### Energy drinks: another cause of QT prolongation? [^116Yneh4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Of course, most energy drink consumers do not have a genetic LQTS. Is there evidence that energy drink–induced QT prolongation poses a risk to these individuals? A MEDLINE search finds only a single case of torsade de pointes, the characteristic arrhythmia caused by QT prolongation, linked to energy drink consumption (ie, the young woman with LQTS‐1 described above). 8 Torsade de pointes can rapidly progress to ventricular fibrillation, and it is impossible to know whether QT prolongation played a role in any of the unexplained deaths or cardiac arrests linked to energy drinks. But with millions of consumers and > 20 000 emergency department visits yearly involving energy drinks, the role of QT prolongation would be more compelling if there were other reports of torsade de pointes.

Concerns about the short‐ and long‐term health risks of energy drinks extend well beyond their effect on ventricular repolarization. These concerns have led to a wide range of recommendations, including stricter requirements for product labeling, restrictions on caffeine content, limitations on the marketing and sale to children and adolescents, and educating parents, teachers, and healthcare providers about the health risks of energy drinks. On the research front, the observation that energy drinks can cause QT prolongation, a well‐established risk factor for sudden death, warrants further investigation. Which ingredient or combination of ingredients is responsible for this effect on repolarization? Do some products pose a greater risk than others? What effect does the addition of alcohol or other drugs have on the electrocardiographic effect of energy drinks? What role does QT prolongation play in the sudden deaths linked to energy drinks? Further research is not needed to support the sensible recommendation that patients with a genetic LQTS should be cautioned about the risks of energy drinks. Likewise, individuals who are taking QT‐prolonging medications as well as those with coronary or structural heart disease should be advised of this risk.

### Energy drinks: another cause of QT prolongation? [^112S56Yc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

So, does energy drink–induced QT prolongation pose a serious health risk? The most obvious at‐risk group would be those with a genetic long‐QT syndrome (LQTS); a health risk in this group is supported by 2 case reports and a small clinical trial. A previously healthy 22‐year‐old woman experienced cardiac arrest after drinking 6 cans of energy drink over 4 hours. 8 The initial ECG showed torsade de pointes, and her QTc shortly after arrival was prolonged at 526 ms, normalizing to 419 ms over the next few days. Subsequent genetic testing confirmed LQTS‐1. In a similar case, a 13‐year‐old girl who presented with chest pain and palpitations after consuming an energy drink had a prolonged QTc interval on admission (561 ms) that fully normalized by the next day. 9 Genetic testing again confirmed LQTS‐1. Finally, in a randomized, placebo‐controlled study of subjects with familial LQTS, the QTc interval increased by > 50 ms after energy drink in 3 of 24 patients. 10 Perhaps some of the cardiac arrests linked to energy drinks were the result of unmasking a previously undiagnosed genetic ion channelopathy.

### Sudden cardiac arrest occurring in temporal proximity to consumption of energy drinks [^111z9Ts4]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Energy drinks potentially can trigger life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. It has been postulated that the highly stimulating and unregulated ingredients alter heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac contractility, and cardiac repolarization in a potentially proarrhythmic manner.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe our experience regarding sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurring in proximity to energy drink consumption in patients with underlying genetic heart diseases.

Methods

The electronic medical records of all SCA survivors with proven arrhythmias referred to the Mayo Clinic Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic for evaluation were reviewed to identify those who consumed an energy drink before their event. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, documented energy drink consumption, and temporal relationship of energy drink consumption to SCA were obtained.

Results

Among 144 SCA survivors, 7 (5%; 6 female; mean age at SCA 29 ± 8 years) experienced an unexplained SCA associated temporally with energy drink consumption. Of these individuals, 2 had long QT syndrome and 2 had catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; the remaining 3 were diagnosed with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Three patients (43%) consumed energy drinks regularly. Six patients (86%) required a rescue shock, and 1 (14%) was resuscitated manually. All SCA survivors have quit consuming energy drinks and have been event-free since.

Conclusion

Overall, 5% of SCA survivors experienced SCA in proximity to consuming an energy drink. Although larger cohort studies are needed to elucidate the incidence/prevalence and quantify its precise risk, it seems prudent to sound an early warning on this potential risk.

### Energy drinks: another cause of QT prolongation? [^111SwnES]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the first product appeared on US shelves in 1997, the caffeinated energy drink market has grown dramatically, with an estimated annual revenue of $10 billion in 2018. Advertising for products such as Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar emphasizes claims of enhanced energy level, mental focus, and physical performance. This marketing strategy resonates with teenagers and young adults, the dominant consumer group for these products. As the energy drink market has grown, so too has awareness of their health risks. 1, 2 Between 2004 and 2014, 34 deaths linked to energy drinks were reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, and serious adverse events described in the literature include cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and seizures. 3 Despite multiple articles in the medical literature and lay press describing the risks of energy drinks, especially when combined with alcohol, growth of this industry shows little sign of slowing.

Although the health risks of energy drinks have been widely recognized, the mechanism responsible for the cardiovascular complications associated with them remains uncertain. The acute hemodynamic effects of energy drinks in healthy volunteers have been well described: a modest increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (in the range of 3–5 mm Hg) with little change in heart rate. Although transient hemodynamic changes of this degree are unlikely to be harmful in the young consumers of energy drinks, the rapid ingestion of a large volume by a susceptible individual may result in potentially more dangerous changes. In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Shah and colleagues 4 test the hypothesis that energy drinks can cause QT‐interval prolongation, a well‐recognized risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. Previous small studies of the electrocardiographic effect of energy drinks, some lacking a placebo control, have reached conflicting conclusions. Using a double‐blinded crossover trial design, the effect of 2 different caffeinated energy drinks and a caffeine‐free placebo drink on the QT interval was assessed in healthy volunteers with a normal QT interval at baseline. Both energy drinks produced an average maximal increase in heart rate–corrected QT interval (QTc) of 18 to 20 ms that persisted up to 4 hours after consumption. In contrast, the placebo drink was followed by only a small transient increase in QTc. Although no subject developed a QTc > 500 ms, both energy drinks resulted in QTc prolongation > 50 ms in 2 subjects, a range clearly associated with increased risk of arrhythmia. The effect of the energy drinks on blood pressure and heart rate was similar to that observed in previous studies.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^112uQYVg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Energy drinks are a growing industry with a market value predicted to reach $61 billion by 2021. 1 It is estimated that about 30% of teenagers between the ages of 12 through 17 years in the United States consume energy drinks on a regular basis. 2 A study of military personnel found that nearly 45% of deployed service members consumed at least 1 energy drink per day with 14% drinking ≥ 3 daily. 3 Although commonly promoted as supplements that can boost performance and cognition, these drinks have also been reported to have numerous detrimental side effects, particularly cardiovascular and neurological in nature. 4, 5, 6 The number of annual emergency department visits involving energy drinks increased from 10 068 in 2007 to 20 783 in 2011. 7 According to the Food and Drug Administration, there have been 34 deaths attributed to energy drinks warranting investigation into the safety of these beverages. 8

Energy drink consumption has been associated with cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, spontaneous coronary dissection, and coronary vasospasm. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 This association is strengthened with studies showing increased platelet aggregation, increased systolic blood pressure (SBP), and QTc prolongation. 17, 18, 19, 20 QT/QTc interval prolongation is a biologically plausible reason for the sudden cardiac arrest associated with energy drinks and QTc prolongation places patients at increased risk for developing torsades de pointes, which can lead to fatal ventricular arrhythmias. 21 Several small studies have demonstrated mild QTc prolongation with energy drink consumption but the data remain controversial because of energy drink dose and study design‐related confounders. 19, 20, 22, 23 To validate previous electrocardiographic findings and to assess the differences between energy drink types, we conducted a randomized, double‐masked, placebo‐controlled, crossover study in young healthy volunteers.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^113BoVz1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are currently more than 500 energy drink products available on the market purported to boost physical and mental alertness. 1 In line with their increased popularity is a coinciding rise in energy drink–associated emergency department visits and deaths, which has led to questions about their true safety profile. 2, 3, 4 In a review of energy drink–associated adverse cardiovascular events, abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial and ventricular fibrillation, ST elevation, and QT prolongation have been reported. 5 However, the exact relationship between energy drinks and these adverse events has gone primarily unexplained.

Energy drinks usually consist of caffeine plus proprietary energy blends that vary between products. Caffeine has been around for centuries and is generally recognized as safe in doses less than 400 mg by the Food and Drug Administration. 6 Caffeine, a natural methylxanthine, acts as a central nervous stimulant in humans by antagonizing adenosine receptors, leading to additional cardiovascular effects such as peripheral vasoconstriction and subsequent increased blood pressure (BP). 7, 8 Caffeine alone is not suspected to induce any ECG changes in healthy volunteers at a dose of 400 mg. 9 Typically, caffeine toxicity–related adverse events have only been observed in case studies where doses far exceed 400 mg. 10, 11

Although the cardiovascular safety profile of caffeine has been relatively well established, there is little published literature on the electrophysiologic and hemodynamic changes with multi‐ingredient energy drinks. We conducted a randomized controlled trial assessing the cardiovascular safety of high‐volume energy drink consumption.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^111y2LFM]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — acute cardiovascular effects in healthy people include marked short‑term hemodynamic and electrocardiographic changes. Increased norepinephrine levels of 74% have been noted, and 1 to 2 h after consumption healthy individuals usually have a ~ 6- to 10-mm Hg rise in systolic and 3 to 6 mm Hg rise in diastolic blood pressure with heart rate increasing approximately 3 to 7 bpm; in apparently healthy persons QTc prolongation up to 22 to 25 ms 1 to 2 h after consumption has been described.

### Energy drink consumption and cardiac complications: a case for caution [^114MJWfn]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

We present a case of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in a 28-year-old previously healthy man in the context of daily consumption of 2 Monster energy drinks and 2 to 3 beers. We have obtained consent from this patient to present his case. Our observation adds to the developing literature describing an association between highly caffeinated drinks and adverse cardiovascular events. The previous cases in the literature and the proposed underlying mechanisms of this association are briefly discussed in this article. With the rising popularity of energy drinks, clinicians should be aware of their arrhythmogenic potential and consider screening for these products in patients who present with otherwise unexplained arrhythmias.

### Alcohol and arrhythmias [^114UB1Hb]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The association between alcohol consumption and abnormalities of heart rate and rhythm has long been recognized. Significant attention has focused on the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) with excessive alcohol intake. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of these relationships and provided additional insights into potentially arrhythmogenic mechanisms. However, considerable uncertainty remains, such as the level of consumption at which harm begins and whether alcohol plays a role in other arrhythmias. This review characterizes the spectrum of conduction abnormalities and heart rhythm disorders in relation to alcohol consumption. In addition, it discusses the latest epidemiologic and experimental evidence, the potential importance of beverage type and constituent ingredients, and conflicting information on drink definitions, thresholds, and recommendations.

### Effect of dietary factors on cardiac rhythm [^115yAWTL]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The interaction between arrhythmias and certain lifestyle factors such as obesity and alcohol consumption is well-established. There is significant public and professional interest in the role of various diets, vitamins, and minerals in cardiovascular health. However, many widely held beliefs are not supported by the literature. There is limited evidence for routine magnesium and omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids supplementation, while coffee, tea, nuts, antioxidant vitamins, and even chocolate may have some antiarrhythmic properties. Saturated fat, added salt, and excessive energy drink consumption appear to be harmful for patients with rhythm disorders. However most recommendations are based on observation studies, and this remains a fertile area for further research.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^1132eRoj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

QTc prolongation is a recognized marker of increased risk for fatal arrhythmias. Prolongation of the QT/QTc interval by more than 60 ms from baseline or a value > 500 ms is a marker for life‐threatening arrhythmias. For this reason, several published studies have assessed QT/QTc effects post energy drink consumption. This is one of the first caffeine‐controlled studies that shows significant QTc prolongation of ≈10 ms 2 hours after high‐volume energy drink consumption in young healthy volunteers. It is possible that previous published studies showed a lack of effect due to studying a lower dose of energy drink (250–750 mL), monitoring for an insufficient amount of time (30–240 minutes), or not having a control arm. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 It also appears that the product and dose used in our study was different from the other studies, which might explain our significant findings. Our findings are similar to another study (n = 27), which used the same dose as ours and found a significant 6‐ms prolongation in QTc at 2 hours when compared with placebo. 20 Further, in a noncontrolled study (n = 14) using the same dose (2 cans) as in our study, 57% of participants had a QTc > 500 ms post consumption. 21 In contrast, a study by Brothers et al 22 (n = 15), comparing low‐ and moderate‐dose energy drinks, coffee, and water, found no changes in the QTc interval.

Study Limitations

Our results should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations. Importantly, our results only appear to be significant relative to the caffeine group, and the change from baseline post energy drinks is not alarming. Of note, the risk of arrhythmia may be negligible because the QTc difference is transient. Currently, we cannot explain the QTc reduction in the caffeine arm. We did not utilize a true placebo arm in this study, which may be critical for future studies. As such, in another study using a noncaffeinated placebo, a mild reduction in QTc was also evident. 20 The hemodynamic changes may be benign if not sustained with chronic use. While caffeine alone is not expected to shorten the QTc interval, this possibility cannot be ruled out. We did not control for food intake post baseline measurement on study days. Food intake has been linked to shortening of the QTc interval, which could possibly explain our discordant findings. 45 We also used the machine‐calculated values and did not hand measure the ECG parameters. The latter is considered as the gold standard by some experts. Our results can only be generalized to the time points specified in the study. Consumption of 946 mL (32 ounces) of an energy drink over 45 minutes may not be representative of normal consumption patterns. However, it is important to note that 710‐mL (24 ounces) energy drink cans are readily available in the market and it appears that serious adverse events may be associated with a higher volume of consumption. 46 T‐wave peak to T‐wave end interval analysis is emerging as a superior marker of arrhythmic risk and future studies should evaluate not only the QT/QTc interval, but also the transmural dispersion of ventricular repolarization to accurately depict energy drink–related arrhythmic risk. 47 Although our sample size mimics some previous published studies, future studies may need to employ a larger sample size to capture differences in sex or dosing. 25 Since this was a proof‐of‐concept study, we were not powered for multiple comparisons and, as a result, the reported P values are not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

The interaction between arrhythmia episodes and certain lifestyle factors such as obesity and alcohol is well established. There is significant public and professional interest in the role of caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and energy drinks in cardiovascular health. However, many widely held beliefs are not supported by evidence. This study provides a comprehensive review of the impact of caffeinated beverages on cardiac rhythm.

Conclusions

Caffeinated energy drinks significantly prolong the QTc interval and raise brachial and central blood pressure post‐acute exposure. Further investigation is warranted on whether an individual ingredient or a unique combination leads to the observed electrophysiological and hemodynamic changes. The impact of long‐term energy drinks consumption remains unknown.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^111Mid64]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Energy drinks have been linked to an increase in emergency room visits and deaths. We aim to determine the impact of energy drinks on electrocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters in young healthy volunteers. Methods and Results A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers. Participants consumed 32 oz of either energy drink A, energy drink B, or placebo within 60 minutes on 3 study days with a 6-day washout period in between. The primary end point of QT c interval and secondary end points of QT interval, PR interval, QRS duration, heart rate, and brachial and central blood pressures were measured at baseline, and every 30 minutes for 240 minutes. A repeated-measures 2-way analysis of variance was performed with the main effects of intervention, time, and an interaction of intervention and time. Thirty-four participants were included (age 22.1 ± 3.0 years). The interaction term of intervention and time was statistically significant for Bazett's corrected QT interval, Fridericia's corrected QT interval, QT, PR, QRS duration, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, central systolic blood pressure, and central diastolic blood pressure (all P < 0.001). The maximum change from baseline in Bazett's corrected QT interval for drinks A, B, and placebo were +17.9 ± 13.9, +19.6 ± 15.8, and +11.9 ± 11.1 ms, respectively (P = 0.005 for ANOVA) (P = 0.04 and < 0.01, respectively compared with placebo). Peripheral and central systolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significantly different compared with placebo (all P < 0.001). Conclusion Energy drinks significantly prolong the QT c interval and raise blood pressure. Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT03196908.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^1179s6Km]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest, controlled study, indicating acute‐consumption of 32 oz of a caffeinated energy drink significantly prolongs the QTc interval when compared with placebo. According to the Food and Drug Administration, QTc prolongation is a well‐established risk factor for arrhythmias, with a prolongation over 10 ms prompting further investigation. 26, 27 Clinically, a QT/QTc interval > 500 ms or a change > 30 ms warrants careful monitoring. 28 Drugs such as ranolazine and terfenadine carry warnings, or have been removed from the market because of prolongation of the mean QT/QTc by 6 ms. 29, 30

Three smaller studies have evaluated the impact of consuming 32 oz of energy drinks on heart rhythm variables. 19, 25, 31 In a non‐controlled study (n = 14) by Kozik et al, 57% of the healthy participants had a QTc > 500 ms after consuming 32 oz of the energy drink. 31 In a small (n = 18) randomized, caffeine‐controlled clinical trial, 32 oz of an energy drink resulted in a significantly higher QTc at 2 hours when compared with the caffeinated control (+0.4 ± 18.4 ms versus −10.4 ± 14.8 ms, respectively; P = 0.02). 19 In another similar placebo‐controlled trial (n = 27), the QTc interval was transiently higher (6 ms) at 2 hours after 32‐oz energy drink consumption when compared with placebo (+3.4 ± 10.7 and −3.2 ± 11.8 ms, respectively; P = 0.030). 25 The results of our study confirm these previous findings and suggest that the QTc changes are generally sustained over the 4 hour monitoring period versus being a transient effect after 32‐oz energy drink consumption.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^113661df]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Caffeine in doses < 400 mg is typically not considered arrhythmogenic, but little is known about the additional ingredients in energy drinks. We evaluated the ECG and blood pressure effects of high‐volume energy drink consumption compared with caffeine alone.

Methods and Results

This was a randomized, double‐blind, controlled, crossover study in 18 young, healthy volunteers. Participants consumed either 946 mL (32 ounces) of energy drink or caffeinated control drink, both of which contained 320 mg of caffeine, separated by a 6‐day washout period. peripheral, and centralmeasurements were obtained at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post study drink consumption. The time‐matched, baseline‐adjusted changes were compared. The change in correctedinterval from baseline in the energy drink arm was significantly higher than the caffeine arm at 2 hours (0.44 ± 18.4 ms versus −10.4 ± 14.8 ms, respectively; P = 0.02). Thec changes were not different at other time points. While both the energy drink and caffeine arms raised systolicin a similar fashion initially, the systolicwas significantly higher at 6 hours when compared with the caffeine arm (4.72 ± 4.67 mm Hg versus 0.83 ± 6.09 mm Hg, respectively; P = 0.01). Heart rate, diastolic, central systolic, and central diastolicshowed no evidence of a difference between groups at any time point. Post energy drink, augmentation index was lower at 6 hours.

Conclusions

The corrected QT interval and systolicwere significantly higher post high‐volume energy drink consumption when compared with caffeine alone. Larger clinical trials validating these findings and evaluation of noncaffeine ingredients within energy drinks are warranted.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^1122HwD8]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — regulatory classification, composition, and risk populations include the following points: the amount of caffeine in over-the-counter products is limited to a maximum of 200 mg per dose, whereas there is no limit for energy drinks; within the FDA, energy drinks are classified as either dietary supplements (require adverse events reporting, but contents not as strictly controlled) or foods/beverages (do not require adverse events reporting, contents strictly controlled); energy drinks usually have herbal blends, taurine, glucuronolactone, and vitamins in high concentrations, whereas traditional beverages do not; reported adverse events include trouble sleeping, anxiety, cardiovascular events, seizures, and even death, with safety concerns especially important in vulnerable populations including those younger than 18 yr, pregnant or breastfeeding women, caffeine naive or sensitive individuals, individuals taking stimulant or other caffeine-based medications, those with certain cardiovascular or medical conditions, and/or heavy consumption patterns — defined as two or more energy drinks in one session; the majority of energy drink-related health concerns appear to be linked to caffeine, caffeine-like additives, and/or other energy drink substances such as taurine that may interact with caffeine, and multiple ingredients with heavy consumption appear to be more problematic than coffee or caffeine alone, particularly in individuals with long QT syndrome.

### Cardiovascular responses to energy drinks in a healthy population: the C-energy study [^113GxSxJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Energy drink consumption has increased significantly over the past decade and is associated with greater than 20,000 emergency department visits per year. Most often these visits are due to cardiovascular complaints ranging from palpitations to cardiac arrest.

Objective

To determine if energy drinks alter; blood pressure, electrolytes, activated bleeding time (ACT), and/or cardiac responses measured with a 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) Holter.

Methods

Continuous ECG data was collected for five hours (30 minutes baseline and 4 hours post consumption [PC]). Subjects consumed 32 ounces of energy drink within one hour and data (vital signs and blood samples) was collected throughout the study period. Paired students t-test and a corresponding non-parametric test (Wilcoxon signed rank) were used for analysis of the data.

Results

Fourteen healthy young subjects were recruited (mean age 28.6 years). Systolic blood pressure (baseline = 132, ± 7.83; PC = 151, ± 11.21; P = 0.001); QTc interval (baseline = 423, ± 22.74; PC = 503, ± 24.56; P < .001); magnesium level (baseline 2.04, ± 0.09; PC = 2.13, ± 0.15; P = 0.05); and calcium level (baseline = 9.31, ± .28; PC = 9.52, ± .22; P = 0.018) significantly increased from baseline. While potassium and ACT fluctuated (some subjects increased their levels while others decreased) these changes were not significant. Eight of the fourteen subjects (57%) developed a QTc > 500 milliseconds PC. Other T-wave changes were noted in 9/14 (64.3%) subjects PC.

Conclusions

Energy drinks increased systolic blood pressure, altered electrolytes, and resulted in repolarization abnormalities. These physiological responses can lead to arrhythmias and other abnormal cardiac responses highlighting the importance that emergency room personnel assess for energy drink consumption and potential toxicity.

### Caffeine and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with heart failure… [^111WEmCr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

These results challenge the intuitive perception that caffeine intake should be limited in patients with heart disease and at risk for arrhythmia. Importance The presumed proarrhythmic action of caffeine is controversial. Few studies have assessed the effect of high doses of caffeine in patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Main Outcomes and Measures Number and percentage of ventricular and supraventricular premature beats assessed by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Results. Exercise test–derived variables, such as ventricular and supraventricular premature beats, duration of exercise, estimated peak oxygen consumption, and heart rate, were not influenced by caffeine ingestion. We observed no increases in ventricular premature beats in patients with higher levels of plasma caffeine concentration compared with lower plasma levels or with the placebo group. The relationship between caffeine consumption and the triggering of arrhythmias has been explored for decades but remains controversial. 1–3 Early experimental studies indicated that caffeine appeared to cause severe ventricular arrhythmias. 4 Evidence from human studies, however, suggests that caffeine might not be arrhythmogenic in most scenarios, 5–8 except. Other subgroups of interest were also analyzed. No significant differences were observed for major arrhythmic outcomes in this analysis. During the treadmill test, there were also no differences in VPBs or SVPBs between both days of the protocol. Likewise, duration of exercise and estimated peak oxygen consumption were similar between groups. The only significant differences were higher values of peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the caffeine group.

In this double-blind randomized crossover clinical trial, we evaluated the acute effects of high-dose caffeine consumption in an HF population at increased risk for arrhythmic events. After 500 mg of caffeine administered over a 5-hour period, we found no association between caffeine ingestion and arrhythmic episodes, even during the physical stress of a treadmill test. The acute ingestion of high doses of caffeine did not induce arrhythmias in patients with chronic systolic HF at rest and during a symptom-limited physical exercise. To date, there is no solid evidence to support the common recommendation to limit moderate caffeine consumption in patients at risk for arrhythmias. Accepted for Publication: August 29, 2016.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^116qx8kX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Although not statistically significant, a trend in the elevation of cSBP at 6 hours post energy drink consumption was evident. Central BP indices are emerging as superior predictors of cardiovascular risk over peripheral BPs as they better reflect vascular compliance and should be further investigated in future studies. 37 The trend towards a higher HR at 2 hours and the lower AI at 6 hours in the energy drink arm are clinically not critical in this acute setting.

Certain populations may consider exercising caution when consuming energy drinks. Those with congenital long QT syndrome are at a predisposed risk for arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes. 38 More commonly, those with acquired long QT syndrome induced by concomitant use of QT/QTc‐prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesaemia are at a similar risk. 39 Obesity has also been associated with prolongation of the QT interval. 40, 41 Interestingly, in one noncontrolled study, the cohort with overweight/obese participants (n = 18) showed significant QT prolongation from baseline after consuming 5 mL/kg of an energy drink (340 ± 57 ms versus 357 ± 54 ms, P = 0.006). 24 The consumption of energy drinks with alcohol is another practice common in some social settings. 42 Caution should be exercised as combining alcohol or illicit substances with energy drinks may trigger or exacerbate untoward cardiovascular events. 43, 44

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^114XjgDr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Energy drinks have been linked to an increase in emergency room visits and deaths. We aim to determine the impact of energy drinks on electrocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters in young healthy volunteers.

Methods and Results

A randomized, double‐masked, placebo‐controlled, crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers. Participants consumed 32 oz of either energy drink A, energy drink B, or placebo within 60 minutes on 3 study days with a 6‐day washout period in between. The primary end point ofc interval and secondary end points ofinterval, interval, duration, heart rate, and brachial and central blood pressures were measured at baseline, and every 30 minutes for 240 minutes. A repeated‐measures 2‐way analysis of variance was performed with the main effects of intervention, time, and an interaction of intervention and time. Thirty‐four participants were included (age 22.1 ± 3.0 years). The interaction term of intervention and time was statistically significant for Bazett's corrected QT interval, Fridericia's corrected QT interval, duration, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, central systolic blood pressure, and central diastolic blood pressure (all P < 0.001). The maximum change from baseline in Bazett's correctedinterval for drinks A, B, and placebo were +17.9 ± 13.9, +19.6 ± 15.8, and +11.9 ± 11.1 ms, respectively (P = 0.005 for) (P = 0.04 and < 0.01, respectively compared with placebo). Peripheral and central systolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significantly different compared with placebo (all P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Energy drinks significantly prolong thec interval and raise blood pressure.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^116Xt6R9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Alcohol intake — ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death: Class I recommendations are that complete abstinence from alcohol is recommended in cases where there is a suspected correlation between alcohol intake and ventricular arrhythmias (Level of Evidence: C), and that persistent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias despite abstinence should be treated as for other diseases, including an ICD, in patients receiving chronic optimal medical therapy and who have reasonable expectation of survival for more than 1 y (Level of Evidence: C). Observational data describe a J-shaped relationship with risk lowest in those with low alcohol intake (i.e., 2 to 6 drinks per week) and higher with high intake (i.e., more than 3 to 5 drinks per day) and with binge drinking; in middle-aged men with established CHD, low to moderate intake (1 to 14 units per week) was not associated with any significant benefit. The guideline notes alcohol's effects on arrhythmia risk correlate directly with amount and duration of intake, even small quantities may be significant in susceptible individuals, and alcohol has a negative inotropic effect that may be masked by catecholamine release.

### Effects of energy drinks on cardiovascular endpoints… [^111LGWbt]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Effects of Energy Drinks on Cardiovascular EndpointsClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview This study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover, proof-of-concept trial designed to examine how energy drinks affect heart rhythm and other health measures in healthy adults aged 18 to 40. This study investigates the cardiovascular safety of energy drinks by examining their effects on electrocardiographic parameters, with a specific focus on the QTc interval. The protocol consists of two phases conducted with 3 healthy volunteers. Phase A evaluates four interventions: 1) energy drink A 2) moxifloxacin 3) caffeine 4) placebo. Phase B evaluates four interventions: 1) energy drink B 2) taurine 3) caffeine + taurine 4) lower dose energy drink A. After an overnight fast participants will consume the study intervention within a 30 minute period.

Over the next 4 hours, the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, hemodynamics, glucose, endothelial function, and side effects will be monitored. Participants maintain minimal physical activity during this period.
- Have a corrected QT interval greater than 450 milliseconds for males or greater than 470 milliseconds for females, determined during the baseline visit
- Presence of any known medical condition, confirmed through participant interview. Examples of these include but not limited to: Dyslipidemia, Thyroid disease, Diabetes, Recurrent headache, Any psychiatric condition or neurological disorder, History of alcohol or drug abuse, Past diagnosis or history of renal insufficiencies, Hepatic dysfunction, Electrolyte imbalances requiring hospitalization.
- **Presence of any known heart/cardiac diseases or conditions such as**: Atrial Fibrillation, History of stroke or heart attack, Hypertension, Heart Failure, Vascular Disease, Family history/Active Long QT Syndrome, Coronary artery disease, Cardiomyopathy, Valvular heart disease, Ventricular arrhythmia, Congenital heart defect, Pericardial disease, Myocarditis.
- Pre-existing risk to tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, or central nervous system side effects

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^114GwbHB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study findings suggest significant prolongation of the QTc interval 2 hours after energy drink consumption when compared with caffeine. Systolic BP remained significantly elevated over the caffeine control at 6 hours post energy drink consumption. Ingredients contained in energy drinks other than caffeine warrant further investigation. Larger clinical trials controlling for the limitations of this study are warranted.

### European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) / European association of cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation (EACPR) position paper on how to prevent atrial fibrillation endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) [^116wDHd9]. Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

Caffeine — atrial fibrillation (AF) risk: The acute effects of high caffeine loading or even intoxication show minor and overall inconsistent evidence for increased susceptibility to supraventricular arrhythmias. High habitual caffeine ingestion in several prospective cohort studies failed to show any significant relationship to incident AF, and heavy coffee drinking failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between caffeine and AF or flutter even in very high consumers (10 cups, 1000 mg/day). Overall, caffeine consumption on a habitual and regular basis does not seem to increase the incidence of AF; however, energy drinks containing other stimulants such as taurine in combination with alcohol may possibly contribute to an increase of risk, at least in youth groups.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^1129P1ch]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In the largest cohort study to ascertain dietary data and quantify cardiac ectopy using 24‐hour Holter monitoring and the first to do so in a community‐based cohort, we found no evidence that chronic consumption of caffeinated products was associated with more PACs or PVCs. Our findings suggest that clinical recommendations advising against the regular consumption of caffeinated products to prevent cardiac ectopy and arrhythmia should be reconsidered. However, whether acute consumption of these caffeinated products affects cardiac ectopy requires further study.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^1114hJDE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Significant prolongation in the QT interval was also evident within the first hour after energy drink consumption but these are thought to be HR related changes. There appears to be a mild PR shortening effect and is currently thought to be clinically non‐significant. Most previous studies used the Bazett's correction formula, but it is known to under correct at low heart rates. 46 Conversely, the Fridericia formula has been shown to be an acceptable alternate correction formula when compared with the Bazett's. 47 Our results are significant regardless of the heart rate correction formula used (Bazett's or Fridericia's). However, it is important to note that QTc prolongation does not necessitate onset of torsades de pointes and is simply a risk factor. While our study incorporates many aspects of a "Thorough QT/QTc Study", assay‐sensitivity could not be assessed due to the lack of a positive‐control (eg, moxifloxacin). 27

Individuals with acquired or congenital long QT syndrome and those with hypertension should be more vigilant and limit their energy drink intake. Based on currently available data, the class of energy drinks, rather than one particular product, warrants use with caution.

### Effect of "energy drink" consumption on hemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters in healthy young adults [^116CXkGf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Energy drinks are frequently purported to improve cognitive function and concentration. However, the cardiovascular effects of these drinks have not been adequately studied.

Objective

To determine the cardiac effects of a commercially available, multicomponent energy drink in healthy volunteers.

Methods

Fifteen healthy adults were included in this prospective study. Individuals who had chronic medical conditions, were on chronic medication, or were pregnant or breast-feeding were excluded. Subjects abstained from caffeine for 48 hours prior to and during the study. In the morning on Day 1 of the study, while subjects were in a fasted state, baseline blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters were measured. Participants then consumed 500 mL (2 cans) of an energy drink and measurements were repeated 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours later. Participants then drank 500 mL of energy drink daily for the next 5 days. Day 1 protocol was repeated on Day 7.

Results

On Days 1 and 7, maximum mean systolic BP (SBP), HR, and QTc interval occurred at 4 hours. Maximum diastolic BP (DBP) occurred at 2 hours on Days 1 and 7. Within 4 hours of energy drink consumption, on Days 1 and 7, respectively, SBP increased by 7.9% (p = 0.006) and 9.6% (p < 0.001), HR increased by 7.8% (p = 0.009) and 11.0% (p < 0.001), and QTc interval increased by 2.4% (p = 0.368) and 5.0% (p = 0.052). DBP increased by 7.0% (p = 0.046) and 7.8% (p = 0.063) within 2 hours of energy drink consumption on Days 1 and 7, respectively.

Conclusions

Although no significant ECG changes were observed, HR increased 5–7 beats/min and SBP increased 10 mm Hg after energy drink consumption.

### Energy drink-induced near-fatal ventricular arrhythmia prevented by an intracardiac defibrillator decades after operative "repair" of tetralogy of Fallot [^115BG72E]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a 45-year old man who experienced a potentially fatal arrhythmia after consumption of multiple energy drinks. At 5 years old, he underwent "repair" of tetralogy of Fallot using a patch in the right ventricular outflow tract, and at age 40 had an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator (AICD) placed. His first AICD shock occurred within 30 minutes after he finished the third energy drink and was preceded by feelings of lightheadedness and severe dizziness. Without the AICD, he likely would have died. The risk of consuming energy drinks in those with underlying structural heart disease and the general population should be determined. Warning labels should be required to inform consumers of the risks posed by these drinks and of appropriate limits for consumption.

### Caffeine consumption and cardiovascular risks: little cause for concern [^1158X5XL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Many studies examining caffeine intake have focused on the number of "cups of coffee" regularly consumed. The epidemiology of coffee consumption itself has changed significantly over the last 2 decades, with the advent of coffee shop franchise expansion over the entire United States in the 1990s and worldwide in the 2000s. In 2015, of the 100 million coffee drinkers in the United States, 30 million had a preference for "speciality beverages" — lattes, cappuccinos, and mochas. 15 In addition, energy drinks sprang into being. For example, Red Bull was first produced in 1987 and sold more than 5.6 billion cans in 2014. 16 Caffeine consumption in isolation appears to be benign, but there is a growing body of evidence that substances such as taurine and guarana in some caffeinated beverages may be unhealthy. There are multiple case reports in the literature regarding arrhythmias and/or death following excessive energy drink consumption prior to exercise. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, there were > 20 000 emergency room visits related to energy drinks in 2011. 17 Many specialized caffeinated beverages have a large number of calories and that may be a health hazard for the development of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus. A restaurant double espresso (2 ounces, 150 mg caffeine, 0 calories) habit may not be problematic, but how healthy is a Venti Peppermint Mocha (20 ounces, 415 mg caffeine, 440 calories) or a Monster Energy (16 ounces, 160 mg caffeine, 300 calories)? 3

Modern technology provides the opportunity to design studies to collect immense amounts of observational data related to arrhythmias. We no longer rely on a 24 to 48‐hour snapshot of a person's life using traditional Holter monitors. We have the capacity to easily implant loop recorders that are smaller than a penlight battery. The procedure is performed with very little risk to the patient, and the device captures and broadcasts wireless data for 3 years or more, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. Smart phone apps are also available that allow individuals to provide other information instantaneously to a study site or coordinator. Individuals who are at high risk to develop a cardiac arrhythmia could have a loop recorder implanted, the participant could transmit beverage consumption information in real time, and the two data sources could be linked and analyzed. These types of research possibilities are opening new opportunities to investigate the occurrence of arrhythmias.

### Genetics of atrial fibrillation [^1179Cbn2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is characterized by rapid and disorganized electrical activation of the atria, leading to uncoordinated contraction. The loss of synchronized contraction leads to stasis of blood in the atria and subsequent predisposition to the development of stroke secondary to formation of atrial thrombi. 1 AF is commonly associated with coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, obesity, and sleep‐apnea syndrome. Alcohol, caffeinated beverages, and energy drinks have also been linked to AF. 2 In some instances, no risk factor can be identified. This has suggested possible underlying genetic predispositions to developing AF. Furthermore, AF has also been shown to occur in families. 3 AF is linked to atrial size and the extent of atrial fibrosis, which are affected by autonomic tone, inflammation, atrial pressure, and genetic factors. 4

In this review, we will discuss genetic alterations implicated in AF and explore their electrophysiological consequences. The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. This work has been exempted from institutional review board approval.

### Caffeine consumption and cardiovascular risks: little cause for concern [^1115oeY1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

In summary, recently published studies, including prospective cohorts, clinical investigations, and meta‐analyses, generally show coffee consumption is safe for the heart. Concerning CVD risk factors, there is little evidence that chronic coffee intake consumption raises blood pressure. Boiled coffee brewing may raise atherogenic lipid levels, and other brewing methods do not appear to have this effect. Finally, there is little risk for atrial or ventricular arrhythmias at most of the levels of caffeine consumption in our society. Future research in this area is especially of interest concerning newer caffeinated beverages with greater amounts of caffeine per serving and with a large number of calories. Implantable and wearable devices have become available to identify cardiac arrhythmias, and this type of technology will provide new opportunities for research, diagnosis, and cardiovascular care.

### Cardiovascular risk of energy drinks: caffeine and taurine facilitate ventricular arrhythmias in a sensitive whole-heart model [^11319CsV]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Several case reports have suggested an increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to energy drinks. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess acute electrophysiologic effects of caffeine and taurine, two of the main ingredients of energy drinks, in an experimental whole-heart model.

Methods and Results

Twenty-five rabbit hearts were excised, retrogradely perfused, and assigned to two groups. Hearts were perfused with caffeine (2, 10, and 50µM) or taurine (2, 10, and 50µM) after generating baseline data. Eight monophasic action potentials and electrocardiography recordings showed a significant abbreviation of action potential duration (APD 90), QT interval, and effective refractory periods (ERP) after caffeine treatment. With taurine, cardiac repolarization duration and ERP were significantly shortened. A ventricular vulnerability was assessed by a predefined pacing protocol. With caffeine, we observed a trend towards more ventricular arrhythmias in a dose-dependent manner. After treatment with taurine, significantly more episodes of ventricular arrhythmias occurred.

Conclusion

In this experimental whole-heart study, treatment with caffeine and taurine provoked ventricular arrhythmias. The underlying mechanism was an abbreviation of cardiac repolarizations and effective refractory periods that may facilitate re-entry and thereby provokes arrhythmias. These findings help to understand the potentially hazardous and fatal outcomes after intoxication with energy drinks.

### Cardiovascular effects of energy drinks in the pediatric population [^117YEfJq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Consumption of energy drinks in the pediatric population is correlated with more emergency department visits and causes adverse reactions, such as neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular effects. These cardiovascular complications include increased cardiometabolic risk with high intake of sugar, short-term blood pressure increases and a decrease in cerebral blood flow due to the caffeine content, increased or decreased blood pressure from taurine, unmasked cardiac conditions, such as channelopathies, and atrial and ventral fibrillations. Cardiovascular complications can also arise when energy drinks are mixed with pharmaceutical drugs, such as amiodarone, potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, warfarin, digoxin, or corticosteroids. Combining energy drinks with alcohol also precipitates adverse cardiovascular events, posing a risk to the health of children and adolescents. This review further explores the ingredients in energy drinks and their mechanism of action in causing these cardiovascular complications.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^116f6eYV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration requires a thorough investigation of QT/QTc effects for all new drug entities, with a prolongation over 10 ms prompting regulatory concern. 23 Cisapride and other noncardiovascular drugs have been withdrawn from the market because of a 5‐ to 10‐ms QT interval prolongation. 24 Ephedra‐containing dietary supplements were also pulled from the market partly because of their association with significant QTc interval prolongation. 25 Our findings are concerning since caffeine likely does not affect the QTc interval based on previous studies. Further investigation of other energy drink constituents is necessary. 9

Taurine,‐carnitine, and panax ginseng are some additives found in energy drinks and have conflicting physiologic effects. The preponderance of evidence suggests taurine is more likely an antiarrhythmic than a proarrhythmic. 26 A correlation between‐carnitine deficiency and short QT syndrome has been postulated. 27 However,‐carnitine supplementation is not suspected to result in an overcorrection or prolongation of the QT interval based on published literature. Interestingly, panax ginseng, at a dose of 200 mg in one study, showed a transient prolongation of the QTc interval 2 hours after ingestion, but this appears to be a chance finding and not evident in other studies. 20, 28 Due to the fact that multiple ingredients in energy drinks have the ability to alter electrophysiological properties, their sole and concurrent use needs further scrutiny.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^113sEASY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The results are inconsistent in other studies where energy drink volumes under 32 oz were investigated. Brothers et al (n = 15) reported no changes in the QTc over 6.5 hours post‐consumption of a 24‐oz energy drink. 22 Tauseef et al found QTc prolongation of 13 ms after 500 mL (16.9 ounce) energy drink consumption. 20 An Australian study enrolled patients with congenital long QT‐syndrome (n = 24) and found no statistically significant changes within 90 minutes after consumption of 500 mL (16.9 ounce) of an energy drink. However, 3 patients did have a QTc increase > 50 ms when compared with baseline. 23 One parallel designed study assessed the impact of consuming 460 mL of 3 different types of caffeinated energy drinks on ECG parameters with no clinically significant changes. 32

In this study, both energy drinks had a similar effect on electrocardiographic parameters. Common ingredients contained in this study's products included a combination of caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, and B‐vitamins. Caffeine at doses under 400 mg is not expected to induce any electrocardiographic changes. 33 Taurine is an endogenous molecule and supplementation is believed to be anti‐arrhythmic rather than pro‐arrhythmic. 34, 35 In animal models evaluating short QT syndrome, a taurine‐magnesium coordination compound has been shown to prolong the QT interval in a dose‐dependent manner. 36 Data on glucuronolactone and B‐vitamins are limited but they are typically regarded as safe. 37 Although the preponderance of data suggest these ingredients may be safe individually, their use in combination requires evaluation.

There was an ≈5 and 4 mm Hg increase in SBP and DBP, respectively after energy drink consumption relative to placebo. A previous meta‐analysis of 15 studies including > 300 participants similarly suggested a 4‐ and 3‐mm Hg change in SBP and DBP independent of dose. 18 An emerging predictor of cardiovascular risk is cSBP. 38 In this study, cSBP was significantly elevated after energy drink consumption but the long‐term consequences remain unknown.

### Death of a young man after overuse of energy drink [^111yoeYu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old-man admitted to emergency department with ventricular tachycardia. Patient had drunk 3 cans of 250-mL energy drink 5 hours before the basketball match; he had palpitation and nausea before the match. After 30 minutes of the match, during the break, patient lost his consciousness. On admission, normal cardiac rhythm was achieved by cardioversion, and the patient was hospitalized and died on the third day. Energy drinks generally contain caffeine, taurine, various vitamins, glucose, and herbal extracts such as guarana and ginseng. Especially in high doses, caffeine can cause palpitations and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmia. Energy drink consumers should be informed about their severe adverse effects in case of overuse.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^111PgDB4]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drink caffeine content and safety thresholds — energy drinks vary in caffeine concentration, with most containing 32 mg·100 mL−1 and others containing 30 to 134 mg of caffeine per 100 mL, a concentration that greatly exceeds the FDA-imposed limit of 20 mg of caffeine per 100 mL for traditional soda; small format energy shots (~60 mL) are approximately 6-fold to 12-fold the concentration limit. Coffee caffeine content varies between 48 mg and 317 mg per serving. Reports note that agitation and tachycardia can occur at doses as low as 50 mg, while caffeine doses of less than 200 mg in a 70-kg adult are unlikely to produce toxicity; the role of rate of consumption and preexisting conditions in serious energy drink-related adverse events has not been elucidated.

### Hypercoagulability after energy drink consumption [^1112RdXH]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Energy drink consumption in the United States has more than doubled over the last decade and has been implicated in cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and even sudden cardiac death. We hypothesized that energy drink consumption may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events by increasing platelet aggregation, thereby resulting in a relatively hypercoagulable state and increased risk of thrombosis.

Methods

Thirty-two healthy volunteers aged 18–40 y were given 16 oz of bottled water or a standardized, sugar-free energy drink on two separate occasions, 1-wk apart. Beverages were consumed after an overnight fast over a 30-min period. Coagulation parameters and platelet function were measured before and 60 min after consumption using thrombelastography and impedance aggregometry.

Results

No statistically significant differences in coagulation were detected using kaolin or rapid thrombelastography. In addition, no differences in platelet aggregation were detected using ristocetin, collagen, thrombin receptor-activating peptide, or adenosine diphosphate-induced multiple impedance aggregometry. However, compared to water controls, energy drink consumption resulted in a significant increase in platelet aggregation via arachidonic acid-induced activation (area under the aggregation curve, 72.4 U versus 66.3 U; P = 0.018).

Conclusions

Energy drinks are associated with increased platelet activity via arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation within 1 h of consumption. Although larger clinical studies are needed to further address the safety and health concerns of these drinks, the increased platelet response may provide a mechanism by which energy drinks increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

### Energy drinks: another cause of QT prolongation? [^111hg91V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In the drug development world, the US Food and Drug Administration would require extensive safety testing before approval of a drug that caused this degree of QT prolongation in a "thorough QT/QTc study". Whether classified as beverages or dietary supplements, energy drinks require no such safety evaluation. It is sufficient to declare that the individual ingredients are "generally recognized as safe". Safety testing is not required to determine whether the combination of several ingredients that are each generally recognized as safe results in a not‐so‐safe concoction.

The electrocardiographic effects of caffeine, the main ingredient in energy drinks, have been extensively studied; there is no convincing evidence that caffeine alone causes QTc prolongation. 5, 6 Ginseng, added to many of these products for its purported energy‐boosting properties, has been reported to cause QT prolongation, but in a direct comparison of a ginseng‐containing energy drink with the same amount of ginseng alone, ginseng had no effect on QT interval. 7 In the concentration found in energy drinks, none of the other common ingredients, such as taurine, guarana,‐carnitine, yohimbine, sugars, and B vitamins, is known to cause QT prolongation. Although the observation by Shah et al 4 that the 2 different energy drinks had the same effect on QTc suggests that this may be a class effect, there are > 100 different products on the market, each with a proprietary combination of ingredients. A conclusion about a possible class effect would at least require knowing about differences in the composition of the 2 products tested.

### Associations of alcohol consumption with left atrial morphology and function in a population at high cardiovascular risk [^113BZxFc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive alcohol consumption has been associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. An enlarged left atrium and impaired left atrial function may lead to atrial fibrillation. The association of alcohol consumption with structural and functional left atrial measures, however, has received limited attention.

Methods and Results

We studied 503 participants from the PREDIMED‐Plus (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial, a randomized trial testing intensive weight loss intervention with an energy‐reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity promotion in preventing cardiovascular disease in adults with metabolic syndrome. Participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography at baseline, year 3, and year 5 of the study. Outcomes of interest included volume index and reservoir, conduit, and contractile strains of the left atrium. Alcohol consumption was calculated through food frequency questionnaires and presented as drinks consumed per day. Multiple linear regression and mixed models estimated the association of alcohol consumption with left atrial measurements at baseline and through follow‐up. Cross‐sectionally, higher alcohol consumption (per 1 drink/day increases) was associated with larger left atrial volume (0.65 mL/m 2 [95% CI, 0.18–1.11]) and lower left atrial reservoir and contractile strain (−0.44% [95% CI, −0.87 to −0.01]; and −0.44% [95% CI, −0.75 to −0.14]). Baseline alcohol consumption was not associated with changes in left atrial measurements, but increases in alcohol consumption (per 1 drink/day increase) during follow‐up were associated with left atrial enlargement (0.71 mL/m 2 [95% CI, 0.17–1.26]).

Conclusions

In a population at high cardiovascular risk, increased alcohol consumption was associated with left atrial enlargement and worsening atrial function.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^117B81No]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Other ingredients and adverse effects — beyond caffeine, energy drinks include additives such as taurine, B vitamins and glucuronolactone; evidence to substantiate performance effects of non-caffeine ingredients is minimal, though a recent meta-analysis found a significant association between taurine dosage and physical performance. Some herbals in energy drinks have been associated with adverse effects including seizures, myocardial infarctions, ventricular tachycardia, and gastrointestinal upset, and concerns have been raised about a possible taurine and caffeine interaction producing endothelial dysfunction. Acute and chronic adverse health effects of energy drinks are still being elucidated, and it is unclear to what extent adverse events occur while individuals are engaged in sport.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114y28nN]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Primary prevention risk factors — exercise and alcohol considerations for atrial fibrillation: Most cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased risk of new-onset AF, and observational studies have demonstrated that obesity and physical inactivity each independently increase the risk of newly diagnosed AF; caution should be considered in pursuing years of regular, high-volume (≥ 3 h/d) high-intensity endurance training given observational data linking it with increased AF risk in men and a similar "J" curve risk curve for high or vigorous activity in both men and women; alcohol consumption enhances AF risk in a fairly linear fashion, with clear evidence that binge drinking heightens risk, and uncertainty persists regarding harms or benefits of no more than 1 regular drink per day.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^116ZdbKb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

While blood pressure changes can be attributed primarily to the caffeine, other ingredients in energy drinks may pose some hemodynamic activity. 37 Taurine has been shown to lower blood pressure in prehypertensive patients, indicating the need for investigating simultaneous caffeine and taurine intake. 39

Caffeine and ephedra‐containing supplements were withdrawn from market after discovery of adverse QTc interval effects. 40 Additionally, a sustained elevation in SBP of 2 mm Hg is associated with a 7% increased risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease and a 10% increased risk of stroke mortality. 41 The cardiovascular effects seen in this study warrant concern as the observation of increased cardiovascular adverse effects and fatalities related to energy drinks remains an important public health issue. 42

Several factors may limit the generalizability of this study. We did not investigate the effects of different doses and the volume of drink consumed (two 16‐ounce cans over 60 minutes) in this study may not be representative of real‐world consumption patterns. However, 24‐oz variants of certain energy drink brands are readily available, facilitating consumption of larger volumes of energy drink in one sitting. In a survey of 2040 respondents, 16% reported having once consumed > 2 energy drinks in a day. 43 We assessed the effects of acute consumption of an energy drink < 4 hours, which does not lend insight to long‐term effects nor the effects of chronic consumption. Additionally, we assessed energy drink consumption alone, and it is not uncommon for energy drinks to be consumed in combination with other substances such as alcohol. 44, 45 While all products were packaged identically, it is possible that some participants were able to identify the energy drink or placebo drinks based on taste or pharmacodynamic response. Our study included only healthy individuals between the ages of 18 to 40 years and results may not be applicable to populations with concomitant comorbidities or those who are not within the studied age range. We did not independently test the concentrations of the ingredients in the energy drinks but relied on publicly available data.

### Acute effects of red bull energy drinks on atrial electromechanical function in healthy young adults [^11477735]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks (EDs) are widely consumed by adolescents and young adults. Almost all kinds of arrhythmias have been reported following EDs consumption, most of which is atrial fibrillation (AF). Atrial conduction time prolongation and heterogeneous sinusal impulses propagation to the atriums are the key electrophysiological mechanisms leading AF. We aimed to evaluate the acute effects of Red Bull ED ingestion on atrial electromechanical conduction times in healthy young adults. After a 12-hour fasting, 54 healthy young adults consumed 330 mL of Red Bull ED. Atrial electromechanical coupling (PA), intra-atrial electromechanical delay (intra-AEMD), and interatrial electromechanical delay (inter-AEMD) were measured at baseline and 2-hour after Red Bull ED ingestion by echocardiographic tissue-Doppler imaging (TDI) method. PA-lateral (49.7 ± 11.2 vs 54.1 ± 11.0 msn, p = 0.001) and PA-septal (40.8 ± 9.1 vs 43.7 ± 10.5 msn, p = 0.032) times were statistically significantly prolonged after Red Bull ED ingestion. There was also a statistically significant increase in the duration of inter-AEMD (14.4 ± 10.6 vs 18.1 ± 8.5 msn, p = 0.010) after ED ingestion. It was showed that even a single can of ED can acutely increase atrial electromechanical conduction times in young adults. These findings may be the cause of ED-associated AF.

### Does coffee reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation? [^116vZimy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Since atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the United States, investigation of dietary and environmental factors contributing to risk of development of atrial fibrillation is important. Stimulants, such as caffeinated beverages, have been implicated as potential risk factors for development of arrhythmias. Coffee, perhaps the most popular caffeinated beverage worldwide, is consumed by a major fraction of Americans daily, who drink an average of 3 cups per day. 1, 2 For most, the appeal of coffee may be driven by a purported cognitive and physical benefit, thought to be attributable to caffeine, although a complex set of ingredients compose this beverage.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Bodar et al present an interesting study demonstrating that a moderate degree of coffee consumption in the PHS (Physicians' Health Study) was associated with a moderate decrease in the risk of developing atrial fibrillation. 3 This study population represented a large cohort (n = 18 960) and interestingly showed a dose‐response effect, with 1 to 3 cups of coffee per day showing a decrease in the risk of atrial fibrillation with no impact with either lessor or greater amounts of coffee.

### Arrhythmogenic foods – A growing medical problem [^113fcgEA]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic ingredients in our diet such as mushrooms, licorice, toxic honey, liquid protein drinks, etc. have long been recognized as rare but important considerations in the differential diagnosis of arrhythmias. Anecdotal reports of torsades de pointes (TdP), arrhythmias and/or sudden death and small studies in normal subjects have suggested that simple ingredients such as grapefruit juice or ingredients in energy drinks marketed as dietary supplements could have direct arrhythmogenic actions, especially in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS). Two recent studies that employed the industry-standard "thorough QT" trial design leave no doubt that grapefruit juice and some energy drinks can prolong the QTc interval and to exceed 500 msec. in some patients with cLQTS, a threshold known to signal imminent danger. These reports raise numerous clinically important questions such as which other patients may be at risk of arrhythmias. For example, patients with multiple clinical risk factors for TdP (hypokalemia, bradycardia, female sex, etc.) may be at risk from these and possibly other dietary ingredients ingested by millions of people each day. It is essential that further research evaluate the safety of these and similar food products and that vulnerable patients, especially those with cLQTS, be warned of this serious and emerging threat.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^112vBtbc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

Twelve men and 6 women (n = 18) were included, of which 11 identified as white, 3 as Asian, 2 as Hispanic, 1 as black, and 1 undisclosed. Average age, height, and weight were 26.7 ± 4.0 years, 171.9 ± 12.2 cm, and 74.4 ± 15.0 kg, respectively. Nine were regular coffee drinkers (≥ 1 cup of coffee per day), 5 were occasional drinkers, and 4 reported no coffee consumption. Four reported regular energy drink use (≥ 1 can per day), 5 occasional energy drink use, and 9 no energy drink use. Data imputation was performed for less than 4% of central BP parameters. At each time point, the change from baseline is reported in Table 1.

Table 1
Baseline‐Adjusted ECG and BP Parameters

Baseline QTc interval, uncorrected QT interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and HR were 413 ± 17.3 ms, 405 ± 26.9 ms, 158 ± 21.0 ms, 89.1 ± 9.69 ms, and 63.4 ± 10.5 beats per minute, respectively. Baseline pSBP, pDBP, cSBP, cDBP, and AI were 117 ± 9.89 mm Hg, 72.0 ± 8.56 mm Hg, 103 ± 9.00 mm Hg, 73.4 ± 8.60 mm Hg, and 5.50 ± 10.1, respectively.

ECG Effects

A significant difference in the baseline‐adjusted QTc interval (Figure 2) was evident 2 hours after energy drink consumption when compared with caffeine (0.44 ± 18.4 ms versus −10.4 ± 14.8 ms, respectively; P = 0.02). There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the baseline‐adjusted HR 2 hours after energy drink consumption when compared with caffeine (3.39 ± 11.04 versus −0.61 ± 9.13, respectively; P = 0.07). There was no evidence of time‐matched intragroup differences with QT interval, PR interval, and QRS duration (all P > 0.14).

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^1165ueWe]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drink use in children and adolescents and adverse event reporting are highlighted. The health concerns associated with energy drink use are amplified in children and adolescents, and children and adolescents experience adverse effects from energy drinks in greater numbers than adults. Position statements recommended that energy drinks should never be consumed by children or adolescents, or used for hydration before, during, or after physical activity, and the American Beverage Association has recommended that energy drinks should 1) be marketed as separate from sports drinks, 2) not be sold or marketed in schools, and 3) not be marketed to children. In case of a severe adverse effect (e.g., palpitations, seizures), emergency care should be sought immediately; information can be obtained from regional Poison Control Centers (1-800-222-1222), and consumers and health care providers should report cases via the FDA's Safety Reporting Portal (https://www.safetyreporting.hhs.gov/SRP2).

### The proarrhythmic conundrum of alcohol intake [^114GAtMG]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The arrhythmogenic potential of alcohol consumption that leads to cardiac arrhythmia development includes the induction of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, with atrial fibrillation (AF) being the commonest alcohol-related arrhythmia, even with low/moderate alcohol consumption. Arrhythmias occur both with acute and chronic alcohol use. The "Holiday Heart Syndrome" relates to the occurrence of AF, most commonly following weekend or public holiday binge drinking; however, other arrhythmias may also occur, including other supraventricular arrhythmias, and occasionally even frequent ventricular premature beats and a rare occurrence of ventricular tachycardia. Arrhythmias in individuals with alcohol use disorder, in addition to AF, may comprise ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) that may be potentially fatal leading to cardiac arrest. The effects of alcohol on triggering VAs appear to be dose-dependent, observed more commonly in heavy drinkers, both in healthy individuals and patients with underlying structural heart disease, including ischemic heart disease and alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Men appear to be affected at higher dosages of alcohol, while women can suffer from arrhythmias at lower dosages. On the other hand, low to moderate consumption of alcohol may confer some protection from serious VAs and cardiac arrest (J- or U-curve phenomenon); however, abstinence is the optimal strategy. These issues as they relate to alcohol-induced proarrhythmia are herein reviewed, with the large studies and meta-analyses tabulated and the arrhythmogenic mechanisms pictorially illustrated.

Methods

Study Oversight and Patient Population

The protocol and informed consent forms were approved by the David Grant Medical Center Institutional Review Board (protocol No. FDG20130042H). All participants provided written informed consent.

Participants were recruited via email and flyers between 2013 and 2014 on a US Air Force Base installation. Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 years were included. Participants were excluded if they had a current or previous diagnosis of abnormal heart rhythm, a BP > 140/90 mm Hg, any comorbid medical conditions, history of substance abuse, renal or hepatic dysfunction, concurrent use of drugs or over‐the‐counter products that may interact with study drinks or affect ECG or BP parameters (excluding oral contraceptives), or were pregnant or lactating.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^116c85KM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Although a causal relationship between PACs and AF or PVCs and heart failure cannot be determined by these large epidemiologic studies, extrapolation from data already available from the electrophysiology laboratory has raised interest in the theoretical benefit of prophylactic PAC and PVC ablation. 4, 10 However, little is known about modifiable exposures that may reduce or prevent frequent PACs or PVCs.

Patients often associate the symptoms of premature cardiac contractions with emotional stress, physical activity, dietary factors, and caffeine or other stimulant use. 11 Though there is little data to support the role of behavioral modifications or trigger avoidance in reducing or preventing premature cardiac contractions, clinicians often instruct patients with any arrhythmia to avoid caffeine intake. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of supraventricular arrhythmias state that if a patient's history is consistent with premature extra beats, one should review and eliminate potential exacerbating factors, such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine. 12 Prominent online medical resources for clinicians, such as UpToDate and Medscape, feature similar recommendations for the management of premature beats. 13, 14 While none of these sources explicitly refer to the acute versus chronic effects of caffeine on ectopy, they focus on general avoidance in order to avoid triggering arrhythmias. Caffeine is of particular interest because of its known sympathomimetic effects, leading to increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels 15 and, as a result, possibly increasing ectopy. While most observational and experimental studies examining the effect of caffeine intake on arrhythmogenesis have been negative, the majority of them focus on populations known to have increased premature cardiac contractions, arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT), or other heart disease. 16, 17, 18, 19 In addition, most of the interventional trials investigating the effects of caffeine or other lifestyle modifications on arrhythmias were performed several decades ago 11 and frequently did not use premature cardiac contractions as a primary outcome. 18

Recent and growing evidence points to the potential beneficial cardiovascular effects of several common caffeinated products, including coffee, 20 chocolate, 21 and tea. 22 There may therefore be uncertainty in counseling patients regarding consumption of these products, and many patients may reduce their exposure in order to avoid the presumed arrhythmogenic effect at the expense of possible benefits. We thus sought to study the relationship between chronic consumption of these potentially healthy caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy in a community‐based cohort.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^116qeqVc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a lack of evidence for caffeine abstention or moderation in reducing premature cardiac contractions and arrhythmias, clinicians and treatment guidelines often recommend that such patients avoid caffeine. For example, published guidelines on the management of supraventricular arrhythmias advocate reviewing and eliminating potential exacerbating factors, such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine. 12 Popular resources for clinicians, including UpToDate and Medscape, offer similar suggestions for the management of premature beats. 13, 14

Coffee is among the most commonly consumed beverages in the United States 20 and is the main source of caffeine intake among adults. 33 The biological impact of coffee may be substantial and is not limited to the effects of caffeine. Regular coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and depression. 20 Furthermore, large observational studies have found that habitual coffee drinkers have lower rates of CAD and of cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality. 34, 35 However, not all evidence favors a protective effect of coffee on CAD. Specifically, one case–control study found an increased risk of MI in the hour after coffee consumption. 36 Interestingly, this effect was stronger in light/occasional coffee drinkers (< 1 cup/day) as compared to moderate coffee drinkers (2–3 cups/day) and absent among heavy coffee drinkers (≥ 4 cups/day). In considering these results, however, it is important to recognize that recall bias may have played a role, given that participants were interviewed immediately post‐MI regarding their behaviors prior to the event. In addition, chocolate and tea are caffeine‐containing compounds that have also been postulated to have cardioprotective effects because of their high flavonoid content. 21 Flavonoids boast antioxidant properties and have been shown to increase nitric oxide availability inducing vasodilation, which possibly accounts for the described protective effects of cocoa consumption on the vascular endothelium. 37 Short‐term administration of dark chocolate, which has a higher flavonoid content, has been shown to lower blood pressure in both hypertensive and healthy subjects. 38, 39 In addition, studies have demonstrated that chocolate and tea consumption bear inverse relationships to prevalent and incident CAD, respectively. 21, 22

### Caffeine consumption and cardiovascular risks: little cause for concern [^1145f92b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Caffeine consumption is virtually ubiquitous in our society. It is naturally found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and cola drinks. Furthermore, caffeine is often added to beverages, foods, pain relievers, and other products. In the United States, coffee accounts for ≈70% of the caffeine consumed. 1 A report in this issue of JAHA by Dixit and colleagues describes the relations between the reported intake of caffeinated products and the occurrence of arrhythmias assessed by 24‐hour Holter monitoring in the Cardiovascular Health Study. The investigation included > 1300 adults and all participants were > 65 years of age at baseline. 2 The authors report no association for atrial or ventricular arrhythmia prevalence and reported intake of caffeinated products. The Dixit article provides an opportunity to briefly review the pharmacology of caffeine related to the cardiovascular system and to share recent information and insights from clinical studies and population reports concerning caffeine intake and cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, and arrhythmias.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^112t7Scs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Premature cardiac contractions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Though experts associate premature atrial contractions (s) and premature ventricular contractions (s) with caffeine, there are no data to support this relationship in the general population. As certain caffeinated products may have cardiovascular benefits, recommendations against them may be detrimental.

Methods and Results

We studied Cardiovascular Health Study participants with a baseline food frequency assessment, 24‐hour ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter) monitoring, and without persistent atrial fibrillation. Frequencies of habitual coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption were assessed using a picture‐sort food frequency survey. The main outcomes weres/h ands/hour. Among 1388 participants (46% male, mean age 72 years), 840 (61%) consumed ≥ 1 caffeinated product per day. The median numbers ofs ands/h and interquartile ranges were 3 (1–12) and 1 (0–7), respectively. There were no differences in the number ofs ors/h across levels of coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption. After adjustment for potential confounders, more frequent consumption of these products was not associated with ectopy. In examining combined dietary intake of coffee, tea, and chocolate as a continuous measure, no relationships were observed after multivariable adjustment: 0.48% fewers/h (95%−4.60 to 3.64) and 2.87% fewers/h (95%−8.18 to 2.43) per 1‐serving/week increase in consumption.

In the largest study to evaluate dietary patterns and quantify cardiac ectopy using 24‐hour Holter monitoring, we found no relationship between chronic consumption of caffeinated products and ectopy.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^114K1aFs]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — conclusions on risk and monitoring emphasize that energy drinks are frequently consumed and there are reports of morbidity and mortality associated with their consumption. In particular, individuals known to be more susceptible to adverse events include those of young age, small stature, caffeine-naïve or caffeine-sensitive, pregnant or breastfeeding women, those with certain medical conditions and/or taking certain medications, consuming multiple energy drinks in one session, and those with underlying cardiovascular or other diseases. Of critical importance, children and adolescents appear to be at particularly high risk of complications from energy drinks due to their small body size, being relatively caffeine naive, and potentially heavy and frequent consumption patterns, as well as the amounts of caffeine. Although most healthy adults can consume an energy drink without any significant, negative, acute health effects, the long-term effects of chronic consumption have not been well studied. Continued monitoring of adverse events related to energy drink consumption is needed to fully understand the rate, severity and nature of reactions to these products across the lifespan.

Effects of Energy Drinks on Cardiovascular EndpointsClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview This study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover, proof-of-concept trial designed to examine how energy drinks affect heart rhythm and other health measures in healthy adults aged 18 to 40. This study investigates the cardiovascular safety of energy drinks by examining their effects on electrocardiographic parameters, with a specific focus on the QTc interval. The protocol consists of two phases conducted with 3 healthy volunteers. Phase A evaluates four interventions: 1) energy drink A 2) moxifloxacin 3) caffeine 4) placebo. Phase B evaluates four interventions: 1) energy drink B 2) taurine 3) caffeine + taurine 4) lower dose energy drink A. After an overnight fast participants will consume the study intervention within a 30 minute period.

Over the next 4 hours, the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, hemodynamics, glucose, endothelial function, and side effects will be monitored. Participants maintain minimal physical activity during this period.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^1167vN8r]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Premature cardiac contractions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Though experts associate premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with caffeine, there are no data to support this relationship in the general population. As certain caffeinated products may have cardiovascular benefits, recommendations against them may be detrimental.

Methods and Results

We studied Cardiovascular Health Study participants with a baseline food frequency assessment, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter) monitoring, and without persistent atrial fibrillation. Frequencies of habitual coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption were assessed using a picture-sort food frequency survey. The main outcomes were PACs/h and PVCs/hour. Among 1388 participants (46% male, mean age 72 years), 840 (61%) consumed ≥ 1 caffeinated product per day. The median numbers of PACs and PVCs/h and interquartile ranges were 3 (1–12) and 1 (0–7), respectively. There were no differences in the number of PACs or PVCs/h across levels of coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption. After adjustment for potential confounders, more frequent consumption of these products was not associated with ectopy. In examining combined dietary intake of coffee, tea, and chocolate as a continuous measure, no relationships were observed after multivariable adjustment: 0.48% fewer PACs/h (95% CI -4.60 to 3.64) and 2.87% fewer PVCs/h (95% CI -8.18 to 2.43) per 1-serving/week increase in consumption.

Conclusions

In the largest study to evaluate dietary patterns and quantify cardiac ectopy using 24-hour Holter monitoring, we found no relationship between chronic consumption of caffeinated products and ectopy.

### Alcohol consumption and risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death: an observational study of 408, 712 individuals [^114Hwe9f]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although previous studies have demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between alcohol and sudden cardiac death (SCD), there is a paucity of evidence on the role of alcohol specifically on incident ventricular arrhythmias (VAs).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to characterize associations of total and beverage-specific alcohol consumption with incident VA and SCD using data from the UK Biobank.

Methods

Alcohol consumption reported at baseline was calculated as UK standard drinks (8 g of alcohol) per week. Outcomes were assessed through hospitalization and death records. Alcohol consumption was modeled as restricted cubic splines in multivariate Cox regression models and corrected for regression dilution bias.

Results

We studied 408,712 middle-aged individuals (52.1% female) over a median follow-up time of 11.5 years. A total of 1733 incident VA events and 2044 SCDs occurred. For incident VA, no clear association was seen with total alcohol consumption. Although consumption of greater amounts of spirits was associated with increased VA risk, no other significant beverage-specific associations were observed. For SCD, a U-shaped association was seen for total alcohol consumption, such that consumption of < 26 drinks per week was associated with lowest risk. Consumption of greater amounts of beer, cider, and spirits was potentially associated with increasing SCD risk, whereas increasing red and white wine intake was associated with reduced risk.

Conclusion

In this predominantly white cohort, no association of total alcohol consumption was observed with VA, whereas a U-shaped association was present for SCD. Additional studies utilizing accurately defined VA and SCD events are required to provide further insights into these contrasting findings.

### Alcohol use disorders and the heart [^115ygAWv]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Daily alcohol intake is associated with a shorter right atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and increased atrial flutter in patients less than 60 years old 35. The shorter right AERP may allow the right atrium to sustain a rapid rate in response to an initiating rhythm or allow propagation of an appropriately timed premature atrial complex 35. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia associated with chronic high‐volume alcohol intake. Above a safe threshold of approximately one drink/day the relative risk of AF increases 10% for each drink per day 36. However, it appears that the relationship between chronic alcohol consumption and arrhythmias may be non‐linear, involving complex interactions between dose, drinking pattern, age and sex 34. For example, Psaty found alcohol was inversely related with incidence of AF in older adults with a lower level of drinking (two to three drinks/week) and a low incidence of binge drinking 37. Acute alcohol withdrawal in chronic alcohol users can increase cardiac sympathetic activity and reduce both heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, promoting cardiac arrhythmias 34.

Assessment and treatment of arrhythmia in patients who are heavy users of alcohol can be challenging if abstinence, or at least a significant reduction in intake, is not achieved 38. Specifically, for atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation to reduce risk of stroke and ventricular rate control are central to the management strategy. In some cases, direct current cardioversion or electrophysiologically guided ablation techniques may be used, but ablation is known to be less successful in those who continue to drink alcohol, with higher AF relapse rates 39.

### Caffeine and cardiac arrhythmias: a review of the evidence [^115RgUFn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on the safety and physiologic effects of caffeine in patients with known arrhythmias. The studies presented suggest that in most patients with known or suspected arrhythmia, caffeine in moderate doses is well tolerated and there is therefore no reason to restrict ingestion of caffeine. A review of the literature is presented.

### Use of performance-enhancing substances [^111tiJDf]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Performance-enhancing substances (PES) in children and adolescents — caffeine and other stimulants — have high exposure with "73% of children consume caffeine on any given day" and a "Median intake of those 12–19 y who ingest caffeine: 40.6 mg". Amphetamine exposure is noted as "Nonmedical use of amphetamines in 12th grade: lifetime: 12.4%; monthly: 4.4%; overall; athletes not at greater risk for use, but boys in certain sports with higher rates: lacrosse, wrestling". Mechanistically caffeine is "Currently believed that performance benefit primarily due to central nervous system stimulation and enhanced muscle activation". Dosing and effects data indicate "Most studies with caffeine have examined ~3–6 mg/ kg, but 1–3 mg/kg has been shown to have performance-enhancing effects, particularly in endurance activity", with improvements including "4% improvements in strength of knee extensors", "14% in muscular endurance", and "10% to 20% improvements in time to exhaustion studies". Adverse effects include "Cardiac arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions); increased blood pressure", and "Significant toxicity has been associated with ingestion of multiple energy drinks, leading to almost 1500 emergency department visits in 2011 in the 12- to 17-y age group", and powdered caffeine has been "responsible for at least 2 deaths in young people (1 teaspoon of powdered caffeine is equivalent to 28 cups of coffee; FDA warning)".

### An analysis of energy-drink toxicity in the national poison data system [^112ThG6p]. Clinical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Small studies have associated energy drinks-beverages that typically contain high concentrations of caffeine and other stimulants-with serious adverse health events.

Objective

To assess the incidence and outcomes of toxic exposures to caffeine-containing energy drinks, including caffeinated alcoholic energy drinks, and to evaluate the effect of regulatory actions and educational initiatives on the rates of energy drink exposures.

Methods

We analyzed all unique cases of energy drink exposures reported to the US National Poison Data System (NPDS) between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2011. We analyzed only exposures to caffeine-containing energy drinks consumed as a single product ingestion and categorized them as caffeine-containing non-alcoholic, alcoholic, or "unknown" for those with unknown formulations. Non-alcoholic energy drinks were further classified as those containing caffeine from a single source and those containing multiple stimulant additives, such as guarana or yerba mate. The data were analyzed for the demographics and outcomes of exposures (unknown data were not included in the denominator for percentages). The rates of change of energy drink-related calls to poison centers were analyzed before and after major regulatory events.

Results

Of 2.3 million calls to the NPDS, 4854 (0.2%) were energy drink-related. The 3192 (65.8%) cases involving energy drinks with unknown additives were excluded. Of 1480 non-alcoholic energy drink cases, 50.7% were children < 6 years old; 76.7% were unintentional; and 60.8% were males. The incidence of moderate to major adverse effects of energy drink-related toxicity was 15.2% and 39.3% for non-alcoholic and alcoholic energy drinks, respectively. Major adverse effects consisted of three cases of seizure, two of non-ventricular dysrhythmia, one ventricular dysrhythmia, and one tachypnea. Of the 182 caffeinated alcoholic energy drink cases, 68.2% were < 20 years old; 76.7% were referred to a health care facility. Educational and legislative initiatives to enhance understanding of the health consequences of energy drink consumption were significantly associated with a decreased rate of energy drink-related cases (p = 0.036).

Conclusions

About half the cases of energy drink-related toxicity involved unintentional exposures by children < 6 years old. Educational campaigns and legal restrictions on the sale of energy drinks were associated with decreasing calls to poison centers for energy drink toxicity and are encouraged.

### Alcohol use and cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111yVaVc]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Alcohol is one of the most commonly consumed substances in the world, exhibiting complex relationships with multiple aspects of cardiovascular health and disease. The majority of the research on the topic is observational and therefore prone to bias and confounding. The available evidence suggests no risk to possible risk reduction when alcohol is consumed in low amounts (such as no more than 1 to 2 drinks a day) in regard to coronary artery disease, stroke, sudden death, and possibly heart failure. The risk associated with consuming 1 to 2 drinks a day on atrial fibrillation remains unknown. More randomized trials of low to moderate alcohol consumption are needed for more definitive conclusions. In stark contrast, heavier alcohol consumption such as binge drinking or consuming on average ≥ 3 drinks/d is consistently associated with worse outcomes in every cardiovascular disease entity studied. Considering the level of evidence, it remains unknown whether drinking is part of a healthy lifestyle and therefore clinicians should reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors such as regularly engaging in physical activity, avoiding tobacco use, and maintaining healthy body weight.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^117DH4Te]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias — evaluation and initial management synopsis: On initial discovery, an evaluation for structural heart disease is warranted with physical examination, an ECG, and imaging, usually with echocardiography. In the absence of any abnormality or a family history of sudden cardiac death, further assessment and treatment are guided by symptoms, and if the patient is asymptomatic and does not have evidence of a cardiac channelopathy, reassurance as to the benign nature is sufficient. If the arrhythmia is suspected of being sufficiently frequent to cause ventricular dysfunction over time, periodic follow-up with reassessment of ventricular function is warranted, and for mild symptoms, avoidance of aggravating factors such as excessive consumption of caffeine or sympathomimetic agents, may be sufficient. Therapy with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker reduces symptoms for some patients; Class I antiarrhythmic medications can be effective, but those are generally avoided due to concerns for adverse effects, and for patients who require arrhythmia suppression for whom antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or undesired, catheter ablation can be a highly effective treatment.

### Alcohol use disorders and the heart [^115WFQ68]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmia

Heavy alcohol consumption in a binge pattern is associated with the development of acute cardiac arrhythmia, even in those with normal heart function. The term 'holiday heart' was coined by Ettinger in 1978 to describe 'an acute cardiac rhythm and or conduction disturbance associated with heavy ethanol consumption in a person without other clinical evidence of heart disease and disappearing without evident residual, with abstinence' 29. The authors noted a seasonal rise in the incidence of arrhythmias during a period of traditional binge drinking (Christmas and New Year). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common arrhythmia noted, but atrial flutter, junctional tachycardia, isolated premature ventricular complexes, isolated premature atrial complexes, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia were also described.

Alcohol may act together with coexistent electrolyte disturbance and/or acute illnesses such as infections to produce supraventricular arrhythmias 30. Sudden death in alcohol misuse (SUDAM) is increasingly recognized, and case–series have described heavy drinkers who die suddenly with no autopsy findings other than fatty liver change 31. There are several possible (but unproven) causes of such deaths, and a ventricular arrhythmia unmasked by persistent heavy alcohol use is one possibility. When compared with deaths due to sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, the SUDAM group are significantly older and have a 10‐fold greater incidence of fatty liver change 32. Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with QT interval prolongation 33, and alcohol dependence commonly presents alongside polysubstance use and psychiatric morbidity where QT‐prolonging medications may be part of the clinical picture, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), lithium and methadone 34. The risk of ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death is lower in individuals with modest alcohol intake (two to six drinks/week) than those with high intake (21–35 drinks/week) and binge drinkers. This may be attributable to the protective effects of low‐to‐moderate alcohol consumption against coronary artery disease as described above 13. Arrhythmias may also be manifestations of an underlying alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and so a holistic cardiovascular assessment in important.

Additional analyses adjusting for factors associated with AF, such as fish consumption and physical activity, did not meaningfully alter the results. Similarly, adjusting for the effects of other caffeinated product consumption did not reveal any further associations between coffee, tea, or chocolate and cardiac ectopy. No statistically significant interactions between the presence of cardiovascular disease (defined as the presence of diabetes, hypertension, CAD, CHF, or AF at baseline) and caffeine on the risk of PACs, PVCs, SVT, or VT were observed (P = 0.17, 0.13, 0.37, and 0.77, respectively).

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^111dfFtE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Assessment of Ectopy and Arrhythmia

Holter data were analyzed at the Washington University School of Medicine Heart Rate Variability Laboratory using a MARS 8000 Holter scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) and manually reviewed to ensure accuracy. The number of supraventricular ectopic beats, or PACs, per hour and number of ventricular ectopic beats, or PVCs, per hour were recorded throughout the duration of Holter monitoring. SVT and VT episodes were evaluated as the total number of discrete episodes (or "runs" defined as 3 or more consecutive beats) during Holter monitoring.

Covariate Ascertainment

Self‐identified race was categorized as white, black, and other. Self‐identified sex was classified as male or female. Self‐reported income, defined as total combined family income before taxes, was categorized into 3 groups: < $12 000, $12 000 to 34 999, and ≥ $35 000. Self‐reported education level was categorized into 5 groups: high school or less, vocational school, some college, 4 years of college, and postgraduate education. Body mass index was calculated from baseline height and weight measurements. A measure of daily caloric intake was calculated from the picture‐sort food frequency questionnaire. Diabetes mellitus was defined as reported use of an antihyperglycemic medication at baseline or a fasting glucose level of ≥ 126 mmol/L. Smoking status was defined as never, past, or current. Participants reported their usual frequency of consumption of beer, wine, and liquor, and the usual number of servings of each drink on each occasion, from which total weekly alcohol consumption was calculated. Hypertension was defined as either a reported history of physician‐diagnosed hypertension plus use of antihypertensive medications, systolic blood pressure of ≥ 140 mm Hg, or diastolic pressure of ≥ 90 mm Hg. AF was defined as a reported history of AF, AF on baseline 12‐lead ECG, or AF detected on Holter. CHF and myocardial infarction (MI) were identified by participant self‐report and were confirmed by medical record verification. CAD was defined as angina, previous MI, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or previous angioplasty. 25 Information regarding prescription medications used in the preceding 2 weeks was collected at baseline directly from prescription bottles, including use of β‐blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, class I antiarrhythmics, and class III antiarrhythmics. 23

### Alcohol consumption, sinus tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias at the munich octoberfest: results from the munich beer related electrocardiogram workup study (munichBREW) [^1113gMPy]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute and chronic alcohol intake result in desirable and undesirable health effects. Modest recreational alcohol consumption may lead to perceived wellbeing, beyond moderate intake confers the risk of adverse outcomes. Common symptoms of acute alcohol consumption are disorientation, disinhibition, nausea, and vomiting. Excessive acute abuse may lead to death. Chronic consumption has been ascribed cardio-protective effects. More commonly, chronic alcohol use dose-dependently is associated with detrimental effects including substance addiction and severe nutritional, hepatic, neurological and social consequences.

From a cardiovascular perspective, acute excessive alcohol consumption has been associated with the so called 'Holiday Heart Syndrome'. This syndrome affects individuals without a specific cardiac history resulting in both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, predominantly atrial fibrillation. Small case series confirmed a relation between alcohol use and atrial fibrillation. Regarding chronic alcohol consumption, population-based studies reported a dose-response effect on the development of atrial fibrillation.

Many open questions remain. All reports on effects of acute alcohol intake were derived from small retrospective analyses with relations to arrhythmias as secondary findings. In our study, we thus intended to conduct a large, sufficiently powered, observational, cross-sectional analysis of cardiac arrhythmia prevalence in participants with quantitatively measured acute alcohol intake. Investigating visitors of the 2015 Munich Octoberfest, we hypothesized that increased breath alcohol concentration (BAC) is associated with a higher burden of cardiac arrhythmias. To parallel acute with chronic alcohol use, we studied participants of the community-based KORA Study.

### Effects of alcohol on skeletal and cardiac muscle [^114ZE3G4]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

The acute and chronic toxic effects of alcohol on skeletal and cardiac muscle are clinically important. Muscle weakness and atrophy are the main manifestations of skeletal myopathy, and arrhythmias and progressive left-ventricular dysfunction are those of cardiomyopathy. Most patients remain asymptomatic from these effects for a long time. Myocyte atrophy and death are the main pathological findings. A clear dose-related effect has been established with ethanol consumption, with gender and some specific gene polymorphisms being factors of increased susceptibility to alcohol-induced muscle damage. Pathogenic mechanisms are pleiotropic, the most relevant being disturbances in carbohydrate, protein, and energy cell turnover, signal transduction, and induction of apoptosis and gene dysregulation. Ethanol abstinence is the only effective treatment, although controlled drinking is useful in patients who do not achieve abstinence. Persistent high-dose consumption results in deterioration of muscle and heart function, with a high mortality due to arrhythmias and progression of heart failure.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^11214i79]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The long‐term use of energy drinks also needs particular attention. In one study, consuming a single energy shot (60 mL) twice daily for 7 days conferred no significant ECG changes when compared with placebo. 29 Similarly, 500 mL of another energy drink consumed for 7 days showed no ECG‐related changes from baseline. 15 However, these results cannot be generalized across all energy drink products. While the degree of BP change seen in our study is generally not concerning in an acute setting, even mild sustained elevations in systolic BP at the population level can increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 30, 31

In this study, both the energy drink and caffeine arms exhibited a similar increase in pSBP from baseline for the initial 4 hours post study drink consumption. Caffeine is rapidly absorbed and typically peaks at about 1 hour, explaining the initial BP increase in both study arms. 32 This is similar to results from another study by Svatikova et al 33 that also suggested activation of the catecholamine pathway. However, the sustained pSBP elevation by ≈4 mm Hg at 6 hours post energy drink consumption suggests that other ingredients may be hemodynamically active. Guarana, another common ingredient in energy drinks, may contain 2% to 15% of its dry weight in caffeine. 34 This may or may not explain a delayed BP response when compared with caffeine alone. 35 Taurine, in contrast, is thought to have a BP‐lowering effect at higher doses, potentially altering the overall BP response. 36 The current literature is lacking regarding the hemodynamic profile of the ingredients contained in energy drinks, making it difficult to ascertain whether it is caffeine interacting with the other ingredients or the other ingredients alone that are driving the BP effects.

### Cardiovascular complications from consumption of high energy drinks: recent evidence [^112orVAb]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The energy drinks (ED) are caffeinated beverages that are popular among teenagers and young adults. They are aggressively marketed as providing alertness, energy and sex prowess. The EDs in addition to caffeine contain several plant stimulants and simple sugars, which increase their caloric content. The caffeine concentration in these drinks is high and their overconsumption could lead to insomnia, agitation, tremors and cardiovascular complications including sudden death. Alcohol is often mixed with EDs (AMEDs) in the wrong perception that the caffeine in the EDs will prevent the drowsiness and sleepiness from alcohol and allow the person to consume more alcohol. This false perception, could lead to alcohol intoxication and the taking of risky decisions, like driving under the influence of alcohol and the risk of serious physical harm to themselves and others. To prevent the problem of consumption of EDs and AMEDs, the caring physician could help by advising the parents and his young patients about the serious health risks from the consumption of these drinks. In order to grasp the extend of the problem of ED and AMED consumption, we did a Medline search of the English language literature from January 2010 to December 2013, using the terms EDs and alcohol-mixed EDs. All the findings from the recent studies regarding the cardiovascular complications from the consumption of EDs and AMEDs together with collateral literature will be discussed in this review.

### Supraventricular tachycardia induced by chocolate: is chocolate too sweet for the heart? [^112q73u7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conflicting studies have been published concerning the association between chocolate and cardiovascular diseases. Fewer articles have described the potential arrhythmogenic risk related to chocolate intake. We present a case of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in a woman after consumption of large quantity of chocolate. A 53-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented to us with complaints of palpitations and shortness of breath after consuming large amounts of chocolate. Electrocardiogram showed supraventricular tachycardia at 165 beats per minute, which was restored to sinus rhythm after adenosine bolus injection. Electrophysiology studies showed atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation. Chocolate contains caffeine and theobromine, which are methylxanthines and are competitive antagonists of adenosine and can have arrhythmogenic potential. Our case very well describes an episode of tachycardia precipitated by large amount of chocolate consumption in a patient with underlying substrate. There are occasional case reports describing association between chocolate, caffeine, and arrhythmias. A large Danish study, however, did not find any association between amount of daily caffeine consumption and risk of arrhythmia.

### Alcohol consumption, sinus tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias at the munich octoberfest: results from the munich beer related electrocardiogram workup study (munichBREW) [^1151d5UK]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we have conducted a large prospective analysis of acute alcohol consumption on ECG-assessed cardiac arrhythmias. We thereby report good technical feasibility of ECG screening even under lively conditions at the Munich Octoberfest. Acute and — to a lesser extent — chronic alcohol consumption were associated with sinus tachycardia. Analysis of respiratory sinus arrhythmia as a measure of autonomic tone suggested that acute alcohol intake confers autonomic imbalance. Additional research is warranted to investigate if autonomic imbalance constitutes the link between sinus tachycardia and the occurrence of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, as implicated by reports of the so-called 'Holiday Heart Syndrome' (Figure 3).

Figure 3
MunichBREW study conclusions. The figure summarizes the study procedures and results in the panel shaded in green. These findings influence the generated hypothesis on 'Holiday Heart Syndrome' pathophysiology illustrated in the panel shaded in red. Importantly, additional research is warranted to support this hypothesis.

### Health effects of energy drinks on children, adolescents, and young adults [^117QAVte]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the effects, adverse consequences, and extent of energy drink consumption among children, adolescents, and young adults.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Google using "energy drink", "sports drink", "guarana", "caffeine", "taurine", "ADHD", "diabetes", "children", "adolescents", "insulin", "eating disorders", and "poison control center" to identify articles related to energy drinks. Manufacturer Web sites were reviewed for product information.

Results

According to self-report surveys, energy drinks are consumed by 30% to 50% of adolescents and young adults. Frequently containing high and unregulated amounts of caffeine, these drinks have been reported in association with serious adverse effects, especially in children, adolescents, and young adults with seizures, diabetes, cardiac abnormalities, or mood and behavioral disorders or those who take certain medications. Of the 5448 US caffeine overdoses reported in 2007, 46% occurred in those younger than 19 years. Several countries and states have debated or restricted energy drink sales and advertising.

Conclusions

Energy drinks have no therapeutic benefit, and many ingredients are understudied and not regulated. The known and unknown pharmacology of agents included in such drinks, combined with reports of toxicity, raises concern for potentially serious adverse effects in association with energy drink use. In the short-term, pediatricians need to be aware of the possible effects of energy drinks in vulnerable populations and screen for consumption to educate families. Long-term research should aim to understand the effects in at-risk populations. Toxicity surveillance should be improved, and regulations of energy drink sales and consumption should be based on appropriate research.

### Caffeinated coffee consumption or abstinence to reduce atrial fibrillation: the DECAF randomized clinical trial [^1131QPEA]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Conventional wisdom holds that caffeinated coffee is proarrhythmic. Coffee is the most commonly consumed caffeinated beverage in the US, and a randomized trial assessing caffeinated coffee consumption in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not previously been performed.

Objective

To determine the effect of caffeinated coffee consumption compared with abstinence from coffee and caffeine on recurrent AF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolling 200 current or previous (within past 5 years) coffee-drinking adults with persistent AF, or atrial flutter with a history of AF, planned for electrical cardioversion from 5 hospitals in the US, Canada, and Australia between November 2021 and December 2024. The date of final follow-up was June 5, 2025.

Intervention

Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to regular caffeinated coffee consumption vs coffee and caffeine abstinence for 6 months. Patients in the coffee consumption group were encouraged to drink at least 1 cup of caffeinated coffee daily. Patients in the abstinence group were encouraged to completely abstain from both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and other caffeine-containing products.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was clinically detected recurrence of AF or atrial flutter over 6 months.

Results

Two hundred patients (mean [SD] age, 69 [11] years; 71% male) were randomized to caffeinated coffee consumption (n = 100) or coffee abstinence (n = 100). Baseline coffee intake was 7 cups (IQR, 7–18) per week in both groups. During follow-up, coffee intake in the consumption and abstinence groups was 7 (IQR, 6–11) and 0 (IQR, 0–2) cups per week, respectively, resulting in a between-group difference of 7 cups (95% CI, 7–7) per week. In the primary analysis, AF or atrial flutter recurrence was less in the coffee consumption (47%) than the coffee abstinence (64%) group, resulting in a 39% lower hazard of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.42–0.89]; P = 0.01). A comparable benefit of coffee consumption was observed with AF recurrence only. There was no significant difference in adverse events.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this clinical trial of coffee drinkers after successful cardioversion, allocation to consumption of caffeinated coffee averaging 1 cup a day was associated with less recurrence of AF or atrial flutter compared with abstinence from coffee and caffeinated products.

### Dangerous mistake: an accidental caffeine overdose [^111afoab]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Given that cardiac arrhythmias are the most frequent cause of death by caffeine overdose, sports practitioners should be informed on the potential health hazards related to excessive caffeine intake, as well as, dietary supplements should be better regulated and reported on food labels.

In the future, we suggest contacting the regional poison control centre to improve and increase dataset which can contribute to enhance federal analysis and the correct legislation of this kind of products.

Learning points

Caffeine overdose can be fatal.
Cardiac arrhythmia is a frequent consequence that needs immediate management.
Clinical awareness of caffeine toxicity should be increased.

### Detrimental effects of energy drink consumption on platelet and endothelial function [^112ZUxyV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Energy drink consumption has been anecdotally linked with sudden cardiac death and, more recently, myocardial infarction. As myocardial infarction is strongly associated with both platelet and endothelial dysfunction, we tested the hypothesis that energy drink consumption alters platelet and endothelial function.

Methods

Fifty healthy volunteers (34 male, aged 22 ± 2 years) participated in the study. Platelet aggregation and endothelial function were tested before, and 1 hour after, the consumption of 250 mL (1 can) of a sugar-free energy drink. Platelet function was assessed by adenosine diphosphate-induced (1 micromol/L) optical aggregometry in platelet-rich plasma. Endothelial function was assessed via changes in peripheral arterial tonometry and expressed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI).

Results

Compared with baseline values, there was a significant increase in platelet aggregation following energy drink consumption, while no change was observed with control (13.7 ± 3.7% vs 0.3 ± 0.8% aggregation, respectively, P < .01). Similarly, RHI decreased following energy drink consumption (-0.33 ± 0.13 vs 0.07 ± 0.12 RHI [control], P < .05). Mean arterial pressure significantly increased following energy drink consumption, compared with control (P < .05). Heart rate was unaffected by energy drink consumption.

Conclusion

Energy drink consumption acutely increases platelet aggregation and decreases endothelial function in healthy young adults.

### Dangerous mistake: an accidental caffeine overdose [^116hpBmh]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

This case illustrates the life-threatening consequences, such as malignant cardiac arrhythmias, of severe caffeine poisoning, which is a rare event. Also, it highlights the risk of accidental caffeine overdose associated with sports practice, which can be related, not only, to the difficulty in measuring small portions, but also due to unclear consumer's instructions.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^114M7uQT]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

ACSM evidence statement and recommendations note that the serious and detrimental impacts of energy drink consumption are well documented in case reports (ACSM Evidence Category C), and the ACSM writing group concurs that energy drink consumption, especially in vulnerable populations can be potentially hazardous (ACSM Evidence Category D). Recommended actions include that the message that these beverages are not intended for children needs to be re-enforced and widely disseminated and that warnings should be prominently displayed on the front of products naming vulnerable populations, including those younger than 18 yr, who should avoid energy drink use. Regulatory actions are needed, with examples including Health Canada mandates to improve transparency and provide labels and proposals for labeling transparency, clearly labeled warnings, and restriction on sales to those younger than 18 yr until safety and efficacy data are provided by energy drink manufacturers.

Discussion

Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a natural product commonly found in foodstuffs, beverages and medicinal products.

When relatively low doses of caffeine are consumed, severe side effects are uncommon.

However, in recent years, larger amounts of caffeine have been added to energy drinks or taken as dietary supplements, such as anhydrous caffeine, for increasing endurance, concentration and athletic performance.

Normally, mild stimulation is obtained with a caffeine dosage of 0.05–0.2 g. Even though fatal caffeine intoxication is rare, acute ingestion of > 5 g can be lethal.

After oral intake, around 90% of the product is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and clinical effects are observed within 15 min with a peak effect within 1–1.5 hour after consumption. Half-life elimination of caffeine varies between 3 and 7 hours and has several modifying factors such as sex, age, use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy and smoking.

Therefore, there is a significant variability regarding ingested amounts and their toxic effects.

Caffeine is structurally similar to adenosine and acts as a competitive antagonist on adenosine receptors. Adenosine receptors are found throughout the human body. However, they have a specific role in the brain and heart.

By blocking the adenosine receptors, at high doses, caffeine interacts with the sympathetic nervous system inducing prolonged and intensified beta-receptor activation with positive inotropic and chronotropic effects which can trigger arrhytmia. And in toxic doses, caffeine directly releases calcium from intracellular stores, which also may increase the susceptibility for arrhythmias.

Symptoms of caffeine intoxication may include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, dizziness, tinnitus, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and seizures. Toxic levels of caffeine are also associated with severe hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and hyperlactacidaemia. Leucocytosis, mild metabolic acidosis, ketonuria, hypophosphataemia and hypocalcaemia have also been described.

### Alcoholic cardiomyopathy: an update [^115tgans]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of arrhythmia

Alcohol consumption is related to an increased incidence of arrhythmia: both supraventricular (mostly triggered by binge drinking in younger patients) and ventricular tachycardia (in heavier drinkers). However, in AC patients, alcohol intake does not seem to worsen prognosis regarding ventricular arrhythmia compared with iDCM. In any case, abstinence lowers the risk of SCD and ventricular arrhythmia in AC.

The indications for ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy are the same as in non-ischaemic DCM, excluding those cases with an underlying high-risk genetic variant that prompts a lower threshold for ICD implantation (e.g. LMNA, RBM20 FLNC, and other high-risk genes). The same applies for the medical management of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmia in these patients, which is outside the scope of this review.

Supportive care

Extracardiac effects of alcohol such as liver cirrhosis, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, or electrolyte imbalance need to be specifically treated by the corresponding specialists in patients with AC. The result of controlling these comorbidities, as well as concomitant cardiovascular risk factors that are frequent in this population (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia), results in an improved prognosis of these patients. As an example, an early intervention regarding excessive alcohol intake can have a positive effect on controlling hypertension.

In cases of end-stage AC that do not improve with abstinence from alcohol or medical treatment, cardiac transplantation is the only remaining therapeutical option. Once complete abstinence from alcohol is achieved, heart transplantation has proven to be feasible in AC. In a series of 94 patients with AC, almost 30% underwent heart transplantation.

### Alcohol consumption, sinus tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias at the munich octoberfest: results from the munich beer related electrocardiogram workup study (munichBREW) [^111EjPMG]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

We conservatively based sample size considerations on an estimated 1.5% prevalence of any arrhythmia under no acute influence of alcohol and at rest. Even without considering sinus tachycardia, we detected arrhythmias in 2.3% of our chronic and in 5.4% of our acute alcohol cohorts. We thus submit that we present sufficiently powered results. In our acute alcohol cohort, we found a strong and robust association of increased BAC with sinus tachycardia in particular. We were not able to associate increased BAC with other arrhythmia subtypes and specifically atrial fibrillation. This is despite prior reports that repeatedly suggested such a relation coining the term 'holiday heart syndrome'. It is notable that so far studies have considered patients presenting with atrial fibrillation and have then retrospectively identified recent acute alcohol consumption as a presumed cause. Ours is the first large and prospective investigation to systematically analyse the immediate occurrence of arrhythmias under the influence of acute alcohol intake. We thus conclude that acute alcohol consumption leads to increased arrhythmia prevalence overall, with sinus tachycardia as the immediate main effect.

For chronic alcohol consumption, prior results are more equivocal. Based on large community-based studies, modest use does not appear to be a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Only long-term use in the Framingham Heart Study and beyond moderate use (> 35 standard drinks per week) in the Copenhagen City Heart Study resulted in an increased risk for atrial fibrillation. Along these findings, in our own community-based analysis of low to moderate chronic alcohol consumption with less than 20 g/d on average, we did not find an association with an increased arrhythmia prevalence.

A main result of our study is the profound association of acute alcohol consumption with sinus tachycardia. As demonstrated in our sensitivity analysis, it is intuitive to assume that participants of a festival present with significantly higher rates of sinus tachycardia than under resting conditions. However, sinus tachycardia occurred almost 30% more often in Octoberfest participants under the influence of alcohol compared with those without alcohol consumption. Furthermore, the association of sinus tachycardia with higher BAC remained even after accounting for confounders. Although less pronounced, also in KORA S4 increased chronic alcohol consumption was associated with sinus tachycardia.

### Does coffee reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation? [^1161Kpck]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological Features of Coffee and Caffeine

Physiological effects of coffee have shown a protective cardiovascular effect. Caffeine has been reported to be a nonselective inhibitor of adenosine A1 and A2A receptors, 4 reducing the ability of adenosine to shorten atrial action potentials and thereby decreasing the propensity for triggering atrial fibrillation. In addition, constituents of coffee, including caffeine and polyphenols, have antioxidant properties that may potentially help protect against adverse atrial remodeling. 5 Broadly, antioxidants in coffee have been shown to improve cardiovascular health by improving lipid profiles and blood pressure. 6, 7 Collectively, these findings suggest that coffee and the constituents composing coffee may be beneficial to cardiovascular and arrhythmogenic health.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

n-3 fatty acids and statins for prevention of sudden cardiac death — early data were promising regarding n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including a 2006 meta-analysis of 19 observational and RCTs linking consumption to prevention of SCD and the randomized GISSI trial in recent MI in which fish oil 1 g/d reduced mortality due to fewer SCD; however, subsequent RCTs have not replicated these benefits and have shown n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to be ineffective, though studies consistently showed lack of harm and patients can be reassured of their safety. In contrast, statin medications clearly reduce mortality and appear to reduce SCD risk related to ischemic heart disease, with secondary analyses from ICD prevention trials showing less SCD risk among patients on statins, but this effect in HF was not confirmed in 2 prospective RCTs of rosuvastatin in HF (CORONA and GISSI-HF).

### Energy drink-induced cardiomyopathy [^112aeneD]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a case of severe biventricular heart failure potentially related to excessive energy drink consumption in a 21-year-old man. The patient presented with a 4-month history of shortness of breath on exertion, orthopnoea and weight loss. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated severely impaired biventricular systolic function and bilateral ventricular thrombi, subsequently confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which found in addition no oedema, inflammation or focal fibrosis. Blood tests, renal ultrasound and subsequent abdominal MRI demonstrated severe renal failure caused by a chronic obstructive uropathy, long-standing and previously undiagnosed. There was no significant past medical, family or social history other than excessive intake of an energy drink. This case report adds to the growing concern in the literature about the potential cardiotoxic effects of energy drinks, which should be considered when assessing young patients presenting with a non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^114uUU5P]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The Impact of Alcohol Consumption on the Outcome of CA

Although alcohol consumption was strongly associated with the outcome of AF recurrence after the initial CA, the impact did not remain after the final CA. Several reports 4, 5, 20 have described the mechanism of how the consumption of alcohol causes AF. First, there is a link between chronic alcohol abuse and alcoholic cardiomyopathy, 4, 21 which possibly leads to cardiac arrhythmias such as AF. Second, transient triggers, 5, 22 including a hyperadrenergic state (increased levels of serum catecholamines), 20 impaired vagal tone (decreased heart rate variability), 23 electrolyte imbalances, 20 and various electrophysiological changes in atrial cells (eg, an increase in intra‐atrial conduction time represented by a length of the P‐wave, reduction in the refractory period, and negative inotropic effect through calcium‐channel inhibition in ventricular cells) 24, 25, 26 are associated with the occurrence of AF. Regarding the outcome after AF ablation in patients with PAF, the latter factors seem to have more of an effect than the former factor, because neither the duration of the drinking history nor the volume of alcohol consumption, which could have a severe chronic effect, significantly affected the outcome in multivariate analysis even though these factors were remarkably related to the outcome in univariate analysis. Instead, the frequency of weekly alcohol consumption, which could be a transient trigger, remained a significant predictor of AF recurrence after the initial CA even under the multivariate analysis. Although the volume of alcohol consumption or the duration of the drinking history could be correlated with the frequency of alcohol consumption, the frequency may significantly affect the outcome of the initial AF ablation. The similar atrial size and prevalence of non‐PV foci between patients who did and did not consume alcohol may also imply that atrial remodeling is not as severe when AF is paroxysmal, even in patients who consumed alcohol. Indeed, some studies have reported an association between alcohol consumption and mechanical remodeling of the heart 21, 27; however, unfortunately in the present study, no tools were used to ascertain changes in the substrate (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, voltage mapping, or an assessment of areas of fractionation).

We report the case of a 70-year-old woman who developed life-threatening arrhythmia as a result of acute and severe hypokalaemia, which she developed after consuming large quantities of a liquorice-rich herb tea. She had no previous heart condition. We also discuss the legislative discrepancy in both the USA and in Europe, whereby consumers are warned about the risk of chronic hypertension whenever they buy a product containing liquorice, yet the risk of hypokalaemia may not be mentioned at all.
