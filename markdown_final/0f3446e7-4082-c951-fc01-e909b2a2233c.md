## Question

Treatment of laryngitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of laryngitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing acute from chronic laryngitis and identifying red flags. Then, I should verify the evidence base for antibiotics, corticosteroids, and reflux therapies. Next, I will consider nonpharmacologic care and when to escalate to laryngoscopy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm and highlight special scenarios and key takeaways, making sure I double-check any claims against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical categories and natural history, because management hinges on this distinction. Acute laryngitis is typically viral and self-limited, with symptoms resolving within 1 to 3 weeks, whereas chronic laryngitis persists beyond 3 weeks and requires a broader differential and targeted evaluation, including reflux, phonotrauma, and less common infectious or inflammatory etiologies [^e91b5130] [^24dcd688].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics; I need to check the highest-quality evidence. Multiple Cochrane reviews and contemporary guidelines consistently show no objective benefit of antibiotics for acute laryngitis, with any small subjective improvements not outweighing harms and costs; thus, routine antibiotics are not recommended, and this is a strong recommendation across AAO-HNS and primary care guidance [^2c49879f] [^b490030c] [^2baa1154] [^cb9289ed] [^3c15dcdb] [^7c50327b].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about corticosteroids, because patients often ask for a "quick fix". The AAO-HNS guideline issues a strong recommendation against routine corticosteroids for dysphonia prior to laryngeal visualization, citing lack of benefit and potential harms; evidence for steroids in acute laryngitis is limited and indirect, though a single low-dose steroid can modestly accelerate pain relief in acute sore throat, which is a different entity than laryngitis, so I should not extrapolate that to laryngitis without supportive data [^8fdec13b] [^f4587ab3] [^8deb9c41] [^668d1170].

> I will now examine reflux-related laryngitis, because this is a common pitfall. Initially, I thought PPIs were broadly effective for reflux laryngitis, but wait, I should double-check the randomized data. High-quality trials and meta-analyses show no consistent benefit of PPIs over placebo for suspected LPR, with heterogeneity and a strong placebo effect; guidelines advise against empiric PPIs for isolated dysphonia without laryngeal visualization, though a time-limited PPI trial may be reasonable if typical GERD symptoms coexist, ideally with objective reflux testing if symptoms persist or if there are no esophageal symptoms to guide empiric therapy [^f9806b38] [^a4620103] [^4cdd5c0e] [^5474e155] [^04a0204e] [^bd92977a].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic management, because this is foundational. Voice rest, hydration, humidification, and avoidance of irritants are prudent; for persistent or recurrent dysphonia, voice therapy is recommended when the cause is amenable to therapy, and patient education on vocal hygiene and control measures is advised; I need to ensure I anchor these to guideline statements and not overstate benefits beyond the evidence [^1ae018a3] [^8265781b] [^794633c8].

> Let me consider when to escalate diagnostic evaluation, because missing serious disease is the key risk. If dysphonia persists beyond 4 weeks or if red flags are present — such as tobacco use, hemoptysis, respiratory distress, neck mass, or failure to improve — laryngoscopy is recommended to exclude malignancy, structural lesions, or other serious pathology; I should confirm that this threshold is consistent across guidelines and adjust urgency to clinical suspicion [^f63eab06] [^61e7b6a2] [^e91b5130].

> But wait, what if the presentation is not straightforward? I need to ensure I cover special scenarios. In suspected croup (acute laryngotracheitis), corticosteroids are indicated and improve outcomes; in chronic bacterial laryngitis, particularly MRSA, prolonged targeted antibiotics may be required; in fungal laryngitis such as cryptococcus, antifungal therapy is indicated; and in inducible laryngeal obstruction, nonpharmacologic interventions are first-line, with diagnosis typically requiring laryngoscopy when feasible [^ae7552d3] [^250fa87c] [^411816ca] [^25cb5242].

> I should double-check the practical algorithm so it is actionable. For acute laryngitis, observe with supportive care and avoid antibiotics and routine steroids; for chronic laryngitis, address modifiable factors, consider reflux only if typical symptoms coexist and avoid empiric PPIs for isolated throat symptoms, and refer for laryngoscopy if not improving by 4 weeks or if red flags arise; throughout, prioritize voice hygiene and consider voice therapy for persistent dysphonia once the larynx is visualized to guide therapy [^794633c8] [^1ae018a3] [^f63eab06].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and evidence-based. Do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for laryngitis; do not use corticosteroids empirically without laryngeal visualization; do not start PPIs for isolated dysphonia without typical GERD symptoms; and escalate to laryngoscopy if symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks or if serious disease is suspected, while employing supportive voice care and education for all patients [^cb9289ed] [^8fdec13b] [^04a0204e] [^f63eab06].

---

Laryngitis treatment is **primarily supportive**, with voice rest, hydration, and humidification as first-line measures [^notfound]. Antibiotics are **not recommended** for acute viral laryngitis because they do not improve outcomes and increase adverse effects and resistance risk [^2c49879f] [^cb9289ed]. Corticosteroids are **not routine** and should be reserved for select cases (e.g. professional voice users with urgent needs) after weighing risks and benefits [^8fdec13b] [^668d1170]. For suspected reflux laryngitis, a **limited PPI trial** may be considered if typical GERD symptoms are present, but evidence is mixed and empiric PPIs for isolated dysphonia are discouraged [^cc269e28] [^f9806b38]. Persistent symptoms beyond 4 weeks warrant laryngoscopy to exclude serious pathology [^f63eab06].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is the cornerstone of laryngitis management, especially for acute viral cases [^notfound]. The following measures are recommended:

- **Voice rest**: Minimize talking and avoid whispering, which can strain the vocal cords more than normal speech.

- **Hydration**: Encourage adequate fluid intake to maintain mucosal hydration.

- **Humidification**: Use humidifiers or steam inhalation to reduce dryness and irritation.

- **Avoid irritants**: Refrain from smoking, alcohol, and caffeine, which can exacerbate symptoms.

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are **not recommended** for acute viral laryngitis because they do not improve objective outcomes (e.g. voice quality) and carry risks of adverse effects and antibiotic resistance [^2c49879f] [^cb9289ed]. They should only be considered if bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected (e.g. bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis) [^7c50327b].

---

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are **not routinely recommended** for laryngitis due to limited evidence of benefit and potential adverse effects [^8fdec13b]. They may be considered in select cases, such as professional voice users with urgent performance needs, after careful consideration of risks and benefits [^notfound].

---

### Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

PPIs may be considered for suspected reflux laryngitis, particularly when typical GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation) are present [^cc269e28]. However, evidence for PPI efficacy in isolated laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) without esophageal symptoms is mixed, and routine empiric PPI use is discouraged [^f9806b38] [^04a0204e]. A limited trial (8–12 weeks) may be reasonable in selected cases, with further evaluation if symptoms persist [^cc269e28].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Persistent dysphonia beyond 4 weeks, or the presence of red flags, warrants **laryngoscopy** to exclude serious pathology (e.g. malignancy, structural lesions) [^f63eab06]. Red flags include:

- Persistent hoarseness beyond 4 weeks [^f63eab06]

- Hemoptysis (coughing blood)

- Unexplained weight loss

- Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)

- Neck mass or lymphadenopathy

- History of tobacco use

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Voice rest | Acute viral laryngitis | Strongly recommended |
| Hydration | Acute viral laryngitis | Strongly recommended |
| Humidification | Acute viral laryngitis | Strongly recommended |
| Antibiotics | Confirmed bacterial infection | Only if confirmed |
| Corticosteroids | Select cases (e.g. professional voice users) | Use cautiously |
| PPIs | Reflux laryngitis with GERD symptoms | Limited trial |
| Laryngoscopy | Persistent symptoms (> 4 weeks) or red flags | Strongly recommended |

---

Laryngitis treatment is **primarily supportive**, with antibiotics avoided unless bacterial infection is confirmed. Corticosteroids are not routine, and PPIs may be tried selectively for reflux-related cases. Persistent symptoms or red flags require laryngoscopy to exclude serious pathology.

Background

This is an update of the original review published in 2005. Acute laryngitis is a common illness worldwide. Diagnosis is often made by case history alone and treatment often targets symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different antibiotic therapies in adults with acute laryngitis. A secondary objective was to report the rates of adverse events associated with these treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to December 2014), LILACS (1982 to December 2014) and BIOSIS (1980 to December 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo for acute laryngitis. The main outcome was objective voice scores.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted and synthesised data.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (351 participants) that had moderate to high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. We downgraded the studies because of limitations in study design or execution (risk of bias), imprecision and inconsistency of results. We included a new trial presented only as a conference abstract in this update. In one study of acute laryngitis in adults, 100 participants were randomised to receive penicillin V (800 mg twice daily for five days) or an identical placebo. A recording of each patient reading a standardised text was made at the first visit, during re-examination after one and two weeks, and at follow-up after two to six months. No significant differences were found between the groups. The trial also measured symptoms reported by participants and found no significant differences. One study investigated erythromycin for acute laryngitis in 106 adults. The mean objective voice scores measured at the first visit, at re-examination after one and two weeks, and at follow-up after two to six months did not significantly differ between the groups. At one week there were significant beneficial differences in the severity of reported vocal symptoms (slight, moderate and severe) as judged by participants (P value = 0.042). However, the rates of participants having improved voice disturbance (subjective symptoms) at one and two weeks were not significantly different among groups. Comparing erythromycin and placebo groups on the rate of persistence of cough at two weeks, the risk ratio (RR) was 0.38 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.97, P value = 0.04) and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 5.87 (95% CI 3.09 to 65.55). We calculated a RR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.90, P value = 0.034) and a NNTB of 3.76 (95% CI 2.27 to 13.52; P value = 0.01) for the subjective voice scores at one week. A third trial from Russia included 145 patients with acute laryngitis symptoms. Participants were randomised to three treatment groups: Group 1: seven-day course of fusafungine (six times a day by inhalation); Group 2: seven-day course of fusafungine (six times a day by inhalation) plus clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily for seven days); Group 3: no treatment. Clinical cure rates were measured at days 5 ± 1, 8 ± 1 and 28 ± 2. The authors reported significant differences in the rates of clinical cure at day 5 ± 1 favouring fusafungine (one trial; 93 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.20; P value = 0.04) and fusafungine plus clarithromycin (one trial 97 participants; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.16; P value = 0.05) when compared to no treatment. However, no significant differences were found at days 8 ± 1 and 28 ± 2. Also, no significant differences were found when comparing fusafungine to fusafungine plus clarithromycin at days 5 ± 1, 8 ± 1 and 28 ± 2.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics do not appear to be effective in treating acute laryngitis when assessing objective outcomes. They appear to be beneficial for some subjective outcomes. Erythromycin could reduce voice disturbance at one week and cough at two weeks when measured subjectively. Fusafungine could increase the cure rate at day five. The included RCTs had important methodological problems and these modest benefits from antibiotics may not outweigh their cost, adverse effects or negative consequences for antibiotic resistance patterns.

### Antibiotics for acute laryngitis in adults [^b490030c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acute laryngitis is a common illness worldwide. Diagnosis is often made by case history alone and treatment is often directed towards controlling symptoms.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic therapies in adults suffering acute laryngitis. A secondary objective was to report the rates of adverse events associated with these treatments.

Search Strategy

We systematically screened the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1966 to December Week 2 2006); and EMBASE (1974 to June 2006), LILACS (from 1982 to December 2006) and BIOSIS (1980 to June 2002). Other strategies included hand searching relevant journals, searching ongoing trial databases and general databases such as Google scholar.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute laryngitis. The main outcome measurement was objective voice scores.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two review authors and then descriptively synthesized.

Main Results

Only two trials met study inclusion criteria after extensive literature searches. One hundred participants were randomly selected to receive either penicillin V (800 mg twice a day for five days), or an identical placebo, in a study of penicillin V in acute laryngitis in adults. A tape recording of each patient reading a standardized text was obtained during the first visit, subsequently during re-examination after one and two weeks, and at follow up after two to six months. No significant differences were found between the groups. The trial also measured symptoms reported by participants and found no significant differences. The second trial investigated erythromycin for treating acute laryngitis in 106 adults. The mean objective voice scores measured at the first visit, at re-examination after one and two weeks, and at follow up after two to six months did not significantly differ between control and intervention groups. At one week there were significant beneficial differences in the severity of reported vocal symptoms as judged by the participants (P = 0.042). Comparing the erythromycin and placebo groups on subjective voice scores the a priori relative risk (RR) was 0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.96, P = 0.034) and the number needed to treat (NNT) was 4.5.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics appear to have no benefit in treating acute laryngitis. Erythromycin could reduce voice disturbance at one week and cough at two weeks when measured subjectively. We consider that these outcomes are not relevant in clinical practice. The implications for practice are that prescribing antibiotics should not be done in the first instance as they will not objectively improve symptoms.

### Laryngitis – diagnosis and management [^02ed2e5b]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngeal inflammation includes a broad spectrum of pathologies, from infectious processes that need to be managed as airway emergencies, to indolent diseases that mimic head and neck cancer. The importance of a thorough history cannot be emphasized enough as it is the most important step toward developing a differential diagnosis. Vocal pathologies often have a noticeable impact on a person's quality of life and daily activities; therefore, it is key to counsel patients on the course of the disease process. Treatment of specific pathologies depends on the causative pathogen or etiology, as well as the age, vocal demands, and clinical characteristics of the individual.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^cb9289ed]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy for dysphonia — Statement 8: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe antibiotics to treat dysphonia, with a strong recommendation against prescribing based on systematic reviews and randomized trials showing ineffectiveness of antibiotic therapy and a preponderance of harm over benefit. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A with systematic reviews showing no benefit for antibiotics for acute laryngitis or upper respiratory tract infection and Grade A evidence showing potential harms, and the level of confidence in evidence is high. The benefit-harm assessment indicates a preponderance of harm over benefit if antibiotics are prescribed, and exclusions include patients with dysphonia caused by bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infection; the word routine is used to discourage empiric therapy while acknowledging occasional circumstances where antimicrobial use may be appropriate.

### Medical therapy of reflux laryngitis [^052221d3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngeal signs and symptoms are frequently associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Establishing the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), however, is enigmatic as there are no tests that specifically define GERD-related laryngitis. Furthermore, in contrast to typical GERD, the treatment data for LPR using acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors has not shown a statistically significant advantage over placebo. This review highlights the current challenges for establishing the diagnosis of GERD-related LPR and focuses on the limitations of medical therapy directed toward gastric acid suppression.

### Therapeutic strategies for laryngeal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^b17fc35b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is increasingly associated with ear, nose, and throat symptoms, including laryngitis. Many patients are unaware of the gastroesophageal etiology of their symptoms. A variety of criteria are used to diagnose this condition, including laryngoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and the use of ambulatory pH and impedance monitoring. However, no test serves as the gold standard for the diagnosis given their lack of sensitivity and specificity for reflux disease. Numerous trials have assessed the role of proton pump inhibitor therapy in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux and most have revealed no benefit to acid suppression over placebo. Despite many uncertainties there has been some progress regarding the role of acid-suppressive therapy as well as other agents in this unique group of patients. In this review we explore therapeutic options and their rationale for patients with laryngeal signs and symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^e91b5130]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Persistent dysphonia — supporting timing and care patterns — reports that symptoms from viral laryngitis typically last 1 to 3 weeks and then resolve spontaneously, so initial observation for most patients with new-onset dysphonia is reasonable and persistence beyond this period raises concern for other pathologies. Delays are common, with most patients with dysphonia waiting between 88.7 and 119.2 days before seeking treatment and a survey of primary care providers finding that 64% preferred to treat rather than refer a patient with chronic dysphonia (> 6 weeks). The guideline text urges referral based on evidence suggesting that referral for careful laryngeal visualization results in shorter time to disease resolution and is more cost-effective than continued treatment without identification of an underlying etiology. Care patterns further note that a majority of patients (90%) with a complaint of hoarseness initially present to primary care, while otolaryngologists ultimately see between 3% and 10% of initial dysphonia consultations.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections… [^bb6f1df9]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Cohort studies and RCTs have shown that AOM typically resolves without antibiotic therapy in children. These infants should undergo an otolaryngology consultation, if available, for tympanocentesis. 8 Immediate initiation of antibiotics is recommended in children younger than two years with bilateral AOM and in those with AOM and otorrhea. 39, 40 Amoxicillin is recommended as first-line treatment for AOM. 7–9. If there is no response to initial antibiotic therapy within 48 to 72 hours, the patient should be reexamined to confirm the diagnosis, and amoxicillin/clavulanate should be initiated. 7, 8 Ceftriaxone can be used as a second-line agent or in children with vomiting. 7 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin/sulfisoxazole are not effective for the treatment of AOM. 7, 8 Longer courses of antibiotics have lower failure rates than shorter courses.
41.

Laryngitis Acute laryngitis is inflammation of the vocal cords and larynx lasting less than three weeks. 54 Symptoms include loss or muffling of the voice, sore throat, and other classic URI symptoms such as cough, fever, runny nose, and headache. A Cochrane review of antibiotic therapy in patients with laryngitis found two studies showing that antibiotic use does not reduce the duration of symptoms or lead to voice improvement. 54 Although these studies are older, there are no recent studies to indicate that these conclusions have changed. Laryngitis is a self-limited, viral disease that does not respond to antibiotic therapy.
18. 55, 56 The incidence of epiglottitis in children has decreased with the use of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines in early infancy. 13, 57 A combination of an intravenous antistaphylococcal agent that is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a third-generation cephalosporin may be effective.

12 Intravenous monotherapy with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin/sulbactam is also recommended. 13–15.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^76458adc]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, laryngoscopy was the mandatory gold standard for the accurate assessment and diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction. However, upper airway endoscopy is considered an aerosol-generating procedure in professional guidelines, meaning routine procedures are highly challenging and the availability of laryngoscopy is reduced. In response, we have convened a multidisciplinary panel with broad experience in managing this disease and agreed a recommended strategy for presumptive diagnosis in patients who cannot have laryngoscopy performed due to pandemic restrictions. To maintain clinical standards whilst ensuring patient safety, we discuss the importance of triage, information gathering, symptom assessment and early review of response to treatment. The consensus recommendations will also be potentially relevant to other future situations where access to laryngoscopy is restricted, although we emphasize that this investigation remains the gold standard.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^664d3388]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics in dysphonia — policy and rationale: Policy level is "Strong recommendation against." Dysphonia in most patients is caused by acute viral laryngitis and routine empiric antibiotics are unwarranted; "Acute laryngitis is self-limited, with most patients experiencing symptomatic improvement within 7 to 10 days irrespective of treatment," and a Cochrane review "found that antibiotics do not appear to be effective in treating acute laryngitis in terms of objective outcomes." Cost and harm considerations include that "Medications account for one-fifth to one-third of total direct costs in management of laryngeal disorders, and 30% of that is attributable to antibiotics," and "Antibiotics can have side effects, including rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting," with "Overprescription [that] contributes to bacterial antibiotic resistance." Limited exceptions are noted: "Antibiotics for dysphonia may be appropriate in select circumstances," often in immunosuppressed patients, and "The diagnosis should be established prior to initiation of therapy."

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^531f14e3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections account for millions of visits to family physicians each year in the United States. Although warranted in some cases, antibiotics are greatly overused. This article outlines the guidelines and indications for appropriate antibiotic use for common upper respiratory infections. Early antibiotic treatment may be indicated in patients with acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, epiglottitis, or bronchitis caused by pertussis. Persistent cases of rhinosinusitis may necessitate the use of antibiotics if symptoms persist beyond a period of observation. Antibiotics should not be considered in patients with the common cold or laryngitis. Judicious, evidence-based use of antibiotics will help contain costs and prevent adverse effects and drug resistance.

American Gastroenterological Association GERD management — suspected extraesophageal GERD syndromes (laryngitis, asthma, cough): Grade B is recommended with fair evidence that it improves important outcomes for acute or maintenance therapy with once- or twice-daily PPIs (or H2RAs) in patients with a suspected extraesophageal GERD syndrome who have a concomitant esophageal GERD syndrome; Grade D: recommend against once- or twice-daily PPIs (or H2RAs) for acute treatment in the absence of a concomitant esophageal GERD syndrome; and Grade Insuff.: no recommendation, insufficient evidence to recommend for or against once- or twice-daily PPIs for patients with suspected reflux cough syndrome. Supporting context states that the only randomized controlled trials showing a treatment effect were in patients with esophageal GERD symptoms in addition to either laryngitis or asthma, and that most therapeutic trials used twice-daily dosing of PPIs for treatment periods of 3–4 months.

### Glucocorticoids in laryngology: a review [^03e54536]. The Laryngoscope (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To provide the otolaryngologist an evidence-based sound review of glucocorticoid use for laryngeal pathology.

Study Design

Review of contemporary peer-reviewed literature as well as review articles.

Methods

A review of the literature regarding glucocorticoids as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of benign laryngeal pathology and laryngeal manifestations of systemic disease was performed. Review included both systemic administration as well as local injection.

Results

Glucocorticoids, administered in the critical care setting for planned extubation, markedly reducing the risk of reintubation and remain a rudimentary pharmacologic adjunct in laryngeal manifestations of common autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Intralesional injection has reduced the rate of surgical intervention for benign inflammatory primary laryngeal pathology.

Conclusions

Glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of a number of laryngeal pathologies, through both systemic and intralesional administration. However, a clear consensus for utilization of glucocorticoids in the treatment of specific laryngeal disorders has yet to be published.

Asthma without evidence of persistent Type 2 inflammation — management steps state: Consider other treatments if there is no evidence of Type 2 inflammation. If the patient has no evidence of persistent Type 2 inflammation, review the basics for factors that may be contributing to symptoms or exacerbations, recommend avoidance of relevant exposures (tobacco smoke, pollution, allergens if sensitized and there is evidence of benefit from withdrawal, irritants, infections) and ask about exposures at home and at work, and consider additional diagnostic investigations such as sputum induction to confirm inflammatory phenotype, high resolution chest CT, bronchoscopy to exclude unusual comorbidities or alternative diagnoses such as tracheobronchomalacia or sub-glottic stenosis, and functional laryngoscopy for inducible laryngeal obstruction.

### Extralaryngeal manifestations of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease [^dd70e4ef]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Extralaryngeal manifestations of laryngopharyngeal reflux are widely recognised, although evidence to support mechanistic pathways is still lacking. Evidence to support reflux contribution to the following disorders is accumulating: otitis media, sinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea, dental erosions, subglottic and tracheal stenosis, inflammatory lung disease and lung transplant rejection. Acid likely only plays a small part in symptom generation and therefore proton pump inhibitor therapy will not provide sustained relief for many, and should no longer be considered as a diagnostic trial. Multifaceted management including behavioural modifications, barrier protection, antiinflammatory approaches and occasionally surgery are more effective.

Mucosal Leishmaniasis

XVII. What are the treatment options for American (New World) mucosal leishmaniasis (ML)?

Recommendations
45. All persons with clinically manifest, metastatic, American ML should receive systemic antileishmanial therapy, with the goals of preventing morbidity (e.g. disfigurement) and mortality (e.g. from aspiration pneumonia or respiratory obstruction) [Strong, low].
46. Before treatment is initiated, a complete examination of the naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal mucosa should be conducted by a specialist to assess the anatomic extension and clinical severity of the mucosal disease, which have prognostic implications [Strong, moderate].
47. We recommend inpatient monitoring and prophylactic corticosteroid therapy for persons with laryngeal/pharyngeal disease and increased risk for respiratory obstruction, as indicated by symptoms and otolaryngologic/radiologic examinations, because of the potential for inflammatory reactions after initiation of antileishmanial therapy [Strong, low].
48. The choice of antileishmanial agent, dose, and duration of therapy for persons with ML should be individualized (Table 3) [Strong, moderate]. Remarks: The traditional options for ML include treatment with a pentavalent antimonial (Sb V) compound (20 mg Sb V /kg daily, IV or IM, for 28–30 days) or with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.5–1.0 mg/kg per dose, IV, daily or every other day, for a cumulative total of ∼20–45 mg/kg). More recently, on the basis of comparatively limited data, the armamentarium has expanded to include lipid formulations of amphotericin B (typically, liposomal amphotericin B [L-AmB], with a cumulative total dose ranging widely from ∼20–60 mg/kg), as well as the oral agent miltefosine (∼2.5 mg/kg per day [maximum, 150 mg/day] for 28 days).

### Treatment of clinically diagnosed laryngopharyngeal reflux disease… [^a1c18664]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

The clinical improvement in both controls and study patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux disease is seen. Triple therapy comprised esomeprazole plus amoxicillin sodium and clarithromycin. In both groups, treatment was daily for 4 weeks. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Design Randomized controlled study. Setting Suez Canal University Hospital, Ismalia, Egypt. Patients A total of 212 patients with symptoms of LPRD. Intervention Patients were evaluated by laryngoscopy, ambulatory pH monitoring for 24 hours, and HPSA testing. Esomeprazole magnesium as a monotherapy was evaluated vs triple therapy in patients with HP infection. Persistent dry cough and a feeling of a lump in the throat were the most frequent symptoms of LPRD, while posterior laryngeal inflammation was the main laryngoscopic finding. Results from the HPSA test were positive in 57% of the studied group.

Patients with negative HPSA were treated with esomeprazole as single modality with a reported improvement score of 96. 6%. Patients with positive HPSA test results were divided into 2 groups: 1 received only esomeprazole, with reported improvement in 40%, whereas the second group was treated with esomeprazole, plus amoxicillin sodium and clarithromycin and reported a 90% incidence of symptom improvement. The second study group received triple therapy comprising esomeprazole magnesium, 40 mg, plus amoxicillin sodium, 1 g, and clarithromycin, 500 mg, 14 for the same period. Two patients discontinued follow-up. Fifty-three patients showed marked improvement in symptoms, partial improvement occurred in 3 patients, and 3 patients showed no improvement. In conclusion, the incidence of the HP infection in patients with LPRD in our study is 57%.

Second, HP infection should be considered when treatment is prescribed to patients with LPRD because the standard therapy for GERD might be insufficient. Finally, the use of triple therapy in the treatment of LPRD with HP infection might result in a higher cure rate.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^8fdec13b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Hoarseness (dysphonia) — corticosteroid therapy recommendation: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx, with a recommendation against prescribing based on randomized trials showing adverse events and absence of clinical trials demonstrating benefits with a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use. Quality improvement opportunity is to discourage the empiric use of steroids for dysphonia prior to laryngeal examination. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with randomized trials showing increased incidence of adverse events associated with orally administered steroids and absence of clinical trials demonstrating any benefit of steroid treatment on outcomes, and the level of confidence in evidence is high. The benefit is to avoid potential adverse events associated with unproven therapy, with risks, harms, costs noted as none, and a benefits-harms assessment indicating a preponderance of harm over benefit for steroid use; value judgments emphasize avoiding adverse events of ineffective or unproven therapy. Patient preferences have a small role with shared decision making in specific circumstances, exclusions include children with croup, the policy level is recommendation against, and there were no differences of opinions.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors to treat persistent throat symptoms: multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial [^f9806b38]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Persistent throat symptoms are a common presentation in primary and secondary care and principally comprise hoarseness; the sensation of a lump in the throat (globus); repeated throat clearing; mucus in the throat, or "catarrh"; cough; and throat discomfort. The prevalence of globus alone in middle aged women is about 6%, with a lifetime ever population incidence of more than 40%. A quarter of patients attending primary care for other conditions might report major throat symptoms when questioned.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) affects up to 20% of the Western population. An association between GORD and throat and voice symptoms is widely cited — a decade ago more than half of British otolaryngologists prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for throat symptoms.GORD and related symptoms have been described using a variety of terms, including extraoesophageal reflux, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and reflux laryngitis. The concept of a link between GORD and throat and voice symptoms has since become even more popular, with open access primary care guidelines advocating PPI treatment. The few randomised controlled trials that have compared PPIs with placebo are heterogeneous and generally underpowered. By far the largest controlled trial included 145 patientsand found no benefit from treating suspected reflux laryngitis with PPIs twice daily compared with placebo twice daily. Despite variable quality, recent meta-analyses of small randomised controlled trials indicate either no benefitor mild superiorityof PPIs over placebo. Increasing use of PPIs, at cost to the National Health Service, has become the default treatment for persistent throat symptoms in primary and secondary care without robust evidence. Inappropriate use of PPIs is a major healthcare concern and contributes to polypharmacy, risk of drug interactions, and risk of side effects. A US study found that the cost of treating extraoesophageal reflux symptoms in 281 patients was more than fivefold that of the estimated cost of treating patients with traditional GORD symptoms, with more than 50% of these costs attributed to prescriptions for PPIs.

We investigated the role of PPIs as pragmatic preferred treatment for throat symptoms in primary and secondary care.

### Clinical outcomes of laryngopharyngeal reflux treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7f814a6c]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the therapeutic benefit of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) over placebo in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and to analyze the epidemiological factors of heterogeneity in the literature.

Methods

An electronic literature search was conducted to identify articles published between 1990 and 2018 about clinical trials describing the efficiency of medical treatment(s) on LPR. First, a meta-analysis of placebo randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PPIs versus placebo was conducted according to diet. The heterogeneity, response to PPIs, and evolution of clinical scores were analyzed for aggregate results. Second, a systematic review of diagnosis methods, clinical outcome of treatment, and therapeutic regimens was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.

Results

The search identified 1,140 relevant publications, of which 72 studies met the inclusion criteria for a total of 5,781 patients. Ten RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The combined relative risk was 1.31 in favor of PPIs and increased to 1.42 when patients did not receive diet recommendations. Randomized controlled trials were characterized by a significant heterogeneity due to discrepancies in clinical therapeutic outcomes, diagnosis methods (lack of gold standard diagnostic tools), and therapeutic scheme. The epidemiological analysis of all articles supports the existence of these discrepancies in the entire literature. In particular, many symptoms and signs commonly encountered in LPR are not assessed in the treatment effectiveness. The lack of diagnosis precision and variability of inclusion criteria particularly create bias in all reported and included articles.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis supports a mild superiority of PPIs over placebo and the importance of diet as additional treatment but demonstrates the heterogeneity between studies, limiting the elaboration of clear conclusions. International recommendations are proposed for the development of future trials. Laryngoscope, 129:1174–1187, 2019.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^7c50327b]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections are responsible for millions of physician visits in the United States annually. Although viruses cause most acute upper respiratory tract infections, studies show that many infections are unnecessarily treated with antibiotics. Because inappropriate antibiotic use results in adverse events, contributes to antibiotic resistance, and adds unnecessary costs, family physicians must take an evidence-based, judicious approach to the use of antibiotics in patients with upper respiratory tract infections. Antibiotics should not be used for the common cold, influenza, COVID-19, or laryngitis. Evidence supports antibiotic use in most cases of acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, and epiglottitis and in a limited percentage of acute rhinosinusitis cases. Several evidence-based strategies have been identified to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for acute upper respiratory tract infections.

### Evaluation of omeprazole in the treatment of reflux laryngitis: a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study [^21641b38]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Proton-pump inhibitors are often recommended in the treatment of laryngitis secondary to gastric reflux. Despite prospective treatment studies reporting high efficacy, only one previous report has been placebo-controlled and blinded. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of omeprazole in treating proven reflux laryngitis.

Study Design

Prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.

Methods

Fifty-three patients with one or more reflux laryngitis symptoms were recruited to undergo 24-hour dual-channel pH probe testing. Thirty patients with more than four episodes of laryngopharyngeal reflux were enrolled. By random assignment, 15 patients received 40 mg omeprazole twice a day and the other 15 received placebo for a period of 2 months. Symptoms (hoarseness, throat pain, lump in throat sensation, throat clearing, cough, excessive phlegm, dysphagia, odynophagia, and heartburn) and endoscopic laryngeal signs (erythema, edema, and mucus accumulation) were recorded initially, at 1 month, and 2 months.

Results

In general, most symptom scores improved over time for both the omeprazole and placebo groups. Hoarseness, when patients begin with low hoarseness symptom scores, and throat clearing improved significantly more in patients on omeprazole than in those on placebo during the 2-month study. Throat pain, lump in throat sensation, excessive phlegm, difficulty swallowing, pain with swallowing, and heartburn showed improvement in both treatment arms, signifying the possibility of a placebo effect. Endoscopic laryngeal signs did not change significantly over the course of the study for either treatment group.

Conclusions

A placebo effect appears to exist in the treatment of reflux laryngitis. However, hoarseness, when initially scored low, and throat clearing resulting from reflux laryngitis are effectively treated by omeprazole.

### How to understand and treat laryngopharyngeal reflux [^0beeccf0]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is frustrating, as symptoms are nonspecific and diagnosis is often unclear. Two main approaches to diagnosis are empiric treatment trials and objective reflux testing. Initial empiric trial of Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) twice daily for 2–3 months is convenient, but risks overtreatment and delayed diagnosis if patient complaints are not from LPR. Dietary modifications, H2-antagonists, alginates, and fundoplication are other possible LPR treatments. If objective diagnosis is desired or patients' symptoms are refractory to empiric treatment, pH testing with/without impedance should be considered. Additionally, evaluation for non-reflux etiologies of complaints should be performed, including laryngoscopy or videostroboscopy.

### Laryngeal dysfunction: assessment and management for the clinician [^df0af060]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The larynx is one of the most highly innervated organs in humans and serves a number of vitally important, complex, and highly evolved biological functions. On a day-to-day basis, the larynx functions autonomously, addressing several roles including airway protection, swallowing, and phonation. In some situations the larynx appears to adopt a functional state that could be considered maladaptive or "dysfunctional". This laryngeal dysfunction can underpin and account for a number of respiratory symptoms that otherwise appear incongruous with a clinical disease state and/or contribute to the development of symptoms that appear "refractory" to treatment. These include conditions associated with a heightened tendency for inappropriate laryngeal closure (e.g., inducible laryngeal obstruction), voice disturbance, and chronic cough. Recognition of laryngeal dysfunction is important to deliver targeted treatment and failure to recognize the condition can lead to repeated use of inappropriate treatment. Diagnosis is not straightforward, however, and many patients appear to present with symptoms attributable to laryngeal dysfunction, but in whom the diagnosis has been overlooked in clinical work-up for some time. This review provides an overview of the current state of knowledge in the field of laryngeal dysfunction, with a focus on pragmatic clinical assessment and management.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guidelines address a variety of otolaryngologic diseases and/or procedures. It may seem reasonable to create these guidelines by assembling a team of expert clinicians familiar with the pertinent clinical issues and the available evidence, with debate and eventual agreement leading to recommendations. However, trustworthy clinical practice guidelines are in fact created via a defined process to assemble a guideline development group composed of diverse stakeholders: clinician generalists and specialists, content experts, methodologists, physicians and nonphysicians, patients, and advocates. Such a guideline development group can create a valuable and trusted guideline for clinicians and affected patients.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^06481ba8]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Vocal demand and voice behaviour

Dysphonia and other irritating throat symptoms are more prevalent among professional voice usersdue to prolonged or exaggerated vocal fold vibration, which cause mechanical epithelial injury and inflammation, termed phonotrauma. Laryngeal muscle tension and fatigue related to excess vocal strain may play a roleand contributions from psychosomatic factors are common themes in the literature.

Diagnostic approach

A history of increased voice demand is sought although chronic phonatory symptoms (cough and throat clearing) are also considered potential precipitants. Nasoendoscopic findings involving laryngeal inflammation, motor tension or disrupted vocal cord movement may be contributory although such features are non-specific.

Treatment approach

Treatments include strategies to improve vocal hygiene and minimise excess voice demands, as well as targeted therapies to normalise aberrant motor patterns or tensionand address sensory components which may drive phonotraumatic symptoms. Patients may also be provided with reflux therapies in a 'cover all' approach.

Aerosolised irritants

Numerous airborne aerosols are irritative or noxious to the respiratory tract, including the laryngopharynx. Irritants are classified by occupational, domestic and environmental source. Impacts on the aerodigestive tract are specific to irritating agents and are associated with several throat symptoms.

Diagnostic and treatment approach

Comprehensive analysis of environmental aerodigestive irritants and proposed aerodigestive symptom implications are available, including diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Respiratory allergy

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are among the most common allergic manifestations in the general population. Despite a continuous respiratory epithelium extending between the nasal and lower airways, the larynx and pharynx are excluded among defined airway allergy phenotypes. Chronic throat symptoms are more prevalent in allergic populationsand vice versa. Historically, throat symptoms when present are regarded as secondary manifestations, caused by irritative secretions travelling up from the lower airway or falling from the nasal cavity or via unified airway pathophysiology. However, emerging evidence advances IgE-mediated eosinophilic inflammation within the laryngopharynx as a previously under-recognised consequence of allergen sensitisation in some. This concept of an 'allergic laryngitis' (AL) is supported by a developing literature that points to epidemiological evidence and results from direct allergy provocation studies in both animal and human studies. Further research is needed to clarify its biological basis and clinical implications.

Diagnostic and treatment approach

AL is yet to be accepted as a valid diagnosis of airway allergy and has no established diagnostic or treatment directions beyond chronic cough under the 'upper airway cough syndrome' framework.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^7aa68f72]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Summary box

Unexplained chronic throat symptoms (UCTS) are a common presentation to gastroenterology and otolaryngology departments and cause considerable burden in both primary and specialist care.
The yield of diagnostic tests is low and the assessment and management of UCTS differs widely across specialty settings, involving contradictory aetiological concepts, nomenclature and terminology, fragmenting patient care, consequently leading to variable outcomes.
Clinical characteristics are non-specific and occur in heterogeneous fashion between diagnostic divides. Their correlation to postulated diagnoses remains unresolved, presenting a diagnostic and management dilemma for clinicians.
Key multifactorial pathophysiological concepts include chronic laryngopharyngeal inflammation, sensory and motor dysfunctions, symptom hypervigilance, intersected by diverse biopsychosocial factors, with significant overlaps with disorders of gut–brain interaction.
Evidence suggests a more unified symptom construct and interdisciplinary approach may offer advantages both for patient outcomes and collaborative research endeavours.

### Sepsis in a patient with acute epiglottitis and respiratory failure [^5431cb84]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Whenever evidence for swelling of the upper airway exists, clinicians should be aware of possibly rapid clinical deterioration. Intubation should be evaluated early aiming at avoiding complications such as severe hypoxaemia. Neisseria meningitidis is a rare cause of epiglottitis/supraglottitis, usually responsive to most recommended antibiotic regimens. Steroid treatment is controversially discussed in the treatment of epiglottitis, but can be taken into consideration for the clinical presentation of bacterial sepsis in the sense of sepsis bundle treatment.

### Antibiotics for acute laryngitis in adults… [^356b3573]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are antibiotics effective for the treatment of acute laryngitis in adults. Evidence-Based Answer Two small trials of antibiotic treatment in acute laryngitis do not support routine use of antibiotics in these patients. Most patients will feel better in five to seven days, and it is unlikely that they will experience a clinically important benefit from antibiotics. Practice Pointers Laryngitis is characterized by hoarseness accompanied by varying degrees of sore throat, congestion, and other symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Although it usually is a viral infection, bacteria such as. Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been isolated from the respiratory tract of symptomatic patients. Whether the bacteria are the cause of infection and whether treatment with antibiotics improves symptoms is not clear.

Nevertheless, many physicians routinely prescribe antibiotics for adults with laryngitis. Reveiz and colleagues reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotics for the treatment of acute laryngitis in adults, and to report any associated adverse effects. Despite an extensive review, only two relevant clinical trials were identified. They were conducted by the same group of Swedish researchers and were published in 1985 and 1993. In the first trial, penicillin V or placebo was given twice daily for five days to 100 adults with laryngitis. Symptoms reported by the patients and a blinded assessment of voice quality were recorded for up to six months. There was no significant difference found between antibiotic and placebo groups for any of the measured outcomes. The second study compared erythromycin with placebo.

The authors found a small benefit in voice after one week and an improvement in reported cough symptoms at two weeks in the treatment group. Adverse events were not reported. The poor quality of the literature for such a common condition is similar to that for bronchitis and other upper respiratory tract infections. Even patients with purulent secretions usually have viral infections and do not benefit from antibiotics. 1.

### Proton pump inhibitor therapy for the treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6c0bbdc5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Goals

To compare the treatment effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and placebo for patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).

Study

PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched from the date of conception to August 2014. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis if they compared the treatment response of PPI therapy and placebo among patients with LPR. The risk difference, the standard mean difference (SMD), and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the endpoints evaluated.

Results

Fourteen eligible RCTs with 771 participants were identified and analyzed in this meta-analysis. By pooling all eligible data, we found that patients treated with PPI therapy had a significantly higher response rate than those who received placebo (risk difference = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.01–0.30). Compared with placebo, PPI therapy could also improve the total reflux symptom index significantly (SMD = 1.65; 95% CI, 0.15–3.14), but results of the reflux symptom index varied for specific symptoms. However, PPI therapy did not show any advantage over placebo in the improvement of the reflux finding score (SMD = 0.62; 95% CI, -0.96–2.19).

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis of 14 eligible RCTs, we found that in patients with LPR, PPI therapy could improve reflux symptoms significantly compared with placebo.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^61e7b6a2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Statement 4B — need for laryngoscopy in persistent dysphonia — clinicians should perform laryngoscopy, or refer to a clinician who can perform laryngoscopy, when dysphonia fails to resolve or improve within 4 weeks or irrespective of duration if a serious underlying cause is suspected; this is a Recommendation based on observational studies, expert opinion, and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is stated as Grade C, observational studies on the natural history of benign laryngeal disorders; grade C for observational studies plus expert opinion on defining what constitutes a serious underlying condition, with Level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits include avoiding missed or delayed diagnosis of serious conditions and permitting prompt assessment of the larynx when serious concern exists, whereas risks, harms, costs include potential for delay in diagnosis, procedure-related morbidity, procedure-related expense, and patient discomfort; the benefits-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note a consensus-based agreement on 4 weeks with the option to proceed more promptly based on clinical circumstances; Exclusions are none, the Policy level is Recommendation, and the role of patient preferences is limited with a serious underlying concern but moderate without one. Differences of opinions are reported regarding the time frame (4 or 6 weeks), with 10 panel members favoring a 4-week time frame and 5 favoring a 6-week time frame.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: expert review [^5474e155]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effectiveness for extraesophageal manifestations — meta-analyses show no advantage for PPIs over placebo for suspected GERD-related chronic laryngitis (relative risk, 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94–1.74) and no clear benefit for chronic cough, while in asthma a small mean improvement in morning peak expiratory flow (mean difference, 8.68 L/min; 95% CI, 2.35–15.02) was deemed unlikely to be clinically meaningful, and empirical PPI use for routine asthma treatment was not endorsed.

### Laryngeal cryptococcosis: clinical presentation and treatment of a rare cause of hoarseness [^411816ca]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Laryngeal cryptococcosis is rare, with few reported cases in the literature. We present current investigation and treatment recommendations for this disease.

Study Design

A structured literature review; additional cases and expert opinion are presented.

Results

Localized laryngeal cryptococcal infection most commonly presents with persisting hoarseness. Clinical suspicion of the disease is required for accurate diagnosis, with treatment based on the patient's immune status. Early microbiological advice and adequate follow-up is recommended to ensure disease resolution.

Conclusion

Isolated laryngeal cryptococcosis is a rare presentation of fungal infection. It is easily treated and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with persisting hoarseness.

### "Active larynx": preliminary evaluation of the reliability of visual assessments of laryngeal inflammation [^b14477cf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

While the agreement was poor for the decision of whether to delay surgery due to laryngeal inflammation, there was a significant difference in the overall rating of activeness and in the sum of the characteristics measured between larynges for which surgeons would delay surgery and larynges for which surgeons would not. A formal analysis of the predictive capacity including exploratory factor analysis and evaluations of internal consistency is not possible with such a small study population. The decision to proceed with surgery is multifactorial, and activeness may play a small role in the decision. As such, an activeness scale is unlikely to ever be predictive of surgery planning. However, this initial evaluation of convergent and discriminant validity is promising and warrants further investigation.

Although the term active larynx is anecdotally discussed frequently among airway surgeons, it is rarely seen in the literature. A recent consensus statement on outcomes to report for LTR nearly reached consensus for including "active/reactive larynx."Other guidance documents reference evaluating for inflammation whether inflammation is "active" or mature. Numerous other reports discuss prophylactic treatments of reflux medications, azithromycin, topical or systemic steroids, or other anti‐inflammatory treatments. This is not surprising given how inflammation is implicated in the formation and progression of stenosis in the context of airway reconstruction and otherwise., Despite these numerous causes of airway inflammation, it is not clear that these causes have different appearances endoscopically. For example, diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux by laryngoscopy findings has been limited by low positive predictive value and competing diagnoses. Follow‐up studies on the active larynx might categorize larynges in the image library according to etiology to determine if these causes can be differentiated visually.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^14dcc792]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment options available for management of extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and to compare the most recent technological advances to the existing guidelines.

Summary Background Data

Extraesophageal manifestations of GERD include cough, laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), and asthma. Recent advances in diagnostic modalities may have outpaced the existing diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases for articles pertaining to the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of extraesophageal manifestations of reflux, specifically cough due to reflux, LPR, and asthma due to reflux. Search terms applied to 3 thematic topics: diagnosis, medical treatment, and surgical treatment. We had searched the bibliographies of included studies, yielding a total of 271 articles for full review. We graded the level of evidence and classified recommendations by size of treatment effect, according to the guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.

Results

One hundred twenty-eight articles met criteria for analysis. Our findings show that the diagnosis of cough, LPR, or asthma due to gastroesophageal reflux is difficult, as no criterion standard test exits. Also, patients often present without heartburn or regurgitation typical of GERD. Combined multichannel intraluminal impedance, the pH (MII-pH) monitoring system, and the symptom association probability (SAP) test might distinguish extraesophageal manifestations of reflux from idiopathic chronic cough, laryngitis due to other causes, and atopic asthma. In addition, extraesophageal manifestations of reflux are most effectively diagnosed with a stepwise approach incorporating empiric treatment and antisecretory therapy, combined MII-pH monitoring, and surgical intervention in few selected cases.

Conclusions

Recent studies demonstrate the potential diagnostic role of MII-pH monitoring. Surgical intervention provides resolution of extraesophageal symptoms less reliably than typical symptoms when the patient has GERD.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^034d3346]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) symptoms treated with proton pump inhibitors — study results show mixed benefit: "PPI treatment is often used in patients suspected of having reflux-related laryngeal symptoms and signs also termed LPR" but "substantive evidence for impact of this approach is sparse and in need of clarity." Open-labeled studies report response "ranging from 47% to 90%"; in 1 randomized trial of "rabeprazole, 20mg twice daily, versus placebo" there was "a significant improvement in symptom index score" without a difference in laryngeal signs, whereas "This multicenter randomized double-blinded study of 145 patients suspected of LPR did not show a benefit" after "4-months with esomeprazole, 40 mg twice daily," and "Three subsequent meta-analyses of controlled studies in LPR have suggested no benefit to PPI therapy overall; however, there was evidence that a subgroup of patients may benefit from such therapy."

### Is GRADE the right choice for clinical practice guidelines developed by the American academy of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery foundation? [^6d8cfb68]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), developed to inform clinicians, patients, and policy makers about what constitutes optimal clinical care, are one way of increasing implementation of evidence into clinical practice. Many factors must be considered by multidisciplinary guideline panels, including strength of available evidence, limitations of current knowledge, risks/benefits of interventions, patient values, and limited resources. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) is a framework for summarizing evidence that has been endorsed by many national and international organizations for developing CPGs. But is GRADE the right choice for CPGs developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF)? In this commentary, we will introduce GRADE, discuss its strengths and limitations, and address the question of what potential benefits GRADE might offer beyond existing methodology used by the AAO-HNSF in developing CPGs.

### Unexpected consequences of proton pump inhibitor use [^d91ffc81]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed classes of medications for gastroesophageal and laryngopharyngeal reflux diseases. There is emerging evidence that the pathogenesis of disease in laryngeal mucosa is not just related to refluxed acid, but also the presence of pepsin and acidic microenvironments. The widespread use of PPIs is also calling into question potential complications of PPI use. This commentary expands upon these issues with other potential unexpected consequences, and considers the importance of determining a proper approach to patient management.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1ddabb4f]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

Extraesophageal reflux syndromes — continuation, discontinuation, and step-down of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy are tied to concomitant esophageal disease and response. Many patients will have persistent symptoms after 8 weeks of empirical PPI therapy. The need for continued PPI therapy is predicated on the presence and severity of concomitant esophageal syndromes. In the absence of concomitant esophageal GERD syndromes, PPI therapy should be discontinued and other diagnostic and/or therapeutic avenues pursued. There are no trials showing the effectiveness of maintenance therapy for patients in whom empirical therapy with twice-daily PPI therapy results in improvement of asthma, cough, or laryngitis. Step-down therapy should be attempted, but the likelihood of symptom recurrence with step-down therapy in patients with extraesophageal reflux syndrome is currently unknown.

### MRSA chronic bacterial laryngitis: a growing problem [^250fa87c]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Chronic bacterial infection of the larynx is characterized by long-standing hoarseness and exudative laryngitis. Prolonged antibiotic therapy is required to clear the infection, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may be the responsible pathogen. The objective of this study was to describe the presentation, comorbidities, treatment response, and underlying etiology- including the incidence of MRSA-in our patient population with chronic bacterial laryngitis.

Methods

A review of patients with a diagnosis of chronic bacterial laryngitis from 2012 to 2016 was performed. Diagnosis of chronic bacterial laryngitis was based on clinical history and findings on flexible laryngoscopy. In selected cases, the diagnosis of bacterial laryngitis was confirmed by operative biopsy. Information regarding clinical presentation and course was collected.

Results

Twenty-eight patients were included in the study. Twenty-three were treated empirically with Amoxicillin-clavulonic acid for a minimum of 21 days. Twelve of the 23 (52%) had recurrence or nonresolution of infection. Seven of the 12 nonresponders (58%) were found to have MRSA by laryngeal tissue culture. Five patients were treated initially with Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and all resolved the infection without the need for further treatment. There was a nonstatistically significant increase in smoking and reflux in the MRSA population compared to the non-MRSA group.

Conclusion

MRSA infection was documented in 30% of patients overall with chronic bacterial laryngitis. Based on the results of the study, a treatment algorithm for management of this unusual patient population is suggested.

### UK consensus statement on the diagnosis of inducible laryngeal obstruction in light of the COVID-19 pandemic [^2c123672]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

3 FUTURE STEPS

Recognizing the dynamic and unpredictable landscape that we are working in, the implementation of these recommendations should be audited, not only regarding their efficacy, but also their acceptability and feasibility for patients and healthcare professionals. Two key risks in particular should be recognized and monitored. The first relates to over‐treatment in the absence of the current gold standard; the second relates to under‐treatment for patients at risk of extreme distress, and high healthcare utilization.

Acceptability and feasibility should be monitored at a local level, recognizing variations in local resources, capacity and patient demographics. Service providers should recognize that patients often have different capabilities, or preferences for treatment place and type. Some may be hesitant about attending hospitals during the pandemic or lack confidence with tele‐medicine. We welcome the development of resources (eg videos) that can aid patient understanding of diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.

In the absence of routine laryngoscopy, the risk of misdiagnosis must not be overlooked and so it is imperative to maintain strong connections between respiratory and otolaryngology services. A research opportunity exists to investigate the diagnostic value of non‐invasive objective laryngeal assessments, such as dynamic CT, although this will clearly be currently limited by the difficulty of comparing to the gold‐standard laryngoscopy. Efforts should also be made to produce and refine validated outcome measures to better monitor therapeutic response.

Beyond the pandemic, lessons learned from workforce responses to clinical delivery, digital advances in tele‐medicine and further MDT integration patient management, present opportunities to establish and develop relationships between ILO experts across the globe. We look forward to greater collaboration to facilitate collection and amalgamation of larger data sets that will help us to further understand ILO and relative management strategies.

### Systematic review of the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions used to treat adults with inducible laryngeal obstruction [^25cb5242]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

This review identifies the evidence for non-pharmacological interventions used to treat adults with ILO. The literature eludes to several intervention components but due to the quality of research methodology no meaningful conclusions on efficacy of these is possible. However, signals in the synthesis performed supports the opinion that non-pharmacological interventions may be an effective ILO treatment and warrant further development and investigation, with robust processes applied, to evaluate effectiveness.

### A systematic review of proton-pump inhibitor therapy for laryngopharyngeal reflux [^67459880]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The author performed a MEDLINE literature search to identify and evaluate all randomized, placebo-controlled trials of the treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) with an oral proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) that have been published since 1966. Eight such trials that included a total of 358 patients were identified. These eight studies contained seven different definitions of LPR. Validity scores (maximum: 9) ranged from 5 to 9 (mean: 7.5). One study investigated low-dose once-daily therapy, two studies investigated low-dose twice-daily therapy, and five studies investigated high-dose twice-daily therapy. Outcomes measures were not consistent among studies, and most studies used unvalidated outcomes measures. Only two studies found that a PPI was significantly better than placebo-one in the low-dose twice-daily group and one in the high-dose twice-daily group. The author concludes that the current body of literature is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions about the efficacy of PPI therapy for the treatment of LPR.

### Systematic review of the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions used to treat adults with inducible laryngeal obstruction [^1d2e16a9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Cochrane methodology and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines were used to perform this systematic review. The review protocol was registered on the international Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database on 9 December 2020 (registration number:).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

A population, intervention, comparison, outcome framework was applied to identify studies of adults with ILO (population) who had received non-pharmacological treatment (intervention) with or without a control intervention (comparison) and where effectiveness of these interventions were considered (outcome). All types of studies, except expert opinion and reviews, were included; no publication date limitation was applied. Case reports and case series were excluded if no pre–post outcomes were available. Studies were limited to those in the English language.

For inclusion, ILO had to be objectively diagnosed, either by direct laryngeal imaging (ie, endoscopic and/or scanning confirmation) or via the validated diagnostic Pittsburgh questionnaire. Due to the recognised differences in paediatric and adult respiratory clinical care management, together with the variances in paediatric and adult larynges, publications reporting data from participants under 16 years of age were excluded. Further, if a study did not report any age demographic data it was excluded from review.

'Non pharmacological interventions' were classed as any interventions not classified as a pharmacological intervention under the EU Directive 2001/83/EEC (ie, the intervention contained no administration of a substance or combination of substances aiming to modify physiological function).

To ensure included studies had meaningful and non-trivial outcomes, only those reporting outcome measures explicit to ILO (eg, symptoms, direct visualisation, healthcare utilisation) were included.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^5e8bb28c]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the negative conclusions of a Cochrane meta-analysis, a recent review suggests that a therapeutic benefit for acid-suppressive therapy in patients with chronic cough cannot be dismissed, advocating a rigorous patient selection that could allow the identification of patient subgroups likely to be responsive. On the contrary, no systematic reviews and meta-analyses found any significant clinical benefit of PPI therapy over placebo in reflux laryngitis.

Asthma and GERD can often coexist, with reflux disease being reported in 40–80% of patients with asthma. While asthma medications can trigger GERD, PPIs might, on the contrary, improve asthma control. Here, again, an early Cochrane review showed no benefit of PPI therapy on nocturnal symptom score and lung function, but a recent meta-analysis – by selecting the morning peak expiratory flow rate as the primary outcome – disclosed a benefit of PPIs over placebo, which was greater in patients with proven GERD.

Despite the widespread use of PPIs in dental practice to manage the oral manifestations of GERD, treatment of dental erosions represents the only objectively documented clinical use.

In summary, while PPIs are the mainstay of medical treatment for esophageal manifestations of GERD, their benefit in extra-digestive GERD remains uncertain. The complexity of patient presentation is matched by the challenge in appropriate diagnosis of reflux as the cause for patients' symptoms, which may also be related to other co-morbidities. Upper GI endoscopy and pH monitoring suffer from poor sensitivity, while laryngoscopy suffers from poor specificity in diagnosing reflux in this group of patients. An empiric trial of PPIs could be the initial approach to diagnose and treat the potential underlying cause of these extra-esophageal symptoms. For those who improve with PPIs, GERD is presumed to be the etiology, but for those who do not respond, diagnostic testing with impedance and/or pH monitoring are reasonable to exclude continued acid or weakly acid reflux. In such cases, etiologies other than GERD may be pursued. Difficult patients are best investigated and treated in referral centers.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^c82b13da]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination elements for dysphonia: The purpose of this statement is to help clinicians identify the underlying cause of dysphonia, and careful history and physical examination provide important clues to the underlying etiology and can help direct management. The larynx is described as a physiologically complex organ at the intersection of the upper respiratory tract and esophageal inlet, exposed to a variety of pathogens and noxious irritants and at risk for iatrogenic injury, so potential etiologies are very broad and include traumatic, infectious, inflammatory, neurologic, metabolic, neoplastic, congenital, and behavioral factors. The history should include duration, type of onset, potential inciting events, how the condition is affecting the patient, associated symptoms, modifying factors, current medications, habits, concurrent medical conditions, and prior surgery; careful evaluation allows the clinician to categorize dysphonia severity, develop a treatment plan, and prioritize patients who may need escalated care.

### Pulsed dye laser treatment of primary cryptococcal laryngitis: a novel approach to an uncommon disease [^3d8b24af]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

An 82-year-old supplemental oxygen dependent woman with severe COPD presented with an eight month history of worsening hoarseness and stridor. Office laryngoscopy revealed laryngeal edema and ulcerative masses throughout the larynx. In-office biopsies were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. This report details a novel approach to the treatment of cryptococcal laryngitis, a combination of in-office pulsed-dye laser (PDL) ablation and medical therapy. Despite treatment with oral fluconazole, the recommended treatment for cryptococcal laryngitis the patient continued to be symptomatic with dysphonia and throat discomfort. Repeated laryngeal exam demonstrated persistent cryptococcal nodules. The patient was subsequently effectively treated with an in-office PDL laser. This case demonstrates the efficacy of in-office laser treatment for residual laryngeal Cryptococcus. For patients like this one, who have failed medical therapy and are unfit for general anesthetic, the in-office laser provides an excellent alternative treatment approach.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^8deb9c41]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials.

Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.

Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.

Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval −1.9 to −7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (−0.4 to −21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0–10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups.

Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat.

### Systemic steroids for otolaryngology-head and neck surgery disorders: an evidence-based primer for clinicians [^668d1170]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To offer pragmatic, evidence-informed guidance on the use of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) for common otolaryngologic disorders.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guidelines.

Review Methods

A comprehensive search of published literature through November 2021 was conducted on the efficacy of SCS, alone or in combination with other treatments, for managing disorders in otolaryngology and the subdisciplines. Clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials, when available, were preferentially retrieved. Interventions and outcomes of SCS use were compiled to generate summary tables and narrative synthesis of findings.

Conclusions

Evidence on the effectiveness of SCS varies widely across otolaryngology disorders. High-level evidence supports SCS use for Bell's palsy, sinonasal polyposis, and lower airway disease. Conversely, evidence is weak or absent for upper respiratory tract infection, eustachian tube dysfunction, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, or nonallergic rhinitis. Evidence is indeterminate for acute laryngitis, acute pharyngitis, acute sinusitis, angioedema, chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps, Ménière's disease, postviral olfactory loss, postoperative nerve paresis/paralysis, facial pain, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.

Implications For Practice

Clinicians should bring an evidence-informed lens to SCS prescribing to best counsel patients regarding the risks, anticipated benefits, and limited data on long-term effects. Alternate routes of corticosteroid administration-such as sprays, drops, inhalers, and intralesional injections-may be preferable for many disorders, particularly those that are self-limited or require a prolonged duration of therapy. Prudent use of SCS reduces the risk of medication-related adverse effects. Clinicians who are conversant with high-level evidence can achieve optimal outcomes and stewardship when prescribing SCS.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors to treat persistent throat symptoms: multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial [^a4620103]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study found that lansoprazole offers no benefit over placebo for patients with persistent throat symptoms. No trends were in favour of lansoprazole. Patients who received lansoprazole on average reported worse improvement in symptoms than those receiving placebo. Treating patients for reported persistent throat symptoms "empirically" with PPIs, in the absence of specialist investigations, is common practice by healthcare practitioners worldwide. This should now be discouraged through evidence based treatment guidelines. Recent guidelines on chronic cough, which previously advocated trials of PPIs for presumed reflux related symptoms, have incorporated high level evidence and placebo controlled trials of PPIs and now state that acid reduction treatments should not be routinely prescribed for this condition.

The practice of prescribing PPIs for these patients is based on several observational cases series showing improvement in symptoms over time with treatment. The inability of placebo controlled trials to replicate the benefits of PPIs in uncontrolled observational studies, however, suggests a misattribution of placebo enhanced spontaneous resolution in such single cohort reports. A systematic review of studies that used PPIs as empirical treatment for suspected reflux related throat symptoms identified 14 uncontrolled studies, one non-blind, non-randomised study with a control group of healthy volunteers, and six double blind, placebo controlled randomised trials from 1994 to 2004. A lack of common outcome measures, potential selection bias, or inadequate blinding of the results were among typical limitations. An updated meta-analysis to 2005 of eight randomised controlled trials concluded that PPI treatment "may offer a modest but non-significant clinical benefit" over placebo. A previous trial randomised 145 patients in a 2:1 ratio to esomeprazole twice daily or matched placebo twice daily. The participants completed a Likert scale assessment of five symptoms: throat clearing, cough, globus, sore throat, and hoarseness. The participants identified their single most bothersome symptom at baseline. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of participants who had resolution of their most troublesome symptom. No difference was found between the treatment groups for the primary outcome measure, nor in secondary outcomes of laryngeal appearances, pH monitoring, or disease specific quality of life (laryngopharyngeal health related quality of life). Although discussions about methodology could be raised, it is difficult to conclude why this study did not diminish the enthusiasm for PPI use in this patient population. In our multicentre trial, we used a validated symptom reporting outcome. It is imperative that high quality clinical trials with negative outcomes, such as our trial, are incorporated into evidence based guidelines to bring about practice change. Our trial provides evidence for the medical profession to question indiscriminate use of PPIs and change empirical practices.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline for the use of larynx-preservation strategies in the treatment of laryngeal cancer [^1c1a736a]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop a clinical practice guideline for treatment of laryngeal cancer with the intent of preserving the larynx (either the organ itself or its function). This guideline is intended for use by oncologists in the care of patients outside of clinical trials.

Methods

A multidisciplinary Expert Panel determined the clinical management questions to be addressed and reviewed the literature available through November 2005, with emphasis given to randomized controlled trials of site-specific disease. Survival, rate of larynx preservation, and toxicities were the principal outcomes assessed. The guideline underwent internal review and approval by the Panel, as well as external review by additional experts, members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Health Services Committee, and the ASCO Board of Directors.

Results

Evidence supports the use of larynx-preservation approaches for appropriately selected patients without a compromise in survival; however, no larynx-preservation approach offers a survival advantage compared with total laryngectomy and adjuvant therapy with rehabilitation as indicated.

Recommendations

All patients with T1 or T2 laryngeal cancer, with rare exception, should be treated initially with intent to preserve the larynx. For most patients with T3 or T4 disease without tumor invasion through cartilage into soft tissues, a larynx-preservation approach is an appropriate, standard treatment option, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy therapy is the most widely applicable approach. To ensure an optimum outcome, special expertise and a multidisciplinary team are necessary, and the team should fully discuss with the patient the advantages and disadvantages of larynx-preservation options compared with treatments that include total laryngectomy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) [^ef087ed7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA/ASTMH mucosal leishmaniasis — treatment recommendations for American (New World) ML: All persons with clinically manifest, metastatic disease should receive systemic antileishmanial therapy (strong, low). Before therapy, a complete examination of the naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal mucosa should be conducted by a specialist to assess anatomic extension and clinical severity (strong, moderate). We recommend inpatient monitoring and prophylactic corticosteroid therapy for persons with laryngeal/pharyngeal disease and increased risk for respiratory obstruction (strong, low). The choice of antileishmanial agent, dose, and duration should be individualized (strong, moderate). Regimens cited include SSG 20 mg SbV/kg daily, IV or IM, for 20–28 days; L‑AmB 3 mg/kg per dose IV daily or every other day for a cumulative total of approximately 20–45 mg/kg; lipid formulations of amphotericin B (typically L‑AmB) with cumulative totals approximately 20 to 60 mg/kg; and oral miltefosine approximately 2.5 mg/kg per day [maximum, 150 mg/day] for 28 days.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^fc9dde1b]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

Search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and for additional data from published trials.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^19d4c394]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The rationale for empirical PPI treatment

Due to the low cost and practical convenience of prescribing a PPI trial course against symptoms of suspected EE reflux, this may be chosen instead of initial pretreatment diagnostic investigations. Such strategy may be supported by several guidelines including the recent AGA publication that recommended a PPI trial of 12 weeks. However, initial testing was recommended to be tailored to the patients clinical presentation as well as in patients who fail a PPI trial and experts are divided.

Although reflux may cause EE symptoms, it is uncommon for reflux to be the dominant cause in patients not also experiencing typical esophageal symptoms and there is little evidence to support that PPI treatment is better than placebo in this patient group. There is some evidence from an RCTs that rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily was significantly better than placebo in patients selected based on symptoms, videostroboscopic evidence of LPR and RFS. A reduction in RFS and RSI was also reported in patients receiving esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily for three months. One study has found that symptoms of postnasal drainage improved after 8 to 16 weeks of lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily compared to placebo. However, several other studies have not found effects of pantoprazole or rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily. In a randomized clinical trial comparing esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily with placebo did not find any benefits in patients with chronic posterior laryngitis. Notably, this study purposely excluded patients with frequent heartburn. In a meta-analysis containing 480 patients from 10 RCTs there was a minor effect of PPI compared to placebo (RR 1.31, 95%CI 1.03–1.67) and interestingly the preplanned analysis of the effects of PPI treatment without dietary and lifestyle modifications did not reach statistical significance. In patients with chronic cough there are no high-quality studies that support that PPI therapy has a benefit. This further weakens the arguments of an initial PPI trial.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^be17570e]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To estimate the benefits and harms of using corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised control trials. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), trial registries up to May 2017, reference lists of eligible trials, related reviews. Study selection Randomised controlled trials of the addition of corticosteroids to standard clinical care for patients aged 5 or older in emergency department and primary care settings with clinical signs of acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, or the clinical syndrome of sore throat. Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status. Review methods Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach. Results 10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95% confidence interval -1.9 to -7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (-0.4 to -21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0–10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups. Conclusion Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42017067808.

### Medications and vocal function [^6b355928]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Medications can have innumerable direct and indirect effects on laryngeal hydration, vocal fold mucosal integrity, laryngeal muscle function, and laryngeal sensation. Effects, therefore, can be subtle and slowly progressive over time. This article delineates the general classes of medications that are known to cause alterations of vocal function, highlights medical history symptoms that may help raise suspicion for medication-related vocal changes, and presents recommendations for approaches to treatment of these issues.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^e8635d90]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic and clinical classifications of UCTS

Several aetiological theories have emerged over decades of scientific enquiry to account for UCTS and inform divergent diagnoses and treatment approaches employed for these complaints. These may be broadly divided into chronic inflammatory and functional symptom concepts, the prominent theories and diagnoses of which are summarised below.

Chronic inflammatory concepts

Occult irritation of the aerodigestive tract causing chronic inflammation of the larynx or laryngopharynx is promoted as a cause of non-specific UCTS. Potential contributors include refluxed gastroduodenal content, inhaled irritants, respiratory allergens and voice behaviours. However, inflammatory indicators from nasoendoscopyare non-specific to both symptoms and postulated inflammatory aetiology in most literature investigating this relationship, are often identified in asymptomatic individualsand are subject to variable interpretations, highlighting diagnostic complexities.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is theorised to result from the back flow of gastroduodenal contents into the laryngopharynx, leading to chronic inflammation. Central to its pathophysiology is the inflammatory reaction to these contents, with pepsin being a primary culprit. Although gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is more prevalent among those with chronic throat issues, attributing aerodigestive symptoms to LPR is contentious. Unlike GORD, reflux-associated throat symptoms are non-specific, often seen in upright individuals during the day, regardless of BMI, and typically without heartburn.

Diagnostic approach

Diagnosing LPR is complex. Nasoendoscopic findings reflect secondary mucosal inflammation and are open to interpretation. The gold standard for GORD diagnosis, intraluminal oesophageal pH-impedance (pH-II), has poor sensitivity and specificity for LPR, offering little therapeutic guidance. The search for a definitive diagnostic tool for LPR continues, making the current diagnosis largely clinical.

Treatment approach

Treatment often mirrors those used in treatment of GORD, emphasising lifestyle changes although their effectiveness has yet to be validated. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were once the go-to for LPR, but recent studies question their efficacy for reflux-induced laryngeal symptoms, possibly due to the role of pepsin. Liquid alginates consumed after meals may have modest benefits based on early research. Anti-reflux surgery appears to be more effective than acid suppression therapies, but its symptomatic relief does not always correlate with acid and impedance metrics, leading to varied interpretations in the literature and challenges in patient selection.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^ce38def1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Hoarseness (dysphonia) management — laryngoscopy timing and corticosteroid use is addressed as follows: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx, and the policy level for laryngoscopy at any time was an option whereby clinicians may perform diagnostic laryngoscopy at any time in a patient with dysphonia.

### Management of laryngopharyngeal reflux: an unmet medical need [^6ba5fe76]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2010). Low credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is defined by the association of laryngeal symptoms with laryngeal inflammation at laryngoscopy. However, these symptoms are difficult to characterize and the laryngoscopic signs lack specificity. Moreover, to date, the diagnosis of LPR can rely neither on esophageal investigations (endoscopy, pH/impedance monitoring) nor on response to high dose proton pump inhibitors because of a high placebo effect. Therefore, there is a need for the development of new tools which may help to better identify the subgroup of patients with laryngeal symptoms related to supra-esophageal reflux.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^794633c8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on treating patients who present with dysphonia, which is characterized by altered vocal quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication and/or quality of life. Dysphonia affects nearly one-third of the population at some point in its life. This guideline applies to all age groups evaluated in a setting where dysphonia would be identified or managed. It is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and treat patients with dysphonia. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the quality of care for patients with dysphonia, based on current best evidence. Expert consensus to fill evidence gaps, when used, is explicitly stated and supported with a detailed evidence profile for transparency. Specific objectives of the guideline are to reduce inappropriate variations in care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of advanced practice nursing, bronchoesophagology, consumer advocacy, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, laryngology, neurology, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, professional voice, pulmonology, and speech-language pathology. Action Statements The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should assess the patient with dysphonia by history and physical examination to identify factors where expedited laryngeal evaluation is indicated. These include, but are not limited to, recent surgical procedures involving the head, neck, or chest; recent endotracheal intubation; presence of concomitant neck mass; respiratory distress or stridor; history of tobacco abuse; and whether the patient is a professional voice user. (2) Clinicians should advocate voice therapy for patients with dysphonia from a cause amenable to voice therapy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should identify dysphonia in a patient with altered voice quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication or reduces quality of life (QOL). (2) Clinicians should assess the patient with dysphonia by history and physical examination for underlying causes of dysphonia and factors that modify management. (3) Clinicians should perform laryngoscopy, or refer to a clinician who can perform laryngoscopy, when dysphonia fails to resolve or improve within 4 weeks or irrespective of duration if a serious underlying cause is suspected. (4) Clinicians should perform diagnostic laryngoscopy, or refer to a clinician who can perform diagnostic laryngoscopy, before prescribing voice therapy and document/communicate the results to the speech-language pathologist (SLP). (5) Clinicians should advocate for surgery as a therapeutic option for patients with dysphonia with conditions amenable to surgical intervention, such as suspected malignancy, symptomatic benign vocal fold lesions that do not respond to conservative management, or glottic insufficiency. (6) Clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, botulinum toxin injections for the treatment of dysphonia caused by spasmodic dysphonia and other types of laryngeal dystonia. (7) Clinicians should inform patients with dysphonia about control/preventive measures. (8) Clinicians should document resolution, improvement or worsened symptoms of dysphonia, or change in QOL of patients with dysphonia after treatment or observation. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 1 action: (1) Clinicians should not routinely prescribe antibiotics to treat dysphonia. The guideline update group made recommendations against other actions: (1) Clinicians should not obtain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with a primary voice complaint prior to visualization of the larynx. (2) Clinicians should not prescribe antireflux medications to treat isolated dysphonia, based on symptoms alone attributed to suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), without visualization of the larynx. (3) Clinicians should not routinely prescribe corticosteroids for patients with dysphonia prior to visualization of the larynx. The policy level for the following recommendation about laryngoscopy at any time was an option: (1) Clinicians may perform diagnostic laryngoscopy at any time in a patient with dysphonia. Disclaimer This clinical practice guideline is not intended as an exhaustive source of guidance for managing dysphonia (hoarseness). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and it may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem. Differences from Prior Guideline (1) Incorporation of new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply (2) Inclusion of 3 new guidelines, 16 new systematic reviews, and 4 new randomized controlled trials (3) Inclusion of a consumer advocate on the guideline update group (4) Changes to 9 KASs from the original guideline (5) New KAS 3 (escalation of care) and KAS 13 (outcomes) (6) Addition of an algorithm outlining KASs for patients with dysphonia.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^4de74f63]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs and symptoms. The Centor clinical prediction rules can be used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether to prescribe an antibiotic.

Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen as the first choice treatment. The use of corticosteroids is mentioned in few, and is generally discouraged (table 1). Antibiotics are probably not helpful for pain relief in an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses, but may help those with a bacterial infection. Recommended management of sore throat varies widely, and table 1summarises current guidelines.

### Laryngopharyngeal reflux and atypical gastroesophageal reflux disease [^c521e43a]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux and atypical manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease have a high economic and social burden in the United States. There is increasing research supporting the reflex theory and hypersensitivity syndrome underlying this disease pathophysiology. Novel diagnostic biomarkers have gained more traction in the search for a more reliable diagnostic tool, but further research is needed. Current standard-of-care treatment relies on proton pump inhibitor therapy. Antireflux surgery is usually not recommended. Neuromodulators and treatments targeting specific neuronal receptors are discussed. A diagnostic algorithm is proposed for the evaluation of laryngeal symptoms suspected to be related to extraesophageal reflux disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^9827637c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Burden of dysphonia — prevalence and patterns — Analyses of a nationally representative US medical claims database in 2001 found a point prevalence of dysphonia of 0.98% (536,943 patients with dysphonia per 55,000,000 patients) in a treatment-seeking population, with higher rates among females (1.2% vs 0.7% for males) and among those > 70 years of age (2.5% vs 0.6%-1.8% for all other age groups). The point prevalence of dysphonia-related conditions is likely higher because many with voice changes are not treatment seeking, and a community survey reported a 29.9% cumulative lifetime risk of a voice disorder before 65 years of age. Common physician-assigned diagnoses included acute laryngitis, nonspecific dysphonia, benign vocal fold lesions (eg, cysts, polyps, nodules), and chronic laryngitis.
