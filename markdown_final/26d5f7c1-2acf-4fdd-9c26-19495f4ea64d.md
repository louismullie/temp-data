## Question

How is seborrheic dermatitis managed on other parts of the body?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how seborrheic dermatitis is managed on other parts of the body. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition, affected body sites, and phenotypes. Then, I should establish first-line topical antifungal therapy with concrete dosing. Next, I will add anti-inflammatory options for acute flares and steroid-sparing maintenance strategies for sensitive areas. After that, I should consider thresholds and regimens for oral therapy in refractory or widespread disease. I will also adapt for special sites and populations, review the evidentiary strength and limitations, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm including safety and maintenance considerations [^1122SeT6] [^112JxkED] [^114RxZaS] [^112LBPtK] [^113r99iM] [^113gN5in] [^114TVsby] [^113tgVei] [^117L7THS].

> Let me first confirm the condition characteristics and non-scalp distribution. Seborrheic dermatitis commonly involves sebaceous areas beyond the scalp, notably the face, chest, back, axillae, groin, and intertriginous zones, presenting as erythematous plaques with greasy yellow scale and sometimes hypopigmented patches in darker skin tones, which can complicate visual assessment of inflammation, so I need to ensure recognition of dyspigmentation as part of disease activity on the trunk and flexures [^1122SeT6] [^111Yh6TE] [^114NC3Ex]. Hold on, I should verify trial generalizability to body sites; the roflumilast phase 2a program included adults with scalp, facial, trunk, and intertriginous involvement and capped body surface area at 20%, which gives a pragmatic benchmark for topical trial evidence on non-scalp body disease burden [^114TVsby] [^112oiwZr] [^1118FcMC].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacotherapy. Topical antifungals remain the cornerstone because Malassezia drives disease activity; ketoconazole 2% cream applied twice daily for 4 weeks, or until clinical clearing, is an FDA-labeled regimen I can rely on for body sites, and I need to emphasize maintenance after induction to limit relapse given the chronic course [^114QW9oS] [^117L7THS]. Wait, let me verify the breadth of guidance; AAFP guidance recommends topical antifungals as first-line for face and scalp, and although it does not explicitly single out the trunk, that same antifungal-first principle is routinely extended to body sites in practice and is consistent with broader AAFP discussions of face and body involvement, so I can reasonably apply it to non-scalp areas while acknowledging the face/scalp wording in the specific recommendation [^112JxkED] [^111Yh6TE].

> I need to check additional topical options beyond azoles. Ciclopirox is a supported alternative in systematic reviews for seborrheic dermatitis, but hold on, I should verify formulation-specific evidence for body sites; the FDA label provided here is for 1% shampoo dosed twice weekly for four weeks, which is scalp-focused, so for truncal plaques I would preferentially use cream or gel ciclopirox preparations even though the body-specific dosing is not detailed in the provided labeling, and I will anchor the option to Cochrane evidence rather than overextending the shampoo data to the trunk [^113b5fDd] [^111PZYb6] [^116fKbQz]. I should double-check safety; ketoconazole topical has a benign safety profile, and although the shampoo data are scalp-centric, they support the general tolerability of topical ketoconazole formulations, which is relevant to long-term maintenance strategies on body sites too [^1119YZra].

> Let me now incorporate anti-inflammatory therapy for symptomatic flares. Short courses of low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids can rapidly control erythema, pruritus, and scale on body areas, but I need to ensure duration is limited to mitigate atrophy, striae, and telangiectasia risks on the trunk and intertriginous regions, so typically 1 to 2 weeks with taper is prudent, layered over antifungal therapy when inflamed [^114RxZaS] [^113pznTx]. Wait, I initially considered citing clobetasol shampoo alternating with ketoconazole from scalp data as a combination strategy for the body, but that evidence is scalp-specific and the vehicle is a shampoo, so I should not directly extrapolate high-potency shampoo regimens to non-scalp skin; instead, on the body I will choose low- to mid-potency creams or ointments to reduce adverse effects, while reserving superpotent steroids for very limited, thick truncal plaques if absolutely necessary and only for very brief intervals [^112e1W3R] [^113pznTx].

> I will now examine steroid-sparing options for sensitive areas and for maintenance. Topical calcineurin inhibitors such as pimecrolimus 1% or tacrolimus 0.1% can be used on the face, intertriginous folds, and other thin skin to avoid corticosteroid complications, and I should confirm that contemporary AAFP guidance explicitly supports offering calcineurin inhibitors for face or body involvement in patients unresponsive to other treatments or to prevent the consequences of long-term steroid use, which aligns with the safety-first approach on body flexures and the face [^112LBPtK]. But wait, topical calcineurin inhibitors are not FDA-approved for seborrheic dermatitis and carry labeled warnings, so I should counsel regarding transient burning and the boxed warning context, while noting emerging dermatology data do not show increased malignancy versus population background, which helps frame risk-benefit in chronic, relapsing disease on cosmetically sensitive sites [^113pznTx] [^111bGUaa].

> Let me consider nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory foam as another option with body-site data. Roflumilast 0.3% foam applied once daily for 8 weeks achieved higher IGA success versus vehicle in adults with seborrheic dermatitis involving scalp, face, and trunk, with BSA up to 20%; this provides high-quality evidence for a steroid-sparing topical that can be used on both hair-bearing and glabrous body areas, and I should also confirm the FDA-approved labeling for seborrheic dermatitis across these regions to support practical use on the trunk and intertriginous areas [^114TVsby] [^112oiwZr] [^113h1XKZ]. I need to ensure correct positioning; I would use roflumilast either as monotherapy for mild-to-moderate inflammatory body disease or as an add-on to antifungals, especially where steroid exposure is undesirable, and maintain with the least frequent effective schedule once disease is controlled [^114TVsby] [^113h1XKZ].

> For refractory or widespread body disease, I should verify when to escalate to oral therapy. A practical threshold is involvement exceeding about 20% BSA or failure of optimized topical regimens; itraconazole 200 mg daily for 7 days followed by maintenance 200 mg daily for 2 days each month is an FDA-referenced regimen used in refractory seborrheic dermatitis, though I must screen for drug-drug interactions, hepatic risk, and contraindications such as heart failure before prescribing, and I should be transparent that the 20% BSA benchmark is inferred from topical trial inclusion criteria rather than a formal guideline cutoff [^113r99iM] [^114TVsby]. Hold on, I should verify that this escalation matches disease biology; since antifungal load reduction often improves SD, an oral azole can be reasonable for severe truncal and intertriginous disease when topical therapy is impractical or insufficient, with careful monitoring and step-down to topical maintenance afterward [^113r99iM].

> Next, I should adapt for special sites and comorbid conditions. For genital or intertriginous SD presentations such as balanitis, combining a topical antifungal with a mild-to-moderate potency corticosteroid short term is recommended by European STI guidance; in resistant cases, oral azoles are alternatives, with tetracyclines or terbinafine considered where yeast-dominant or inflammatory overlap is suspected, recognizing this is site-specific guidance and requires individualized assessment of infection versus dermatitis [^113gN5in] [^116iVihC]. If lid margin disease coexists as seborrheic blepharitis and does not respond to first-line measures, short courses of topical antibiotics at the lid margin can be considered as an ophthalmology-guided adjunct, although that veers outside routine truncal SD management and should be reserved for refractory blepharitis phenotypes [^112svqLA].

> I should confirm nuances for skin of color and sensitive body areas. In darker skin, SD may present with hypopigmented macules or petaloid patches and can leave dyspigmentation; thus I need to minimize corticosteroid potency and duration on the face, neck, axillae, and groin, favoring antifungals, calcineurin inhibitors, or roflumilast for both efficacy and pigment preservation, while counseling that erythema may be subtle and activity may be tracked by scale, itch, and texture changes on the trunk [^114NC3Ex] [^113pznTx]. Let me reconsider maintenance; gentle cleansers and emollients appropriate for flexures plus once- or twice-weekly antifungal application can reduce relapses, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory topicals can be pulsed for early flares to limit cumulative steroid exposure on body sites [^111Yh6TE] [^117L7THS].

> Now, I should review evidence quality to avoid overstatements. Cochrane reviews consistently support topical antifungals as beneficial for SD, with ketoconazole and ciclopirox showing efficacy versus placebo, although heterogeneity is common and the certainty is often low to moderate; importantly, anti-inflammatory topicals including steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are effective for short-term symptom control, without clear long-term superiority among classes, underscoring the need for individualized, maintenance-based regimens on the body [^116MWaDK] [^113b5fDd] [^117QbHQm] [^111qunoM]. I should double-check adjuncts; keratolytics such as selenium sulfide and zinc pyrithione can help with thick scaling even though most data derive from scalp studies, so for truncal plaques they may serve as short-contact adjuncts, recognizing the evidence base is weaker for non-scalp body sites [^117L7THS] [^1142nQ8V] [^112cxYsr].

> Bringing this together into a pragmatic, body-focused algorithm, I would start mild-to-moderate non-scalp SD with a topical antifungal such as ketoconazole 2% cream twice daily for four weeks, then step to once- or twice-weekly maintenance to prevent relapse; if inflammation is prominent, I would add a low- to mid-potency corticosteroid once daily for up to two weeks and taper off while continuing antifungal maintenance, and if steroid exposure is undesirable or disease is on sensitive body areas, I would use pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, or roflumilast foam as steroid-sparing therapy and maintain with intermittent application; with inadequate response after optimized topical combination therapy or with BSA above roughly 20%, I would consider a short oral itraconazole course followed by topical maintenance, reassessing triggers and adherence throughout [^114QW9oS] [^114RxZaS] [^112LBPtK] [^114TVsby] [^113r99iM] [^117L7THS].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety monitoring and patient counseling. I should confirm that patients use steroids for brief bursts on the body to avoid atrophy and striae, discuss expected transient warmth or burning with calcineurin inhibitors, review roflumilast foam's favorable tolerability profile, and screen for hepatic disease and drug interactions before itraconazole; I should also emphasize that SD is chronic and relapsing, so maintenance therapy and early flare intervention on body sites are key to sustained control and quality of life [^113pznTx] [^113h1XKZ] [^113r99iM] [^113tgVei] [^111Yh6TE].

Treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in non-scalp areas centers on **topical antifungals** (ketoconazole, ciclopirox, selenium sulfide) applied once or twice daily until clearance [^114QW9oS], then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance. For inflammation, use **low-potency corticosteroids** (hydrocortisone 1%, desonide 0.05%) [^114RxZaS] for 1–2 weeks, then taper to avoid atrophy. Calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus 1%, tacrolimus 0.03–0.1%) are **steroid-sparing options** [^115R8Rrf] for sensitive or intertriginous skin [^112LBPtK].

Keratolytics (salicylic acid, sulfur) help reduce **scale** [^117L7THS], and emollients support **barrier repair**. For refractory or extensive disease, consider short courses of oral itraconazole [^113r99iM] or fluconazole, or topical roflumilast 0.3% foam [^114TVsby] [^113h1XKZ]. Maintenance with antifungals and gentle skincare is essential to prevent relapse [^114v34fV].

---

## Topical antifungal agents

Topical antifungals are **first-line therapy** for non-scalp seborrheic dermatitis because they reduce Malassezia colonization and inflammation [^116ZBqMh].

- **Ketoconazole 2% cream or foam**: Apply once or twice daily until clearance, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance [^114QW9oS].

- **Ciclopirox 1% cream or shampoo**: Apply once or twice daily until clearance, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance.

- **Selenium sulfide 2.5% lotion or foam**: Apply once daily for 7–14 days, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance.

---

## Topical corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids reduce **inflammation and pruritus** [^114RxZaS]. Use **low-potency agents** to minimize adverse effects, with **hydrocortisone 1% cream** applied once or twice daily for 1–2 weeks, then taper to maintenance antifungal therapy, and **desonide 0.05% cream** applied once or twice daily for 1–2 weeks before tapering to maintenance antifungal therapy.

---

## Topical calcineurin inhibitors

Calcineurin inhibitors are **steroid-sparing options**, especially for sensitive or intertriginous areas [^111bGUaa]. Use **pimecrolimus 1% cream** twice daily until clearance, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance, or **tacrolimus 0.03–0.1% ointment** on the same schedule.

---

## Keratolytic agents

Keratolytics help reduce **scaling** and improve penetration of other topical therapies [^116ZBqMh]. Use **salicylic acid 2–5% creams or lotions** or **sulfur-containing creams**, applied once daily to reduce scaling [^117L7THS].

---

## Emollients and barrier repair

Regular use of **emollients** supports barrier repair and reduces irritation. Non-fragranced moisturizers should be applied **daily** to maintain **skin hydration and barrier function**.

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapy is reserved for **severe, refractory, or extensive disease** [^115yodbj]. Use **itraconazole** 200 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily for 2 days monthly as maintenance [^113r99iM], or **fluconazole** 150–300 mg weekly for 2–4 weeks, then monthly as maintenance.

---

## Novel therapies

Recent advances include **topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors**. Roflumilast 0.3% foam applied **once daily for 8 weeks** is effective for **trunk and intertriginous areas** [^1118FcMC] [^114TVsby].

---

## Maintenance and prevention strategies

Long-term control requires ongoing **maintenance therapy and lifestyle modifications**.

- **Maintenance antifungal therapy**: Apply once or twice weekly to prevent relapse.

- **Gentle skin care**: Use mild cleansers and avoid irritants.

- **Stress management**: Reduce stress to minimize flares [^113tgVei].

---

## Special considerations

- **Intertriginous areas**: Use low-potency corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors to avoid atrophy [^112LBPtK].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Consider systemic antifungals for severe disease.

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Prefer topical antifungals; avoid systemic therapy unless necessary.

---

Treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in non-scalp areas involves topical antifungals, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytics, and emollients, with systemic therapy for severe cases. Maintenance therapy and lifestyle modifications are essential for **long-term control**.

The results of 14 clinical studies are highlighted, focusing on two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials (STRATUM [NCT04973228] and Trial 203 [NCT04091646]). These trials enrolled a total of 683 adult and pediatric subjects with seborrheic dermatitis affecting the scalp, face, and/or body, all presenting an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of moderate or severe (IGA of 3 or 4 on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4). Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ZORYVE foam, 0.3%, or vehicle foam, applied once daily over 8 weeks.

The combined demographic of trial participants included 79% White, 11% Black, and 5% Asian individuals, with 79% identifying as non-Hispanic/Latino and 21% identifying as Hispanic/Latino. The gender distribution was equal, with 50% male and 50% female participants.

In the STRATUM trial, the age range of participants was from 9 to 87 years, with 7% being 9 to 17 years old and 12% being 65 years or older. Among them, 94% had a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate), and 6% had an IGA score of 4 (severe). Additionally, 67% had a baseline Worst Itch-Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) score of 4 or higher on a 0 to 10 scale.

In Trial 203, ages ranged from 18 to 85 years, with 18% being 65 years or older. At baseline, 93% had an IGA score of 3 (moderate) and 7% an IGA score of 4 (severe), while 81% recorded a WI-NRS score of 4 or higher.

### Seborrheic dermatitis: Diagnosis and treatment [^111Yh6TE]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, chronic relapsing skin condition that predominantly affects areas of the body rich in sebaceous glands. Clinically, it presents as symmetric, poorly defined erythematous patches with yellow, oily scales and fine, superficial desquamation (flaking). In individuals with darker skin, erythema may be less apparent, and postinflammatory pigmentary changes might present with hypopigmented, slightly scaly areas.

- **Scalp treatment**: Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp can be effectively treated with topical over-the-counter antifungal shampoos and prescription-strength antifungal or corticosteroid solutions, foams, or oils. Thick, scaly areas can be treated with keratolytic shampoos and lotions.

- **Face and body treatment**: Seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body can be treated with over-the-counter and prescription-strength antifungal creams, corticosteroid creams, and ointments. Calcineurin inhibitor cream or ointment can also be used.

- **Neonatal seborrheic dermatitis**: Neonatal seborrheic dermatitis is common and typically self-resolves by 6 months of age. Mild cases of the scalp (cradle cap) may be treated conservatively with mineral oil to loosen scales and gentle combing. More severe cases may overlap with atopic dermatitis and can be treated with topical antifungals or topical corticosteroids.

### Exosome therapy for chronic severe seborrheic dermatitis: A case report [^116EwUex]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A male patient, aged 34 years, presented with chronic, severe seborrheic dermatitis (SD) that had been left untreated for 6 months prior to the hospital visit. He had previously received various treatments, such as topical steroids (hydrocortisone 1%), antifungal creams (ketoconazole 2%), and antifungal shampoos. The treatment only showed partial response and recurrence. His SD was debilitating both socially and emotionally, with frequent dry dandruff on his shoulders and clothing, which significantly affected his quality of life.

To alleviate SD symptoms, a total of 4 sessions each for the face and scalp of ASCE exosome therapy were conducted, each with an interval of 2 weeks. The exosome was administered using a Derma pen with a depth of 2 mm, and a total of 5 mL of ASCE was administered per session. The depth of injection was intradermal, and the same volume was maintained throughout the treatment course. During treatment, the patient experienced an SD flare-up after the second session, affecting both the face and scalp, for which a brief course of mild topical steroids (hydrocortisone 1%) used for 5 days was introduced as adjunctive treatment. ASCE plus balm was also applied topically to the face to aid in skin healing.

The treatment efficacy was assessed using the Physician's Global Assessment and Investigator's Global Assessment scales, both employing a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) to rate disease severity, with higher scores indicating more severe conditions. Scaling was evaluated on a 4-point scale from 0 (none: no visible scaling on lesions) to 3 (severe).

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis [^114bnfkW]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects at least 1–3% of the population. Malassezia (Pityrosporum) ovale is thought to be the causative organism, causing inflammation involving T cells and complement. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and body in adults? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, emollients, ketoconazole, lithium succinate, selenium sulphide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical steroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furoate).

### Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp: Etiology and treatment [^115XB8Fi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common chronic infection of the lipid-rich areas of skin. Although seborrheic dermatitis has been recognized as a clinical entity for decades, its etiology remains unclear. Early investigations into the development of seborrheic dermatitis focused on the role of Malassezia (previously Pityrosporum) yeasts. These yeasts are normal skin commensals, leading to doubt about their significance as pathogens in this disorder. However, it was later discovered that treating seborrheic dermatitis with an antifungal agent not only resulted in clinical improvement but also reduced the number of Malassezia yeasts on the skin. This finding has renewed interest in the role of Malassezia yeasts. It has been hypothesized that an immunological component may be involved, possibly representing an abnormal host response to Malassezia yeasts. This paper discusses the role of Malassezia in the etiology of seborrheic dermatitis, along with various treatment options.

### Selenium sulfide [^1142nQ8V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

For the treatment of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, usually two applications each week for two weeks will afford control. After this, the lotion may be used at less frequent intervals, such as weekly, every two weeks, or every three or four weeks in some cases. It should not be applied more frequently than required to maintain control.

### Intradermal botulinum toxin A injection for scalp sebum secretion regulation: A multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in Chinese subjects [^117PBJKq]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). High credibility.

Previous studies revealed that the scalp regreasing process post-shampooing follows hyperbolic-like kinetics over days, with the highest amount of sebum observed 2 to 3 days after shampooing. Lower sebum amounts were present in older age groups across all ethnicities compared to younger individuals, and male subjects were identified as higher sebum producers than females, irrespective of ethnicity. Factors such as diet, occupation, smoking, climate, ultraviolet radiation, pollutants, personal hygiene, and circadian rhythms contribute to this process. Excessive scalp sebum secretion facilitates the regreasing process, leading to greasy scalp and hair. Coated with sebum, greasy hair progressively sticks together, trapping external dirt and particles. Undesirable sebum blocks pores and fuels bacteria and yeasts, resulting in itchiness, dandruff, folliculitis, and acne in susceptible individuals.

Clear scalp and volumized hair help create a youthful, decent, and healthy image. Unlike facial oiliness, which can be modified with cosmetics, greasy scalp and hair are difficult to conceal. Frequent washing may alleviate scalp and hair oiliness but can also lead to sensitive or irritable skin. In contrast to oily facial skin, few therapeutic options are available for greasy scalp and hair. The efficacy of energy devices for treating scalp sebum excretion remains controversial, and the use of lasers on hairy scalps appears challenging and restricted. Although systemic treatments such as antifungals, isotretinoin, spironolactone, and herbal medications have been explored, further research is necessary to establish their effectiveness.

### Diagnosis and treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^1122SeT6]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition affecting infants, adolescents, and adults. The characteristic symptoms — scaling, erythema, and itching — occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is clinically diagnosed based on the location and appearance of the lesions. The skin changes are thought to result from an inflammatory response to a common skin organism, Malassezia yeast.

Treatment with antifungal agents, such as topical ketoconazole, is the mainstay of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body. Due to possible adverse effects, anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors should be used only for short durations. Several over-the-counter shampoos are available for treating seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, and patients should be directed to initiate therapy with one of these agents. Antifungal shampoos (for long-term use) and topical corticosteroids (for short-term use) can be employed as second-line agents for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117QTNEB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

All studies within the comparison of ketoconazole versus steroids used 2% ketoconazole applied in different regimens. Analyzing the complete remission of seborrhoeic dermatitis rash resulted in low heterogeneity between all studies (I² = 11%), and no difference in effect size was noted between subgroups. Single studies in the highest and lowest dose subgroups could not facilitate subgroup analysis for studies that assessed rash clearance in the long-term assessment.

The two studies that carried out a long-term comparative assessment of ketoconazole and steroid effect on erythema (as a discrete outcome) fell into the same dosage category (2% to 7%/wk).

- **Erythema and pruritus scores**: No heterogeneity was observed among studies reporting these scores. Although heterogeneity was substantial among studies that assessed the short-term scaling score, subgroups showed no significant differences. Meaningful subgroup analysis could not be done for long-term assessment of scaling.

- **Side effects**: The main analyses (not subgroup) showed no heterogeneity between studies assessing side effects.

- **Analysis by mode of delivery**: Topical preparations were delivered in the following forms: shampoos, gels, demulcents (cream, ointment, lotion, or liniment), foam, and alcohol solution. Only one study explored differences between modes of delivery, namely foam and gel. Very limited data suggest that differences in drug kinetics evident between gels, creams, ointments, and liniments could cause heterogeneity in study outcomes.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^111qunoM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

- **Data synthesis**: We pooled risk ratios for studies with dichotomous outcomes and mean differences or, when appropriate, standardized mean differences for studies with continuous outcomes using their weighted average for treatment effect as implemented in the RevMan software (RevMan). When heterogeneity was greater than 50%, we used a random-effects model. When heterogeneity was severe, indicated by an I² statistic greater than 80%, we did not perform a meta-analysis but reported individual study results separately.

- **Grade**: We used the program GRADEPro to assess the quality of evidence across studies and to generate 'Summary of findings' tables for the most important comparisons that included a relevant number of studies. We started at a high level of quality because we included only randomized studies. We then used limitations in study design, consistency of results, directness, precision, and publication bias to determine whether this should be downgraded by one or more levels. We reported our reasons for doing so as footnotes in the 'Summary of findings' table and in Table 1. We considered the study design to have limitations when most of the studies in a comparison had an unclear or high risk of bias for randomization, unclear allocation concealment, or blinding of outcome assessment.

- **Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity**: We planned to perform a subgroup analysis among HIV-positive participants with seborrhoeic dermatitis, but only one study included patients with HIV. We conducted subgroup analyses based on conflicts of interest, dose, and mode of delivery.

### Facial seborrheic dermatitis: A report on current status and therapeutic horizons [^1146Q6Ry]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis, characterized by erythema and/or flaking or scaling in areas of high sebaceous activity, affects up to 5% of the U.S. population and often appears in conjunction with other common skin disorders such as rosacea and acne. Despite ongoing research, its etiology is puzzling. Increased sebaceous and hormonal (androgenic) activity is thought to play a part. Recent evidence suggests an important role for individual susceptibility to irritant metabolites of the skin commensal Malassezia, most probably M. globosa.

Approaches thus include agents with antifungal, antikeratinizing, and anti-inflammatory activity. Azelaic acid, which has all three properties, may be a useful addition to first-line management. This management now comprises topical steroids, the immunosuppressant agents tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, azoles and other antifungals, and keratolytic agents. A recent exploratory study supports the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid 15% gel in seborrheic dermatitis. Azelaic acid may be especially valuable in this application because of its efficacy in treating concomitant rosacea and acne.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, relapsing, inflammatory skin condition of unclear etiology. The Malassezia yeast genus is believed to play a role. Seborrheic dermatitis commonly affects areas of the skin with high sebum production, including the scalp, nasolabial folds, glabella, eyebrows, beard, ears, retroauricular skin, sternum, and other skin folds.

Seborrheic dermatitis may present differently in individuals with skin of color. Darker-skinned individuals may present with scaly, hypopigmented macules and patches in typical areas of involvement. Arcuate or petal-like patches may be seen, specifically termed petaloid seborrheic dermatitis. Children of color often do not experience the classic "cradle cap" appearance of seborrheic dermatitis and have erythema, flaking, and hypopigmentation of the affected areas and folds of skin.

Seborrheic dermatitis tends to respond well to conventional treatments, although it tends to recur. Skin of color patients may require a modified treatment approach that considers differences in hair texture and hair washing frequency. This paper aims to highlight these differences to help reduce disparities in the management of seborrheic dermatitis in patients of color.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113Mja9S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

In total, the studies included 9,052 participants. Of these, 4,164 were included in the main intervention group — participants receiving the treatment primarily being tested by the investigators — and 3,701 in the largest control group. Multi-arm studies included 1,985 participants in a second control group and an additional 202 participants in a third control group, altogether encompassing 4,888 control participants.

We grouped the diagnoses of trial participants as follows:

- **Seborrhoeic dermatitis or dandruff of the scalp**.
- **Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp and face**.
- **Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face**.

It was not always clear within studies to what extent the disease also affected the trunk of a participant's body. Few studies stated this clearly — Green, Ortonne, Pari, Pierard, Stratigos, Swinyer — and we assumed that when the face was involved, the trunk might also be affected. Therefore, we did not make further distinctions between seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp exclusively and seborrhoeic dermatitis of these parts with truncal involvement.

One study specifically recruited patients with HIV with seborrhoeic dermatitis as participants. These investigators recruited most participants from outpatient departments of hospitals.

Eight studies were conducted in the United States; six each in Germany and France; five in the UK; four in Turkey; three each in Greece and Belgium; two each in India, Iran, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Sweden; and one study each in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, Italy, Japan, and Korea.

### Individual article: Etiology, treatment challenges, and the role of scalp and haircare in managing dandruff [^117K79r2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are associated with a disrupted scalp barrier that contributes to irritation, pruritus, and flaking of the scalp. The flaking and itch associated with dandruff can significantly impact an individual's self-esteem and quality of life. While the exact pathogenesis of dandruff is still not completely understood, scalp barrier health and its microbiome are thought to play significant roles in disease propagation.

Five expert dermatologists with extensive experience in hair, dandruff, and seborrheic dermatitis were selected to participate in discussions that resulted in five consensus statements focused on scalp barrier health and dandruff. Results of a systematic literature search and expert panel discussion are presented. These consensus statements aim to reflect expert opinions on the understanding of scalp health in the context of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.

The panel addressed challenges to promote scalp health, improve patient comfort, and prevent flares during dandruff management and maintenance. The presented consensus statements urge reframing our understanding of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis treatment by refocusing attention on global scalp and hair health.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^114v34fV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face, and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents, and phototherapy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data, and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

- **Main results**: We included 51 studies with 9052 participants.

### Role of antifungal agents in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^115yodbj]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a superficial fungal disease of the skin, occurring in areas rich in sebaceous glands. An association exists between Malassezia yeasts and seborrheic dermatitis, potentially due to an abnormal or inflammatory immune response to these yeasts. Azoles represent the largest class of antifungals used in the treatment of this disease at the time of writing. In addition to their antifungal properties, some azoles, including bifonazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole, have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity, which may be beneficial in alleviating symptoms. Other topical antifungal agents, such as allylamines (terbinafine), benzylamines (butenafine), hydroxypyridones (ciclopirox), and immunomodulators (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus), have also been effective.

Recent studies have revealed that tea tree oil (Melaleuca oil), honey, and cinnamic acid have antifungal activity against Malassezia species, which may benefit the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. When seborrheic dermatitis is widespread, the use of oral therapy, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine, may be preferred. Essentially, antifungal therapy reduces the number of yeasts on the skin, leading to an improvement in seborrheic dermatitis. With a wide availability of preparations, including creams, shampoos, and oral formulations, antifungal agents are safe and effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp [^115R8Rrf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting primarily the skin of the scalp, face, chest, and intertriginous areas, causing scaling and redness of the skin. Treatment options include antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and keratolytic agents, as well as phototherapy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical pharmacological interventions with established anti-inflammatory action for seborrhoeic dermatitis occurring in adolescents and adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to September 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database. We searched five trials databases and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs in adults or adolescents (> 16 years) with diagnosed seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp or face, comparing topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and lithium salts) with other treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses if feasible.

- **Main results**: We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and natural products.

### Red face revisited: Endogenous dermatitis in the form of atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis [^114RUsCq]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis are multifactorial dermatitides collectively known as endogenous dermatitis. Both conditions can affect the face, but they possess distinct clinical, epidemiological, and physiopathological characteristics. These two diseases are common worldwide. Atopic dermatitis is associated with xerosis and increased susceptibility to irritants and proteins. Patients with this condition often develop asthma, allergic rhinitis, and systemic manifestations mediated by immunoglobulin E. In contrast, seborrheic dermatitis is a moderate chronic dermatitis, typically restricted to regions with high sebum production and areas with cutaneous folds. While numerous studies have focused on the pathophysiology, immunology, and genetics of atopic dermatitis, there is limited knowledge about the genetic and immunological markers of seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical ruxolitinib in the treatment of refractory facial seborrheic dermatitis [^113tgVei]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that affects sebum-rich areas of the body. It is one of the most common skin diseases, with a prevalence of 14.3% in the middle-aged and elderly population. SD follows a relapsing and remitting course, worsening with stress and during the winter months. Importantly, SD has been reported to have a negative effect on quality of life. The underlying mechanism of SD is poorly understood; a combination of Malassezia species colonization, immune system activation, and genetic predisposition, among various other endogenous and exogenous factors, likely contribute to its pathogenesis.

The clinical presentation ranges from simple dandruff to a fulminant rash. The diagnosis is made clinically by the presence of greasy yellow scales overlying well-demarcated erythematous patches or plaques affecting the face, scalp, and upper portion of the chest in a symmetric distribution; the hairline, eyebrows, glabella, and nasolabial folds are particularly involved. Facial SD is frequently associated with rosacea. The goal of therapy is to clear visible signs of disease and reduce associated symptoms and must be maintained long-term to prevent recurrence. Since the underlying mechanism involves, at least in part, Malassezia proliferation and inflammation, common treatments include antifungal and anti-inflammatory therapy. First-line therapy includes topical antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole 2% cream) in combination with a mild topical corticosteroid (e.g. hydrocortisone 2.5% or desonide 0.05% creams) or topical calcineurin inhibitors.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^114TVsby]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis are currently limited in terms of efficacy and safety. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in adult patients with seborrheic dermatitis affecting the scalp, face, and/or trunk.

This multicenter, phase 2a, parallel-group, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial was conducted at 24 sites in the US and Canada between November 12, 2019, and August 21, 2020. Participants included adult patients aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis lasting for 3 months or more and an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 3, indicating moderate severity. The condition affected 20% or less of the body surface area, including the scalp, face, trunk, and/or intertriginous areas. Data analysis was performed from September to October 2020.

The interventions involved once-daily application of roflumilast foam, 0.3% (n = 154), or a vehicle foam (n = 72) for 8 weeks.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcome was IGA success, defined as achieving an IGA score of clear or almost clear, plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline, at week 8. Secondary outcomes included IGA success at weeks 2 and 4; achievement of an erythema score of 0 or 1 with a 2-grade improvement from baseline at weeks 2, 4, and 8; achievement of a scaling score of 0 or 1 with a 2-grade improvement from baseline at weeks 2, 4, and 8; change in the Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) score from baseline; and WI-NRS success, defined as achieving a 4-point or greater improvement in WI-NRS score in patients with a baseline WI-NRS score of 4.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117KTgcX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Given the extensive search and absence of language restrictions, we are confident that we located most of the studies on topical antifungal treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, we found sufficient evidence to draw conclusions only for ketoconazole-, ciclopirox-, and bifonazole-based treatments. For several classes of antifungals, no studies at all were conducted. Studies with long-term follow-up were particularly sparse. Various studies were carried out over a wide time span, with the oldest study dating as far back as 1985.

Many studies did not report our primary outcomes; when this occurred, we included studies that reported only our secondary outcomes. When studies were so poorly reported that we could not use the data in meta-analyses, we reported study findings in the text of this review. Studies used a wide range of doses and application modes of topical antifungal agents. We included studies on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp, and on dandruff, which is considered a mild form of seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we are confident that we have included all available evidence.

In most studies, participants were of widely ranging age groups and of both sexes. Results from most studies were given for all participants without stratification on the basis of sex, age, and so forth. Thus, we could not explore the role of these personal characteristics in treatment outcomes. Most studies used pregnancy as an exclusion criterion; therefore, it is unclear whether antifungals are efficacious in pregnancy.

### Role of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis: A review of pathophysiology, safety, and efficacy [^111bGUaa]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is characterized by erythematous pruritic patches and plaques with greasy scale that occur in sebaceous areas. It is common, affecting up to 3% of the population. Past treatments have relied on a wide variety of anti-inflammatory and antifungal agents, but corticosteroids have limited use because of long-term adverse effects.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors provide a safe alternative for the treatment of SD, as these drugs block the inflammatory cascade involved in the disease process and pose no risk of skin atrophy. Studies of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD have found that improvement occurred within two weeks, and if SD recurred after stopping treatment, it was significantly less severe.

There have been no studies of the comparative efficacy of pimecrolimus versus tacrolimus for the treatment of SD. Common adverse effects, such as mild burning and irritation, have been associated with the use of both of these agents. Safety profile studies are limited to studies of atopic dermatitis, which show no increase in infection rate, photocarcinogenicity, or signs of immunosuppression in patients using topical calcineurin inhibitors for long-term treatment.

This article reviews the clinical trials of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD, focusing on efficacy and safety.

### Non-steroidal topical therapy for facial seborrheic dermatitis [^112rpeew]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory skin disorder that occurs in areas rich in sebaceous glands. It manifests clinically as erythematous macules or plaques with varying levels of scaling and associated pruritus. Although the pathogenesis of SD has yet to be fully understood, Malassezia yeasts, hormones, sebum levels, and immune response are known to play important roles. Additional factors, including drugs, winter temperatures, and stress, may exacerbate SD. Available treatments include antifungal agents, topical low-potency steroids, and calcineurin inhibitors.

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a topical non-steroidal cream in treating facial seborrheic dermatitis (FSD). A case series of 11 patients with mild or moderate FSD and a history of several previous treatments without improvement was performed. The patients were treated for 8 weeks with a topical non-steroidal facial cream (NSFC) containing zinc PCA, piroctone olamine, hydroxyphenyl propamidobenzoic acid, biosaccharide gum-2, and stearyl glycyrrhetinate. Signs, symptoms, and tolerance were assessed before, during, and at the end of the treatment. All patients had improved symptoms of FSD, including desquamation, pruritus, erythema, and stinging sensation. An excellent response was observed in 81.8% of patients, while 18.1% showed a good response. None of the patients experienced adverse effects.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117L7THS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis aims to achieve the following: achieve remission of rashes, eliminate itching and burning sensations, reduce the severity of rashes, and prevent recurrence of rashes.

A variety of drug and non-drug treatments have been tried for seborrhoeic dermatitis. Antifungal and anti-inflammatory drugs are probably the most widely applied. Various preparations are available for topical and oral application. Behavioral modifications such as frequent skin cleansing with soap, a resolute commitment to personal hygiene, and frequent outdoor recreation, especially in summer, have been found to lessen the symptoms. Other therapeutic modalities include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, and coal tar, which are applied topically and function to soften and remove the thick hardened crusts that sometimes occur in seborrhoeic dermatitis. Recalcitrant cases of this skin problem have been managed with phototherapy (i.e. ultraviolet B phototherapy), as well as with isotretinoin therapy, which reduces sebaceous gland size and consequently sebum secretion.

In this review, we have focused on the more widespread topical application of antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, and ciclopirox, which are available as ointments, creams, gels, and shampoos.

- **How the intervention might work**: Based on the concept that Malassezia yeasts are involved in the pathogenesis of seborrhoeic dermatitis, antifungals have long been proposed as a treatment that confers the same benefits.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^114t6Chj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

- **Miconazole versus steroids**: One trial (Faergermann) compared 2% miconazole solution versus 1% hydrocortisone solution and reported similar outcomes for both drugs (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.61). On long-term follow-up, miconazole induced complete resolution better than the steroid did (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15). No secondary outcomes were reported for this comparison.

- **Miconazole shampoo plus rinse versus shampoo alone**: No primary outcomes were reported for this comparison.
	- **Symptom severity scores for erythema, pruritus, scaling measured with any type of systematic symptom severity assessment**:
		- **Pruritus score**: Seif found that miconazole and placebo had similar efficacy in clearance of itch (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.71).

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^111PZYb6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- **Criteria for considering studies for this review**:

		- **Types of studies**: We included randomized controlled trials (including cross-over trials and cross-over trials of body parts) of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

		- **Types of participants**: We included studies conducted with adults or adolescents who had been diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner, as explicitly stated or implied within context, as having seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD) of the scalp, face, or both based on clinical case definition, with or without laboratory confirmation. The term 'healthcare practitioner' as used implies physicians or another cadre of care providers who used well-defined guidelines for making the diagnosis. We included studies that had described the diagnosis as seborrhoeic eczema or seborrhoeic dermatitis. No consensus has been reached on the difference between seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp and dandruff, which are seen by many as part of a continuous spectrum of dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we also included studies with patients who were diagnosed with dandruff.

### The global prevalence of seborrheic dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116V7cbV]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, yet its global prevalence, pathogenesis, and epidemiology remain inadequately defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a detailed estimation of the global prevalence of seborrheic dermatitis, analyze demographic variations, and explore differences in various settings.

- **Data sources**: Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from inception through October 2023.

- **Study selection**: Original investigations on seborrheic dermatitis prevalence were included after duplicate screening of titles, abstracts, and full articles, incorporating only studies with clinician-diagnosed cases.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Following PRISMA guidelines, data were extracted and quality was assessed independently by multiple reviewers. A random-effects model using restricted maximum likelihood was employed for meta-analysis and subgroup analyses.

- **Main outcome and measure**: The primary outcome was the pooled estimate of global seborrheic dermatitis prevalence.

From 1574 identified articles, 121 studies were included, encompassing 1,260,163 individuals and revealing a pooled global seborrheic dermatitis prevalence of 4.38% (95% CI, 3.58%-5.17%), with significant heterogeneity (I² = 99.94%). Subgroup analyses indicated variations by age, with a higher prevalence in adults (5.64% [95% CI, 4.01%-7.27%]) compared to children (3.70% [95% CI, 2.69%-4.80%]) and neonates (0.23% [95% CI, 0.04%-0.43%]). Geographic analyses indicated variability, with the highest prevalence in South Africa (8.82%).

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp: Summary of a Cochrane review [^1173T5tQ]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Clinical question**: Are there differences in effectiveness between topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or lithium salts) and placebo or azoles in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adults?

- **Bottom line**: The topical anti-inflammatory treatments were more effective in achieving total clearance of symptoms than placebo by 1.4-fold to 8.5-fold, but there are no considerable differences between the anti-inflammatory topical treatments or in comparison with azoles for short-term treatment. There is no evidence of treatment effects in long-term, continuous, or intermittent use of these compounds despite the chronic nature of the disease.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^113pznTx]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects patients of all ages, with a global prevalence of 5% or greater. Cardinal features are erythematous, scaly, pruritic patches and plaques, with a yellowish, greasy appearance, affecting areas with abundant sebaceous glands, often accompanied by dyspigmentation in patients with darker skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can have deleterious effects on quality of life, particularly in patients with more severe disease.

Treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis include topical antifungals, corticosteroids, and sulfur/sulfacetamide; topical calcineurin inhibitors are also used off-label. Coal tar is less commonly used and is associated with safety concerns. Treatments are available as creams, lotions, ointments, foams, shampoos, gels, and solutions/topical suspensions. Corticosteroids are effective but should not be used long term due to the risk of atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, rosacea, and ocular toxic effects when used on the eyelid. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat seborrheic dermatitis; however, efficacy and safety have been assessed in patients with severe facial seborrheic dermatitis. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are associated with short-term warmth and burning sensations, and labeling includes a warning for rare cases of lymphoma and skin cancer, although clinical data do not suggest a higher risk compared with the general population. Scalp seborrheic dermatitis is often treated with shampoos containing antifungal agents.

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis [^116ZBqMh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects at least 10% of the population. Malassezia (Pityrosporum) ovale is thought to be the causative organism and causes inflammation by still poorly defined mechanisms. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and body in adults? We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, so please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, emollients, ketoconazole, lithium succinate, selenium sulphide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical corticosteroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furoate).

A total of 328 patients were screened, and 226 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.9 [16.8] years; 116 men, 110 women) were randomized to roflumilast foam (n = 154) or vehicle foam (n = 72) [Figure 1]. Most patients (208 of 226 [92.0%]) completed the study. Only 2 (1.3%) roflumilast-treated patients discontinued due to adverse events (AEs), compared with 1 (1.4%) vehicle-treated patient. Additionally, 2 patients (1.3%) missed the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) at week 8 due to COVID-19 disruption and were excluded from the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population (n = 224).

- **Treatment comparison**: Treatment groups were well balanced for demographic and baseline disease characteristics. More than 90% of patients had moderate severity of seborrheic dermatitis (IGA score of 3) at baseline. Approximately 90% had a moderate score for erythema, and slightly more than 80% had a moderate score for scaling. Mean Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) scores were slightly less than 6 in both groups. Mean percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected was 3.3% in the roflumilast group and 3.0% in the vehicle group. More roflumilast-treated patients than vehicle-treated patients presented with facial involvement (64.9% vs. 50.0%).

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117QbHQm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: We explored studies examining the effects of ketoconazole, bifonazole, metronidazole, clotrimazole, and ciclopirox in alleviating symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Ketoconazole demonstrated a lower incidence of failure to achieve complete resolution compared to placebo; however, the results displayed statistical heterogeneity unexplained by subgroup analyses of dose, mode of delivery, or conflict of interest. Evidence was deemed moderate or low quality.

- **Summary of main results**: Treatment with ketoconazole resulted in a reduced failure rate of total rash clearance compared to placebo, supported by low-quality evidence. Although ketoconazole effectively reduced erythema and scaling more than placebo, both treatments showed comparable effects on pruritus. Participants using ketoconazole reported a similar risk of side effects to those on placebo.

	- Ketoconazole was less effective than steroids in achieving complete remission of rashes, though this finding lacked statistical significance. Both ketoconazole and steroids exhibited similar effects in improving erythema, pruritus, and scaling symptoms. The high statistical heterogeneity led to evidence being rated as low quality. Participants using ketoconazole had a 44% lower risk of side effects compared to those on steroids.

	- In comparison with ciclopirox, ketoconazole was similarly effective in alleviating seborrhoeic dermatitis symptoms. Evidence for this comparison was graded as low quality. When evaluating symptom-specific outcomes, both drugs showed comparable efficacy.

### The evolving role of therapeutic shampoos for targeting symptoms of inflammatory scalp disorders [^114Y5j4o]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Scalp lesions are common among patients with psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and various other inflammatory and fungal conditions. Topical corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment for many scalp dermatoses, significantly reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus. However, conventional corticosteroid formulations such as creams and ointments are often difficult or time-consuming for patients to apply and may produce undesirable cosmetic effects. Medicated shampoos provide a more convenient alternative for patients requiring topical administration of corticosteroids for scalp conditions.

Tar shampoos have long been used to treat psoriasis and are effective for the long-term maintenance of remission in responsive patients. Antifungal shampoos effectively treat seborrheic dermatitis and other mycotic conditions. A shampoo formulation containing fluocinolone acetonide, 0.01%, is also approved for treating seborrheic dermatitis. Additionally, one superpotent corticosteroid shampoo (clobetasol propionate 0.05%; Clobex Shampoo) is approved in the United States for once-daily treatment of scalp psoriasis. The results of a 2007 pilot study demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo improved the signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. These findings suggest that high-potency corticosteroid shampoos may provide a valuable option for topical corticosteroid therapy in dermatologic conditions affecting the scalp.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^112jdK4X]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

We minimized potential biases in the review process by including studies published in any language, thereby reducing reporting bias. However, the challenge of finding available translators for Chinese articles remains, and several are still on the list awaiting assessment. Nonetheless, we avoided reporting bias by including studies with insufficient data in the review and imputing missing data to enable their inclusion in meta-analyses.

A few studies employed a split-face cross-over design. Although we intended to analyze them with paired t-tests, a lack of detail in the study reports prevented this. As these studies accounted for only a small fraction of the total, we believe their exclusion has not significantly influenced our results.

Outcome measures varied significantly across studies. Most utilized a four-step scale ranging from no symptoms to mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. We treated this scale as continuous, ranging from 0 to 3 or from 1 to 4, and used total clearance as our primary outcome due to its potential for more reliable assessment, despite lacking supporting data. Given the much higher heterogeneity in meta-analyses involving symptom scores compared to those involving total clearance, this decision seems prudent in retrospect.

The absence of a robust case definition for seborrhoeic dermatitis posed challenges. We addressed this by including studies where authors diagnosed participants with dandruff, considering it a mild form of the condition.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^115sHh3W]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either roflumilast foam, 0.3%, or a vehicle foam. Assignment to treatment groups was based on an interactive response technology system using a computer-generated randomization list, which was generated by an unblinded statistician not involved in the trial and stratified by study site and baseline disease severity. The study design included an initial screening period of up to 4 weeks, followed by randomization, an 8-week treatment phase, and a follow-up phase of 1 week. At week 8, patients who met eligibility requirements were given the option to enroll in an open-label, single-arm, long-term safety extension of the trial.

Roflumilast foam is uniquely formulated to contain 0.3% roflumilast in an emollient, water-based (65% water) foam without fragrances, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, or ethanol. The foam features a propellant that dissipates rapidly when applied. The vehicle foam was identical to the roflumilast foam, 0.3%, without the active ingredient. Each patient received blinded, uniquely numbered kits containing two blinded, 60-g canisters of the assigned product. The number of kits dispensed to each patient was based on BSA involvement.

Study staff instructed patients on how to apply the treatment foam during the randomization (baseline) visit. The investigational product was applied to seborrheic dermatitis lesions as a thin film and rubbed in thoroughly but gently until the product disappeared. The foam was self-administered once daily, in the evening at least 20 minutes before going to bed, except when treatment was applied at the study site.

### Management of seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis versicolor [^116vTSgv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are two very common skin diseases. Pityriasis versicolor is a chronic, superficial fungal disease usually located on the upper trunk, neck, or upper arms. In pityriasis versicolor, the lipophilic yeast Malassezia (also known as Pityrosporum ovale or P. orbiculare) changes from the blastospore form to the mycelial form under the influence of predisposing factors. The most important exogenous factors are high temperatures and a high relative humidity, which probably explain why pityriasis versicolor is more common in the tropics. The most important endogenous factors are greasy skin, hyperhidrosis, hereditary factors, corticosteroid treatment, and immunodeficiency.

There are many ways of treating pityriasis versicolor topically. Options include propylene glycol, ketoconazole shampoo, zinc pyrithione shampoo, ciclopiroxamine, selenium sulfide, and topical antifungals. In difficult cases, short-term treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole is effective and well tolerated. To avoid recurrence, a prophylactic treatment regimen is mandatory.

Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by red, scaly lesions predominantly located on the scalp, face, and upper trunk. There are now many studies indicating that Malassezia plays an important role in this condition. Even a normal number of Malassezia can trigger an inflammatory reaction. Mild corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. However, the disease often recurs quickly, sometimes within just a few days. Antifungal therapy is effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^114cgFmQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

- **Lithium salts versus placebo**:

	- Primary outcomes assessed the participants without complete resolution. In a study by Dreno comparing lithium gluconate versus placebo, it was found that at short-term (up to four weeks) follow-up, lithium resulted in a higher remission rate. This meant fewer participants taking lithium failed to achieve complete resolution compared with participants given placebo. However, the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). At long-term (more than four weeks) follow-up, lithium was statistically significantly better than placebo (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86).

- **Secondary outcomes**:

	- Symptom severity scores for erythema, pruritus, and scaling were measured using systematic severity assessment methods. In terms of erythema score, one study by Langtry compared the effects of lithium preparations versus placebo. The results provided weak evidence of better erythema reduction with lithium (MD -3.90, 95% CI -16.91 to 9.11) at short-term follow-up and similar results at long-term follow-up (MD -6.20, 95% CI -20.49 to 8.09). Dreno analyzed erythema as a discrete outcome and found that lithium gluconate produced better clearance of erythema after eight weeks of follow-up when compared with placebo (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.84).

	- For the scaling score, results from Langtry showed that participants taking lithium had lower scaling scores than those given placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant (MD -5.00, 95% CI -18.78 to 8.78).

### Treating seborrheic dermatitis: Review of mechanisms and therapeutic options [^115vd4L9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a condition for which both dermatologists and patients often establish a routine that can be difficult to change. Unlike the new treatment paradigms for eczema, acne, and actinic keratoses, combination therapies have not traditionally been part of the approach to treating seborrheic dermatitis. However, with the advent of new therapies and vehicles, as well as a better understanding of the role neutrophils and free oxygen radicals play in inflammation, there are new options for maintaining and controlling the disease process to minimize flares.

The needs of the scalp, face, and chest differ, as do variations in skin types. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanisms of the inflammatory process are often similar. Seborrheic dermatitis is histologically classified as a papulosquamous disorder with paucineutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrates. If the trigger and etiologic agent is most likely Malassezia furfur, the ideal mechanisms of action of therapies should be directed accordingly.

### Interventions for infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (including cradle cap) [^115sSeFq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (ISD) is a chronic, inflammatory, scaling skin condition, which causes redness and a greasy scaling rash in infants and young children. It can last from weeks to months, but rarely years. When it occurs on the scalp, it is referred to as 'cradle cap'. While benign and self-limiting, regardless of its location on the body, it can distress parents. The effectiveness of commonly promoted treatments is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of interventions for infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis in children from birth to 24 months of age.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 22 May 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched trials registers and checked reference lists of included studies for further references to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched for unpublished RCTs and grey literature via web search engines and wrote to authors and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs of interventions for ISD in children from birth up to 24 months who were clinically diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner with ISD or cradle cap. We allowed comparison of any treatment to no treatment or placebo, and the comparison of two or more treatments or a combination of treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were 'Change in severity score from baseline to end of study' and 'Percentage of infants treated who develop adverse effects or intolerance'.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113uC6oN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

We changed the review title from 'Interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis' to 'Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. In the protocol, we originally presented this review as an all-encompassing interventions review for seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, we had to narrow our focus to topical antifungal agents due to the multiplicity of comparisons and the diverse outcome variables encountered. For meaningful comparisons and coherent conclusions, we decided it was best to divide the review into segments focusing on major classes of treatment identified from the trials. These segments will be published in a series, culminating in an overview.

We had proposed to conduct a search for side effects associated with various interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis. Unfortunately, we did not perform this search due to limited resources. The adverse effects reported in included studies were non-specific, making a targeted search for specific adverse effects challenging. Additionally, we concluded that searching grey literature and conference proceedings, as initially proposed, would likely not yield additional information. The already low quality of reporting in published trials complicated analysis, and the conference proceedings covered by the electronic search provided minimal data.

### Ketoconazole [^1119YZra]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In 11 double-blind trials with 264 patients using ketoconazole shampoo, 2% for dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis, an increase in normal hair loss and irritation occurred in less than 1% of patients. In three open-label safety trials, where 41 patients shampooed 4–10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. Similar to other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with tinea versicolor, treatment options included a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% (n = 106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n = 107), or placebo (n = 105). Drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%), and 4 (4%) of the patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any treatment group were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any group.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from an uncertain population size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Post-marketing experiences with ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have identified adverse drug reactions such as hair discoloration, abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, and angioedema.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^115pKAiH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The rationale for certain treatment regimens was seldom given; most studies simply stated that participants were treated for four weeks with a 2% solution to be applied twice daily. However, wide variation in dose and mode of delivery was observed without a clear explanation for this. It is interesting that no relationship between dose and the outcome of 'clearance of symptoms' was obvious at the study level as an indirect comparison. It was only when individual symptom outcomes were assessed that higher doses seemed to produce a better treatment effect. However, this observation was based only on single studies. In direct comparisons of dose effect, no reason was found to conclude that different doses had different treatment effects.

- **Quality of evidence**: The major problem with the quality of the evidence was how outcomes were measured. We failed to identify any validated outcome measure for seborrhoeic dermatitis or outcome measures conventionally endorsed by expert committees or ranking specialist fora. This situation also applies to other dermatological disorders, as our consultation with experts in the field revealed. Our principal outcome measure, namely, total clearance, has face validity, but we do not know how reliably it can be measured. Global severity scores have the drawback that they can be based on assessment of any symptom/affected area combination, which could weaken the reliability of the measure. Therefore, we excluded studies that measured outcomes in this way. They are listed under excluded studies.

Although we undertook rigorous assessment of treatment outcomes, considerable heterogeneity was noted.

### Topical pimecrolimus 1% cream for resistant seborrheic dermatitis of the face: an open-label study [^113ZxQJM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis are numerous, including both topical and systemic agents, such as topical corticosteroids, oral antifungals, and psoralen plus UVA. However, the long-term use of topical corticosteroids may lead to adverse effects. Pimecrolimus 1% cream is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for seborrheic dermatitis.

- **Objective**: To explore the efficacy of pimecrolimus 1% cream for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis lesions resistant to conventional treatments.

- **Methods**: Sixteen patients with resistant seborrheic dermatitis of the face applied pimecrolimus 1% cream twice daily for 2 weeks. The lesions were assessed clinically, and the severity of the signs was evaluated using a 4-point score. Scores for all affected regions, including paranasal, forehead, and eyebrows, were evaluated separately to determine if different results would be obtained for different facial areas. Additionally, patients completed self-assessments on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at each visit.

- **Results**: Statistically significant reductions in scores for all parameters were observed at day 7 and day 14 of the study. There were no significant differences between responses in the three regions of the face. No adverse effects were reported, except for temporary pruritus immediately after applying pimecrolimus 1% cream, which occurred in one patient.

- **Conclusion**: Although the interpretation of efficacy was limited by the open-label, non-controlled study design and the small number of patients, this trial suggests that pimecrolimus 1% cream may be a promising treatment for resistant seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113cGFMQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face, and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents, and phototherapy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data, and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

- **Main results**: We included 51 studies with 9052 participants.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^115DYSWi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

- **Sensitivity analyses**: We considered two comparisons to contain sufficient studies for sensitivity analysis, namely, 'ketoconazole versus placebo' and 'ketoconazole versus steroids'. We intended to analyze differences in outcomes by conducting adequate randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. However, for these two comparisons, we found no study, or at most two studies, that had a low risk of bias for these domains. We therefore refrained from drawing conclusions regarding the influence of risk of bias on review results.

- **Publication bias**: Funnel plots for the main comparisons that included sufficient studies for assessment did not reveal a strong indication of publication bias.

- **Grading of the evidence**: Only one study, by Dreno, had no limitations regarding randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding of the outcome assessor. Therefore, we downgraded the evidence for all comparisons based on limitations in study design. For further downgrading decisions, see Table 1.

### Efficacious and safe management of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis using clobetasol propionate shampoo 0·05% combined with ketoconazole shampoo 2%: A randomized, controlled study [^112e1W3R]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Topical antifungals and corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis. The short-contact clobetasol propionate 0·05% shampoo (CP) is an efficacious and safe once-daily treatment for scalp psoriasis. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CP alone and combined with ketoconazole shampoo 2% (KC) in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis.

- **Methods**: This randomized and investigator-blinded study consisted of three phases, each lasting 4 weeks. During the treatment phase, subjects were randomized to receive KC twice weekly (K2), CP twice weekly (C2), CP twice weekly alternating with KC twice weekly (C2 + K2), or CP four times weekly alternating with KC twice weekly (C4 + K2). All subjects received KC once weekly during the maintenance phase and were untreated during the follow-up phase.

- **Results**: At the end of the treatment phase, all three CP-containing regimens were significantly more efficacious than K2 in decreasing the overall disease severity (P < 0·05). Both combination regimens were also significantly more efficacious than K2 in decreasing each individual sign of the disease (P < 0·05). While the C2 and C4 + K2 groups experienced slight worsening during the maintenance phase, the efficacy of C2 + K2 was sustained and remained the highest among all groups. All regimens were well tolerated without inducing any skin atrophy. Similarly low incidences of telangiectasia, burning, and adverse events were observed among the four groups.

- **Conclusions**: The combination therapy of twice-weekly CP alternating with KC represents an effective strategy in managing moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^1118FcMC]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

The study on roflumilast in seborrheic dermatitis, published in 2023 in the journal JAMA Dermatology, explored the treatment effects on seborrheic dermatitis. This multi-center, double-blind, randomized clinical trial addressed the question: what is the effect of roflumilast 0.3% foam in patients with seborrheic dermatitis? The study involved a population of 226 patients, consisting of 110 females and 116 males. Inclusion criteria required adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis for at least three months and an Investigator Global Assessment score of at least 3, affecting 20% or less of the body, including scalp, face, trunk, and intertriginous areas. Key exclusion criteria included the use of topical antifungals, corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, sulfur-based treatments, medical devices, crisaborole, azelaic acid, or metronidazole within two weeks prior to randomization.

- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups, with 154 receiving roflumilast foam (once-daily topical application of 0.3% roflumilast in emollient foam) and 72 receiving vehicle foam (once-daily topical application of vehicle foam without active ingredient).

- **Primary outcome**: The study reported a significant increase in Investigator Global Assessment success at week 8, with 73.8% of participants in the roflumilast group showing improvement compared to 40.9% in the vehicle group (absolute difference 32.8%, 95% confidence interval 18.5 to 45.7).
