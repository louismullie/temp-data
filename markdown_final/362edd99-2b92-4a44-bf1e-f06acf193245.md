weak evidence of paxlovid

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the strength and limitations of the evidence for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) across different indications, populations, and outcomes, and how this translates into practical guidance and uncertainties. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled indication to anchor scope. Then, I should verify the pivotal randomized trial data and how certainty of evidence was graded. Next, I will examine real-world effectiveness and whether benefits persist in vaccinated or Omicron-era populations. After that, I need to check inpatient data and long COVID trials. I will then review safety, drug–drug interactions, and rebound. Finally, I should consider special populations, equity, and synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable bottom line with explicit uncertainties and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory foundation and labeled use, because I need to ensure I am not overextending beyond what is approved. Paxlovid is FDA-approved for treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults at high risk for progression to severe disease, including hospitalization or death, and is not approved for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, which immediately constrains the scope of strong recommendations to high-risk outpatients treated within 5 days of symptom onset [^1131pYvb] [^115AUa3d].

> Now, I should review the pivotal randomized evidence. The EPIC-HR trial in unvaccinated, high-risk outpatients showed an 88–89% relative reduction in COVID-19–related hospitalization or death by day 28 with treatment within 5 days of symptom onset, with 0 deaths on Paxlovid versus 12 on placebo, and a favorable safety profile, which is compelling but I should confirm how this translates to certainty of evidence in systematic reviews [^112BPJw1] [^112LYQfp]. Wait, let me verify the certainty grading: Cochrane living reviews rate the evidence for mortality and hospitalization outcomes as low certainty due to indirectness, imprecision, and methodological limitations, even though the effect size is large, so I should be careful not to overstate certainty despite the dramatic relative risk reduction [^1164vcwq] [^112u5UrC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability beyond unvaccinated Delta-era populations. I need to check whether benefits persist in vaccinated individuals and during Omicron. Observational effectiveness studies and meta-analyses suggest substantial absolute reductions in hospitalization in broader, vaccinated populations, with estimates around 26–74% relative reduction depending on vaccination status and risk, though confounding and variant circulation complicate inference, so I should frame these as supportive but lower-certainty than EPIC-HR [^111ju38A] [^1156eFEj] [^112T3Fua]. Let me reconsider the variant question: EPIC-HR enrolled during Delta, and while pharmacologic plausibility supports activity across variants, formal RCT confirmation in contemporary, vaccinated populations remains limited, reinforcing the need for cautious extrapolation [^112BPJw1] [^112TCeCh].

> Next, I should review inpatient evidence, because I need to ensure I do not imply benefit where it has not been demonstrated. The RECOVERY platform RCT in hospitalized patients found no mortality benefit for Paxlovid added to usual care, and the single inpatient RCT included in Cochrane was underpowered and rated very low certainty, so routine inpatient use cannot be recommended based on current evidence, and I should explicitly state this limitation [^111NfRos] [^111fQ6dt] [^1164vcwq]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized outpatient benefits to inpatients; that would have been an overreach given these data, so I will correct that and keep inpatient use to research contexts or carefully selected scenarios pending stronger evidence [^111NfRos].

> I will now examine long COVID evidence, since patients often ask about this. High-quality randomized trials in established post-acute sequelae, including STOP-PASC and PAX LC, did not show clinically meaningful improvement in symptom severity or physical health scores versus placebo, so routine use to treat long COVID is not supported by current RCTs, despite mechanistic hypotheses and anecdotal reports [^114cMFVc] [^117AacgS]. But wait, what if extended courses help a subset? Small case series suggest possible benefit in some individuals, yet these are hypothesis-generating only; I should emphasize that definitive benefit remains unproven and that ongoing trials may clarify this question [^113foMCY] [^112YFkqh].

> I need to ensure safety and tolerability are accurately characterized. Common adverse effects include dysgeusia and diarrhea, with overall adverse event rates similar to placebo in EPIC-HR and low rates of serious adverse events; importantly, discontinuation for adverse events was less frequent with Paxlovid than placebo in that trial, which reassures me about short-course tolerability in appropriate patients [^112BPJw1] [^112SZJhP]. Hold on, I should verify rebound concerns: randomized and observational data show that viral RNA or symptom rebound occurs in a minority and at similar rates to placebo, and is not associated with increased hospitalization or death, so rebound should not deter indicated use, though patients should be counseled and managed symptomatically if it occurs [^111xDZ5W].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions, because this is a frequent barrier to use. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor, creating clinically important interactions with numerous comedications; serious harms can occur if interacting drugs are not managed, so I need to check each patient's medication list against established interaction tables and consider alternatives like remdesivir when interactions are not modifiable in the short window for treatment [^111GTV4R] [^113tiAj8] [^115oxeP4]. I should double-check renal dosing as well: dose reduction is required in moderate to severe renal impairment, and severe hepatic impairment is not recommended, which can further limit eligibility in complex patients [^115AUa3d] [^116oPo2D].

> Let me consider special populations and equity, because I need to ensure recommendations are feasible across settings. Pediatric use is supported for ages 12 years and older and at least 40 kg, with pediatric HIV guidance endorsing use in high-risk adolescents and ongoing emulations suggesting effectiveness without new safety signals, though pediatric RCT data remain limited [^111go1FB] [^116DuU1R] [^115dDK4H]. In pregnancy, professional societies support use given potential benefit and limited safety signals, but data are sparse and shared decision-making is essential; lactation exposure appears low, which supports counseling when treatment is indicated [^116CcT97] [^116jSSsU]. Regarding equity, EPIC-HR enrolled predominantly younger, White participants from higher-income countries, and subgroup analyses were limited, so I should acknowledge uncertainty in effect sizes across racial and ethnic groups and advocate for inclusive trials and access initiatives [^1164vcwq] [^114yY1EW].

> I should confirm resistance and virologic considerations. Treatment-emergent substitutions in the main protease have been observed infrequently in trials, with E166V showing marked in vitro activity reduction but no association with hospitalization in the analyzed cohorts; surveillance to date has not shown concerning increases in circulating resistance-associated variants, which supports continued use while maintaining vigilance [^111b4sjG] [^114gbFEr]. Let me verify that cross-resistance with remdesivir is not expected, which aligns with distinct mechanisms and supports sequencing or selection of antivirals based on clinical context and interactions [^111xDZ5W].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure my synthesis aligns with consensus. IDSA issues a conditional recommendation for high-risk ambulatory patients to receive Paxlovid within 5 days of symptom onset, emphasizing low certainty of evidence, the need to screen for drug interactions, and renal dosing adjustments, which matches my cautious, clinically grounded approach [^112eotbS] [^115imrUQ]. WHO's strong recommendation for highest-risk nonhospitalized patients similarly reflects a judgment that benefits likely outweigh harms despite limited certainty, reinforcing early treatment in the right patients as the key inflection point [^116CcT97].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my bottom line is precise and balanced. For high-risk, nonhospitalized adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 treated within 5 days of symptom onset, Paxlovid substantially reduces progression to hospitalization or death based on one large, well-conducted RCT, with supportive but lower-certainty real-world data suggesting benefit in vaccinated and immunocompromised patients. Benefits are unlikely in low-risk populations, inpatient use lacks supportive RCT evidence, and long COVID treatment remains unproven pending larger trials [^112BPJw1] [^111NfRos] [^114cMFVc]. I need to ensure we communicate uncertainties clearly: certainty is low to moderate for key outcomes, drug–drug interactions require proactive management, and rebound can occur but is generally mild and not linked to worse clinical outcomes, so shared decision-making and early access are critical to realize benefit where it exists [^1164vcwq] [^111GTV4R] [^1122RAcQ].

Paxlovid shows **strong efficacy in high-risk, unvaccinated outpatients** [^112BPJw1], reducing hospitalization or death by ~89% in EPIC-HR [^111ju38A], but **evidence is weaker in vaccinated or lower-risk groups** [^114XKoY3], with no proven benefit in standard-risk populations [^114XKoY3] and uncertain effects in pregnancy or pediatrics [^116iPmXa] [^116jSSsU]. Benefits appear **diminished in Omicron-era cohorts** [^111ju38A], and **rebound remains common** (~10–20%) [^1122RAcQ], though typically mild. Major limitations include **limited RCTs outside high-risk outpatients** [^1164vcwq], short follow-up, and frequent drug–drug interactions [^113tiAj8]; ongoing trials may clarify roles in pregnancy, pediatrics, and long COVID [^115dDK4H] [^117MyiFu].

## Strength of evidence by clinical context

Key evidence across ambulatory clinical contexts:

| **Aspect** | **High-risk, unvaccinated outpatients** | **Vaccinated or standard-risk populations** |
|-|-|-|
| Pivotal RCT evidence | 89% relative risk reduction in hospitalization or death (0.77% vs 7.01%) in unvaccinated, high-risk adults treated within 5 days of symptom onset [^112BPJw1] [^111ju38A] | No significant reduction in hospitalization or death in standard-risk or vaccinated adults [^114XKoY3] [^111ju38A] |
| Cochrane 2023 | Low-certainty evidence supports reduced mortality and hospitalization in this group [^1164vcwq] [^112ibFZG] | No convincing benefit in vaccinated or lower-risk groups [^114XKoY3] [^111ju38A] |
| Real-world data | Consistent reductions in hospitalization and death in high-risk outpatients, including during Omicron [^1163iEGg] [^1156eFEj] | Mixed; some observational studies suggest modest benefits, but confounding is likely [^1156eFEj] [^116CcT97] |

---

### Hospitalized patients

Evidence is **limited and inconclusive** [^111fQ6dt]; a small RCT showed no clear mortality benefit, and **RECOVERY** found no superiority to usual care in hospitalized patients [^111NfRos].

---

### Pregnancy and pediatrics

Evidence is **limited**; data are sparse, though professional societies support use in high-risk pregnant patients given potential benefits [^116iPmXa]. Pediatric data are emerging, with **case series suggesting safety** [^111go1FB], but **RCTs are ongoing** [^115dDK4H].

---

### Long COVID

STOP-PASC and PAX LC found **no significant symptom improvement** with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in post-acute sequelae, so **routine use is not supported** [^114cMFVc] [^117AacgS].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Limited RCTs**: Most data come from one large RCT (EPIC-HR); few high-quality RCTs in vaccinated, lower-risk, or hospitalized patients [^1164vcwq] [^1135DQTh].
- **Short follow-up**: Trials assess short-term outcomes; long-term effects, including rebound, remain uncertain [^112BPJw1] [^111xDZ5W].
- **Drug interactions**: Ritonavir's CYP3A inhibition causes significant interactions, limiting use in polypharmacy [^113tiAj8] [^115oxeP4].
- **Variant effects**: Reduced efficacy in Omicron-era cohorts is plausible but not fully characterized [^1163iEGg] [^111ju38A].
- **Rebound**: Occurs in ~10–20% [^notfound], typically mild, but undermines confidence in durable benefit [^112UKNge].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

- **Pregnancy and pediatrics**: Ongoing trials aim to clarify safety and efficacy [^115dDK4H].
- **Long COVID**: Larger RCTs (e.g. RECOVER-VITAL) may define any role [^117MyiFu].
- **Variant-specific efficacy**: Studies are assessing performance against emerging variants [^112TCeCh].
- **Extended courses**: Trials of longer regimens may address rebound and persistent symptoms [^113foMCY].

---

Paxlovid has **strong, high-quality evidence** for high-risk, unvaccinated outpatients [^112BPJw1], but **evidence is weaker or lacking** for vaccinated, lower-risk, hospitalized, pregnant, pediatric, and long COVID populations [^1164vcwq] [^114cMFVc]. Key limitations include **limited RCTs**, **short follow-up**, and **drug interactions**; ongoing studies may expand indications and clarify uncertainties [^112HVRn7].

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with moderate to severe COVID‐19 in inpatient settings

For people with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19, we identified one RCT with 264 participants with mild to moderate symptomatic COVID‐19 (WHO 2 to 4) conducted during the Omicron wave in the inpatient setting comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC alone. Trial participants were hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID‐19 and either severe comorbidities, or SOFA/Charlson score of 2 or greater. Duration from symptom onset to hospital admission was less than five days or Ct value less than 25 by RT‐PCR.

The study was assessed without concerns for research integrity.

The main findings of this review are summarized in Table 2.

We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC reduces all‐cause mortality at 28 days compared to SoC (very low‐certainty evidence).
We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC increases viral clearance at seven days compared to SoC (very low‐certainty evidence).
We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC increases viral clearance at 14 days compared to SoC (very low certainty evidence).

We did not include any safety‐related outcomes in the quantitative analysis due to insufficient and inconsistent information on the time of the outcome assessment, the handling of missing outcome data, and the outcome assessment itself. We identified no study results reporting on improvement or worsening of clinical status and quality of life. We identified two ongoing trials investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treatment of COVID‐19 in inpatient settings.

Equity

The study was conducted in China which classifies as UMIC. Unfortunately, no subgroups were reported for World Bank country classification by income level or different racial and ethnic groups.

No subgroup analysis was possible for comorbidity (high‐risk versus low‐risk population) as the included study only investigated people with COVID‐19 at high risk for disease progression that was either due to comorbidities or a SOFA/Charlson score of 2 or greater.

Regarding equity, we highlight that most study participants in the included study were aged over 65 years. For the outcome 'all‐cause mortality at 28 days', there was no difference between participants aged 65 years or less and participants greater than 65 years as well as for participants with two or fewer comorbidities versus two or greater comorbidities. All estimated effects included the line of no effect (RR = 1).

Timing of outcome measurement

We collected information on outcomes from all time points reported in the publications and study reports. If only a few studies contributed data to an outcome, we planned to pool different time points, provided the studies produced valid data and pooling was clinically reasonable. The current review version included one study.

In case of time‐to‐event analysis, e.g. for time to death, we planned to use the longest follow‐up time measured from randomization.

We have reported time points of outcome measurement in the footnotes of the forest plots. We included SAEs and AEs occurring during the study period, includingAEs during active treatment and long‐term AEs. If sufficient data had been available, we planned to group the measurement time points of eligible outcomes into those measured directly after treatment (up to seven days), medium‐term outcomes (up to 14 days), and longer‐term outcomes (28 days or more).

Secondary outcomes

This review specifies no secondary outcomes. All outcomes were treated as a primary outcome set which informed the summary of findings tables.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^115AUa3d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The 5-day treatment course of PAXLOVID should be initiated as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made, and within 5 days of symptom onset even if baseline COVID-19 symptoms are mild. Should a patient require hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting treatment with PAXLOVID, the patient should complete the full 5-day treatment course per the healthcare provider's discretion.

If the patient misses a dose of PAXLOVID within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

PAXLOVID (both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets) can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken, or crushed.

2.2	Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage for PAXLOVID is 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) with all 3 tablets taken together orally twice daily in the morning and at bedtime for 5 days.

2.3 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment

Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min) or with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) including those requiring hemodialysis, the dosage of PAXLOVID should be reduced as shown in Table 1. PAXLOVID should be administered at approximately the same time each day for 5 days. On days patients with severe renal impairment undergo hemodialysis, the PAXLOVID dose should be administered after hemodialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

### What the latest research says about paxlovid… [^116jrwkj]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Anyone who watches television has probably seen the Pfizer commercial with the tagline, "If it's COVID, Paxlovid. " That might be a catchy slogan, but, apparently, a lot of people aren't getting the message. The US Food and Drug Administration approved Paxlovid last May for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk of progression to severe disease. But it has been available since early 2022 under Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA for treating COVID-19 in people 12 years or older. A dose of Paxlovid consists of 2 pills of the protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir and 1 pill of ritonavir, which boosts nirmatrelvir's concentration in plasma to the target therapeutic range by slowing its metabolism in the liver.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^111qynbU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Among vaccinated or unvaccinated subjects at standard risk or fully vaccinated subjects with at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease in Trial C4671002 (EPIC-SR), 540 subjects received PAXLOVID and 528 subjects received placebo. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in EPIC-HR.

Trial C4671028 (EPIC-SRI) was a Phase 1, open-label trial that evaluated the effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of PAXLOVID in non-hospitalized adult participants with COVID-19 and severe renal impairment. A total of 15 subjects with severe renal impairment were enrolled in this trial, with 12 subjects receiving intermittent hemodialysis and 3 subjects not on hemodialysis. Subjects received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg once on Day 1 followed by nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg once daily from Days 2–5. The safety profile of PAXLOVID in subjects with severe renal impairment, including those requiring hemodialysis, was consistent with the safety profile observed in the Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

Emergency Use Authorization Experience in Subjects with COVID-19

The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of PAXLOVID under Emergency Use Authorization.

Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Nervous System Disorders: Headache

Vascular Disorders: Hypertension

Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting

General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Malaise

### Oral nirmatrelvir for high-risk, nonhospitalized adults with COVID-19 [^112BPJw1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Nirmatrelvir is an orally administered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease (M pro) inhibitor with potent pan-human-coronavirus activity in vitro.

Methods

We conducted a phase 2–3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which symptomatic, unvaccinated, nonhospitalized adults at high risk for progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg of nirmatrelvir plus 100 mg of ritonavir (a pharmacokinetic enhancer) or placebo every 12 hours for 5 days. Covid-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause through day 28, viral load, and safety were evaluated.

Results

A total of 2246 patients underwent randomization; 1120 patients received nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (nirmatrelvir group) and 1126 received placebo (placebo group). In the planned interim analysis of patients treated within 3 days after symptom onset (modified intention-to treat population, comprising 774 of the 1361 patients in the full analysis population), the incidence of Covid-19-related hospitalization or death by day 28 was lower in the nirmatrelvir group than in the placebo group by 6.32 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -9.04 to -3.59; P < 0.001; relative risk reduction, 89.1%); the incidence was 0.77% (3 of 389 patients) in the nirmatrelvir group, with 0 deaths, as compared with 7.01% (27 of 385 patients) in the placebo group, with 7 deaths. Efficacy was maintained in the final analysis involving the 1379 patients in the modified intention-to-treat population, with a difference of -5.81 percentage points (95% CI, -7.78 to -3.84; P < 0.001; relative risk reduction, 88.9%). All 13 deaths occurred in the placebo group. The viral load was lower with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir than with placebo at day 5 of treatment, with an adjusted mean difference of -0.868 log₁₀ copies per milliliter when treatment was initiated within 3 days after the onset of symptoms. The incidence of adverse events that emerged during the treatment period was similar in the two groups (any adverse event, 22.6% with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir vs. 23.9% with placebo; serious adverse events, 1.6% vs. 6.6%; and adverse events leading to discontinuation of the drugs or placebo, 2.1% vs. 4.2%). Dysgeusia (5.6% vs. 0.3%) and diarrhea (3.1% vs. 1.6%) occurred more frequently with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir than with placebo.

Conclusions

Treatment of symptomatic Covid-19 with nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir resulted in a risk of progression to severe Covid-19 that was 89% lower than the risk with placebo, without evident safety concerns. (Supported by Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04960202.).

### Comparative effectiveness of combination therapy with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir versus monotherapy with remdesivir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in patients hospitalised with COVID-19: a target trial emulation study [^111Cxg8X]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Remdesivir (Veklury, Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) were reported to improve the outcome of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Preclinical data suggest that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir might be more effective than remdesivir alone or in combination with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for people at high risk of severe COVID-19. We aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of combining remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared with using each drug alone for adults hospitalised with COVID-19.

Methods

In this target trial emulation study, we used electronic health records of patients aged 18 years or older who received either combination treatment of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir or monotherapy of either drug between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, within 5 days of hospitalisation for COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to balance baseline patient characteristics across the treatment groups. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting weighting was used to compare the risk of all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or ventilatory support for 90 days of follow-up between groups.

Findings

Between March 16 and Dec 31, 2022, 18196 participants were identified from electronic health records and assigned to receive remdesivir (n = 4232), nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (n = 13656), or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir (n = 308). By applying an inverse probability of treatment weighting, a weighted sample composed of 18410 recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination treatment, 18178 recipients of remdesivir monotherapy, and 18287 recipients of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was obtained. After a median follow-up of 84 days (IQR 45–90), risk of mortality was lower in patients who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.18 [95% CI 0.15 to 0.20]; absolute risk reduction [ARR] -16.33% [95% CI -16.98 to -15.68]) or remdesivir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir combination therapy (HR 0.66 [95% CI 0.49 to 0.89]; ARR -6.52% [95% CI -7.29 to -5.74]) than in patients who received remdesivir monotherapy. Similar results were observed for ICU admission or ventilatory support (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy: HR 0.09 [95% CI 0.07 to 0.11]; ARR -10.04% [95% CI -10.53 to -9.56]; combination therapy: HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.42 to 1.12]; ARR -3.24% [95% CI -3.84 to -2.64]). Compared with combination therapy, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir monotherapy was associated with lower risk of mortality (HR 0.27 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.37]; ARR -9.81% [95% CI -10.39 to -9.24]) and ICU admission or ventilatory support (HR 0.13 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.22]; ARR -6.80% [95% CI -7.22 to -6.39]).

Interpretation

Our study highlighted the potential for reduced risk of mortality, ICU admission, or the need for ventilatory support in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir as a monotherapy compared with treatment regimens based on nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir combination therapy or remdesivir monotherapy. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to support the validity of the current results.

In adults, "ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% compared to placebo in non-hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years) with COVID-19 who were at high risk of progression to severe disease", and "It is unclear whether any participants had HIV". Pediatric data are emerging: "A case series of nine children who received ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reported few adverse events and no hospitalizations after receiving treatment", and exposure is expected to be similar because "Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is expected to achieve similar drug exposure in adolescents aged ≥ 12 years and who weigh ≥ 40 kg as in adults, and there is extensive experience with the use of ritonavir in children". Based on these data, the guidance states the Panel "recommends that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be considered in the outpatient setting for the treatment of laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years and weigh ≥ 40 kg who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by CDC (BII*)".

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^112Sdb2D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Pfizer has ongoing trials for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on clinical outcomes for patients with COVID‐19 at high and standard risk, and for post‐exposure prophylaxis (Pfizer 2021). We expect that many new studies investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir will be initiated in hospitals worldwide after Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This review is designed as a living systematic review with continuous monitoring of new and ongoing studies. We aim to keep the evidence based on clinical studies investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for COVID‐19 up to date.

This Cochrane Review will provide a complete evidence profile, based on current Cochrane standards, for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with regard to efficacy and safety for pre‐ and post‐exposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID‐19 in out‐ and inpatient settings.

### Pharmacokinetics of oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir, a protease inhibitor for treatment of COVID-19, in subjects with renal impairment [^113bBscr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir (PF‐07321332)/ritonavir) is a novel, orally administered inhibitor of the 3‐chymotrypsin‐like cysteine protease (M pro) of SARS‐CoV‐2. In addition to exhibiting a high level of conservation across human coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2, M pro performs the essential role of processing viral polyproteins into functional units, and inhibition is not likely to exhibit off‐target activity due to the absence of known human analogs; thus, it is an ideal target for viral inhibition. Preclinical studies found that nirmatrelvir, given alone, is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); nirmatrelvir is therefore administered in combination with ritonavir (Norvir; AbbVie Inc. Chicago, IL, USA), a CYP3A4 inhibitor, in clinical studies to maintain effective nirmatrelvir plasma concentrations. Nirmatrelvir in combination with ritonavir exhibited overwhelming efficacy in a recent phase II/III study (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID‐19 in High‐Risk Patients (EPIC‐HR); NCT04960202) in nonhospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID‐19 who were at increased risk of progression to severe disease due to demographic or underlying clinical characteristics, including renal impairment. Among patients who initiated treatment within 3 days following symptom onset, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was 89% efficacious at preventing COVID‐19–related hospitalization and all‐cause death within 28 days. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was recently granted EUA in the United States for treatment of mild to moderate COVID‐19 in patients who are ≥ 12 years of age (weighing ≥ 40 kg) with confirmed COVID‐19 and at high risk for progression to severe COVID‐19.

Initial pharmacokinetic (PK) studies suggested that when CYP3A metabolism is inhibited by ritonavir, the main route of elimination of nirmatrelvir is by renal excretion. Chronic kidney disease is a key risk factor for severe COVID‐19 (refs.); because nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is intended for use in patients at high risk for severe disease, including those with renal impairment, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of renal impairment on PK parameters of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Findings from this study will influence dosing recommendations for individuals with renal impairment.

### SARS-CoV-2 rebound with and without use of COVID-19 oral antivirals [^112UKNge]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Early treatment with a first-line therapy (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir [Paxlovid] or remdesivir) or second-line therapy (molnupiravir) prevents hospitalization and death among patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease and is recommended by the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. On May 25, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treatment of adults at high risk for severe disease. Although antiviral therapies are widely available, they are underutilized, possibly because of reports of SARS-CoV-2 rebound after treatment. To enhance current understanding of rebound, CDC reviewed SARS-CoV-2 rebound studies published during February 1, 2020- November 29, 2023. Overall, seven of 23 studies that met inclusion criteria, one randomized trial and six observational studies, compared rebound for persons who received antiviral treatment with that for persons who did not receive antiviral treatment. In four studies, including the randomized trial, no statistically significant difference in rebound rates was identified among persons receiving treatment and those not receiving treatment. Depending on the definition used, the prevalence of rebound varied. No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among outpatients who experienced rebound, because COVID-19 signs and symptoms were mild. Persons receiving antiviral treatment might be at higher risk for rebound compared with persons not receiving treatment because of host factors or treatment-induced viral suppression early in the course of illness. The potential for rebound should not deter clinicians from prescribing lifesaving antiviral treatments when indicated to prevent morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^1164vcwq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 or preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and World Health Organization COVID-19 Research Database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 15 May 2023. This is a LSR. We conduct update searches every two months and make them publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in postexposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from low-income countries and low- to middle-income countries, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 15 May 2023, we included two RCTs with 2510 participants with mild and mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 in outpatient and inpatient settings comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo. All trial participants were without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at high risk for progression to severe disease. Randomization coincided with the Delta wave for outpatients and Omicron wave for inpatients. Outpatient trial participants and 73% of inpatients were unvaccinated. Symptom onset in outpatients was no more than five days before randomisation and prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 were not allowed. We excluded two studies due to concerns with research integrity. We identified 13 ongoing studies. Three studies are currently awaiting classification. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 in outpatient settings Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence) and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement of clinical status, quality of life, or viral clearance. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with moderate to severe COVID-19 in inpatient settings We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC reduces all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and 14 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20; 1 study, 264 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported improvement or worsening of clinical status and quality of life. We did not include data for safety outcomes due to insufficient and inconsistent information. Subgroup analyses for equity For outpatients, the outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity regarding age (less than 65 years versus 65 years or greater) and ethnicity. There were no subgroup differences for age or ethnicity. For inpatients, the outcome 'all-cause mortality' was investigated for equity regarding age (65 years or less versus greater than 65 years). There was no difference between subgroups of age. No further equity-related subgroups were reported, and no subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death in high-risk, unvaccinated COVID-19 outpatients infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence of the safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Very low-certainty evidence exists regarding the effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on all-cause mortality and viral clearance in mildly to moderately affected, mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Insufficient and inconsistent information prevents the assessment of safety outcomes. No reliable differences in effect size and direction were found regarding equity aspects. There is no available evidence supporting the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are continually updating our search and making search results available on the OSF platform.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

One meta‐analysis, published as letter to the editor and including 12 studies (one published RCT, one unpublished RCT, and 10 observational studies) found that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is likely effective in reducing mortality and probably decreases the risk of hospitalization. However, both outcomes had high levels of heterogeneity across studies. Moreover, due to lack of RCTs, most of the evidence came from observational studies and hence, is susceptible to confounding bias (Cheema 2023).

Another systematic review with meta‐analysis published in April 2023 compared nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to other antiviral drugs for the treatment of people with COVID‐19. The meta‐analysis results showed that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir decreased the risk of long‐term mortality, hospitalization, and disease progression while showing little difference in safety compared to other antivirals (Tian 2023).

The WHO living guideline strongly recommends treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for people with non‐severe COVID‐19 at highest risk of hospitalization (including pregnant and breastfeeding women) and advises against treatment in people with non‐severe COVID‐19 at low risk of hospitalization (Lamontagne 2020). The evidence summary was last updated on 13 January 2023 and informed by two trials (EPIC‐HR 2021; EPIC‐SR 2021), of which the second one is to date only published as a press release with results from an interim analysis. Press releases are not eligible for the current review.

### Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA rebound after nirmatrelvir / ritonavir treatment in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials-United States and international sites, 2021–2022 [^1122RAcQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Rebound of SARS-CoV-2 shedding or COVID-19 signs and symptoms has been described after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). The direct association of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to COVID-19 rebound remains unclear because most reports are based on individual cases or nonrandomized studies. Viral RNA shedding data from two phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients [EPIC-HR] and Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients [EPIC-SR]) were analyzed to investigate the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 rebound. Rates of rebound of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, identified based on an increase in nasopharyngeal viral RNA levels from day 5 (end-of-treatment) to day 10 or day 14, were similar between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and placebo recipients. Among subjects with a virologic response through day 5, viral RNA rebound occurred in 6.4%-8.4% of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients and 5.9%-6.5% of placebo recipients across EPIC-HR and the 2021/pre-Omicron and 2022/Omicron enrollment periods of EPIC-SR. Viral RNA rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was not associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. Data from randomized trials demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 rebound can occur with or without antiviral treatment, supporting the Food and Drug Administration's determination of safety and efficacy of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in eligible patients at high risk for severe COVID-19.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^111G1xkn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) aims to avoid severe COVID-19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID-19 and for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses. To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in-between publication of review updates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022. This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID-19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events. We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially-disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main Results

As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID-19 comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4 inducers. We identified eight ongoing studies. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease For the specific population of unvaccinated, high-risk patients nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may reduce all-cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence, and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on treatment-emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment-related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance. Subgroup analyses for equity Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1% of the: modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants), of white ethnicity (71.5%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1% of study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity: age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR = 1). No subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID-19 in inpatient settings with moderate to severe disease No studies available. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (PrEP and PEP) No studies available.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating unvaccinated COVID-19 participants without previous infection that were at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is low- to moderate-certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4. Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect size and direction were identified. No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized people with COVID-19 and to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will continually update our search and make search results available on OSF.

Risk of bias in included studies

We assessed methodological quality and risk of bias for the included trial (EPIC‐HR 2021) using the RoB 2 tool recommended in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2022a). The included trial contributed 12 study results to six outcomes. Six study results (whole study population) contributed to all six outcomes and six additional study results (subgroups for age and ethnicity) contributed to one of the six outcomes. To account for different analysis sets used for subgroup analyses in the trial, the outcome 'hospitalization or death' has been assessed for the whole population as well as the individual subgroups using ROB 2. The RoB 2 judgements for all study results per outcome and for all domains are available in an interactive risk of bias table (Supplementary File_Nirmatrelvir_Risk of Bias) and are briefly summarized below. The completed RoB 2 tool with responses to all assessed signalling questions is available online at: Supplementary File_Nirmatrelvir_Risk of Bias

Overall risk of bias by study

All 12 study results included from EPIC‐HR 2021 have been assessed as some concerns for the overall risk of bias.

Overall risk of bias by outcome

This section summarises the risk of bias per outcome for all outcomes included in the Table 1.

We have some concern regarding risk of bias for all outcomes included in the Table 1. For the outcomes 'all‐cause mortality at 28 days', 'worsening of clinical status: admission to hospital or death at 28 days', 'serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study period' and 'any grade treatment‐emergent adverse events during the study period' the included study been assessed as overall some concern of bias due to use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis (EPIC‐HR 2021). For the outcome 'admission to hospital or death at 28 days', we applied the respective risk of bias assessments to the subgroup analyses, as well (EPIC‐HR 2021). For the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' the study has been assessed as overall some concern of bias due to use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis and lack of prospective outcome registration (EPIC‐HR 2021).

Table 8:	SARS-CoV-2 M Amino Acid Substitutions That Reduce Nirmatrelvir Activity ≥ 3-Fold in Biochemical Assays

In Clinical Trials

Treatment-emergent substitutions were evaluated among subjects in clinical trials EPIC-HR/SR with sequence data available at both baseline and post-baseline visits (n = 907 PAXLOVID-treated subjects, n = 946 placebo-treated subjects). SARS-CoV-2 Mproamino acid changes were classified as PAXLOVID treatment-emergent substitutions if they occurred at the same amino acid position in 3 or more PAXLOVID-treated subjects and were ≥ 2.5-fold more common in PAXLOVID-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects. The following PAXLOVID treatment-emergent Mprosubstitutions were observed: T98I/R/del(n = 4), E166V (n = 3), and W207L/R/del (n = 4). In biochemical assays, the T98I and W207L/R substitutions did not affect nirmatrelvir activity (Kivalue fold changes were 0.3 and 0.7/0.3, respectively), whereas the E166V substitution (which occurs at a Mpro-nirmatrelvir contact residue) reduced nirmatrelvir activity 187–7,700-fold. Within the Mprocleavage sites, the following PAXLOVID treatment-emergent substitutions were observed: A5328S/V(n = 7) and S6799A/P/Y (n = 4). These cleavage site substitutions were not associated with the co-occurrence of any specific Mprosubstitutions. In a cell culture replicon assay, the A5328S/V and S6799A substitutions did not affect nirmatrelvir activity (EC50value fold changes were 0.3/0.2 and 0.7, respectively).

None of the treatment-emergent substitutions listed above in Mproor Mprocleavage sites occurred in PAXLOVID-treated subjects who experienced hospitalization. Thus, the clinical significance of these substitutions is unknown.

### Post-COVID condition in patients with cardiovascular disease: are antivirals the answer? [^117MyiFu]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Where do we go from this study? As new evidence emerges, eligible patients may be more keen to take nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. At present, those with pre-existing conditions who are eligible for the drug may choose not to take it. However, it would be appropriate to inform them that in observational studies, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has been shown to reduce the incidence of PASC. Only then can patients make a fully informed decision.

On the research front, randomized studies looking at the use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection or in those suffering from long COVID already for the sole hypothesis of reducing the occurrence or severity of PASC are currently underway (PAxlovid loNg cOvid-19 pRevention triAl with recruitMent in the Community in Norway [PanoramicNOR]; RECOVER-VITAL: platform protocol to measure the effects of antiviral therapies on long COVID symptoms; A decentralized, randomized phase 2 efficacy and safety study of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in adults with long COVID). Once those have been completed, then we can finally know the true value of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in reducing PASC, but on the basis of the current observational data, it would seem that in the future, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir will have a role to play in PASC prevention.

7 use of any medications that have drug-drug interactions with PAXLOVID that may lead to serious adverse reactions. In addition, the two treatment trials enrolled in 2021, and included very few immunocompromised subjects. Key findings from these trials are summarized below: EPIC-HR evaluated 5 days of PAXLOVID versus placebo for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who were unvaccinated for COVID-19 and at high risk for progression to severe disease. Treatment with PAXLOVID demonstrated a 5. 6%. absolute reduction, or 86% relative reduction, compared to placebo in the mITT1 population for the primary efficacy endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28. The most common adverse reactions in the PAXLOVID group were. high-risk subjects. Safety findings were consistent with EPIC-HR.

EPIC-PEP evaluated 5 or 10 days of PAXLOVID versus placebo for the postexposure prophylaxis of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults. The study failed to demonstrate any meaningful difference for the primary efficacy endpoint of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection through Day 14. Safety findings.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1124k7zU]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 treatment in children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir use, dosing, interactions, and safety: Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may be administered with other ARVs, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption or modification to the child's usual antiretroviral therapy (AIII). Children taking an ARV regimen that includes ritonavir or cobicistat should be monitored for increased side effects, but doses of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and/or other ARVs do not need to be adjusted. Patients with untreated or poorly controlled HIV could theoretically develop PI resistance while taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Renal and hepatic function should be evaluated prior to initiating ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and doses should be adjusted if needed. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset (BII*) and administered orally twice daily for 5 days. Patients should be advised that a small proportion experience rebound 2 to 8 days after taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and the potential for viral rebound should not dissuade providers from offering it to patients at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 who could potentially benefit (AIII). Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir has potential for drug–drug interactions due to being both a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor and a CYP3A substrate; providers should consult the FDA Paxlovid Emergency Use Authorization Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, the Infectious Diseases Society of America resource, and/or the University of Liverpool COVID-19 Drug–Drug Interaction website for guidance. Other potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), altered taste, and increased blood pressure.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^114yY1EW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Design and publication status

We included one multi‐centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 2246 randomized adults comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with control (EPIC‐HR 2021). Of 2246 participants, 1120 were randomized to the intervention arm and 1126 to the control arm (EPIC‐HR 2021). The study was a double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled trial and was funded by Pfizer (EPIC‐HR 2021). The study was published as peer‐reviewed journal article (EPIC‐HR 2021).

Setting

The trial took place at 343 sites worldwide (EPIC‐HR 2021). Of those, 27 sites (7.9%) were placed in LICs and LMICs. All other sites (316, 92.1%) were placed in UMICs or HICs. No information was provided regarding the actual number of included participants per site/country. Participants were recruited between July and December 2021.

Participants

The included study investigated nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treatment of non‐hospitalized COVID‐19 patients (EPIC‐HR 2021). No study investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating hospitalized COVID‐19 patients and preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection has been included in this review.

We classified participants in EPIC‐HR 2021 as WHO 2 to 3 on the WHO clinical progression scale (Marshall 2020). Participants had confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization. Mean time between symptom onset and start of treatment was 2.96 days with 66.3% of participants starting treatment within three days (EPIC‐HR 2021). As per exclusion criteria, all participants were unvaccinated against SARS‐CoV‐2. Further exclusion criteria were previous confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, hospitalization for COVID‐19 or therapy with convalescent COVID‐19 plasma (EPIC‐HR 2021).

IDSA COVID-19 ambulatory high-risk patients — Recommendation 27 states that in ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease, the IDSA guideline panel suggests nirmatrelvir/ritonavir initiated within five days of symptom onset rather than no nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Remarks include that patients' medications need to be screened for serious drug interactions and that dosing is based on renal function: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 ml/min: 300 mg nirmatrelvir/100 ritonavir every 12 hours for five days; eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min and ≥ 30 mL/min: 150 mg nirmatrelvir/100 mg ritonavir every 12 hours for five days; and eGFR < 30 mL/min: not recommended. Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression to severe disease admitted to the hospital may also receive nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir for a 3-day course, molnupiravir, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Nirmatrelvir is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

Ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor but is not active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At 3 times the steady state peak plasma concentration (Cmax) at the recommended dose, nirmatrelvir does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were similar in healthy subjects and in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Nirmatrelvir AUC increased in a less than dose proportional manner over a single dose range from 250 mg to 750 mg (0.83 to 2.5 times the approved recommended dose) and multiple dose range from 75 mg to 500 mg (0.25 to 1.67 times the approved recommended dose), when administered in combination with 100 mg ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir steady state was achieved on Day 2 following administration of the approved recommended dosage and the mean accumulation ratio was approximately 2-fold.

The pharmacokinetic properties of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are displayed in Table 3.

The predicted Day 5 nirmatrelvir exposure parameters in adult subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were treated with PAXLOVID in EPIC-HR are presented in Table 4.

Effect of Food

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir were observed following administration of a high fat meal (800–1,000 calories; 50% fat) to healthy subjects.

There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir based on age (18 to 86 years), sex, or race/ethnicity.

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy. Data on use in pregnancy, including prescribing patterns and patient experience (adverse effects, incidence of rebound), are limited. We performed a cross-sectional study in which we surveyed a cohort of vaccinated pregnant or lactating individuals with breakthrough COVID-19. Of 35 pregnant respondents, 51.4% were prescribed and 34.3% took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; of these, 91.7% experienced dysgeusia and 50.0% had rebound (50.0% positive test result, 33.3% return of symptoms). Three of five lactating respondents were prescribed and two took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. There were no significant adverse outcomes. Unknown risk was the most common reason for declining nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. More research is needed to establish the safety of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in pregnancy and lactation, to improve public health messaging, and to increase uptake of this treatment.

We performed meta‐analyses according to the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2022). Forest plots were used to visualize meta‐analyses.

If clinical and methodological characteristics of individual studies were sufficiently homogeneous, we planned to pool the data in meta‐analyses. When meta‐analyses were feasible, we planned to use the random‐effects model as we assume that the intervention effects are related but might not be the same included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we performed meta‐analyses using the Mantel‐Haenszel method using a random‐effects model to calculate the summary (combined) intervention effect estimate as a weighted mean of the intervention effects estimated in the individual studies. For continuous outcomes, we planned to use the inverse‐variance method.

We planned to present descriptive statistics only, if we deemed meta‐analysis inappropriate for a certain outcome because of heterogeneity, or because of serious study limitations leading to considerably high risk of bias (e.g. competing risk of death not taken into account in outcome measurement). The current review included only one study with different subgroups.

We used RevMan Web for meta‐analysis and to calculate the effect estimate of the only included study (RevMan Web 2020).

### Effectiveness of molnupiravir vs nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a target trial emulation study [^111pXUKJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ongoing spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the need for effective antiviral treatments. Two oral antiviral drugs, molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) have shown promise as novel treatment options for adults with COVID-19 from phase III randomised controlled trials, namely the Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) trial and the Molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of COVID-19 in an Outpatient Setting (MOVe-OUT) trial. There is limited evidence directly comparing the effectiveness of these two antiviral treatments. Nevertheless, several clinical guidelines, including National Institutes of Health from US and National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia, recommend nirmatrelvir–ritonavir over molnupiravir, provided that patients do not have any contraindications to either drugs. Consequently, understanding their relative effectiveness profiles is crucial for informing public health policy and guiding clinical practice.

Abstract

Rebound of SARS-CoV-2 shedding or COVID-19 signs and symptoms has been described after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). The direct association of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to COVID-19 rebound remains unclear because most reports are based on individual cases or nonrandomized studies. Viral RNA shedding data from two phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients [EPIC-HR] and Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients [EPIC-SR]) were analyzed to investigate the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in COVID-19 rebound. Rates of rebound of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, identified based on an increase in nasopharyngeal viral RNA levels from day 5 (end-of-treatment) to day 10 or day 14, were similar between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and placebo recipients. Among subjects with a virologic response through day 5, viral RNA rebound occurred in 6.4%–8.4% of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir recipients and 5.9%–6.5% of placebo recipients across EPIC-HR and the 2021/pre-Omicron and 2022/Omicron enrollment periods of EPIC-SR. Viral RNA rebound after nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was not associated with COVID-19–related hospitalization or death. Data from randomized trials demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 rebound can occur with or without antiviral treatment, supporting the Food and Drug Administration's determination of safety and efficacy of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in eligible patients at high risk for severe COVID-19.

14.2	Trial in Unvaccinated Subjects Without a Risk Factor for Progression to Severe COVID-19 or Subjects Fully Vaccinated Against COVID-19 With at Least One Factor for Progression to Severe COVID-19 (EPIC-SR)

PAXLOVID is not indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients without a risk factor for progression to severe COVID-19.

EPIC-SR (NCT05011513) was a Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in non-hospitalized symptomatic adult subjects with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eligible subjects were 18 years of age or older with COVID-19 symptom onset of ≤ 5 days who were at standard risk for progression to severe disease. The trial included previously unvaccinated subjects with no risk factors for progression to severe disease or subjects fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (i.e., completed a primary vaccination series) with at least 1 of the risk factors for progression to severe disease as defined in EPIC-HR. Through the December 19, 2021, data cutoff, a total of 1,075 subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive PAXLOVID or placebo orally every 12 hours for 5 days; of these, 59% were fully vaccinated high-risk subjects.

The primary endpoint in this trial, the difference in time to sustained alleviation of all targeted COVID-19 signs and symptoms through Day 28 among PAXLOVID versus placebo recipients, was not met.

In an exploratory analysis of the subgroup of fully vaccinated subjects with at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease, a non-statistically significant numerical reduction relative to placebo for the secondary endpoint of COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28 was observed.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — nirmatrelvir/ritonavir other considerations state that the panel agreed the overall certainty of evidence for ambulatory treatment was low with limited study details and imprecision, and that the EUA did not report safety data; the panel agreed benefits are likely to outweigh potential harms in high‑risk patients, but drug interactions must be considered. The evidence confirms maximum benefit when used early in the disease process with high viral loads; it is critical to rapidly diagnose and treat ambulatory patients early, observational studies have shown a similar benefit among vaccinated patients infected with newer variants, and the panel recognized the need for additional evidence for hospitalized patients. According to the EUA, use may be associated with a risk of developing HIV resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV‑1 infection.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 rebounds following nirmatrelvir / ritonavir treatment [^112suYWK]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV-r) is an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and has been recommended in the treatment of nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19. In rare occasions, some patients experience virologic and symptomatic rebound after initial resolution, which we call COVID-19 rebound after NMV-r. Although COVID rebound can also occur after molnupiravir treatment or even no antiviral treatment, we have more serious concern about the rebound after NMV-r, which remains the most effective antiviral. Due to a lack of information about its frequency, mechanism, outcomes, and management, we conducted this review to provide comprehensive and updated information to address these questions. Based on the limited evidence, the incidence of COVID-19 rebound after NMV-r was less than 2%, and most cases developed 5–15 days after initiating NMV-r treatment. Almost all reported cases had mild symptoms, and the clinical condition gradually subsided without additional treatment. Overall, the clinical outcome was favorable, and only a small number of patients required emergency department visits or hospitalization. Regarding virologic rebound, culturable SARS-CoV-2 with possible transmission was observed, so re-isolation may be needed.

EPIC-HR (NCT04960202) was a Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in non-hospitalized symptomatic adult subjects with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eligible subjects were 18 years of age and older with at least 1 of the following risk factors for progression to severe disease: diabetes, overweight (BMI > 25), chronic lung disease (including asthma), chronic kidney disease, current smoker, immunosuppressive disease or immunosuppressive treatment, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, sickle cell disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, active cancer, medically-related technological dependence, or were 60 years of age and older regardless of comorbidities. Subjects with COVID-19 symptom onset of ≤ 5 days were included in the study. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) or placebo orally every 12 hours for 5 days. The trial excluded individuals with a history of prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination and excluded individuals taking any medications with clinically significant drug interactions with PAXLOVID. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28. The analysis was conducted in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set [all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 3 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment], the mITT1 analysis set (all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment), and the mITT2 analysis set (all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days).

Introduction

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid [Pfizer]) is an oral antiviral drug combination that targets a key SARS-CoV-2 protease enzyme. Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir was approved based on interim efficacy and safety data from the Evaluation of Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) trial, conducted before the emergence of the Omicron variant. In the trial, 2246 patients who were not vaccinated against COVID-19 were randomized to receive nirmatrelvir and ritonavir or placebo within 5 days of symptom onset. Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir reduced the primary composite end point of 28-day risk of death or COVID-19–related hospitalization by 5.6% absolute (88% relative) compared with placebo. By day 28, there were 0 deaths in the nirmatrelvir and ritonavir group and 12 in the placebo group. EPIC-HR reported numerically fewer serious adverse events but more suspected drug-related adverse events with nirmatrelvir and ritonavir than placebo.

Parallel to EPIC-HR, a further 1141 lower-risk adults were studied in a second trial known as EPIC-SR (called standard-risk). The manufacturer announced the closure of the trial in a June 14, 2022, media release, "due to a very low rate of hospitalization or death observed in the standard-risk patient population". Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir was not associated with reduced symptoms (the primary end point), and the media release reported a non–statistically significant reduction of 0.9% absolute (51% relative) in hospitalization or death. Peer-reviewed observational analysis has also shown COVID-19–related hospitalization or death from any cause was significantly lower with nirmatrelvir and ritonavir treatment, although by approximately half the magnitude reported in the EPIC-HR trial. Observational studies have demonstrated a benefit of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir treatment in higher risk individuals.

2.1	Important Dosage and Administration Information

PAXLOVID is nirmatrelvir tablets co-packaged with ritonavir tablets. There are three different dose packs available:

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 300 mg;100 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 150 mg;100 mg for patients with moderate renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir; ritonavir) co-packaged for oral use 300 mg;100 mg (Day 1) and 150 mg;100 mg (Days 2–5) for patients with severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Nirmatrelvir must be co-administered with ritonavir. Failure to correctly co-administer nirmatrelvir with ritonavir may result in plasma levels of nirmatrelvir that are insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]. Completion of the full 5-day treatment course and continued isolation in accordance with public health recommendations are important to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Viral RNA Rebound and Treatment-Emergent Substitutions

EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR were not designed to evaluate COVID-19 rebound; exploratory analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between PAXLOVID use and rebound in viral RNA shedding levels.

Post-treatment increases in SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding levels in nasopharyngeal samples were observed on Day 10 and/or Day 14 in a subset of PAXLOVID and placebo recipients in EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR, irrespective of COVID-19 symptoms. The frequency of detection of post-treatment viral RNA rebound varied according to analysis parameters, but was generally similar among PAXLOVID and placebo recipients. A similar or smaller percentage of placebo recipients compared to PAXLOVID recipients had nasopharyngeal viral RNA results < lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at all study timepoints in both the treatment and post-treatment periods.

In EPIC-HR, of 59 PAXLOVID-treated subjects identified with post-treatment viral RNA rebound and with available viral sequence data, treatment-emergent substitutions in Mpropotentially reducing nirmatrelvir activity were detected in 2 (3%) subjects, including E166V in 1 subject and T304I in 1 subject. Both subjects had viral RNA shedding levels < LLOQ by Day 14.

Post-treatment viral RNA rebound was not associated with the primary clinical outcome of COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28 following the single 5-day course of PAXLOVID treatment. The clinical relevance of post-treatment increases in viral RNA following PAXLOVID or placebo treatment is unknown.

Cross-Resistance

Cross-resistance is not expected between nirmatrelvir and remdesivir or any other anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents with different mechanisms of action (i.e., agents that are not Mproinhibitors).

Making new evidence underpinning an LSR publicly available: the Cochrane Review on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir

Pfizer's new drug combination of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) poses an excellent case for establishing an LSR with a standardised monthly search and study selection process. The antiviral drug combination aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thus decreasing hospitalisation and death. In light of the ongoing potential for evolving virus variants, limited effective therapies for the treatment of COVID‐19 and prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the outpatient setting, as well as global vaccination coverage issues, the role of effective oral therapies for patients at high risk of severe disease is of global interest.

Besides several ongoing trials of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for both treatment and post‐exposure prophylaxis being conducted by the pharmaceutical company itself, we expect many new investigator-initiated trials of the drug combination worldwide after its Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2021and its marketing authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in January 2022. Therefore, the Cochrane Review evaluating Pfizer's new antiviral was designed as an LSR with continuous monitoring of new and ongoing studies.

Kahale and colleagues recently proposed to document the search and selection process for each LSR update through tailored Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagrams. However, they do not address the lack of transparency between updates. To improve transparency between published updates of the review, we created an Excel spreadsheet — publicly accessible on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform and linked from the results section of the Cochrane Review — that details the living evidence surveillance process, enabling readers to easily track the progress of eligible studies, whether completed or ongoing.

Monthly searches for the LSR began on 11 April 2022, the day the protocol was published in the Cochrane Library. The information specialist (MIM) provides the author team with the search results the same day, having first removed duplicates as well as all previously screened records using EndNote. Two members of the author team then independently screen the search results in Covidence and document the outcomes of the selection process in the Excel spreadsheet. The data available in the publicly accessible OSF file are summarised in table 1.

At a crucial time with rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for 2 oral antivirals, molnupiravir (in persons aged ≥ 18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (in persons aged ≥ 12 years weighing ≥ 40 kg), for the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within 5 days of symptoms onset and given for 5 days' duration. This article reviews the 2 oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and formulary considerations.

A total of 2,113 subjects were randomized to receive either PAXLOVID or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 45 years; 51% were male; 71% were White, 15% were Asian, 9% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 4% were Black or African American, and 1% was missing or unknown; 41% were Hispanic or Latino; 67% of subjects had onset of symptoms ≤ 3 days before initiation of study treatment; 49% of subjects were serological negative at baseline; the mean (SD) baseline viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples was 4.71 log₁₀copies/mL (2.89); 27% of subjects had a baseline viral RNA of ≥ 10⁷ (log₁₀copies/mL); 6% of subjects either received or were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatment at the time of randomization and were excluded from the mITT and mITT1 analyses.

The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the PAXLOVID and placebo groups.

The proportions of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event were 2.0% in the PAXLOVID group and 4.2% in the placebo group.

Table 9 provides results of the primary endpoint in mITT1 analysis population. For the primary endpoint, the relative risk reduction in the mITT1 analysis population for PAXLOVID compared to placebo was 86% (95% CI: 72%, 93%).

Consistent results were observed in the mITT and mITT2 analysis populations.

Similar trends have been observed across subgroups of subjects (see Figure 1).

If clinical trials do indeed detect a signal, there should be a clear regulatory pathway to ensure that these drugs can be made accessible to patients, especially since there are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically for Long COVID. This might entail consideration of options like expanded access, fast-track designation, and breakthrough therapy designation to both encourage industry participation and increase access of pharmaceutical treatments to Long COVID patients.

In conclusion, while the case series findings are heterogeneous, we describe the use of long courses of Paxlovid as a potentially promising pharmaceutical treatment to support at least some people with Long COVID. These cases provide strong rationale for the ongoing study of antivirals for Long COVID to determine if, when, and how they should be used in this patient population.

### Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA rebound after nirmatrelvir / ritonavir treatment in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials-United States and international sites, 2021–2022 [^112F9XAa]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) * is a COVID-19 oral antiviral treatment consisting of nirmatrelvir, a SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro or 3C-like protease [3CL pro]) inhibitor, and ritonavir, a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Several reports have described patients who have experienced a rebound in SARS-CoV-2 detection or COVID-19 signs and symptoms after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, or without antiviral treatment. Identifying the direct contribution of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to the rebound phenomenon has been challenging. Other than limited analyses from the pharmaceutical sponsor of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir based on the Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) trial, conducted before SARS-CoV-2 Omicron emergence, reports of COVID-19 rebound are primarily based on individual cases and nonrandomized cohort studies. The lack of clarity and persistent concerns about COVID-19 rebound have reportedly contributed to reduced nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use. This analysis used data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate the frequency of rebound in SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding among outpatients with COVID-19 treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or placebo in two randomized, double-blind clinical trials.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and symptoms in adults with postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: the STOP-PASC randomized clinical trial [^116ExDUe]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID or post−COVID-19 condition, has affected millions of people worldwide and encompasses a variety of conditions and symptoms that can persist months to years with impact on quality of life and function. Evolving definitions, growing mechanistic understanding, and clinical heterogeneity present challenges to the diagnosis and treatment of PASC. There is an urgent need for evidence-based treatments for PASC but currently a paucity of published trials testing interventions that target underlying pathophysiology.,

SARS-CoV-2 virus or viral particle persistence is one of several proposed casual mechanisms for PASC. Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding for months in the upper respiratory tract and in the stool has been observed. Although no reservoir of live replicating virus has been identified in individuals with PASC, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or protein has been found to persist in various tissues such as blood, periodontal pockets, gastrointestinal tract, the central nervous system, and other anatomic sites. Residual viral presence may trigger ongoing inflammation and immune dysregulation, resulting in a diverse array of symptoms. Thus, antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 present a therapeutic avenue for investigation to address a potential root cause of PASC.

Some studies suggest that antivirals such as nirmatrelvir, molnupiravir, and remdesivir taken during the acute infection period may reduce the risk of select post−COVID-19 sequelae, while others demonstrate mixed results in different cohorts. Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro) preventing viral replication. Nirmatrelvir, in combination with low-dose ritonavir that slows nirmatrelvir metabolism via inhibition of CYP3A4 (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We and others have reported anecdotal cases of patients with PASC who noted improvement of symptoms after taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, but there are no published randomized clinical trials testing nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for treatment of PASC.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^116rYrc4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Ritonavir

Ritonavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 0, 15, 35, and 75 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (at 0, 25, 50, and 110 mg/kg/day) during organogenesis (on GD 6 through 17 in rats and GD 6 through 19 in rabbits). No evidence of teratogenicity due to ritonavir was observed in rats and rabbits at systemic exposures (AUC) 5 (rats) or 8 (rabbits) times higher than exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. Increased incidences of early resorptions, ossification delays, and developmental variations, as well as decreased fetal body weights were observed in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity, at systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 10 times higher than exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. In rabbits, resorptions, decreased litter size, and decreased fetal weights were observed at maternally toxic doses, at systemic exposures greater than 8 times higher than exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID. In a PPND study in rats, administration of 0, 15, 35, and 60 mg/kg/day ritonavir from GD 6 through PND 20 resulted in no developmental toxicity, at ritonavir systemic exposures greater than 10 times the exposure at the approved human dose of PAXLOVID.

### Efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid) for COVID-19: a rapid review and meta-analysis [^112T3Fua]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and Google Scholar were searched to identify the relevant evidence up to November 10, 2022. The reference lists of key studies were also scanned to find additional records. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Cochrane tools for assessing the risk of bias. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 3.0 was employed for data analysis. Twenty-three studies involving 314353 patients were included in the analysis. The findings of the meta-analysis showed a significant difference between the Paxlovid and no-Paxlovid groups in terms of mortality rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14–0.45), hospitalization rate (OR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.24–0.69), polymerase chain reaction negative conversion time (mean difference [MD] = -2.46; 95% CI: -4.31 to -0.61), and hospitalization or death rate (OR = 0.17; 95% CI: 0.06–0.46). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 rebound (OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.67–1.04), emergency department visit (OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.45–1.24), intensive care unit admission (OR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.13–1.01), and adverse events (OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 0.42–11.47). The results of the present study support the efficacy and safety of Paxlovid in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to investigate the COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid treatment.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^114Um6vB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Pfizer's new drug combination nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is a combination of the SARS‐CoV‐2 protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir, and ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV to enhance HIV protease inhibitors. Nirmatrelvir blocks the activity of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro protease, an enzyme needed for viral replication. In humans nirmatrelvir is metabolized by the P450 cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4. In order to remain active in the body for longer periods of time, nirmatrelvir is co‐administered with low‐dose ritonavir, to slow down the breakdown of nirmatrelvir (Pfizer 2021). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is to be administered orally within five days of symptom onset and taken twice daily for five days. Given the inactivation of CYP3A4 by ritonavir, a common enzyme in drug metabolism, ritonavir interferes with the metabolism of many drugs, can alter their plasma concentrations, and increase drug‐related adverse effects. The applicability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may thus be limited in some populations at high risk of severe COVID‐19, such as those with comorbidities requiring medications metabolized using the CYP3A4 enzyme. As 3CL pro, the substrate‐binding site is highly conserved among all coronaviruses and shares no homology with human proteases, a SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro antagonist will be highly specific to SARS‐CoV‐2 and less affected by virus mutations (Dai 2020) compared to antivirals binding to other sites, more prone to mutation.

### Efficacy and safety of paxlovid (nirmatrelvir / ritonavir) in the treatment of COVID-19: an updated meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112hQ6zw]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study is aimed to access the efficacy and safety outcomes for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients treated with Paxlovid. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, databases were used to retrieve articles from 1 January 2020 to 1 January 2023. Article screening, quality evaluation and data extraction were completed and cross-checked. The meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) were conducted using RevMan, StataMP, and TSA software. A total of 42 original articles were included. Overall meta-analysis results showed that for death, hospitalisation, death or hospitalisation, emergency department (ED) visit, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and extra oxygen requirement outcomes, every odds ratio (OR) was < 1 and p < 0.05. For rebound outcome, the OR was > 1 and p > 0.05. For adverse events (AEs) outcome, the OR was > 1 and p < 0.05. In conclusion, Paxlovid effectively reduced the risks of death, hospitalisation, death or hospitalisation, ED visit, ICU admission, and extra oxygen requirement. There was no significant statistical difference considering rebound, but people should pay attention to possible AEs. However, for rebound and AEs outcomes, observations in certain subgroups suggested conclusions contrary to the overall meta-analysis. Trial sequential analysis indicated these two outcomes have a risk of false negative or false positive conclusions, so additional original studies are needed for further validation.

### Comparing molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir efficacy and the effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in animal models [^116hRp46]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2 are underutilized. Two oral drugs, molnupiravir and paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), have received emergency use authorization. Initial trials suggested greater efficacy of paxlovid, but recent studies indicated comparable potency in older adults. Here, we compare both drugs in two animal models; the Roborovski dwarf hamster model for severe COVID-19-like lung infection and the ferret SARS-CoV-2 transmission model. Dwarf hamsters treated with either drug survive VOC omicron infection with equivalent lung titer reduction. Viral RNA copies in the upper respiratory tract of female ferrets receiving 1.25mg/kg molnupiravir twice-daily are not significantly reduced, but infectious titers are lowered by > 2log orders and direct-contact transmission is stopped. Female ferrets dosed with 20 or 100mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice-daily show 1–2log order reduction of viral RNA copies and infectious titers, which correlates with low nirmatrelvir exposure in nasal turbinates. Virus replication resurges towards nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment end and virus transmits efficiently (20mg/kg group) or partially (100mg/kg group). Prophylactic treatment with 20mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir does not prevent spread from infected ferrets, but prophylactic 5mg/kg molnupiravir or 100mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir block productive transmission. These data confirm reports of similar efficacy in older adults and inform on possible epidemiologic benefit of antiviral treatment.

### A mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 immunity predicts paxlovid rebound [^117Fs8Ci]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral medication targeting SARS-CoV-2, remains an important treatment for COVID-19. Initial studies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were performed in SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated patients without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, most individuals have now either been vaccinated and/or have experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. After nirmatrelvir/ritonavir became widely available, reports surfaced of "Paxlovid rebound", a phenomenon in which symptoms (and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity) would initially resolve, but after finishing treatment, symptoms and test positivity would return. We used a previously described parsimonious mathematical model of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to model the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. Model simulations show that viral rebound after treatment occurs only in vaccinated patients, while unvaccinated (SARS-COV-2 naïve) patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir do not experience any rebound in viral load. This work suggests that an approach combining parsimonious models of the immune system could be used to gain important insights in the context of emerging pathogens.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and symptoms in adults with postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection: the STOP-PASC randomized clinical trial [^114cMFVc]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study STOP-PASC was published by Linda N Geng and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Long COVID. In the STOP-PASC study, the trial question was: what is the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection? In the STOP-PASC study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the STOP-PASC study, the population was: 155 patients (92 female, 63 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with at least 3 months of moderate-to-severe post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 symptoms. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; severe liver disease; acute COVID-19 infection; receipt of COVID-19-specific treatment within 30 days, COVID-19 vaccination within 28 days or other vaccine within 14 days of randomization; receipt of medications interacting with the study drug. In the STOP-PASC study, the interventions were: n = 102 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (oral dose of 300/100 mg BID for 15 days) n = 53 placebo and ritonavir (matching oral placebo and ritonavir BID for 15 days). In the STOP-PASC study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in reduction in severity of 6 core COVID-19 symptoms including fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, body aches, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiovascular symptoms at 10 weeks (23.02% vs. 28%; AD -4.98%, 95% CI -10.18 to 0.22). In the STOP-PASC study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant decrease in Patient Global Impression of Change score at 10 weeks (3.38 points vs. 3.13 points; B 0.1, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.67) Borderline significant decrease in Patient Global Impression of Severity score at 10 weeks (4 points vs. 3.79 points; B 0.19, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.62) No significant difference in the percentage of patients experiencing relief at 10 weeks (32.4% vs. 41.5%; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.09). In the STOP-PASC study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the STOP-PASC study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with at least 3 months of moderate-to-severe post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 symptoms, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not superior to placebo and ritonavir with respect to reduction in severity of 6 core COVID-19 symptoms including fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, body aches, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiovascular symptoms at 10 weeks.

Table 6 describes the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on the Cmaxand AUCinfof other drugs.

In Vitro Studies

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes:

Nirmatrelvir is a reversible and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A, but not an inhibitor CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. Nirmatrelvir is an inducer of CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4, but there is minimal risk for pharmacokinetic interactions arising from induction of these CYP enzymes at the proposed therapeutic dose.
Ritonavir is a substrate of CYP2D6 and CYP3A. Ritonavir is an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP3A.

Transporter Systems: Nirmatrelvir is an inhibitor of P-gp and OATP1B1. Nirmatrelvir is a substrate for P-gp, but not BCRP, MATE1, MATE2K, NTCP, OAT1, OAT2, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, PEPT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, or OATP4C1.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also referred to as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) or nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) protease. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mprorenders it incapable of processing the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, preventing viral replication. Nirmatrelvir inhibited the activity of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Mproin a biochemical assay with a Kivalue of 3.1 nM and an IC50value of 19.2 nM. Nirmatrelvir was found to bind directly to the SARS-CoV-2 Mproactive site by X-ray crystallography.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^114dbEo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

All doses and regimens of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were eligible for this systematic review. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is authorized and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (EUA for Paxlovid ®) at a dose of 300 mg (as two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, given twice‐daily for five days.

We compared nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or to any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Co‐interventions (standard of care) must have been comparable between the study arms.

Types of outcome measures

We evaluated core outcomes in accordance with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative for COVID‐19 patients (COMET 2020; Marshall 2020), and additional outcomes that have been prioritized by consumer representatives and the German guideline panel for treatment of people with COVID‐19 (German AWMF Guideline 2021).

We used different outcome sets for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with COVID‐19 in the out‐ and inpatient setting, and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. If studies were eligible for inclusion regarding study design, population, intervention, and comparator, but no outcomes of interest have been reported, they were not included for meta‐analysis. However, we have summarized reported outcomes for all included studies in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table. We did not exclude studies if they did not report outcomes of interest.

### Nirmatrelvir / ritonavir regimen for mild / moderately severe COVID-19: a rapid review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1156eFEj]. Annals of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen for treatment of laboratory-confirmed mild/moderately severe COVID-19 remains unclear.

Methods

We systematically identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world studies (RWS; observational studies) of the efficacy/effectiveness and/or safety of the approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen for COVID-19. We pooled appropriate data (adjusted estimates for RWS) using an inverse variance, random-effects model. We calculated statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. Results are presented as relative risk (RR) with associated 95% CI. We further assessed risk of bias/study quality and conducted trial sequential analysis of the evidence from RCTs.

Results

We included 4 RCTs (4,070 persons) and 16 RWS (1,925,047 persons) of adults (aged ≥ 18 years). One and 3 RCTs were of low and unclear risk of bias, respectively. The RWS were of good quality. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir significantly decreased COVID-19 hospitalization compared with placebo/no treatment (RR = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.31; I² = 77.2%; 2 RCTs, 3,542 persons), but there was no significant difference for decrease of worsening severity (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.01; I² = 47.5%; 3 RCTs, 1,824 persons), viral clearance (RR = 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93–1.51; I² = 82%; 2 RCTs, 528 persons), adverse events (RR = 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92–2.14; I² = 70.6%; 4 RCTs, 4,070 persons), serious adverse events (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.41–1.62; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, 3,806 persons), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.04–1.70; I² = 49.9%; 3 RCTs, 3,806 persons), although trial sequential analysis suggested that the current total sample sizes for these outcomes were not large enough for conclusions to be drawn. Real-world studies also showed significantly decreased COVID-19 hospitalization (RR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.37–0.60; I² = 95.0%; 11 RWS, 1,421,398 persons) and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14–0.34; I² = 65%; 7 RWS, 286,131 persons) for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir compared with no treatment.

Conclusions

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir appears to be promising for preventing hospitalization and potentially decreasing all-cause mortality for persons with mild/moderately severe COVID-19, but the evidence is weak. More studies are needed.

### Independent FDA analyses of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir resistance in the phase 2 / 3 trials EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR [^114gbFEr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

PAXLOVID consists of nirmatrelvir, an inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro), copackaged with ritonavir, a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir received emergency use authorization in the United States in 2021 and was approved in 2023. However, there is limited published information on SARS-CoV-2 clinical resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Methods

To investigate SARS-CoV-2 resistance development to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in treated patients, we analyzed baseline and matching post-baseline SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing data from 1862 participants (912 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 950 placebo) in Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) and Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients (EPIC-SR), which were Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in participants with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Potential resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) were defined as those that were enriched in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated participants or occurred at Mpro positions of interest, defined using nonclinical data. SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases were analyzed to characterize temporal frequencies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS in circulating viruses.

Results

In EPIC-HR, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS included Mpro T21I (n = 1), E166V (n = 3), A173T (n = 1), and T304I (n = 1), with E166V being the clearest RAS observed. In EPIC-SR, no RAS were detected. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS were not associated with hospitalization or death. Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases did not reveal concerning increases in the frequencies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS over time.

Conclusions

In clinical trials, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was infrequent (< 0.3%-1.1%). Surveillance data currently indicate a low frequency of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS. Collectively, these results provide the most comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in the clinical setting to date. Viral sequences should continue to be closely monitored to identify the potential emergence of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-resistant variants.

Studies awaiting classification

Details are available in the Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table.

Three studies are currently awaiting classification (EPIC‐HOS; EPIC‐PEP 2021; EPIC‐SR 2021). One is investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir as PEP (EPIC‐PEP 2021), while the other two are investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir as treatment for people with weakened immune systems or at increased risk for poor outcomes who are hospitalized due to severe COVID‐19 (EPIC‐HOS) and for people at standard risk (EPIC‐SR 2021). All three studies were initiated and funded by Pfizer. One study has been completed without publication of results (EPIC‐PEP 2021), while the other two have been terminated either due to challenges related to the operational feasibility of the study, taking into account the current epidemiology and declining hospitalization rates for severe COVID‐19 (EPIC‐HOS), or due to a very low rate of hospitalization or death observed in the standard‐risk patient population (EPIC‐SR 2021). Results have not been posted for any of the studies.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus placebo-ritonavir in individuals with long COVID in the USA (PAX LC): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, decentralised trial [^117AacgS]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The substantial burden of post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID) underscores the need for effective pharmacological interventions. Given that viral persistence has been hypothesised as a potential cause of long COVID, antiviral therapy might offer a promising approach to alleviating long COVID symptoms. We therefore investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for treating long COVID.

Methods

In this phase 2, decentralised, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, adults (aged ≥ 18 years) from the 48 states across the contiguous USA, with previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and long COVID symptoms starting within 4 weeks of initial infection and persisting for at least 12 weeks, were eligible for inclusion. Key exclusion criteria were use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within the previous 2 months, CYP3A4-dependent medications, or strong CYP3A4 inducers; acute medical illness such as SARS-CoV-2 infection within the past 2 weeks; active liver disease; renal impairment; and immunocompromise. Using software for 1:1 stratified block random assignment, participants were randomly allocated to receive either two tablets of nirmatrelvir (150 mg each) and one tablet of ritonavir (100 mg), or placebo and one tablet of ritonavir (100 mg), orally administered twice daily for 15 days, stratified by age, sex at birth, and COVID-19 vaccination status. Participants, clinicians, and the study team were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Physical Health Summary Score (PHSS) from baseline to day 28, analysed by intention to treat. Safety endpoints were reported from baseline to week 6 in all participants who were exposed to the study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05668091) and is now closed to new participants.

Findings

Between April 14, 2023, and Feb 26, 2024, 119 participants were screened. 100 were enrolled (66 [66%] female participants and 34 [34%] male participants), with 49 assigned to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 51 to the placebo-ritonavir group (intention-to-treat population). Three participants in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and two in the placebo-ritonavir group withdrew before starting treatment and were excluded from the safety population. The mean PROMIS-29 PHSS at baseline was 39.6 (95% CI 37.4 to 41.9) in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 36.3 (34.4 to 38.2) in the placebo-ritonavir group. The adjusted change from baseline to day 28 was 0.45 (-0.93 to 1.83) in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 1.01 (-0.30 to 2.31) in the placebo-ritonavir group (adjusted mean difference -0.55 [95% CI -2.32 to 1.21; p = 0.54]). No deaths or serious adverse events were recorded between baseline and week 6. Study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in more participants in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group (35 [76%] of 46) compared with the placebo-ritonavir group (27 [55%] of 49), mostly driven by dysgeusia. Early treatment termination due to an adverse event occurred in two participants in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and one in the placebo-ritonavir group.

Interpretation

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir administered for 15 days did not significantly improve health outcomes in participants with long COVID compared with placebo-ritonavir at day 28. However, the study showed the feasibility of large-scale, decentralised trials in long COVID.

Discussion

Summary of main results

This Cochrane Review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating and preventing COVID‐19.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease

For people with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19, we identified one randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 2246 randomized participants with mild symptomatic COVID‐19 (WHO 2‐3) conducted in the outpatient setting comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care to standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease.

The study was assessed without concerns for research integrity.

The main findings of this review are summarized in Table 1. Briefly:

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may reduce all‐cause mortality at 28 days and clinical worsening assessed as admission to hospital or death within 28 days (low‐certainty evidence).
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may reduce serious adverse events during the study period (low‐certainty evidence); there were few serious adverse events other than hospitalization or death.
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir probably has little or no effect on any treatment‐emergent adverse events during the study period (moderate‐certainty evidence)
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir probably increases any treatment‐related adverse events during the study period (moderate‐certainty evidence); treatment‐related adverse events were mostly attributed to dysgeusia and diarrhoea.
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events (moderate‐certainty evidence).

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance. We identified four ongoing trials investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treatment of COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with mild disease.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir and molnupiravir for COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115XdbRb]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) with molnupiravir in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To end this, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and Google Scholar were systematically searched to collect relevant evidence up to February 15, 2023. The risk of bias was evaluated using the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions tool. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Eighteen studies involving 57659 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed a significant difference between nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir in terms of all-cause mortality rate (odds ratio [OR] = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44–0.67), all-cause hospitalization rate (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54–0.69), death or hospitalization rate (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.38–0.99), and negative polymerase chain reaction conversion time (mean difference = -1.55, 95% CI: -1.74 to -1.37). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of COVID-19 rebound (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.71–1.07). In terms of safety, although the incidence of any adverse events was higher in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.57–4.06), no significant difference was observed between the two treatments in terms of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.69–2.00). The present meta-analysis demonstrated the significant superiority of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir over molnupiravir in improving clinical efficacy in COVID-19 patients during the prevalence of Omicron variant. These findings, however, need to be further confirmed.

Certainty of the evidence

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings tables ranged from low to moderate for outpatients (Table 1), and was very low for inpatients (Table 2).

For outpatients, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis only including participants randomly assigned to study intervention who received one or greater more doses of study intervention and had one or more postbaseline visits by day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period; and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and SAEs during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19‐related hospitalizations.

For inpatients, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table for indirectness due to an atypical hospital population of mildly to moderately affected patients and twice for imprecision using the minimally contextualized approach.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing.

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116DuU1R]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 outpatient treatment for children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) should be considered for laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years, weigh ≥ 40 kg, and are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset; it may be administered with antiretrovirals, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption of or modification to the antiretroviral therapy. Remdesivir (Veklury) may be considered in the outpatient setting for children with HIV who are aged ≥ 28 days, weigh ≥ 3 kg, and are at high risk as defined by CDC, and remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset, but its use could be considered in children with HIV with severe immunosuppression who have had > 7 days of symptoms. For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged ≥ 12 years at high risk, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is the preferred treatment, but remdesivir may be considered if ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is unavailable or contraindicated.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of PAXLOVID is based on two Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in symptomatic adult subjects 18 years of age and older with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects in both studies received PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) or placebo every 12 hours for 5 days for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14)]:

Trial C4671005 (EPIC-HR) enrolled subjects who were at high risk for progression to severe disease.
Trial C4671002 (EPIC-SR) enrolled subjects who were at standard risk for progression to severe disease (previously unvaccinated subjects at standard risk or fully vaccinated subjects with at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease).

Adverse reactions were those reported while subjects were on study medication and through 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.

In Trial C4671005 (EPIC-HR), 1,038 subjects received PAXLOVID and 1,053 subjects received placebo. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% incidence in the PAXLOVID group and occurring at a greater frequency than in the placebo group) were dysgeusia (5% and < 1%, respectively) and diarrhea (3% and 2%, respectively).

### Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in children and adolescents aged 12–17 years following SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection: a target trial emulation [^115dDK4H]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, this target trial emulation study confirmed the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in reducing all-cause hospitalization risk among non-hospitalized paediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection. No safety signals were reported following outpatient nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use among paediatric patients aged 12–17 years. Further studies and the ongoing EPIC-Peds trialwill provide additional evidence on the clinical efficacy of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use in children and adolescents with COVID-19, and its safety will be confirmed by adverse drug reaction monitoring in the paediatric population.

Emerging treatments

As the virus becomes better understood, the therapeutic strategy against covid-19 develops. Over 2000 ongoing trials are currently assessing certain treatment strategies for covid-19. Recently, antiviraldrugs including molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been approved in the UK, US, and Europefor treating covid-19 in certain risk groups. Similarly, sotrovimab (Xevudy), a monoclonal antibody treatment, has recently been approved for use in treating certain patients with covid-19 in the UK, US, and Europe. These drugs have been shown to be effective at preventing poor clinical outcomes, including death, in those individuals vulnerable to severe covid-19 infection. Other drug treatments, such as janus kinase inhibitors, corticosteroids, and anti-inflammatory drugs, have contrasting evidence to support their use; therefore, the use of specific drugs is either recommended for or against by certain treatment and management guidelines, which are discussed below.

### Real-world effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in preventing coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization: a population-based cohort study in the province of Québec, Canada [^1163iEGg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has shown to reduce coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and death before the Omicron era, but updated real-world evidence studies are needed. The current study aimed to assess whether nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduces the risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization among high-risk outpatients.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-infected outpatients between 15 March and 15 October 2022, using data from the Québec clinico-administrative databases. Propensity score matching was used to compare infected outpatients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with those not receiving nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. The relative risk (RR) of COVID-19-associated hospitalization occurring within 30 days following the index date was assessed using a Poisson regression.

Results

A total of 14 756 treated outpatients were matched to controls. Regardless of vaccination status, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment was associated with a 74% reduced RR of hospitalization (RR, 0.26 [95% confidence interval [CI].23-.29]; number needed to treat [NNT, 15). The effect was more pronounced in outpatients with an incomplete primary vaccination course (RR, 0.13 [95% CI, .08-.20]; NNT, 9). Benefit was also found in those with a complete primary vaccination course (RR, 0.28 [95% CI, .25-.32]; NNT, 17) regardless of age and the delay since the last vaccination. Subgroups analysis among high-risk outpatients with a primary vaccination course showed that nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the RR of hospitalization in severely immunocompromised outpatients (RR, 0.28 [95% CI, .21-.36]; NNT, 7), regardless of the delay since the last vaccination.

Conclusions

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduces the risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization among incompletely and completely vaccinated high-risk outpatients, as well as immunocompromised individuals, regardless of age and the delay since the last vaccination.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We presented the main results of the review in summary of findings tables, including a rating of the certainty of evidence based on the GRADE approach. We followed current GRADE guidance as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Schünemann 2022).

Two review authors (SR, SW) assessed the certainty of evidence, considering risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias. We used the overall RoB 2 assessment and RoB sensitivity analysis to inform the risk of bias judgement underlying the assessment of the certainty of evidence.

We planned to create separate summary of findings tables for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with different intentions (e.g. treatment of people with COVID‐19 in out‐ and inpatient settings, prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as PEP, and prevention as PrEP), and for different comparisons with regard to the intervention and comparator. The summary of findings tables included the following outcomes.

For use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with intention to treat COVID‐19 in an outpatient setting.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are present in human breast milk in small amounts (less than 2%). In a clinical lactation study in 8 lactating women, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir were estimated to be present in human milk at a mean weight-normalized infant daily dose of 0.16 mg/kg/day (1.8% of maternal weight-adjusted daily dose) and 0.006 mg/kg/day (0.2% of maternal weight-adjusted daily dose), respectively (see Data).

There are no available data on the effects of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.

Data

In a clinical pharmacokinetics study, 8 healthy lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum were administered 3 oral doses every 12 hours (steady state dosing) of 300 mg/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The mean daily amount of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir recovered in breast milk was 0.752 mg and 0.027 mg, respectively, representing 0.13% and 0.014% of the corresponding administered daily maternal doses (unadjusted for weight). The estimated daily infant dose (assuming average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day), was 0.16 mg/kg/day and 0.006 mg/kg/day, 1.8% and 0.2% of the maternal dose, respectively, for nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The optimal dose of PAXLOVID has not been established in pediatric patients.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration of PAXLOVID can alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PAXLOVID. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy and review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy. (4, 5.1, 7, 12.3)

7.1	Potential for PAXLOVID to Affect Other Drugs

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir co-packaged with ritonavir) is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp and OATP1B1. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2]. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 2.

7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PAXLOVID

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2].

7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Table 2 provides a listing of clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor such as ritonavir.

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^113foMCY]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior case series suggest that a 5-day course of oral Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) benefits some people with Long COVID, within and/or outside of the context of an acute reinfection. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior case series of people with Long COVID who have attempted longer courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Methods

We documented a case series of 13 individuals with Long COVID who initiated extended courses (> 5 days; range: 7.5–30 days) of oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside (n = 11) of and within (n = 2) the context of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants reported on symptoms and health experiences before, during, and after their use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Results

Among those who take an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of the context of an acute infection, some experience a meaningful reduction in symptoms, although not all benefits persist. Others experience no effect on symptoms. One participant stopped early due to intense stomach pain. For the two participants who took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within the context of an acute reinfection, both report eventually returning to their pre-re-infection baseline.

Conclusions

Extended courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may have meaningful benefits for some people with Long COVID but not others. We encourage researchers to study how and why nirmatrelvir/ritonavir benefits some and what course length is most effective, with the goal of informing clinical recommendations for using nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and/or other antivirals as a potential treatment for Long COVID.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^113hqevS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Due to its novelty, there are currently few published study results. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) plus standard of care compared to standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses.

To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in‐between publication of review updates.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Scopus, and WHO COVID‐19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 11 July 2022.

This is a LSR. We conduct monthly update searches that are being made publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection criteria

Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in post‐exposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events.

We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially‐disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from LICs and LMICs, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main results

As of 11 July 2022, we included one RCT with 2246 participants in outpatient settings with mild symptomatic COVID‐19 comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care with standard of care plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, had a symptom onset of no more than five days before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease. Prohibited prior or concomitant therapies included medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance and CYP3A4 inducers.

We identified eight ongoing studies.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID‐19 in outpatient settings with asymptomatic or mild disease

For the specific population of unvaccinated, high‐risk patients nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care compared to standard of care plus placebo may reduce all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 11 deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to 0 deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low‐certainty evidence, and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; estimated absolute effect: 61 admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving placebo compared to eight admissions or deaths per 1000 people receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; low‐certainty evidence).

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably has little or no effect on treatment‐emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment‐related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to standard of care plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

No study results were identified for improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

Subgroup analyses for equity

Most study participants were younger than 65 years (87.1% of the: modified intention to treat (mITT1) population with 2085 participants), of white ethnicity (71.5%), and were from UMICs or HICs (92.1% of study centres). Data on comorbidities were insufficient.

The outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity: age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years) and ethnicity (Asian versus Black versus White versus others). There was no difference between subgroups of age. The effects favoured treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the White ethnic group. Estimated effects in the other ethnic groups included the line of no effect (RR = 1). No subgroups were reported for comorbidity status and World Bank country classification by income level. No subgroups were reported for other outcomes.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating COVID‐19 in inpatient settings with moderate to severe disease

No studies available.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (PrEP and PEP)

No studies available.

Authors' conclusions

There is low‐certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality and hospital admission or death based on one trial investigating unvaccinated COVID‐19 participants without previous infection that were at high risk and with symptom onset of no more than five days. There is low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is safe in people without prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4.

Regarding equity aspects, except for ethnicity, no differences in effect size and direction were identified.

No evidence is available on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to treat hospitalized people with COVID‐19 and to prevent a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

We will continually update our search and make search results available on OSF.

Inclusion criteria

We performed study selection in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Lefebvre 2022). Three review authors (SR, RK, and SW) independently screened titles and abstracts of identified records. We retrieved full‐text articles and independently assessed eligibility of the remaining records against the predefined eligibility criteria. We resolved discrepancies through discussion between the review authors. We included studies irrespective of whether measured outcome data were reported in a 'usable' way. We collated multiple reports of the same study, so that the study, rather than the report, was the unit of interest in the review.

### Alleviation of COVID-19 symptoms and reduction in healthcare utilization among high-risk patients treated with nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (NMV / R): a phase 3 randomized trial [^111kDcUq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

More than 775 million cumulative cases and 7.0 million deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported globally. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated ≥ 97% of adults have antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through vaccination, infection, or both. Despite this, severe illness from infection remains a serious public health threat. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r) is the first and only US Food and Drug Administration–approved oral treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults at high risk of progression to severe disease, and reduces hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

Severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death. During the pandemic years, COVID-19‒related healthcare resource strains, such as limitations in emergency department, hospital, and ICU space, negatively affected healthcare and public health infrastructures. Patients with less severe disease may experience COVID-19 symptoms that interfere with daily functioning and activities. In addition to the key goal of preventing progression to severe disease, accelerating symptom recovery is a potential therapeutic goal as described in the National Institutes of Health therapeutic management guidelines for nonhospitalized patients; this is a particularly relevant efficacy outcome for patients given the declining rate of severe COVID-19.

Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) was a phase 2/3 study that assessed NMV/r in nonhospitalized adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 at increased risk of progression to severe disease. Data from EPIC-HR showed NMV/r was safe and effective, with an 89% and 88% relative risk reduction (RRR) against COVID-19‒related hospitalization or all-cause mortality through day 28 when treatment was initiated within 3 or 5 days of symptom onset, respectively. Final study results of the primary endpoint, which include data collected through week 24, and subgroup analyses are also reported. Here, we report additional efficacy endpoints from EPIC-HR, including key secondary and other supportive endpoints (eg, time to sustained alleviation and resolution of COVID-19 symptoms) from the prespecified sequential hypothesis testing.

### Azvudine versus paxlovid in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117UPHFm]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of azvudine versus nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The researchers conducted searches on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and Google Scholar until January 2024. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was utilised to evaluate the quality of the included studies, and data analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Thirteen studies, including 4949 patients, were analysed. The meta-analysis results showed no significant difference between the azvudine and Paxlovid groups in terms of mortality rate (odds rate [OR] = 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59–1.21), negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conversion time (standard mean difference [SMD] = 1.52, 95% CI: -1.07–4.11), and hospital stay (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -1.12–0.33). However, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of intensive care unit admission (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23–0.75) and the need for mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44–0.86) in favour of azvudine. The incidence of adverse events in the azvudine group was significantly lower (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.43–0.99). The certainty of evidence was rated as low and moderate. Azvudine and Paxlovid demonstrated similar effectiveness in reducing mortality rates, negative PCR conversion time and hospital stay. However, azvudine showed better effectiveness in improving other outcomes. Regarding the level of certainty of evidence, further research is needed to validate or challenge these results.

### Molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir plus usual care versus usual care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^111NfRos]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The study RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) was published by RECOVERY Collaborative Group. and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Lancet Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the trial question was: what is the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19? In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the population was: 137 patients (60 female, 77 male). The inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were first trimester of pregnancy; severe liver impairment; severe renal impairment; receipt of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir during current illness; receipt of a concomitant medication with CYP3A4 dependent metabolism risking a severe drug-drug interaction. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the interventions were: n = 68 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (at a dose of 300 mg/100 mg PO BID for 5 days plus standard of care) n = 69 usual care (standard of care only). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at day 28 (19% vs. 19%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.23). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of discharged alive within 28 days (71% vs. 78%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.2) No significant difference in invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 19%; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.08) No significant difference in receipt of ventilation (8% vs. 17%; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.33). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the conclusion was: in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not superior to usual care with respect to death at day 28.

### Pragmatic and open science-based solution to a current problem in the reporting of living systematic reviews [^115nDvoT]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Living systematic reviews (LSRs) are an increasingly common approach to keeping reviews up to date, in which new relevant studies are incorporated as they become available, so as to inform healthcare policy and practice in a timely manner. While journal publishers have been exploring the publication of LSRs using different updating and publishing approaches, readers cannot currently assess if the evidence underpinning a published LSR is up to date, as neither the search details, the selection process, nor the list of identified studies is made available between the publication of updates. We describe a new method to transparently report the living evidence surveillance process that occurs between published LSR versions. We use the example of the living Cochrane Review on nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir (Paxlovid) for preventing and treating COVID-19 to illustrate how this can work in practice. We created a publicly accessible spreadsheet on the Open Science Framework platform, linking to the living Cochrane Review, that details the search and study selection process, enabling readers to track the progress of eligible ongoing or completed studies. Further automation of the evidence surveillance process should be explored.

Discussion

Summary of main results

This Cochrane Review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating and preventing COVID‐19.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with asymptomatic or mild COVID‐19 in outpatient settings

For people with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19, we identified one RCT with 2246 randomized participants with mild symptomatic COVID‐19 (WHO 2 to 3) conducted during the Delta wave in the outpatient setting comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC plus placebo. Trial participants were unvaccinated, without previous confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, had a symptom onset of five days or less before randomization, and were at high risk for progression to severe disease.

The study was assessed without concerns for research integrity.

The main findings of this review are summarized in Table 1.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may reduce all‐cause mortality at 28 days and clinical worsening assessed as admission to hospital or death within 28 days (low‐certainty evidence).
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may reduce SAEs during the study period (low‐certainty evidence); there were few SAEs other than hospitalization or death.
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir probably has little or no effect on any TEAEs during the study period (moderate‐certainty evidence)
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir probably increases any TRAEs during the study period (moderate‐certainty evidence); TRAEs were mostly attributed to dysgeusia and diarrhoea.
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to AEs (moderate‐certainty evidence).

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance. We identified four ongoing trials investigating nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treatment of people with mild COVID‐19 in outpatient settings.

### Recommendations for the management of drug-drug interactions between the COVID-19 antiviral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid) and comedications [^113tiAj8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been granted authorization or approval in several countries for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at high risk of progression to severe disease and with no requirement for supplemental oxygen. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir will be primarily administered outside the hospital setting as a 5-day course oral treatment. The ritonavir component boosts plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir through the potent and rapid inhibition of the key drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, even given as a short treatment course, has a high potential to cause harm from drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with other drugs metabolized through this pathway. Options for mitigating risk from DDIs with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are limited due to the clinical illness, the short window for intervention, and the related difficulty of implementing clinical monitoring or dosage adjustment of the comedication. Pragmatic options are largely confined to preemptive or symptom-driven pausing of the comedication or managing any additional risk through counseling. This review summarizes the effects of ritonavir on drug disposition (i.e., metabolizing enzymes and transporters) and discusses factors determining the likelihood of having a clinically significant DDI. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive list of comedications likely to be used in COVID-19 patients which are categorized according to their potential DDI risk with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. It also discusses recommendations for the management of DDIs which balance the risk of harm from DDIs with a short course of ritonavir, against unnecessary denial of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment.

### Who needs paxlovid in 2024? [^112uWb3t]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

As another COVID-19 summer surge hit the US this year, many infected people likely were prescribed the antivirals nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, better known as Paxlovid, for the first time. Or for the fourth time. Or somewhere in between. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the only approved oral therapy for COVID-19, is recommended for treating mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections among people who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. This includes people aged 50 years or older, especially those 65 years or older, as well as younger individuals who have any of a long list of comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19.

### Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus azvudine for adult inpatients with severe or critical COVID-19 [^114i5XAZ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

In China, both nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) and azvudine have been granted approval to treat adult SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with moderate symptoms. Information about the clinical effect of the two available agents among inpatients with severe or critical COVID-19 is scarce.

Purpose

To compare the clinical outcomes of Paxlovid and azvudine among adult inpatients with severe or critical COVID-19.

Method

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in two large medical centres after the epidemic control measures were lifted in China. A new propensity score matched-inverse probability of treatment weighting cohort was constructed to evaluate the in-hospital all-cause mortality, hospital length of stay, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and safety.

Results

A total of 955 individuals were in the cohort. The antiviral therapy strategies were decided by the senior physician and the supplies of the pharmacy. A total of 451 patients were in the Paxlovid group, and 504 patients were in the azvudine group. Compared with Paxlovid, the effects of azvudine on in-hospital all-cause mortality were not significantly different, and the OR (95% CI) was 1.084 (0.822 to 1.430), and the average hospital length of stay of patients discharged alive was also similar in the azvudine group, and the difference (day) and (95% CI) was 0.530 (−0.334 to 1.393). After 7 days of therapy, the degree of decline in the SOFA score was greater in the Paxlovid group than in the azvudine group (p < 0.001). The change in glomerular filtration rate was not significantly different (p = 0.824).

Conclusion

Paxlovid and azvudine had similar effectiveness on in-hospital all-cause mortality and hospital length of stay. Compared with the azvudine group, after 7 days of therapy, the degree of decline in SOFA score was significantly higher in the Paxlovid group. These findings need to be verified in larger prospective studies or randomised controlled trials.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^112ibFZG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. It remains to be evaluated for which indications and patient populations the drug is suitable.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 or preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

To explore equity aspects in subgroup analyses.

To keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review (LSR) approach and make new relevant studies available to readers in‐between publication of review updates.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register, Scopus, and World Health Organization COVID‐19 Research Database, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions and incorporating studies up to 15 May 2023.

This is a LSR. We conduct update searches every two months and make them publicly available on the open science framework (OSF) platform.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or any other intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID‐19 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity or treatment setting, and for prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

We screened all studies for research integrity. Studies were ineligible if they had been retracted, or if they were not prospectively registered including appropriate ethics approval.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology and used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: 1. to treat outpatients with mild COVID‐19; 2. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID‐19: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, quality of life, (serious) adverse events, and viral clearance; 3. to prevent SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in postexposure prophylaxis (PEP); and 4. pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) scenarios: SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, development of COVID‐19 symptoms, mortality, admission to hospital, quality of life, and (serious) adverse events.

We explored inequity by subgroup analysis for elderly people, socially‐disadvantaged people with comorbidities, populations from low‐income countries and low‐ to middle‐income countries, and people from different ethnic and racial backgrounds.

Main results

As of 15 May 2023, we included two RCTs with 2510 participants with mild and mild to moderate symptomatic COVID‐19 in outpatient and inpatient settings comparing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo. All trial participants were without previous confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and at high risk for progression to severe disease. Randomization coincided with the Delta wave for outpatients and Omicron wave for inpatients. Outpatient trial participants and 73% of inpatients were unvaccinated. Symptom onset in outpatients was no more than five days before randomisation and prior or concomitant therapies including medications highly dependent on CYP3A4 were not allowed.

We excluded two studies due to concerns with research integrity. We identified 13 ongoing studies. Three studies are currently awaiting classification.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with asymptomatic or mild COVID‐19 in outpatient settings

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC plus placebo may reduce all‐cause mortality at 28 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.68; 1 study, 2224 participants; low‐certainty evidence) and admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; 1 study, 2224 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC may reduce serious adverse events during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41; 1 study, 2224 participants; low‐certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably has little or no effect on treatment‐emergent adverse events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and probably increases treatment‐related adverse events such as dysgeusia and diarrhoea during the study period compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.95; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC probably decreases discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events compared to SoC plus placebo (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; 1 study, 2224 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

No studies reported improvement of clinical status, quality of life, or viral clearance.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with moderate to severe COVID‐19 in inpatient settings

We are uncertain whether nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC compared to SoC reduces all‐cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.86; 1 study, 264 participants; very low‐certainty evidence), or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.58; 1 study, 264 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and 14 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.20; 1 study, 264 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

No studies reported improvement or worsening of clinical status and quality of life. We did not include data for safety outcomes due to insufficient and inconsistent information.

Subgroup analyses for equity

For outpatients, the outcome 'admission to hospital or death' was investigated for equity regarding age (less than 65 years versus 65 years or greater) and ethnicity. There were no subgroup differences for age or ethnicity.

For inpatients, the outcome 'all‐cause mortality' was investigated for equity regarding age (65 years or less versus greater than 65 years). There was no difference between subgroups of age.

No further equity‐related subgroups were reported, and no subgroups were reported for other outcomes.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (PrEP and PEP)

No studies available.

Authors' conclusions

Low‐certainty evidence suggests nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduces the risk of all‐cause mortality and hospital admission or death in high‐risk, unvaccinated COVID‐19 outpatients infected with the Delta variant of SARS‐CoV‐2. There is low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence of the safety of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Very low‐certainty evidence exists regarding the effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on all‐cause mortality and viral clearance in mildly to moderately affected, mostly unvaccinated COVID‐19 inpatients infected with the Omicron variant of SARS‐CoV‐2. Insufficient and inconsistent information prevents the assessment of safety outcomes.

No reliable differences in effect size and direction were found regarding equity aspects.

There is no available evidence supporting the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

We are continually updating our search and making search results available on the OSF platform.

### Comparing molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir efficacy and the effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in animal models [^112XEg4q]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Prolonged self-isolation periods after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test impose considerable social hardship on the individual patient and economic burden on societies –, which has resulted in eroding public compliance with self-quarantine during the course of the pandemic. In addition to direct therapeutic benefit, pharmacologically shortening the duration of the infectious period will improve patient quality of life and may provide epidemiologic benefit through interruption of viral transmission chains. We have established efficient suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the ferret model by molnupiravir dosed at 5 mg/kg b.i.d. and experimental nucleoside analog antiviralsin previous work, and demonstrated in this study that therapeutic administration of 1.25 mg/kg molnupiravir or 100 mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to ferrets fully or partially, respectively, suppressed transmission to untreated direct contacts. At these dose levels, either drug reduced shed infectious viral titers to ~10³ TCID₅₀ units/ml nasal lavage fluid, which appears to represent a threshold for productive direct-contact SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the ferret model. SARS-CoV-2 transmitted in all pairs of the 20 mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir group, which reduced viral titers to ~10⁴ TCID₅₀ units/ml nasal lavage fluid, indicating that infectious viral titer in the ferret upper respiratory tract is a correlate for transmission success.

Whole genome sequencing of virus populations isolated from paxlovid-experienced ferrets provided no evidence that replication resurgence and transmission both from and to paxlovid-treated animals in our study were supported by emerging resistance to nirmatrelvir –. Rather, poor control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in ferrets coincided with significantly lower nirmatrelvir levels in the upper respiratory tract than lung and other soft tissues but brain, identifying nasal turbinates as a privileged organ of low nirmatrelvir exposure. This effect could be ferret-specific, since tissue drug exposure levels cannot be readily determined in humans. However, rebounding virus replication in paxlovid recipients, and the lack of efficacy in patients < 65 years of age, in which SARS-CoV-2 infection resides primarily in the upper respiratory tract, are consistent with low nirmatrelvir exposure also in human upper respiratory tissues.

Clinical Antiviral Activity

In clinical trial EPIC-HR, which enrolled subjects who were primarily infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, PAXLOVID treatment was associated with a 0.83 log₁₀copies/mL greater median decline in viral RNA shedding levels in nasopharyngeal samples through Day 5 (mITT1 analysis set, all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days who at baseline did not receive nor were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic mAb treatment); similar results were observed in the mITT2 analysis set (all treated subjects with onset of symptoms ≤ 5 days). In the EPIC-SR trial, which included subjects who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta (79%) or Omicron (19%) variants, PAXLOVID treatment was associated with a 1.05 log₁₀copies/mL greater median decline in viral RNA shedding levels in nasopharyngeal samples through Day 5, with similar declines observed in subjects infected with Delta or Omicron variants. The degree of reduction in viral RNA levels relative to placebo following 5 days of PAXLOVID treatment was similar between unvaccinated high-risk subjects in EPIC-HR and vaccinated high-risk subjects in EPIC-SR.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of PAXLOVID include subjects 65 years of age and older and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Of the total number of subjects in the integrated dataset consisting of EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR who were randomized to and received PAXLOVID (N = 1,578), 165 (10%) were 65 years of age and older and 39 (2%) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Renal impairment increases nirmatrelvir exposure, which may increase the risk of PAXLOVID adverse reactions. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min). Reduce the PAXLOVID dosage in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min). Reduce the PAXLOVID dose and dose frequency in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min), including those requiring hemodialysis. On days when patients undergo hemodialysis, the PAXLOVID dose should be administered after hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of PAXLOVID is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment, therefore, PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^112YFkqh]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

We report on the results of 13 cases who had Long COVID at the time of taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Cases 1–11 (Tables 1 and 2) took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir while negative for SARS-CoV-2, outside of the context of an acute infection; Cases 12–13 (Table 3) did so while positive for SARS-CoV-2, in the context of an acute refinfection. We also report SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history; unless otherwise noted, vaccination did not affect patients' Long COVID symptoms and patients reported no more than temporary side effects.

Table 1
Summary of cases who took extended courses of Paxlovid outside the context of an acute re-infection and experienced any improvement

For individuals indicated as having short-term improvements but not sustained improvements, this means that any improvements observed eventually dissipated. For case 4, he started valacyclovir one day before he started the long course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, so it is difficult to determine if the benefits are due to nirmaltrelvir/ritonavir, valacyclovir, or both.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^115oLxGu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

All doses and regimens of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were eligible for this systematic review. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is authorized and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at a dose of 300 mg (as two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, given twice‐daily for five days (EUA for Paxlovid).

We compared nirmatrelvir/ritonavir plus SoC to SoC with or without placebo, or to any other intervention for treating COVID‐19 and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We planned to investigate different active comparators in separate comparisons. Co‐interventions (SoC) must have been comparable between the study arms.

Types of outcome measures

We evaluated core outcomes in accordance with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative for people with COVID‐19 (COMET 2020; Marshall 2020), and additional outcomes that have been prioritized by consumer representatives and the German guideline panel for treatment of people with COVID‐19 (German AWMF Guideline 2021).

We used different outcome sets for the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for treating people with COVID‐19 in the out‐ and inpatient setting, and for preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. If studies were eligible for inclusion regarding study design, population, intervention, and comparator, but no outcomes of interest were reported, they were not included for meta‐analysis. However, we summarized reported outcomes for all included studies in the Characteristics of included studies table. We did not exclude studies if they did not report outcomes of interest.

### Prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at risk for progression to severe disease [^113NKrsB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The availability of outpatient treatment options for COVID-19, such as nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and monoclonal antibodies, raises hopes for reducing COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality. Among these options, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid)may be preferred for most high-risk patients because of the convenience of oral dosing and its high efficacy vs placebo in reducing hospitalization or death, as reported in a phase 2/3 trial.

However, there are circumstances in which nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should not be used, due to the effect of ritonavir. Ritonavir may elevate the concentrations of drugs highly dependent on hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) metabolism, potentially resulting in serious reactions. Conversely, coadministration with potent CYP3A inducers can significantly reduce nirmatrelvir concentrations, potentially leading to the loss of virologic response. Furthermore, patients with severe kidney impairment and severe liver impairment were excluded from the clinical trials. These medical contraindications may be prevalent in patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease, as suggested by a recent study.

We examined the prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We hypothesized that the rate would be high in these patients.

Description of the intervention

Pfizer's drug combination nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) aims to avoid severe COVID‐19 in asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms, thereby decreasing hospitalization and death. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is a combination of the SARS‐CoV‐2 protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir, and ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV to enhance HIV protease inhibitors. Nirmatrelvir blocks the activity of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro protease, an enzyme needed for viral replication. In humans, nirmatrelvir is metabolized by the P450 cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4. In order to remain active in the body for longer periods of time, nirmatrelvir is co‐administered with low‐dose ritonavir, to slow down the breakdown of nirmatrelvir (Pfizer 2021). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is to be administered orally within five days of symptom onset and taken twice daily for five days. Given the inactivation of CYP3A4 by ritonavir, a common enzyme in drug metabolism, ritonavir interferes with the metabolism of many drugs, can alter their plasma concentrations, and increase drug‐related adverse effects. The applicability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may thus be limited in some populations at high risk of severe COVID‐19, such as those with comorbidities requiring medications metabolized using the CYP3A4 enzyme. As 3CL pro, the substrate‐binding site is highly conserved among all coronaviruses and shares no homology with human proteases, a SARS‐CoV‐2‐3CL pro antagonist will be highly specific to SARS‐CoV‐2 and less affected by virus mutations (Dai 2020) compared to antivirals binding to other sites, more prone to mutation.

Certainty of the evidence

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings table ranged from low to moderate (Table 1).

We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis only including participants randomly assigned to study intervention who took ≥ 1 dose of study intervention and had ≥ 1 post‐baseline visits through day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and serious adverse events during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19 related hospitalizations.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing.

We identified no study results reporting on improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.
