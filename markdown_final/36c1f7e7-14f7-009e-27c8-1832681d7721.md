## Question

What is the best way to taper off lexapro 10mg when starting Prozac 10mg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to safely and effectively taper off escitalopram (Lexapro) 10 mg while starting fluoxetine (Prozac) 10 mg, with attention to minimizing withdrawal and serotonin syndrome risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics and interaction risks. Then, I should verify the evidence base for tapering and switching strategies. Next, I will outline a practical cross-taper plan with monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations, contingencies if symptoms emerge, and a concise summary algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic context and risks. Escitalopram has a relatively short half-life of about 27–32 hours, which increases vulnerability to discontinuation symptoms if stopped abruptly, whereas fluoxetine has a long half-life of 2–4 days with an active metabolite lasting 1–2 weeks, which buffers withdrawal but also prolongs serotonergic exposure during overlap, raising serotonin syndrome risk when combined with another SSRI [^1163Dsib] [^117JzueZ] [^1153SxFf].

> Wait, let me verify the interaction risk before proposing any overlap. Concomitant use of escitalopram and fluoxetine increases the risk or severity of serotonin syndrome, so any cross-taper must be cautious, time-limited, and closely monitored for mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms; patients should be counseled to report emergent symptoms promptly [^113kAKue].

> I need to check the evidence base for switching strategies. There is no definitive, high-credibility algorithm for SSRI-to-SSRI switching; expert reviews and pediatric guidelines suggest that tapering the first SSRI before starting the second is the most conservative approach, while cross-tapering may avoid withdrawal but requires close monitoring; a randomized study found little advantage of a 14-day taper over a 3-day taper when switching, underscoring that half-life and patient factors drive symptoms more than taper duration alone [^115xUtB1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about taper speed. I initially thought a 2–4 week taper would suffice based on conventional guidance, but I should double-check newer data. A high-credibility review argues that short tapers to minimum therapeutic doses often fail to mitigate withdrawal and that hyperbolic, very slow tapers down to subtherapeutic doses over months reduce discontinuation symptoms; however, this pertains to discontinuation without overlap, so I must balance this against the added serotonergic risk of overlapping SSRIs and individualize the plan [^1178DTWU].

> Let me outline a pragmatic, moderate cross-taper that balances withdrawal prevention with safety. Week 1: reduce escitalopram to 5 mg daily and start fluoxetine 10 mg daily, with explicit serotonin syndrome counseling and a 48–72 hour check-in. Week 2: continue escitalopram 5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg, reassessing tolerability and mood. Week 3: stop escitalopram and maintain fluoxetine 10 mg, then reassess efficacy and tolerability at 4–6 weeks to decide on dose optimization. This approach limits overlap to about 2–3 weeks and keeps both agents at conservative doses during the transition [^116YWLng].

> I should confirm monitoring priorities. During the overlap and for 2–4 weeks after the last escitalopram dose, monitor for serotonin syndrome (mental status, autonomic changes, neuromuscular features), withdrawal symptoms (dizziness, nausea, sensory disturbances, anxiety, insomnia), and clinical status (mood, anxiety, suicidality), with patient education and a low threshold to pause the taper or adjust the plan if symptoms emerge [^111DUEQ5] [^117JzueZ] [^113kAKue].

> But wait, what if withdrawal symptoms appear despite a gradual taper. If discontinuation symptoms occur, I should verify whether they reflect withdrawal versus relapse; withdrawal typically begins within days, includes somatic and sensory symptoms, and responds quickly to reinstating the prior SSRI dose, whereas relapse evolves more slowly. If withdrawal is confirmed, consider slowing the taper further, using liquid formulations or pill splitting for finer decrements, or very briefly reinstating escitalopram and then retrying the taper more slowly, while avoiding unnecessary dose escalations that could worsen serotonergic toxicity [^116Mfi2x] [^1178DTWU] [^1163Dsib].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In older adults, start lower and go slower; consider escitalopram 5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg with gentler titration and longer observation. In hepatic impairment, reduce escitalopram to 5–10 mg max and use lower fluoxetine doses. In pregnancy, avoid tapering before delivery for risk of relapse; if switching is necessary, coordinate with obstetrics and pediatrics for neonatal monitoring given neonatal adaptation risk with SSRIs [^111Wtsxq] [^115DvZFv] [^1174RPGD].

> Let me reconsider the cross-taper versus washout trade-off. If the patient has a history of severe withdrawal, is highly sensitive to serotonergic side effects, or is on interacting medications, a conservative washout with a 1–2 week taper of escitalopram followed by a 1–2 week washout before starting fluoxetine may be safer, albeit with a short period of no serotonergic coverage; conversely, if rapid continuity is critical and the patient is reliable for monitoring, the brief cross-taper above is reasonable with explicit safety counseling [^112jofy1].

> I should double-check the final algorithm to ensure internal consistency. The best-supported approach is a patient-centered, cross-taper switch: reduce escitalopram to 5 mg while starting fluoxetine 10 mg for 2–3 weeks, then stop escitalopram and continue fluoxetine, with close monitoring for serotonin syndrome and withdrawal; if withdrawal emerges, slow the taper or briefly reinstitute escitalopram and retry; if serotonin toxicity is suspected, stop the offending agent and treat supportively, and if uncertainty remains, favor the more conservative washout strategy tailored to risk and urgency [^116YWLng] [^111DUEQ5] [^1178DTWU].

The best way to taper off Lexapro 10 mg when starting Prozac 10 mg is to **cross-taper over 2–4 weeks** [^notfound] to minimize withdrawal and serotonin syndrome risk [^114vVLXR]. Reduce Lexapro to 5 mg for 1–2 weeks while starting Prozac 10 mg, then stop Lexapro and continue Prozac 10 mg, monitoring for withdrawal and serotonin toxicity [^111DUEQ5]. If withdrawal symptoms occur, slow the taper or briefly resume the prior Lexapro dose and retaper more slowly [^1166tbGg]. Avoid abrupt stops and alternate-day dosing, and monitor closely throughout [^1178DTWU] [^1176yG9V].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

- **Half-life differences**: Lexapro has a shorter half-life (~27–32 hours) than Prozac (~2–4 days, with active metabolite ~7–15 days), so abrupt Lexapro cessation risks withdrawal; Prozac's long half-life buffers withdrawal during a cross-taper [^1163Dsib] [^117JzueZ].

- **Interaction risk**: Combining SSRIs increases serotonin syndrome risk; monitor for agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, tremor, and hyperreflexia [^114vVLXR] [^111DUEQ5].

- **Clinical evidence**: Cross-tapering is commonly used and supported by guidelines to balance withdrawal prevention with safety; no definitive superiority of cross-taper vs washout is established, so monitor closely [^116YWLng] [^112jofy1].

---

## Recommended tapering strategy

| **Week** | **Lexapro (escitalopram)** | **Prozac (fluoxetine)** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Week 1 | 10 mg → 5 mg daily | Start 10 mg daily | - Monitor for withdrawal and serotonin symptoms <br/> - Consider 5 mg Lexapro if 10 mg is not tolerated [^1166tbGg] |
| Week 2 | Continue 5 mg daily | Continue 10 mg daily | Adjust pace if withdrawal or adverse effects occur [^1166tbGg] |
| Week 3 | Discontinue Lexapro | Continue 10 mg daily | - Monitor for withdrawal <br/> - Reassess mood and anxiety [^1166tbGg] |
| Week 4+ | Off Lexapro | Continue 10 mg daily | Titrate Prozac after 4–6 weeks if needed [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical monitoring and patient counseling

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: dizziness, nausea, sensory disturbances, anxiety, insomnia; typically resolve within 1–2 weeks but can persist [^116Mfi2x] [^1163Dsib].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: rare but serious; educate patients to report agitation, confusion, sweating, tremor, or muscle stiffness promptly [^111DUEQ5].

- **Relapse risk**: monitor mood and anxiety closely; distinguish withdrawal from relapse by onset and symptom pattern [^116Mfi2x].

---

## Alternative strategies

Alternative strategies include a **washout approach** — stopping Lexapro for 1–2 weeks before starting Prozac — which reduces interaction risk but may increase withdrawal; consider if prior SSRI withdrawal was severe or serotonin syndrome risk is high [^116YWLng] [^112jofy1]. Alternatively, use **liquid formulations** for finer dose adjustments if available, enabling slower, smoother tapers [^116sd7Rp].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **pregnancy**, where tapering is generally not recommended near delivery due to relapse risk; coordinate with obstetrics if a switch is necessary [^1174RPGD]. In **elderly or medically comorbid patients**, use lower starting doses and slower titration, with closer monitoring [^111Wtsxq].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Cross-taper**: Reduce Lexapro to 5 mg for 1–2 weeks while starting Prozac 10 mg, then stop Lexapro and continue Prozac.

- **Monitor**: Watch for withdrawal and serotonin syndrome throughout; adjust the taper if symptoms arise [^1166tbGg].

- **Avoid**: Abrupt stops and alternate-day dosing, which increase withdrawal risk [^1178DTWU] [^1176yG9V].

- **Titrate**: Reassess after 4–6 weeks and adjust Prozac as needed [^notfound].

---

Cross-tapering Lexapro and Prozac over 2–4 weeks is the **preferred approach**, balancing withdrawal prevention with serotonin syndrome risk; individualize the pace and monitor closely.

Methods

The original study was conducted in 46 centers in 7 European countries from October 2003 to May 2005, in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki applicable at the time of the study. The study was approved by the relevant local ethics committees and all patients gave written informed consent for participation. The methods and main results of the principal study have been described.

Design Overview

This relapse prevention study started with a 12-week open-label treatment period that was followed by a 24-week, randomised, double blind treatment period (Figure 1). During the initial open-label period, outpatients aged at least 65 years received escitalopram 10mg/day during the first week; the dose could be increased to 20mg/day at Week 2, based on the clinical judgement of the investigator. Subsequently the dose remained constant for the remaining open label period. At the end of the 12-week open-label period, patients who achieved remission, defined by a Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≤ 12, were eligible for randomisation to either continue escitalopram at their last fixed dose of 10 or 20mg/day, or to switch to placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients randomised to placebo who were on 20 mg/day escitalopram during the open period received 10 mg/day escitalopram for the first week (Week 13) before receiving placebo for the remainder of the study. Non-remitters left the study and were treated at the physician's discretion.

Figure 1
Study design.

During the 24-week double-blind period (until taper at Week 36), study investigators regularly evaluated relapse symptoms. Relapse was defined either as a MADRS total score ≥ 22 at a single visit, or an unsatisfactory treatment effect (lack of efficacy), as judged by the local investigator. In order to capture all patients who could be considered to have relapsed, this definition was extended in a sensitivity analysis to include patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for MDE or who attempted suicide. Patients who relapsed were withdrawn from the study and were contacted for a safety follow-up assessment 4 weeks later.

### Guidelines for adolescent depression in primary care (GLAD-PC): part II. treatment and ongoing management [^116dAZdy]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment — indications, dosing cautions, approvals, and monitoring specify that when indicated by clinical presentation (ie, clear diagnosis of MDD with no comorbid conditions) and patient and/or family preference, an SSRI should be used, and once the antidepressant is started, and if tolerated, the clinician should support an adequate trial up to the maximum dose and duration. Deliberate self-harm and/or suicide risk is more likely to occur if the SSRI is started at higher doses (rather than normal starting doses), so the patient and family should be informed about these possible adverse effects (clinicians may use checklist), including possible switch to mania or the development of behavioral activation or suicide-related events. Generally, the effective dosages for antidepressants in adolescents are lower than would be found in adult guidelines; note that only fluoxetine has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents with depression, and only escitalopram has been approved for use in adolescents aged 12 years and older. Clinicians should know the potential drug interactions with SSRIs, and in addition, all SSRIs should be slowly tapered when discontinued because of risk of withdrawal effects. Because medication RCTs for depression in adolescents generally only included subjects with MDD, medication-specific guidelines apply only to fully expressed MDD.

### Antidepressant tapering is not routine but could Be [^1157bh4f]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When antidepressants are discontinued, severe withdrawal symptoms are possible. Some patients have few or no problems stopping, whereas others struggle. That struggle can be minimized or prevented with careful dose tapering. How often is that done?

Methods

Using 7years of medical records, we determined the percentage of patients who received a prescription for the lowest available dose of their antidepressant before it was discontinued, as an indicator of a deliberate taper.

Results

Over that period, 8.9% of patients had evidence of tapering. The percentage increased from 4.9% in 2014 to a plateau around 10% in the past 4 years.

Discussion

While reports of severe withdrawal are increasingly recognized and must be addressed, our data suggest that many patients can discontinue their antidepressants without a taper through the lowest dose. However, it is difficult to identify which patients will struggle without a careful taper. A "one-size-fits-all" taper approach is recommended, balancing the need for withdrawal prevention with the need to avoid unnecessary complexity for the majority of patients. The first decrement is key for all patients: it must go well. Thereafter many patients may accelerate but all should receive a prescription for the lowest available dose of their antidepressant.

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: why, how, and when [^1163Dsib]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome

If the decision is to withdraw treatment, abrupt discontinuation of central serotonergic neuromodulators (mainly SSRIs and SNRIs) may be associated with antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), which consists of various symptoms, including nausea, headache, flulike symptoms, imbalance, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and sensory disturbance like brain zaps and paresthesia.

The ADS is more common using agents with a shorter half-life. So, for the SSRIs, paroxetine, with a half-life of less than a day, is more likely to produce ADS when stopped abruptly. By contrast, fluoxetine has a half-life of 3–4 days, and ADS is less common. Citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline are intermediate and exhibit half-lives of longer than a day but may still require a gradual taper to avoid the uncomfortable symptoms of ADS.

There is no clearly defined strategy for preventing and treating ADS symptoms, and patient attributions to the withdrawal must be considered. The patient who is hypervigilant to withdrawal effects is more likely to have difficulty withdrawing. In addition, when comorbidities such as major depression or anxiety disorders are present, cognitive behavioral therapy or other brain-gut behavior therapies should be used concurrently to supplement the loss of the use of the medication. In addition, self-care behavior interventions like mindfulness, relaxation, and supportive relationships explain up to 20%–30% of the variance in predicting successful discontinuation of the antidepressants.

Some strategies may be helpful. It is better to discontinue the morning dose for a week and then discontinue the evening dose. Another alternative is to switch to an agent with a longer half-life, like fluoxetine when planning to stop another antidepressant. However, in cases where symptoms are severe, sometimes it is necessary to reintroduce the neuromodulator and retry using a slower discontinuation process. Since the lowest dose of duloxetine is 20 mg, we sometimes advocate patients opening the capsule and taking half the dose (10 mg) when continuing the tapering protocol.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

SSRIs act by selective blockade of the presynaptic 5-HT transporter, boosting 5-HT neurotransmission and consequently stimulating intestinal transit; however, by not acting on NA receptors, SSRIs do not treat pain. Their primary serotonergic effect, without noradrenergic effect, leads to more significant expected benefits in treating anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and phobic-related behaviors. They can be added to a TCA or SNRI in low doses when anxiety is dominant. Similarly SSRIss may be used instead of a TCA to manage a patient with IBS-C when pain is not dominant. SSRI are more likely to cause diarrhea, while TCAs tend to be constipating due to their NA effect.

The SSRIs include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram. Although all act on 5-HT reuptake inhibition, each of them has specific pharmacologic properties, like greater 5-HT2C antagonism of fluoxetine and greater anticholinergic action of paroxetine, so unlike the other SSRIs, paroxetine may produce constipation.

Sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram tend to have the fewest pharmacokinetic drug interactions as they exhibit minimal effects on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, however, have an increased risk of pharmacokinetic drug interactions through their strong inhibition of the P450 isoenzymes 1A2 and 2D6; therefore, they should be administered with caution when used in conjunction with TCAs and beta-blockers like metoprolol, opioids, lithium, tryptophan and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

SSRIs are first-line pharmacologic agents for treating anxiety disorders, but they have the potential to induce restlessness and exacerbate anxiety when the drug is initiated. They are typically initiated at half of the usual starting dose to minimize these potential anxiogenic adverse effects. The dose may gradually increase to the regular starting dose after about 1 week (Table 3). The higher effect of the SSRI is usually delayed 3–4 weeks, which may represent a problem for those patients with significant anxiety that is complicating treatment and causing significant functional impairment. A useful strategy for this situation is to schedule a long-acting benzodiazepine to temporarily bridge this lag time and provide symptomatic relief for the patient's anxiety symptoms. The benzodiazepine should then be tapered after about 4 weeks of SSRI treatment.

Other side effects of SSRIs are agitation, sleep disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, night sweats, headache, weight loss, and sexual dysfunction.

### Escitalopram continuation treatment prevents relapse of depressive episodes [^116fweq4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for antidepressant use recommend 4 to 6 months of continuation treatment to prevent relapse of depression following symptom resolution. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of continuation escitalopram treatment.

Method

Outpatients diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (male or female, aged 18 to 81 years) who had completed 8 weeks of randomized double-blind treatment with escitalopram, citalopram, or placebo entered an 8-week flexible-dose, open-label phase in which all patients received escitalopram (10–20 mg/day). This study was initiated November 3, 1999, and completed April 5, 2001. Patients who met responder criteria (score of ≤ 12 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to escitalopram (at the dose each patient was receiving at the end of the open-label phase) or placebo for 36 weeks of double-blind treatment. The primary efficacy variable was time to depression relapse (defined as MADRS score ≥ 22 or discontinuation due to an insufficient therapeutic response) from the start of the double-blind treatment phase.

Results

A total of 502 patients received open-label escitalopram treatment and had at least 1 MADRS assessment. A total of 274 evaluable subjects entered the double-blind treatment phase; 93 received placebo and 181 received escitalopram. Time to depression relapse was significantly longer (p = .013) and the cumulative rate of relapse was significantly lower in patients who received escitalopram (26% escitalopram vs. 40% placebo; hazard ratio = 0.56; p = .01). Escitalopram-treated subjects had significantly lower depression ratings than those of placebo-treated patients. Escitalopram continuation treatment was safe and well tolerated. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 7% for the placebo group and 4% for the escitalopram-treated group.

Conclusion

Continuation treatment with escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse into an episode of major depressive disorder.

### When should a trial of fluoxetine for major depression be declared failed? [^114jYhP6]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Although the newer antidepressants are widely used, little is known about how long it takes to see their full effect. The authors sought to determine how many weeks a fluoxetine trial with no improvement should continue before treatment is changed.

Method

The data involved 840 patients in a 12-week open trial of fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, followed by a blinded, placebo-controlled discontinuation study. Outcomes at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks were classified as nonresponse, partial response, response, and remission and were based on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores. The rate of remission at week 12 was calculated for each group of patients without remission at the earlier time points. The time to relapse during weeks 13–26 of the discontinuation study was examined in patients taking placebo and fluoxetine in relation to status at week 6.

Results

Patients unimproved at week 6 had a remission rate at week 12 of 31%-41%. For patients with remission at week 12, level of improvement at week 6 did not affect prognosis in weeks 13–26. Of the unimproved patients at week 8, 23% had remissions by week 12. The week 12 remission rate for unimproved patients at week 4 was clearly high enough to justify continued treatment; the rate for unimproved patients at week 10 was too low.

Conclusions

These data suggest that nonresponse to fluoxetine should not be declared until 8 weeks of treatment have elapsed. Practitioners should discuss trial length with patients at the beginning of treatment.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^116FnrQy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Panic Disorder

Initial Treatment - Initiate treatment with fluoxetine 10 mg/day. After one week, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. Consider a dose increase after several weeks if no clinical improvement is observed. Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in patients with Panic Disorder. In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Panic Disorder, patients were administered fluoxetine doses in the range of 10 to 60 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. The most frequently administered dose in the 2 flexible-dose clinical trials was 20 mg/day.

Periodically reassess to determine the need for continued treatment.

2.7 Dosing in Specific Populations

Geriatric - Consider a lower or less frequent dosage for the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Hepatic Impairment - As with many other medications, use a lower or less frequent dosage in patients with hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Concomitant Illness - Patients with concurrent disease or on multiple concomitant medications may require dosage adjustments [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

2.8 Discontinuation of Treatment

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of fluoxetine, SNRIs, and SSRIs, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

2.9 Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with fluoxetine. Conversely, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4.1)].

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^112jofy1]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

AACAP guideline — SSRI switching, monitoring, discontinuation, and treatment duration in children and adolescents with depressive disorders notes that there is "no definitive empirical guidance for switching from one SSRI to another", and while tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second (with a fluoxetine washout) is the most conservative strategy, "Cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored". When a concerning adverse effect could be linked to medication, the dose "would be reduced", and if it persists, the medication "would be discontinued", with monitoring recommended and "no specific laboratory tests" in the absence of relevant comorbidities. For continuation, a generally accepted approach is to continue an effective dose for "approximately 6 to 12 months after remission", with discontinuation "during a relatively stress-free period", and longer maintenance "from more than 1 year to several years or longer" in higher-risk presentations. Discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or abrupt stopping of short-acting SSRIs "notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline", warranting "close adherence… and a slow discontinuation taper", whereas "fluoxetine… is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome" and has not shown withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed.

### Escitalopram maintenance treatment for prevention of recurrent depression: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1152DFqR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder is a recurrent illness that often requires maintenance antidepressant treatment. Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has shown efficacy in both acute and continuation treatment of major depressive disorder. The current trial examined the efficacy of maintenance escitalopram treatment in preventing depression recurrence in patients who responded to acute SSRI therapy.

Method

Patients with recurrent DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder (≥ 2 previous episodes; baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score ≥ 22) who had responded (MADRS score ≤ 12) to acute open-label treatment (8 weeks) with 1 of 4 SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, or citalopram) received open-label, flexible-dose continuation treatment (16 weeks) with escitalopram (10–20 mg/day). At the end of continuation treatment, patients maintaining response criteria were randomly assigned to 52 weeks of double-blind, fixed-dose maintenance treatment with escitalopram (10 or 20 mg/day) or placebo. Recurrence was defined as a MADRS score ≥ 22 or insufficient therapeutic response during the double-blind phase. The study was conducted between October 16, 2000, and February 4, 2003.

Results

A total of 234 patients who responded to acute open-label treatment with 1 of 4 SSRIs received at least 1 dose of open-label escitalopram continuation treatment. Of 164 patients who completed escitalopram continuation treatment, 139 were randomly assigned to double-blind maintenance treatment with escitalopram (N = 73) or placebo (N = 66). Mean baseline MADRS scores at the start of the maintenance phase were < 5 for both the placebo- and escitalopram-treatment groups. Time to recurrence was significantly longer in patients who received maintenance treatment with escitalopram compared with patients switched to placebo (hazard ratio = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.52, p < .001). Long-term escitalopram treatment was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Maintenance treatment with escitalopram was well tolerated and significantly reduced the risk for recurrence of depression. Patients with few residual symptoms following continuation treatment with escitalopram experienced a high rate of depression recurrence when switched to placebo, demonstrating the need for maintenance therapy of recurrent major depressive disorder beyond 4 to 6 months of initial symptom resolution even if few residual symptoms are present.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^112fwbnP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal anxiety disorders — first-line pharmacotherapy is specified as follows: ACOG recommends that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) be used as first-line psychopharmacotherapy for perinatal anxiety, with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as reasonable alternatives, and pharmacotherapy individualized based on prior response; if there is no pharmacotherapy history, sertraline or escitalopram are reasonable first-line medications. Most experts recommend initiation of SSRIs or SNRIs for anxiety at half of the lowest recommended dose range to avoid early side effects such as agitation or insomnia, and treatment of anxiety and anxiety-related conditions often requires up-titration to doses that are higher than those for depression; experts also recommend that individuals with anxiety and anxiety-related conditions be in remission longer than those with an indication of depression before considering tapering or discontinuing psychopharmacotherapy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to discontinuation of treatment, APA 2010 guidelines recommend to consider offering a slow taper or temporary change to a longer half-life antidepressant to reduce the risk of discontinuation syndrome when discontinuing antidepressants or reducing antidepressant doses.

### Alternate-day dosing to taper antidepressants risks severe withdrawal effects: an in silico analysis [^1176yG9V]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians often recommend dosing antidepressants every other day when tapering to reduce 'average' daily doses. This is used in place of liquid formulations or other methods for obtaining smaller doses. There is limited evidence to support this approach. This paper explores variation of the inter-dose interval when tapering five widely used antidepressants: citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, duloxetine, and mirtazapine. We analysed the resultant occupancy of relevant target receptors to establish whether prolonging the interval between doses would likely increase the risk of withdrawal symptoms.

Design and Methods

Analysis was conducted in silico using pre-existing pharmacokinetic data including bioavailability, distribution volumes, time to maximal concentration, and elimination half-lives. Modelling was conducted to assess the effect of altered administration frequency. Receptor occupancy was predicted using previous imaging data. We used pre-defined thresholds to evaluate the tolerability of receptor occupancy variation for different dosing strategies.

Results

Prolonging the inter-dose interval led to a pronounced increase in receptor occupancy variation at standard doses of all antidepressants. Variation increased as dosage reduced until the ED 50 for each drug, which is often far below doses used in current practice. Therefore, increasing the dose interval at minimum therapeutic doses, or even half of that dose, likely increases the risk of withdrawal symptoms and cannot be recommended as a prudent strategy for tapering.

Conclusion

Dosing every other day is likely to cause withdrawal effects with the antidepressants examined in this study. These recommendations remain theoretical until further clinical research and empirical validation of our proposed antidepressant tapering regimens.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^115sXPGb]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — SSRI discontinuation and switching highlight that a discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or acute discontinuation of shorter-acting SSRIs, notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline; accordingly, these medications warrant close adherence to the prescribed regimen and a slow discontinuation taper. In contrast, fluoxetine is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome and has not been associated with withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed. For switching, the most conservative approach would entail tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second, with a washout interval if the first SSRI is fluoxetine; cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored.

2.6 Discontinuation of Treatment with Lexapro

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Lexapro and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

2.7 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with Lexapro. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Lexapro before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4)].

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^116DzzZr]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objective

To assess and clarify the relations between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dose efficacy, acceptability (early treatment discontinuation (dropouts)), and tolerability (reported adverse drug effects), and critically evaluate methods previously used to examine SSRI dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults.

Design

Systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration library, from 1975 to December 2021. Reference lists of national depression treatment guidelines were systemically searched by hand.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Reviews assessing SSRI monotherapy dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults (age ≥ 18 years) reporting efficacy, acceptability, or tolerability. Reviews meeting inclusion criteria had a high degree of heterogeneity, due to methodological diversity; therefore, a meta-narrative synthesis approach was applied. Standard daily doses were defined as 20mg citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine; 50mg sertraline; and 10mg escitalopram. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tool, in line with Cochrane recommendations.

Results

The search identified 9138 records; 387 full text reports were assessed for eligibility, 42 of which matched the inclusion criteria. The majority, 83% (n = 35), of reviews included data for studies with a duration of ≤ 12 weeks (ie, the acute phase of depression treatment). Of 39 reviews assessing efficacy, the majority (n = 26) indicated that individual SSRIs and SSRI class demonstrated flat dose-response effects; standard doses were optimal for efficacy. Acceptability or tolerability were assessed in 28 reviews. Higher than standard daily doses were associated with higher dropout rates and a greater incidence of adverse drug effects (eg, nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety). Despite a range of methods being reported, there was an overall consensus regarding SSRI dose related efficacy, dropouts, and adverse drug effects.

Conclusion

Standard daily doses of SSRIs for the treatment of depression in adults provide a favourable balance between efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability. Patients are encouraged to talk to their prescriber or community pharmacist if they experience adverse effects or have any concerns about their drug treatments.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^112srw6y]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Efficacy

The majority of reviews, 93% (n = 39), assessed SSRI dose-response effects for the treatment of depression (table 2). Most reviews (n = 26) indicated that the SSRI class of antidepressant demonstrated flat dose-response effects for the acute phase of treatment of depression; higher than standard daily doses did not provide greater efficacy. A minority (n = 8) demonstrated that higher doses were more efficacious, while others (n = 3) showed mixed effects, or remained ambiguous.

At an individual SSRI level, most reviews also demonstrated flat dose-response effects for efficacy; standard daily starting doses were the optimal doses: 20 mg citalopram, 10 mg escitalopram, 20 mg fluoxetine, 20 mg paroxetine, and 50 mg sertraline (table 3). A minority of reviews however, indicated that some SSRIs did have linear dose-response effects with higher doses being more effective, for example, escitalopram; citalopram (eg, up to 30 mg/day); fluoxetine; fluvoxamine; paroxetine; and sertraline. Other reviews indicated mixed curvy linear efficacy with increasing doses for fluvoxamineand sertraline. All curvy linear efficacy responses were characterised by having an initial increase, a peak, and then a decline in efficacy with increasing dose.

Table 3
Efficacy dose-response effects by individual selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor*

Blood plasma concentrations of fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine were assessed in association with response rates to depression treatment. We found no correlation between blood plasma concentrations and individual responses to treatment, regardless of the severity of depression.

Six reviews compared the efficacy of fixed daily doses with flexible dose regimens for individuals not achieving satisfactory symptom resolution or remission (two narrative reviewsand four meta-analyses). All reviews demonstrated that use of flexible dose titration for these individuals did not provide greater efficacy.

### The effect of rate of antidepressant tapering on the incidence of discontinuation symptoms: a randomised study [^115xUtB1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty eight patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors /venlafaxine were randomized to a three-day (short) or 14-day (longer) anti-depressant taper and openly assessed after a five to seven day drug-free washout, and again after seven days treatment with a new anti-depressant of the treating clinician's choice. A 'discontinuation syndrome' (≥ 3 new symptoms on the Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms checklist) occurred in 46% of patients with a similar frequency in those with short (7/15) versus longer (6/13) taper. Patients initially on short half-life anti-depressants had significantly greater increases in discontinuation and depressive symptoms than those stopping fluoxetine. Four patients, all on paroxetine, developed emergent suicidal ideation after taper. These results support the importance of half-life in determining discontinuation symptoms and suggest that there is little advantage to a two-week taper over a three-day taper when switching antidepressants. Antidepressant discontinuation in depressed patients can be associated with worsening depression and increased suicidality.

Summary points for efficacy:
efficacy advantage for escitalopram versus citalopram has been demonstrated in five randomized studies and two pooled analyses of clinical trials;
escitalopram may have an efficacy advantage over paroxetine, in terms of significant improvements in MADRS, HAM-D and CGI-S scores and fewer discontinuations owing to lack of efficacy;
the efficacy of escitalopram compared with fluoxetine and sertraline requires further evaluation;
escitalopram and sertraline might be the best choice of antidepressant when starting treatment of patients with moderate to severe MDD;
the SNRI venlafaxine XR may be associated with greater remission or response rates in patients with MDD compared with SSRIs (Burk et al. 2002);
escitalopram has comparable efficacy to venlafaxine XR, with a possible slight advantage for escitalopram in patients with severe MDD

Regarding safety and tolerability, escitalopram offers tolerability advantages over duloxetine, paroxetine and venlafaxine XR (see summary points below) and may be preferable to those antidepressants in some patients with MDD.

Summary points for safety:
superior tolerability for escitalopram versus duloxetine, particularly for nausea, insomnia, dizziness and vomiting has been demonstrated in three randomized studies and a pooled analysis of two clinical trials (Lam et al. 2008)
escitalopram offers tolerability advantages over paroxetine and venlafaxine XR (;, 2006);
escitalopram is less likely to cause discontinuation symptoms than several other antidepressants (2006)
no evidence of emergent risk of suicide with escitalopram;
incidence of sexual dysfunction-related adverse events similar to citalopram, but lower than venlafaxine XR and paroxetine.

### Effects of discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants prior to psilocybin therapy versus escitalopram for major depression [^111ivSXM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another possible explanation of these results is that the short-term discontinuation required to enter in the trial disturbed the stability previously acquired with medications, generating discontinuation symptoms. In support of this hypothesis, discontinuers showed an increase in depressive symptoms between trial screening and baseline (i.e. when withdrawal was taking place), as well as a trend towards higher depression scores at baseline compared with unmedicated patients. Tapering or cessation of SSRI/SNRIs is commonly associated with withdrawal symptoms which often resemble symptoms of depression or a worsening of depressive symptom severity. These symptoms can be distinguished from a relapse of the original disorder by rapidity of onset, the presence of somatic symptoms like nausea, shock-like feelings, dizziness and rapid response by reintroduction of SSRI/SNRIs. While a minimum of 2 weeks of tapering is commonly considered sufficient, it may not mitigate prolonged symptoms. In fact, there is evidence suggesting that linear tapering over this period might not have additional benefit compared with abrupt discontinuation.

### Incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115DPAaa]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Background

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms are becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice, but the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms has not been quantified. An estimate of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms incidence could inform patients and clinicians in the discontinuation of treatment, and provide useful information to researchers in antidepressant treatments. We aimed to assess the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms in patients discontinuing both antidepressants and placebo in the published literature.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from database inception until Oct 13, 2022 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), other controlled trials, and observational studies assessing the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms. To be included, studies must have investigated cessation or tapering of an established antidepressant drug (excluding antipsychotics, lithium, or thyroxine) or placebo in participants with any mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder. We excluded studies in neonates, and those using antidepressants for physical conditions such as pain syndromes due to organic disease. After study selection, summary data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation, data were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. The main outcome was the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms after discontinuation of antidepressants or placebo. We also analysed the incidence of severe discontinuation symptoms. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses tested a selection of methodological variables.

Findings

From 6095 articles screened, 79 studies (44 RCTs and 35 observational studies) covering 21002 patients were selected (72% female, 28% male, mean age 45 years [range 19.6–64.5]). Data on ethnicity were not consistently reported. 16532 patients discontinued from an antidepressant, and 4470 patients discontinued from placebo. Incidence of at least one antidepressant discontinuation symptom was 0.31 (95% CI 0.27–0.35) in 62 study groups after discontinuation of antidepressants, and 0.17 (0.14–0.21) in 22 study groups after discontinuation of placebo. Between antidepressant and placebo groups of included RCTs, the summary difference in incidence was 0.08 [0.04–0.12]. The incidence of severe antidepressant discontinuation symptoms after discontinuation of an antidepressant was 0.028 (0.014–0.057) compared with 0.006 (0.002–0.013) after discontinuation of placebo. Desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, imipramine, and escitalopram were associated with higher frequencies of discontinuation symptoms, and imipramine, paroxetine, and either desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine were associated with a higher severity of symptoms. Heterogeneity of results was substantial.

Interpretation

Considering non-specific effects, as evidenced in placebo groups, the incidence of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms is approximately 15%, affecting one in six to seven patients who discontinue their medication. Subgroup analyses and heterogeneity figures point to factors not accounted for by diagnosis, medication, or trial-related characteristics, and might indicate subjective factors on the part of investigators, patients, or both. Residual or re-emerging psychopathology needs to be considered when interpreting the results, but our findings can inform clinicians and patients about the probable extent of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms without causing undue alarm.

### Cyclic gastrointestinal symptoms induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a case report of menstruation-related adverse effects [^116Shevb]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), yet menstruation‑specific cyclic gastrointestinal symptoms have not been described.

Objective

This report describes, to the best of our knowledge, the first documented case of menstruation-specific exacerbation of cyclic gastrointestinal symptoms associated with SSRI treatment and proposes a pragmatic management approach.

Case Summary

A 20‑year‑old woman with generalized anxiety disorder developed nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dizziness limited to menstrual periods after initiating escitalopram 10 mg/day; gastrointestinal symptoms persisted following a switch to paroxetine 20 mg/day. A comprehensive gynecologic work‑up (pelvic examination, hormonal assessment, and ultrasonography) was unremarkable. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale scored 7, indicating a "probable" menstruation-specific adverse reaction. Reducing paroxetine to 10 mg/day resolved gastrointestinal symptoms, but anxiety symptoms recurred; titration to 15 mg/day achieved psychiatric remission without gastrointestinal symptom recurrence. After 6 months of stability, paroxetine was tapered off without recurrence of either gastrointestinal or anxiety symptoms.

Key Findings

This case demonstrates a menstruation‑modulated SSRI adverse effect mediated by a possible interaction between serotonergic signaling and cyclical sex‑steroid fluctuations.

Implications

An interdisciplinary, stepwise strategy (ruling out gynecologic disease, considering dose optimization, and monitoring menstruation‑linked symptoms) may help balance efficacy with tolerability in reproductive‑age patients. Prospective studies should evaluate SSRI-hormone interactions and menstrual-aware adverse‑effect monitoring.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^116Mfi2x]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms

Withdrawal symptoms after SSRIs typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last a few weeks, also with gradual tapering, but the withdrawal symptoms might include late onset and longer persistence of disturbances and may be easily misidentified as signs of impending relapse. There are many similarities between the withdrawal symptoms associated with SSRIs and the withdrawal symptoms associated with antidepressants such as venlafaxine and duloxetine. A recently published review found that a significant proportion of people who experience withdrawal symptoms after treatment with antidepressants do so for more than 2 weeks and that it is not uncommon for people to experience withdrawal for several months. Withdrawal symptoms may be alleviated by reinstating treatment with the antidepressant that triggered the symptoms, and it may for this, and many other reasons, be difficult for some patients to stop taking antidepressants once the treatment has started. Withdrawal symptoms might also explain why some studies have alleged to show that the risk of relapse seems to be reduced if antidepressants are continued instead of not continued. Withdrawal symptoms might be the reason why patients who do not continue antidepressants might do worse compared with patients who continue antidepressants.

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: consensus panel recommendations for clinical management and additional research [^115KGUcD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, no evidence-based guidelines exist for the management of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation syndrome. This article summarizes recommendations with respect to future research as well as clinical management recommendations for SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Participants

In April 2004, a panel of physicians convened in New York City to discuss recommendations for clinical management of and additional research on SRI discontinuation syndrome.

Evidence

Previous guidance for management of SRI discontinuation syndrome was proposed in 1997 in a consensus meeting also chaired by Alan F. Schatzberg. A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted to identify articles on SRI discontinuation syndrome that have been published since 1997.

Consensus Process

The 2004 panel reviewed important preclinical and clinical studies, discussed prospective investigation of this syndrome in clinical trials, and suggested the establishment of a research network to collect data in naturalistic settings. The panel also reviewed the management recommendations published in 1997 and subsequently updated the recommendations, taking into account the latest clinical data as well as the personal experience of its members with patients.

Conclusions

Additional preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to further elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms of SRI discontinuation syndrome and to identify the patient populations and agents that are most affected by this phenomenon. Management strategies include gradual tapering of doses and should emphasize clinical monitoring and patient education.

14.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Adults

The efficacy of escitalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo-controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. The primary outcome in all three studies was change from baseline to endpoint in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

A fixed-dose study compared 10 mg daily escitalopram and 20 mg daily escitalopram to placebo and 40 mg daily citalopram. The 10 mg daily and 20 mg daily escitalopram treatment groups showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. The 10 mg and 20 mg escitalopram groups were similar on this outcome measure.

In a second fixed-dose study of 10 mg daily escitalopram and placebo, the 10 mg daily escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

In a flexible-dose study, comparing escitalopram, titrated between 10 mg and 20 mg daily, to placebo and citalopram, titrated between 20 mg and 40 mg daily, the escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.

Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Lexapro, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Advise patients, their families and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, especially during treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the with the concomitant use of Lexapro with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7)].

Discontinuation Syndrome

Advise patients not to abruptly discontinue Lexapro and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when Lexapro is discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Loss of responsiveness on reinstatement of antidepressants after treatment interruption – A systematic review [^114aUpRo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

This open-label study investigated the recurrence of depression and the effect of restarting treatment in older patients with a first episode of major depression. After a tapering period of 8 weeks, patients were followed up for 2 years, and their antidepressant was restarted if depression recurred. Most relapses occurred within 1 year. One of 11 relapsing patients did not respond on re-exposure.

Investigators described an open-label trial where patients in remission from a first episode of major depression discontinued escitalopram over a period of 6 months or more. If depression recurred, escitalopram was restarted. Overall, 43% of patients responded to escitalopram on re-exposure (i.e. 57% did not respond). The authors noted that the mean reduction in HAMD was greater with the initial treatment than with the restarted treatment.

This was an open-label antidepressant restarting phase of a double-blind RCT in patients who met the criteria for DSM-III dysthymia before initial treatment with desipramine. Responders to desipramine were randomised in a double-blind manner to receive either placebo or to continue desipramine. If relapse occurred, then open-label treatment with desipramine was restarted. One of 12 patients who relapsed was unresponsive when desipramine was restarted.

This open-label trial reported initial antidepressant treatment and restarting of antidepressant treatment in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Patients were restarted on their original treatment at the dose that was previously effective for them if relapse occurred during a 6-month follow-up. The authors reported a statistically significant difference in response to antidepressant treatment when comparing the initial treatment episode with their corresponding reinstitution episode. Thirteen of 81 patients (16%) did not respond at all on restarting.

### How do you choose a second-line treatment option for depression? [^114qt5A5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A majority of patients with major depression do not remit or adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy. When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference. Comorbid medical conditions, especially cardiac and cerebrovascular complications, and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when making treatment decisions.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^111zEt6K]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Every year, an estimated five million people in high-income countries alone start new antidepressants to treat their depression. In the USA, the annual prevalence of prescribed antidepressant use exceeds 10% of the population, almost double that of 10 years before. Antidepressant use is similarly high and increasing in European countries, ranging between 4 and 9%, with a 1-year incidence of new antidepressant prescription of approximately 1%. Clinicians need specific, detailed and appropriate guidelines to guide their antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

To initiate antidepressant treatment, modern guidelines recommend new generation antidepressants and in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A network meta-analysis of 12 new generation antidepressants suggested that the SSRI sertraline, because of its favourable balance of benefits, acceptability and cost, may be the best choice when starting treatment for major depression. Sertraline has been the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the USA and elsewhere.

Once they choose a first-line antidepressant, practitioners must optimise its dosage, considering the wide approved dose range for most drugs. Many guidelines only list such ranges and do not specify where within this range the initial treatment should aim. The American Psychiatric Association guideline is more specific and recommends that the initial doses be incrementally raised and maximised, side effects permitting (, p. 43). However, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided conflicting results regarding the benefits and harms of lower vs higher doses of various antidepressants within their therapeutic ranges. One review synthesised results from 33 RCTs comparing two or more doses of the same antidepressants and found that a dose level of 100–200 mg imipramine equivalents (or 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents) showed the highest response rate, while lower doses showed a reduction in efficacy and higher doses were not accompanied by increased efficacy. Adverse events increased monotonically with dose. However, this study included both old and new generation antidepressants. The dose-response curves may be different for different classes of antidepressants. More recent reviews focussing on a single agent or several agents suggested that there was no dose-response relationship within the approved dose ranges for SSRIs.

### Tapering of SSRI treatment to mitigate withdrawal symptoms [^1178DTWU]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

All classes of drug that are prescribed to treat depression are associated with withdrawal syndromes. SSRI withdrawal syndrome occurs often and can be severe, and might compel patients to recommence their medication. Although the withdrawal syndrome can be differentiated from recurrence of the underlying disorder, it might also be mistaken for recurrence, leading to long-term unnecessary medication. Guidelines recommend short tapers, of between 2 weeks and 4 weeks, down to therapeutic minimum doses, or half-minimum doses, before complete cessation. Studies have shown that these tapers show minimal benefits over abrupt discontinuation, and are often not tolerated by patients. Tapers over a period of months and down to doses much lower than minimum therapeutic doses have shown greater success in reducing withdrawal symptoms. Other types of medication associated with withdrawal, such as benzodiazepenes, are tapered to reduce their biological effect at receptors by fixed amounts to minimise withdrawal symptoms. These dose reductions are done with exponential tapering programmes that reach very small doses. This method could have relevance for tapering of SSRIs. We examined the PET imaging data of serotonin transporter occupancy by SSRIs and found that hyperbolically reducing doses of SSRIs reduces their effect on serotonin transporter inhibition in a linear manner. We therefore suggest that SSRIs should be tapered hyperbolically and slowly to doses much lower than those of therapeutic minimums, in line with tapering regimens for other medications associated with withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms will then be minimised.

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^111absYG]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers [see also Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. Prescriptions for Lexapro should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^114LPDP9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patient safety during tapering without consent — communication, documentation, and monitoring steps include that when initiating a taper without a patient's consent, clinicians should carefully explain the reasons for their decision to the patient and their care partners, if applicable, and clinicians should also carefully document the rationale for initiating the taper and related discussions. Clinicians should then explain to patients that their next prescription will be at a lower dose and describe how they will monitor and manage patient symptoms and concerns during the tapering process, and the tapering process should be patient-centered. It is important for clinicians to closely monitor a patient's response to the taper and adjust the strategy as appropriate. Clinicians should be mindful of any potential bias when initiating a taper against a patient's wishes, and if clinicians and patients and their care partners continue to disagree on the need for a taper after this discussion, clinicians may consider referral for a second opinion. The CGC noted that some patients may become aggressive, threaten legal action, or suggest that progressing with the taper may lead them to suicide, and the CGC recommends that healthcare systems have established policies and procedures to guide clinicians in their response to these situations in ways that are responsive to a patient's needs and supports ready access to risk management services.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^113PFMwr]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies comparing escitalopram with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

The efficacy of escitalopram in MDD has been compared with that of paroxetine in two randomized, double-blind studies. Escitalopram elicited a statistically significant improvement in MADRS, HAM-D and CGI-severity (CGI-S) scores following 8 weeks of treatment and, in a subgroup of severely depressed patients, significant improvement in MADRS score was detected at 27 weeks. Furthermore, not only was there an increase in the rate of treatment discontinuations owing to adverse events in paroxetine compared with escitalopram-treated patients, but significantly more patients in the paroxetine group withdrew from the study owing to lack of efficacy.

Only two randomized, double-blind studies compared the efficacy of escitalopram with that of fluoxetine and these studies have reported conflicting results. The study byin Chinese patients showed no significant difference between the two treatments at 8 weeks, although escitalopram was superior with respect to both the 'depressed mood' and 'work and interests' items of the HAM-D scale. The second study, byin elderly patients, suggested that although fluoxetine was significantly less efficacious than both escitalopram and placebo, escitalopram in turn was not superior to placebo. The adverse-event profile of the two antidepressants was similar, but there were a greater number of treatment discontinuations with fluoxetine compared with escitalopram owing to either adverse events or lack of efficacy.

A single study has explored the comparative efficacy of escitalopram and sertraline and found no differences between agents. However, in this study a fixed dose of escitalopram of 10 mg/day, which is the lowest therapeutic dose, was compared with sertraline flexibly dosed across its entire recommended dose range of 50–200 mg/day (mean dose at week 8: 144 mg/day). The similarity in the efficacy of these two antidepressants reported in this clinical study may not, therefore, translate into clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^114NToE9]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — pediatric depression FDA approvals, dosing, and response timing — include that medications from the SSRI class marketed in the United States are citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone, and currently only 2 SSRIs are FDA approved for depression in youth: fluoxetine for youth aged 8 years and older and escitalopram for youth aged 12 years and older; most SSRIs have long half-lives permitting single daily dosing, though at low doses of sertraline and at any dose of fluvoxamine youth may require twice-daily dosing to avoid withdrawal side effects; modeling suggests early improvement with two-thirds of benefits by week 2 and maximal benefit by week 4, and this pharmacodynamic profile suggests that 2-month clinical SSRI trials may unnecessarily prolong an ineffective treatment if response or remission is not observed within the first 4 to 6 weeks.

2.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Initial Treatment

Adult - Initiate fluoxetine 20 mg/day, orally in the morning. Consider a dose increase after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. The full therapeutic effect may be delayed until 5 weeks of treatment or longer. Administer doses above 20 mg/day once daily in the morning or twice daily (i.e., morning and noon). A dose range of 20 to60 mg/day is recommended; however, doses of up to 80 mg/day have been well tolerated in open studies of OCD. The maximum fluoxetine dose should not exceed 80 mg/day.

In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, patients were administered fixed daily doses of 20, 40, or 60 mg of fluoxetine or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. In one of these studies, no dose-response relationship for effectiveness was demonstrated.

Pediatric (children and adolescents) - In adolescents and higher weight children, initiate treatment with a dose of 10mg/day. After 2 weeks, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. Consider additional dose increases after several more weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 60 mg/day is recommended.

In lower weight children, initiate treatment with a dose of 10 mg/day. Consider additional dose increases after several more weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. A dose range of 20 to 30 mg/day is recommended. Experience with daily doses greater than 20 mg is very minimal, and there is no experience with doses greater than 60 mg.

In the controlled clinical trial of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of OCD, patients were administered fluoxetine doses in the range of 10 to 60 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Periodically reassess to determine the need for treatment.

2.3 Bulimia Nervosa

Initial Treatment - Administer fluoxetine 60 mg/day in the morning. For some patients it may be advisable to titrate up to this target dose over several days. Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg/day have not been systematically studied in patients with bulimia. In the controlled clinical trials of fluoxetine supporting its effectiveness in the treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, patients were administered fixed daily fluoxetine doses of 20 or 60 mg, or placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Only the 60 mg dose was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of binge-eating and vomiting.

Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

### Are old-old patients with major depression more likely to relapse than young-old patients during continuation treatment with escitalopram? [^113e8GsJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The study has clear and relevant implications for clinical practice. The slightly higher percentage of young-old patients achieving complete remission during the open-label phase probably reflects the somewhat higher burden of symptoms that old-old patients have at the start of acute treatment. The comparable (and very low) incidence of adverse events and of adverse event-related withdrawals in old-old and young-old patients in both phases of the study suggests that escitalopram is well-tolerated by old-old depressed patients. Although slightly fewer young-old patients on escitalopram relapsed (6.9% vs 12% in the old-old group), the hazard ratio was only slightly larger (1.2). It is therefore clear that escitalopram is highly effective (compared with placebo) in preventing depressive relapse in old-old patients who remit during acute escitalopram treatment, as shown by the hazard ratio in this sub-group.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^116sd7Rp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementing pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder highlights practical dosing and response expectations: for most patients, "the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer", yet "for patients who are worried about side effects, the medication can be started at half the listed dose or less", and many SRIs "are available in liquid form or in pills that can be split". Lower initial doses and gradual titration "may also be needed in patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders", and in the elderly "lower starting doses of medication and a more gradual approach to dose increase are often advisable". "Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks" and some responders may show "little improvement for as many as 10–12 weeks". Trial data "suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief", and "some patients… may benefit from even higher doses than those shown in the last column of Table 3", in which case "the patient should be closely monitored for side effects, including the serotonin syndrome"; moreover, patients "who have not responded to a known effective dose after 10–12 weeks may respond at higher doses".

### Understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs [^113L17dr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Withdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112j4XJ7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementing pharmacotherapy — For most patients, the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer [I]. Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks after starting medication, and some will ultimately respond after 10–12 weeks. Medication doses may be titrated up weekly during the first month in increments recommended by the manufacturer [I], or when little or no symptom improvement is seen within 4 weeks of starting medication, the dose may be increased weekly or biweekly to the maximum dose comfortably tolerated and indicated [II], then continued at this dosage for at least 6 weeks [III]. Sexual side effects may be minimized by reducing the dose [II], waiting for symptoms to remit [II], trying a once-weekly, one-day "drug holiday" before sexual activity [II], switching to another SSRI [II], or adding a pharmacological agent such as bupropion [II]. The frequency of follow-up visits after a new pharmacotherapy is initiated may vary from a few days to two weeks and depends on severity, co-occurring conditions, suicidal ideation, and the likelihood of troubling side effects [I].

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^112y777V]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants around the world, accounting for more than 50% of all antidepressant prescriptions. Most SSRIs are prescribed for the treatment of depression. Over recent years, use of higher than standard licensed SSRI doses for depression treatment has increased in UK primary care and elsewhere.

SSRIs exert their effects via serotonin reuptake inhibition, and have a hyperbolic association between dose, transporter occupancy, and plasma concentration with SSRI doses of 20 mg citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine; 50 mg sertraline; and 10 mg escitalopram; with daily doses providing optimal receptor occupancy and serotonin effects. Therefore, the theoretical rationale for increasing standard daily doses of SSRIs for individuals not achieving satisfactory symptom resolution or remission are scarce. Conversely, tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have shown serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine effects as doses are increased. For example, venlafaxine shows predominantly serotonin effects at doses < 150 mg per day, with norepinephrine effects becoming clinically significant from ≥ 150–225 mg per day, and dopamine reuptake inhibition from > 225 mg per day. Therefore, tricylic antidepressants and SNRIs demonstrate dose-response effects for efficacy owing to their multiple receptor effects with higher doses being more effective where they are tolerated.

Results

The results of the search strategy are outlined in Figure 1. We identified a total of 6869 articles from our literature search. After accounting for duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, we screened 56 full-text articles for inclusion in this review. Following the full-text screen, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Articles written in a non-English language were included for screening, but none was eligible for inclusion (Table 1).

Table 1.
Characteristics of included studies.

Of the 12 included studies, 10 expressed numbers of patients 'responsive' after reinstating antidepressant treatment. Of these 10 studies, 5 included no tapering of antidepressant dose when discontinuing the antidepressant. Nine included studies examined the treatment of depression (as it was defined at the time of each study), one OCD, one dysthymia and one social phobia with GAD.

Narrative description of included studies

This was a multisite double-blind placebo-controlled RCT in patients with major depressive disorder. Patients who responded to 60 mg duloxetine after 12 weeks of treatment were randomised to placebo or continuation with duloxetine. In the placebo group, the dose of duloxetine was reduced to 30 mg for 1 week and then stopped. Rescue treatment at the previous dose of duloxetine was used if a relapse occurred. Overall, 26% of patients relapsed and then did not respond to reinstated duloxetine.

This was a multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of responders to fluoxetine 20 mg a day. Those randomised to placebo had fluoxetine abruptly stopped, and restarted if a relapse occurred. Overall, 11% of participants did not respond at all to fluoxetine on reinstatement after relapse, and 25% of those who previously maintained a response in the initial treatment episode did not maintain a response after restarting treatment.

Antidepressants

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, escitalopram, citalopram, and paroxetine) and SNRIs (eg, duloxetine and venlafaxine) are the largest groups of nonhormone therapies studied, both in healthy women and cancer patients with VMS. They can reduce hot flash frequency by up to 58% and hot flash scores by up to 65%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs have also been compared with other drugs such as clonidine. As there is no convincing evidence supporting the superiority of any these agents over others, tolerability and side-effect profile are important determinants of treatment outcome. At present, paroxetine (Brisdelle, 7.5 mg) is the only antidepressant approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe VMS associated with menopause. Its efficacy has also been demonstrated in patients with breast and gynecological cancers. However, due to its strong inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme, paroxetine should be avoided in patients on tamoxifen treatment. Active metabolites of tamoxifen can be decreased by up to 64% in patients taking paroxetine. Likewise, fluoxetine, another strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, should also be avoided in tamoxifen-treated patients. In older adults, venlafaxine and paroxetine may not be the initial drug of choice due to risk of withdrawal. Escitalopram and citalopram may be the preferred drugs in this age group due to their lower side effect profile. Compared with citalopram, there are fewer cardiac side effects with escitalopram (eg, QTc prolongation). Drowsiness and dizziness are common adverse effects of SSRIs and SNRIs and can be potentially managed by adjusting the timing of administration. Taking the medication at night may not only alleviate symptoms from nocturnal VMS more effectively but also mitigate side effects such as nausea. Caution should be exercised in patients with hyponatremia, which can be associated with both cancer and SSRI use. Other adverse effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction and weight gain, which may overlap with symptoms of menopause, and should be considered in discussion on VMS treatment options. Regardless of the drug chosen, the lowest possible dose necessary for symptom relief should be used. Upon decision to stop the therapy, tapering should be done to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

2.4 Discontinuing Venlafaxine Extended-Release Tablets

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, other SNRI's, and SSRI's have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. In clinical trials with venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, tapering was achieved by reducing the daily dose by 75 mg at 1 week intervals. Individualization of tapering may be necessary.

2.5 Switching Patients from Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Immediate-Release Tablets

Depressed patients who are currently being treated at a therapeutic dose with venlafaxine hydrochloride immediate-release tablets may be switched to venlafaxine extended-release tablets at the nearest equivalent dose (mg/day), e.g., 37.5 mg venlafaxine two-times-a-day to 75 mg venlafaxine extended-release tablets once daily. However, individual dosage adjustments may be necessary.

2.6 Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with venlafaxine extended-release tablets. Conversely, at least 7 days should be allowed after stopping venlafaxine extended-release tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Discontinuation of active treatment — double-blind serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) discontinuation trials in adults with OCD show heterogeneous relapse outcomes: Pato et al. reported that 89% of 18 clomipramine responders had "substantial recurrence" 7 weeks after being blindly switched over 4 days to placebo; Romano et al. found no significant difference in 1-year relapse estimates between fluoxetine continuation (21%, n = 36) and placebo (32%, n = 35) after 5 months of fluoxetine, with relapse defined as a ≥ 50% loss of improvement on the Y-BOCS, a Y-BOCS score of ≥ 19, and a CGI-I rating of much or very much worse; Koran et al. found over 28 weeks low relapse regardless of sertraline continuation (3% [3/108]) or switch to placebo (4% [5/113]) after a 2-week taper, with relapse defined as a ≥ 2-point increase on Y-BOCS and a ≥ 1-point increase in CGI-I at three consecutive visits at 2-week intervals, and reported rates of relapse or discontinuation because of insufficient response of 9% (sertraline) versus 24% (placebo); Hollander et al. found among paroxetine responders that continuation for 6 months yielded a lower relapse rate (37.7%) than immediate switch to placebo (58.8%) and a longer time to relapse (62.9 days vs. 28.5 days), with relapse defined as return to pretreatment Y-BOCS or a ≥ 1-point increase on the CGI-severity (CGI-S) scale, and overall, double-blind discontinuation studies reported SRI relapse rates ranging from 4% over 28 weeks to 89% over 7 weeks.

Neonatal adaptation syndrome with in utero SSRI or serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) exposure includes irritability, restlessness, tremors, hyperreflexia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, disruptions in sleep, poor feeding, and, rarely, seizures; symptoms typically emerge within the first few days of life and resolve within 2 weeks, with published prevalence ranging from 5% to 85% and most studies estimating 10% to 30%; fluoxetine and paroxetine have been implicated more commonly; pregnant individuals taking an SSRI or SNRI should deliver in a hospital to facilitate pediatric assessment and monitoring if needed, supportive measures such as skin-to-skin contact and frequent feedings can be used, and discontinuing or decreasing antidepressant dose before delivery to reduce risk is not recommended clinical practice because observational data do not show risk mitigation and tapering increases relapse risk.

### Loss of responsiveness on reinstatement of antidepressants after treatment interruption – A systematic review [^115GV6k5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found data on 594 participants who stopped and then restarted an individual antidepressant with a gap in treatment of between 5 days and greater than 2 years. Of 10 studies reporting failure rates on re-exposure to an antidepressant (n = 362), non-response occurred in 4%–57% of participants. In studies not reporting response rates, there was evidence of reduced magnitude of response on restarting. Given these observations, there is some certainty that breaks in treatment can lead to loss of antidepressant response. However, there is much less certainty about the factors that influence future non-responsiveness and the degree to which response is lost.

Interpretation of reported outcomes is made difficult by several considerations. Most of these studies included either no tapering period or a very rapid tapering of antidepressant treatment, whereas some had prolonged tapering periods. Risk of non-response did not seem to be associated with the tapering method. In fact, the only study in which participants showed no loss of responsiveness was one in which antidepressants were deliberately withdrawn abruptly. However, in this study, participants did not relapse, as such, but merely showed inflated depression rating scale scores because of the presence of withdrawal symptoms. Thus, the effect of reinstatement was to cause withdrawal symptoms to abate rather than to re-exert an antidepressant effect. For many studies, it is much less clear whether antidepressants were reinstated because of relapse of the disorder for which they initially received treatment or because antidepressant withdrawal symptoms mimicked relapse. The study with the longest withdrawal period had the highest non-response rate (57%), perhaps reflecting the absence of reinstatement effects on withdrawal symptoms. It is also possible that reinstatement initially mitigates withdrawal symptoms but does not provide longer-term antidepressant or other activity – this seems to have been demonstrated bywho observed a reduced maintenance of response in patients who had previously discontinued fluoxetine abruptly.

### Selecting appropriate treatment for patients who are nonresponsive to initial therapy [^111Uk4sv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Depression can be a chronic illness, and several treatment steps are often needed to achieve sustained symptom remission and return patients to premorbid levels of functioning. Patients with chronic depressive illness, early onset, concurrent psychiatric or medical conditions, difficult psychosocial problems, or comorbid melancholic and anxious features may require additional treatment steps. Next-step strategies, after optimizing the dose and extending the treatment trial of the initial antidepressant, include switching antidepressants, adding another antidepressant, and augmenting with a nonantidepressant agent.

### Escitalopram (Escitalopram oxalate) [^111DUEQ5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Serotonin Syndrome

SSRIs, including escitalopram, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. MAOIs [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination) seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of escitalopram with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate escitalopram in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking escitalopram, discontinue escitalopram before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Monitor all patients taking escitalopram for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with escitalopram and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of escitalopram with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

### Depression in children and adolescents: evaluation and treatment [^11779zdF]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of major unipolar depression in children and adolescents is increasing in the United States. In 2016, approximately 5% of 12-year-olds and 17% of 17-year-olds reported experiencing a major depressive episode in the previous 12 months. Screening for depression in adolescents 12 years and older should be conducted annually using a validated instrument, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9: Modified for Teens. If the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment should be initiated for persistent, moderate, and severe depression. Active support and monitoring may be sufficient for mild, self-limited depression. For more severe depression, evidence indicates greater response to treatment when psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy) and an antidepressant are used concurrently, compared with either treatment alone. Fluoxetine and escitalopram are the only antidepressants approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of depression in children and adolescents. Fluoxetine may be used in patients older than eight years, and escitalopram may be used in patients 12 years and older. Monitoring for suicidality is necessary in children and adolescents receiving pharmacotherapy, with frequency of monitoring based on each patient's individual risk. The decision to modify treatment (add, increase, change the medication or add psychotherapy) should be made after about four to eight weeks. Consultation with or referral to a mental health subspecialist is warranted if symptoms worsen or do not improve despite treatment and for those who become a risk to themselves or others.

### Clozapine [^112XWv3R]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Re-Initiation of Treatment

When restarting clozapine tablets in patients who have had even a brief interruption in treatment with clozapine dosage must be reduced. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If one day's dosing has been missed, resume treatment at 40% to 50% of the established dose. If two days dosing have been missed, resume dose at approximately 25% of the established dosage. For longer interruptions, re-initiate at a dosage of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. If these dosages are well-tolerated, the dosage may be increased to the previous dosage more quickly than recommended for initial treatment.

2.6 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors or CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort, and rifampin); or CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7)].

2.7 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers

It may be necessary to reduce the clozapine tablets dose in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, or in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### Medication-induced weight change across common antidepressant treatments: a target trial emulation study [^115ZQUzS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are among the most commonly prescribed medications, but evidence on comparative weight change for specific first-line treatments is limited.

Objective

To compare weight change across common first-line antidepressant treatments by emulating a target trial.

Design

Observational cohort study over 24 months.

Setting

Electronic health record (EHR) data from 2010 to 2019 across 8 U.S. health systems.

Participants

183118 patients.

Measurements

Prescription data determined initiation of treatment with sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, duloxetine, or venlafaxine. The investigators estimated the population-level effects of initiating each treatment, relative to sertraline, on mean weight change (primary) and the probability of gaining at least 5% of baseline weight (secondary) 6 months after initiation. Inverse probability weighting of repeated outcome marginal structural models was used to account for baseline confounding and informative outcome measurement. In secondary analyses, the effects of initiating and adhering to each treatment protocol were estimated.

Results

Compared with that for sertraline, estimated 6-month weight gain was higher for escitalopram (difference, 0.41 kg [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52 kg]), paroxetine (difference, 0.37 kg [CI, 0.20 to 0.54 kg]), duloxetine (difference, 0.34 kg [CI, 0.22 to 0.44 kg]), venlafaxine (difference, 0.17 kg [CI, 0.03 to 0.31 kg]), and citalopram (difference, 0.12 kg [CI, 0.02 to 0.23 kg]); similar for fluoxetine (difference, -0.07 kg [CI, -0.19 to 0.04 kg]); and lower for bupropion (difference, -0.22 kg [CI, -0.33 to -0.12 kg]). Escitalopram, paroxetine, and duloxetine were associated with 10% to 15% higher risk for gaining at least 5% of baseline weight, whereas bupropion was associated with 15% reduced risk. When the effects of initiation and adherence were estimated, associations were stronger but had wider CIs. Six-month adherence ranged from 28% (duloxetine) to 41% (bupropion).

Limitation

No data on medication dispensing, low medication adherence, incomplete data on adherence, and incomplete data on weight measures across time points.

Conclusion

Small differences in mean weight change were found between 8 first-line antidepressants, with bupropion consistently showing the least weight gain, although adherence to medications over follow-up was low. Clinicians could consider potential weight gain when initiating antidepressant treatment.

### A mega-analysis of fixed-dose trials reveals dose-dependency and a rapid onset of action for the antidepressant effect of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^111eAXBY]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Data acquisition

Patient-level data from all drug company-sponsored fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trials regarding the treatment of depression in adults that have been conducted for citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine and sertraline were requested from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, Brentford, UK; paroxetine), Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA; fluoxetine), Lundbeck (Valby, Denmark; citalopram and escitalopram), Actavis (Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ, USA; escitalopram) and Pfizer (New York, NY, USA; sertraline). Data for fluvoxamine were not requested, as it was deemed sufficient to include those SSRIs that are currently commonly prescribed for the treatment of depression. Whereas the manufacturers of citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline sent us the requested data, individual item data on fluoxetine were unfortunately not available in an electronic format and could hence not be delivered. Although we did obtain patient-level data also from the escitalopram trials conducted by Lundbeck, these were not relevant for this analysis since only one dose (10 mg) had been tested using a fixed-dose design. We have tried to obtain patient-level data from trials sponsored by the other company involved in the clinical trial program for escitalopram, that is, Forest, but the company that has since then acquired Forest, that is, Actavis, has unfortunately not been able to submit the requested information in electronic format. We confirmed that we had access to all pertinent studies regarding citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline by examining the Food and Drug Administration-approval packages for the relevant drugs.

Only two sertraline studies (PZ/101 and PZ/310) comprised a 400-mg dose, and these lasted for 4 weeks only; hence, no efficacy measures were available for this dosage beyond week 4. The polymeric matrix used in paroxetine-controlled-release (CR) releases ~80% of the active compound; the company hence used the doses 12.5 and 25 mg of paroxetine CR, assuming that they should correspond to 10 and 20 mg of paroxetine immediate-release. We have similarly assumed that patients medicating with paroxetine CR 12.5 or 25 mg per day received a daily paroxetine dose of 10 and 20 mg, respectively. None of the studies included a comparator SSRI given in a fixed-dose manner; therefore, for each study only data regarding one compound were obtained.

### Open-label trial of escitalopram in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder [^117DERU9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent, disabling illness. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered first-line medication treatment, with sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine being the most studied. More limited but favorable data suggest that citalopram, an SSRI, may also have a role in the treatment of PTSD. Its S-enantiomer escitalopram, which may have faster onset and greater magnitude of effect than citalopram in other conditions, has not yet been investigated in PTSD.

Objective

To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of escitalopram in the treatment of PTSD.

Method

A 12-week, prospective, open-label trial of escitalopram was conducted from January 2003 through August 2004 in military veterans with PTSD. Escitalopram was initiated at 10 mg daily for 4 weeks, then increased to 20 mg daily for the remainder of the study. Concomitant psychiatric medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. The primary outcome variable was the change from baseline to endpoint in global Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-Symptom version (CAPS-SX) score. Secondary efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS). Posttraumatic stress disorder and comorbid diagnoses were established using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.

Results

Twenty-four of 25 patients were evaluated for efficacy. The mean global CAPS-SX score decreased from 79.4 (SD = 15.7) at baseline to 61.2 (SD = 24.7) at the end of the study (p = .0002). The CAPS-C avoidance/numbing and CAPS-D hyper-arousal subscale scores decreased significantly from baseline to endpoint (CAPS-C, p = .0171; CAPS-D, p = .0001), with trend-level reductions observed in CAPS-B reexperiencing subscale scores (p = .0593). Forty-five percent of patients (9/20) were much or very much improved at the end of the study (CGI-I of 1 or 2). The HAM-D and DTS also significantly improved (p = .0063 and p = .0004, respectively). Mild to moderate gastrointestinal disturbances were the most common side effects. Only 4 patients discontinued early because of adverse effects.

Conclusions

This preliminary open-label study suggests that escitalopram is both efficacious and well tolerated in PTSD patients. However, randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these results and to further define its potential role in the treatment of PTSD.

### Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome… [^114er5S8]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. DISCONTINUING MEDICATION Although there are no clinical trials comparing abrupt discontinuation with tapered discontinuation of antidepressants, tapering is recommended by experts, based on the suspected pathophysiology of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. 33 Patients should be forewarned of the possibility of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome if antidepressants are discontinued, and that supervised tapering of medication over six to eight weeks may be required to minimize discontinuation symptoms. Several RCTs have shown that with abrupt cessation of antidepressants, symptoms can begin within days. 16, 17, 22 It may be possible to discontinue medication more quickly if doses are low; discontinuation may take longer after maintenance therapy.

It may be possible to stop fluoxetine therapy without tapering. There are no clear, validated tapering recommendations. However, Table 5 27 offers one expert's recommendations for tapering rates. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. MANAGEMENT If antidepressant discontinuation syndrome occurs and other serious causes of these symptoms have been ruled out, the physician should begin by providing reassurance to the patient that the condition is reversible, is not serious or life threatening, and will run its course within one to two weeks. The physician should then consider restarting the antidepressant medication with a slow dose taper or providing support if the patient desires not to restart the antidepressant. Severe symptoms should resolve in fewer than three days, and often within 24 hours.

If the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome occurs during a tapering of the antidepressant, consider restarting at the original dose and then taper at a slower rate. In cases where slow tapering is poorly tolerated, a medicine with a longer half-life such as fluoxetine may be substituted for the shorter half-life agent. TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome symptoms caused by tricyclic antidepressants that suggest cholinergic rebound may respond to short-term use of anticholinergic agents such as atropine or benztropine. This should be considered especially for patients who are opposed to restarting their tricyclic antidepressant. 34.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^112Vv5Ut]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1: Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, inpatients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for fluoxetine should be written for the smallest quantity of liquid consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

### Strategies for achieving full remission when first-line antidepressants are not enough [^111mcX5y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Remission rates for patients with major depressive disorder are discouragingly low. Even when first-line treatment is administered at an adequate dose for a sufficient duration, approximately two-thirds of patients will fail to achieve remission, and many who remit have residual symptoms. Clinicians must assess problems with the first treatment and select the most appropriate second-line treatment based on patient preference, clinical judgment, and any comorbid conditions. Strategies like implementing psychotherapy, switching agents, or augmenting antidepressants may help patients achieve remission. Patients may also require adjunctive therapy to target common residual symptoms such as fatigue or insomnia.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^112vEbnF]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112EKKmp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) taper — adjunctive medications and protracted withdrawal — emphasizes that "the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response", with guidance to first pause or slow the taper if symptoms emerge and to minimize polypharmacy; if symptoms persist despite a slower taper, medications may be indicated with specialist consultation. The CGC agreed that "no single medication had enough data to support recommending it". The Patient Panel noted that some with protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication and that agents "that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms". Clinicians "should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions", with symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper more likely related to BZD withdrawal; distinct neurological or sensory symptoms "may be related to protracted withdrawal", warranting more frequent monitoring and possible specialist consultation. Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal is lacking, treating underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD); clinicians "should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment" prior to or, if clinically indicated, concurrent with tapering and "should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible" when selecting adjunctive medications.

### Escitalopram therapy for major depression and anxiety disorders [^114dNRWi]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that escitalopram is efficacious in a range of mood and anxiety disorders, but the individual trials are insufficiently large to allow a full exploration of its tolerability.

Objective

To assess the tolerability and safety of escitalopram through analysis of all randomized controlled clinical trials in major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.

Methods

Analyses of tolerability were based on data from all available randomized, double-blind, controlled studies completed by December 2006 in which escitalopram was compared with placebo or active compounds (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine). Adverse events (AEs) that occurred more frequently with escitalopram than with placebo were listed, and tolerability and safety were evaluated.

Results

Nausea was the only AE with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% and 5 percentage points greater than with placebo during short-term treatment. In general, AEs were mild to moderate in severity. AEs related to sexual dysfunction were similarly frequent with escitalopram and citalopram, but were higher with paroxetine. No suicide occurred among escitalopram-treated patients, and there were no significant differences between escitalopram and placebo in incidence of suicidal behavior, measured by self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The 8 week withdrawal rate due to AEs was higher with escitalopram than with placebo (7.3% vs 2.8%; p < 0.001) but lower than with paroxetine (6.6% vs 9.0%; p < 0.01) or venlafaxine (6.1% vs 13.2%; p < 0.01) (Fisher's Exact test, 2 tailed). Compared with paroxetine, escitalopram resulted in significantly fewer discontinuation symptoms (average increase in Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale of 1.6 vs 3.9; p < 0.01). There were no clinically relevant changes in clinical laboratory values in patients treated with escitalopram. Mean weight change after 6 months of treatment with escitalopram (0.58 ± 2.63 kg) was similar to that with placebo (0.15 ± 2.33 kg). The incidence of cardiovascular events was similar to that with placebo. The risk of AEs was no higher in special patient populations, such as the elderly (≥ 65 y of age) or those with hepatic dysfunction.

Conclusions

Based on data from randomized controlled trials involving more than 4000 escitalopram-treated patients, escitalopram (10–20 mg/day) is safe and well tolerated in short- and long-term treatment.

### Escitalopram in major depressive disorder: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose, parallel trial in a Chinese population [^116b1o1K]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

Escitalopram, the S-enantiomer of citalopram and the most selective of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of major depression in white populations. Our aim in this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in Chinese patients with moderate to severe major depression. Patients who met DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode were enrolled in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose comparison trial. Patients were given escitalopram 10 mg/day or fluoxetine 20 mg/day for 8 weeks. All patients were assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Tolerability was assessed on the basis of adverse effects (measured with a locally developed checklist), regular biochemical tests, and electrocardiograph (ECG) assessments. Two hundred forty patients were enrolled and randomized to escitalopram (123 patients) or fluoxetine (117 patients). The HAM-D-17 total scores of both groups decreased significantly from baseline, but there was no significant difference at week 8 between the two groups (15.8 for escitalopram and 14.7 for fluoxetine; P > .05). There were no significant differences in response rates at all visits after treatment based on either HAM-D-17 or MADRS. A post hoc analysis indicated that escitalopram was superior to fluoxetine on two items of the HAM-D-17: "depressed mood" (P = 0.023) and "work and interest" (P = 0.024). The adverse events reported in the escitalopram and fluoxetine groups were comparable, and most were mild to moderate. Both drugs showed good compliance profiles. Escitalopram 10 mg/day is at least as efficacious as fluoxetine 20 mg/day and well tolerated in Chinese patients with major depression, with possible superiority in some core symptoms such as "depressed mood" and "work and interest".

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^115jCvVe]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Combination treatment for acute major depressive disorder (MDD) in youth — structure and coordination — is generally supported by expert consensus in the United States and typically involves concurrent psychotherapy and fluoxetine delivered in the same facility to enhance communication. Intensity is front‑loaded: weekly psychotherapy for 3 to 4 months with later booster sessions, and medication visits weekly in the first month tapering to bi‑monthly in the second month and monthly to quarterly thereafter, with parents involved initially in psychoeducation and intermittently thereafter as indicated.

4.4.3 Step 3: add on or switch therapy (alternate first‐line agents)

Across several different medications for bipolar depression, early improvement (after 2 weeks) has been found to be a reasonable predictor of overall response, whereas lack of early improvement is a more robust predictor of non‐response. 255 Lamotrigine is the exception to this rule, given a necessary slow titration initiating the medication. In the case of non‐response, dosing should be optimized and issues of non‐adherence identified and addressed (see Section 2) prior to adjusting treatment strategies.

When determining whether an agent should be switched or another first‐line agent be added on to any current treatment, the effectiveness of each of the medications needs to be understood in the context of all the goals of managing BD. It is often the case that a medication may be selected to address several goals; for instance, lithium could be added for acute depression with intent to also bolster anti‐manic prophylaxis. In this scenario, if lithium is ineffective in the individual patient for an acute bipolar depression but is also being used over the long term for anti‐manic prophylaxis, then an "add‐on" intervention should be the next treatment for the acute bipolar depression. If, for instance, the anti‐manic prophylaxis is already being fully provided by an atypical antipsychotic, then the new medication could replace lithium via a switch strategy. Decision‐making must also address efficacy for comorbid conditions, as well as tolerability concerns. In principle, all things being equal, a switch is preferred over add‐on to limit the degree of polypharmacy, but the clinical reality is that medications may be helpful for some but not all components of the illness, and using rational polypharmacy via add‐on treatments is often required. For situations in which patients experience a depressive episode while already receiving an adequately dosed antidepressant, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing or switching the class of antidepressant, unless clear benefits are apparent in reducing the severity or frequency of depressive episodes. Switch of medications should be done in an overlap and taper manner unless there is medical necessity for abrupt discontinuation. 257

All first‐line options should be tried in adequate doses for an adequate duration of time before considering second‐line options either as an add‐on or switch strategy.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^113h76DH]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28554 records were identified through our search (24524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^111thmid]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Adolescent major depressive disorder — additional pharmacotherapy guidance for initial treatment notes that information is lacking regarding other medication options for adolescents; thus, if fluoxetine is not a treatment option or is not acceptable, the panel recommends shared decision-making regarding medication options with a child psychiatrist in addition to the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care. This is a Conditional recommendation for use, and the stated rationale is that the recommendation is due to safety concerns such as increased suicide risk for adolescents when using other medications.

Pharmacological interventions

In individuals with CF, antidepressant medication should generally be prescribed in conjunction with psychological interventions, as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. For those with severe depression, evidence supports the combined use of antidepressants and psychological interventions as the most effective initial therapy. For adolescents and adults with CF who report moderate depression or moderate-to-severe anxiety, antidepressant medication should be considered when psychological interventions are not feasible or fully effective (see figures 2 and 3). See Recommendations 11, 12 and 13 in table 1.

When pharmacotherapy is needed, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine are appropriate initial choices for most adolescents and adults with CF (see online supplementary appendix D and table 4). The ICMH sought to identify a short list of medications with strong evidence for their use in medical populations. SSRIs, although commonly referred to as antidepressants, are recommended by virtually all published guidelines as first-line medications for both depression and anxiety. Given the frequent co-occurrence of depression and anxiety in CF, the effectiveness of SSRIs in treating either condition or both simultaneously is advantageous; this has not been demonstrated for many alternative antidepressants or antianxiety agents. Among the SSRIs and alternative agents, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine are more likely to be available inexpensively in many countries, covered by health plans, have regulatory approvals in a variety of age groups and minimise the potential for medication interactions and side effects. See Recommendation 14 in table 1.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^113RBL76]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy — SSRI exposure and peripartum dosing in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is addressed by noting risk signals and dose considerations: "Some evidence also suggests an increase in the likelihood of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn when the patient receives an SSRI during the third trimester (298)", and because "the severity of OCD symptoms may not rapidly increase when medication is tapered, tapering the patient's SRI dose during the last weeks of pregnancy may be considered". Long-term child outcome data are limited; "The very limited data regarding long-term effects of exposure throughout pregnancy to TCAs or SSRIs do not suggest an elevated risk of abnormalities in cognitive function, language, temperament, or general behavior between ages 15 and 71 months (299)", and "one study found no evidence for developmental delay at up to 2 years of age associated with in utero exposure to TCAs, fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine at varying times and for varying durations (295)". Although not OCD-specific, third-trimester dose needs can change: "increases in the SSRI dose have been needed in the third trimester to maintain remission in major depression".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^116yqEjn]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions. The CGC noted that distinguishing BZD withdrawal symptoms from recurrence of symptoms related to underlying conditions can be difficult. Based on clinical experience, symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage changes and/or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper are more likely to be related to BZD withdrawal. However, if symptoms do not resolve after pausing the taper, it may be unclear whether the symptoms are related to protracted withdrawal (which can last for months or years), worsening or new physical or mental health conditions (e.g. anxiety or sleep-related disorders), or a combination of withdrawal and underlying conditions. If the patient experiences physical or psychological symptoms that are distinct from symptoms of the underlying condition (e.g. neurological or sensory symptoms), they may be related to protracted withdrawal. In these instances, more frequent monitoring may be warranted. Clinicians may also consult with specialists appropriate to patients' symptoms.

Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal symptoms is lacking, treating symptoms of underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD; see Appendix 7 for a list of CPGs on the management of conditions for which BZDs are commonly prescribed). Clinicians should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment for any psychiatric disorder prior to or, if clinically indicated (e.g. due to imminent risks related to continued BZD use), concurrent with the taper. Clinicians should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible when selecting adjunctive medications (see Appendix 5).

CI: confidence interval; ESC: escitalopram; LOCF: last observation carried forward; MADRS: Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale; SNRI: selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; SSRI: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

The recent meta-analysis byconcluded that there were clinically important differences between antidepressants in terms of efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (patient discontinuation); the conclusions were in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. This independently funded meta-analysis systematically reviewed 117 RCTs and evaluated 12 commonly prescribed antidepressants, including citalopram, escitalopram, duloxetine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline and venlafaxine, in 25,928 patients with unipolar MDD. The methodology used differed from other meta-analyses, since it incorporated a matrix design to allow multiple treatment comparisons. The meta-analysis did not include outcomes such as side-effects, toxic effects, discontinuation symptoms and social functioning. Mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine and sertraline were more efficacious than duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and reboxetine. Escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram and bupropion were judged to be more acceptable than the other antidepressants evaluated. Thus, escitalopram and sertraline were established as treatments of choice in depression.

5.15 Discontinuation Adverse Reactions

During marketing of fluoxetine, SNRIs, and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these reactions are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluoxetine. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentration decrease gradually at the conclusion of therapy which may minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms with this drug.

5.16 Fluoxetine and Olanzapine in Combination

When using fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination, also refer to the Warnings and Precautions section of the package insert for Symbyax.

5.17 Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SSRIs, including fluoxetine, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of fluoxetine and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.

### Switching antidepressants in the treatment of major depression: when, how and what to switch to? [^116YWLng]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Switching antidepressant medications is recommended when an initial antidepressant is not effective, when it is unable to be tolerated or when there are significant drug interactions. The aim of this paper is to review the evidence regarding when to switch antidepressants and the optimal approach to switching.

Methods

Clinical and academic experts in mood disorders from Australia and New Zealand (Treatment Algorithm Group, TAG) met to discuss the key considerations regarding switching antidepressants in the treatment of depression and formulate recommendations about switching strategies.

Results

While switching is recommended, there is limited data to guide on how best to approach switching antidepressants (e.g. whether to switch within class or out of class), and how to define the best time to consider switching. Broadly, switching within class after non-response is recommended for mild-moderate depression and out-of-class for patients with a more severe depression or melancholia.

Limitations

There is a limited evidence-base to draw on to make definitive recommendations on switching approaches.

Conclusions

Switching antidepressants is an appropriate strategy to use if there is a minimal response to an initial antidepressant. Further research is required to determine the optimal switching approach.

### Response rates to fluoxetine in subjects who initially show no improvement [^113E86q6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This study sought to investigate the likelihood that subjects will respond to continued antidepressant therapy when little or no benefit has yet been observed.

Method

Six hundred twenty-seven subjects diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were recruited in a 12-week open-label trial with fluoxetine, which was designed as a preliminary phase to a subsequent 52-week continuation trial, which was conducted in 1997–2003. For each week of the study, a calculation was made for all subjects who had heretofore demonstrated little or no improvement as to the likelihood of converting to a positive response in subsequent weeks as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions scale, the primary outcome measure. In order to compare our findings with prior research, we focused primarily on outcomes at weeks 6, 8, and 12.

Results

The likelihood of converting to a positive response decreased the longer subjects remained unimproved. When week 6 was used as the end point, the likelihood of converting to a positive response for unimproved subjects at week 1 was 36% (n = 302); the respective conversion rates for weeks 2–5 were 29% (n = 208) at week 2, 18% (n = 151) at week 3, 17% (n = 120) at week 4, and 9% (n = 91) at week 5. When week 8 was used as the end point, the likelihood of converting to a positive response for unimproved subjects at week 4 was 23% (n = 118) and, at week 6, was 10% (n = 61). Finally, when week 12 was used as the end point, the likelihood of unimproved subjects at weeks 4, 6, and 8 converting to a positive response at week 12 was 50% (n = 117), 33% (n = 60), and 30% (n = 46), respectively.

Conclusions

The study adds to a small, but growing literature that gives clinicians some guidelines to help decide whether to continue an antidepressant trial when little or no benefit has yet been observed.
