## Question

Can you give Toradol without kidney function labs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Toradol (ketorolac) can be given without checking kidney function labs, and under what circumstances that would be acceptable or unsafe. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled contraindications and warnings that hinge on renal function. Then, I should verify how different eGFR thresholds change dosing and monitoring. Next, I will consider high-risk populations such as older adults, those with diabetes or hypertension, and perioperative patients. After that, I need to check what major guidelines say about baseline renal assessment before NSAID use. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline documentation and monitoring if ketorolac is used without prior labs in emergent settings.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology and risk signal. Ketorolac is a potent NSAID that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, thereby reducing renal perfusion in vulnerable patients; it is primarily renally cleared, and its label repeatedly instructs clinicians to assess renal function and use caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because of the risk of acute renal decompensation or failure, which is a direct warning rather than a mere precaution [^114RMPAF] [^113VobR4] [^111z73aR].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled contraindications tied to renal status. The FDA labeling states ketorolac is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine indicating advanced renal impairment and in those at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion, and it instructs dose reduction in patients with moderately elevated serum creatinine, which practically requires knowing baseline renal function to apply safely [^111voDcX] [^1142ZYpJ].

> I need to check the eGFR-based dosing thresholds to quantify risk. Multiple FDA sources converge on avoiding ketorolac when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², capping doses and increasing monitoring when eGFR is 30–60, and allowing standard dosing only when eGFR is 60 or higher, though even then some labels advise caution and monitoring. This pattern is consistent across oral, IV/IM, and intranasal formulations and underscores that baseline renal function materially changes both safety and dose selection [^1167Jry2] [^1152xpwj] [^1152M7AN] [^117TBCxV] [^114kdi8h].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "one-time" dosing. Even a single dose can precipitate AKI in high-risk states such as hypovolemia, heart failure, cirrhosis, or concomitant ACE inhibitors or diuretics, and the label's instruction to correct hypovolemia before administration reinforces that renal perfusion dependency is an immediate concern, not only a cumulative risk. This is why many perioperative and critical care protocols still require baseline renal assessment when feasible [^113JyNqe] [^111z73aR] [^112dK8BW].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure I'm aligned with best practice. The VA/DoD CKD guideline explicitly recommends assessing renal function and avoiding NSAIDs when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and it advises short-term use only after careful risk–benefit analysis with the lowest effective dose and monitoring. The ACS trauma guidance lists NSAIDs as effective but cautions strongly about AKI risk and emphasizes vigilance in older adults and those with renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular comorbidity [^1158fgCQ] [^111rWUiu] [^111stx8T].

> I will now examine high-risk populations where baseline labs are especially critical. Older adults have reduced GFR that is often underestimated by serum creatinine, increasing NSAID-associated AKI risk; patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease, or those on diuretics or ACE inhibitors are at heightened risk of hemodynamically mediated renal injury with NSAIDs; perioperative and ICU patients have high background AKI incidence, making baseline renal function essential to interpret subsequent changes; and patients with sickle cell disease have documented AKI signals with ketorolac exposure, warranting extra caution and lab review [^113pLefB] [^111z73aR] [^112dK8BW] [^115sAKad].

> But wait, what if there is no time to check labs in an emergency. In true emergencies, a single, weight- and age-adjusted dose may be given without labs if the clinical imperative is strong, using the labeled reduced doses for patients 65 years or older, those under 50 kg, or those with suspected renal impairment, and then obtaining renal function as soon as feasible; this is a risk-mitigation approach, not a best-practice endorsement of omitting labs [^1172mmRN] [^1142ZYpJ].

> Let me consider the practical, risk-stratified answer. For low-risk adults under 65 years, over 50 kg, without chronic disease, and not on nephrotoxic or diuretic therapy, a single weight-appropriate dose may be reasonable without prior labs if the indication is compelling and monitoring is planned, but this is a conditional exception. For moderate-risk patients, baseline creatinine and eGFR should be obtained before or contemporaneously with dosing when feasible. For high-risk patients or any scenario involving multiple doses or planned therapy beyond 24 hours, baseline renal function is mandatory to guide dosing and monitoring, and ketorolac should be avoided if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^117TBCxV] [^1152xpwj] [^1167Jry2] [^1158fgCQ].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence if ketorolac is used without prior labs in an emergency. Given the risk of functional AKI with NSAIDs, repeating creatinine within 12–24 hours after exposure and again if clinical status changes is prudent, aligning with inpatient AKI surveillance guidance for at-risk patients after new nephrotoxin exposure; this helps detect early rises that may be reversible with cessation [^113zXqz7] [^1148PT1T].

> Let me synthesize and state this clearly. No, ketorolac should not be given without kidney function assessment in any patient with risk factors, in any setting where multiple doses are anticipated, or when eGFR is unknown and could be below 30 mL/min/1.73 m². A single dose may be considered without prior labs only in carefully selected low-risk adults when the clinical need is urgent, using reduced doses and ensuring prompt lab acquisition and monitoring, with the understanding that this is a risk-mitigated exception rather than standard practice [^114RMPAF] [^111voDcX] [^1158fgCQ] [^1172mmRN].

---

In general, **Toradol (ketorolac) should not be given without checking kidney function labs** in patients with risk factors for renal impairment, older adults, or those on nephrotoxic or diuretic therapy [^111rWUiu] [^111z73aR] [^116JwtXf]. For low-risk patients with no known renal disease, a single dose may be given without labs, but **baseline renal function should be checked before multi-dose or prolonged use** [^notfound]. If renal function is unknown or impaired, use the lowest effective dose, limit total duration to 5 days, and monitor closely for AKI, hyperkalemia, and fluid retention [^113JyNqe] [^1148PT1T].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus emphasize **assessing renal function before administering ketorolac**, particularly in patients with risk factors for renal impairment:

- **Baseline renal function**: Assess renal function before initiating ketorolac therapy, especially in patients with risk factors such as age > 65 years, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease, or concomitant use of nephrotoxic medications or diuretics [^111rWUiu] [^116JwtXf] [^114CxjSX] [^111xnHqa].

- **Contraindications**: Ketorolac is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment or those at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion [^111voDcX].

- **Monitoring**: If ketorolac is administered without prior renal function assessment, close monitoring of renal function is recommended, particularly in high-risk patients [^1148PT1T].

---

## Risks associated with administering ketorolac without renal function assessment

Administering ketorolac without assessing renal function carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Ketorolac can cause dose-dependent reductions in renal blood flow, leading to AKI, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those at risk for renal hypoperfusion [^111z73aR].

- **Hyperkalemia**: NSAIDs, including ketorolac, can cause hyperkalemia, especially in patients with impaired renal function or those taking potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs [^111xnHqa].

- **Fluid retention and edema**: Ketorolac may cause sodium and water retention, exacerbating edema and heart failure symptoms [^111xnHqa].

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Ketorolac inhibits platelet aggregation, increasing the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in patients with coagulopathies or those undergoing surgical procedures [^111voDcX].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ketorolac may be administered without prior renal function assessment

While baseline renal function assessment is generally recommended, certain clinical scenarios may justify administration of ketorolac without prior labs, such as **emergency situations** in which immediate analgesia is required and delaying treatment would cause significant harm. In carefully selected **low-risk patients** — younger individuals (< 65 years) without known renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, or other risk factors — a single dose may be administered without prior renal function assessment, followed by close monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ketorolac should not be administered without renal function assessment

Ketorolac should not be administered without prior renal function assessment in the following scenarios:

- **High-risk patients**: Elderly patients (> 65 years), patients with known renal impairment, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease, or those taking nephrotoxic medications or diuretics [^116JwtXf] [^111z73aR] [^114CxjSX] [^111xnHqa].

- **Multiple dosing or prolonged use**: Baseline renal function assessment is essential before initiating multiple dosing or prolonged therapy (> 24 hours) [^notfound].

- **Perioperative settings**: Patients undergoing surgical procedures, particularly those involving significant blood loss or hemodynamic instability, should have baseline renal function assessed before ketorolac administration [^112yA7Gv] [^112dK8BW].

---

## Recommended monitoring protocols

If ketorolac is administered without prior renal function assessment, the following **monitoring protocols are recommended**:

- **Clinical monitoring**: Closely monitor for signs of renal impairment, including oliguria, hematuria, proteinuria, edema, and electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hyponatremia) [^114kdi8h].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Obtain renal function tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) within 24–48 hours after administration, particularly in high-risk patients or those receiving multiple doses [^113zXqz7].

- **Discontinuation criteria**: Discontinue ketorolac therapy if significant renal impairment or adverse effects are detected [^114oixzQ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Renal function assessment required?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Emergency situations (single dose) | No (if unavoidable) | Immediate analgesia required; monitor closely |
| Low-risk patients (single dose) | No (acceptable) | Minimal risk; monitor if multiple doses |
| High-risk patients (elderly, comorbidities) | Yes | Increased risk of renal impairment |
| Multiple dosing or prolonged use | Yes | Cumulative risk of renal impairment |
| Perioperative settings | Yes | Increased risk of bleeding and renal impairment |

---

In summary, **ketorolac should not be administered without renal function assessment** in patients with risk factors for renal impairment. In low-risk patients, a single dose may be administered without prior labs, but close monitoring is essential. Baseline renal function assessment is critical before initiating multiple dosing or prolonged therapy.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in about 10–15% of hospitalized and more than 50% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Severity of acute and chronic illnesses, iatrogenic exposures, and discrepant AKI definitions lead to variability in prevalence estimates across populations and across studies. Still, mortality rates reach up to 65% in the ICU for patients with AKI.

Clinicians and researchers have classified the heterogeneous etiologies of AKI using "pre-renal", "renal/intra-renal", and "post-renal" categories to explain the nature of the kidney insult. However, this approach fails to account for the overlapping and dynamic nature of AKI due to various etiologies including drugs. For example, a patient with AKI in the context of a decreased effective arterial blood volume from over diuresis — referred to as "pre-renal" AKI, can progress to parenchymal damage if this scenario is prolonged for an extended duration or if another drug such as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administered in combination during this pre-rental state, subsequently referred to as "intra-renal". Leading consensus groups recommend a more explicit and comprehensive AKI classification based on evidence of kidney dysfunction and/or damage. The 10th and 23rd Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) working groups proposed the terms "functional AKI" and "kidney damage" instead of "pre-renal", "renal", and "post-renal". This working group also suggested to exploit both functional and damage kidney biomarkers along with non-kidney biomarkers (e.g. natriuretic peptides, procalcitonin) to better define AKI and characterize its etiologies. Furthermore, the 23rd ADQI expert panel suggested to subcategorize KDIGO stage 1 AKI into 3 substages (1S, 1A, and 1B) and stage 2 and 3 individually into 2 substages (2A & 2B and 3A & 3B, respectively) based on the measurement of functional and damage biomarkers.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketorolac tromethamine and other treatment options before deciding to use ketorolac tromethamine. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. In adults, the combined duration of use of intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine and oral ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days. In adults, the use of oral ketorolac tromethamine is only indicated as continuation therapy to intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine. See package insert for ketorolac tromethamine tablets for transition from intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine (single- or multiple-dose) to multiple-dose oral ketorolac tromethamine.

Note: O ral formulation should not be given as an initial dose.

Use minimum effective dose for the individual patient.

Total duration of treatment in adult patients: the combined duration of use of intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine and oral ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days.

KETOROLAC TROMETHAMINE INJECTION

Ketorolac tromethamine injection may be used as a single or multiple dose on a regular or "as needed" schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to the administration of ketorolac tromethamine (see WARNINGS - Renal Effects). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but ketorolac tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days.

Study design and outcomes

The included studies were identified based on their similar design, patient populations, duration of treatment, and endpoints. Both studies were Phase III trials with a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, multiple-dose, placebo- and active comparator-controlled design. In both studies, patients were randomized to receive HPβCD-diclofenac (Dyloject ™; Hospira, Inc. a Pfizer company, Lake Forest, IL, USA), ketorolac, or placebo, according to a computer-generated random number code. Investigators, clinical staff, and patients were blinded to treatment group assignment. Dose levels of individual study treatments in the orthopedic surgery study were not blinded, however. Patients in the abdominal/pelvic surgery study received 18.75 or 37.5 mg HPβCD-diclofenac (based on randomization), 30 mg ketorolac, or placebo. Patients in the orthopedic surgery study received either 18.75, 37.5, or 50 mg HPβCD-diclofenac, based on the presence of defined risk factors. The standard dose was 37.5 mg; however, patients weighing < 50 kg, aged ≥ 65 years, or with NSAID-related gastrointestinal risk factors, hepatic impairment, or renal insufficiency (based on serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen measures being greater than the upper limit of normal) received the 18.75 mg dose, and patients ≥ 95 kg with no predefined risk factors received 50 mg. Dose adjustment of ketorolac in the orthopedic surgery study was similar. Patients < 65 years old and without renal insufficiency received a standard dose of 30 mg, while high-risk patients received 15 mg.

Study medication was given as an IV bolus injection, with the first dose given ≤ 6 hours following surgery to patients reporting moderate to severe pain on the VAS. The time of first study drug administration was taken as time 0, and subsequent doses were given every 6 hours until discharge or withdrawal/discontinuation. In the abdominal/pelvic surgery population, patients were observed for at least 48 hours following the first study drug dose, and for up to 5 days; in the orthopedic surgery population, patients were observed for at least 24 hours, and for up to 5 days. Safety was monitored throughout both studies by physical examinations, laboratory testing, vital signs, ECG, AEs, and evaluation of thrombophlebitis and wound healing (safety data previously reported).

The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

NSAIDs in primary total joint arthroplasty — We suggest future research on perioperative administration of NSAIDs focus on determining the optimal timing of the dosage and type of NSAID (selective or non-selective) to reduce the postoperative pain and/or reduction in opioid consumption. Because the current literature only has a single study investigating the use of a selective NSAID after discharge of a primary TKA, additional research is still necessary, and we suggest future research focus on the use of selective NSAIDs after discharge of primary hip and knee arthroplasties. If future research has been able to demonstrate the safe utilization of extended non-selective NSAIDs following primary TJA, then we would suggest the inclusion of non-selective NSAIDs in future research following discharge from primary TJA. Although we have robust literature to favor the effectiveness of IV ketorolac, we lack evidence to support the appropriate dosage that weighs the need to achieve adequate pain control while avoiding the risks of higher doses. The workgroup believes the largest impediment to wider adoption of NSAIDs relates to concerns surrounding the gastrointestinal and renal safety of the broad use of medications such as preoperative and postoperative oral NSAIDs with IV ketorolac, IV corticosteroids, and DVT prophylaxis of aspirin. As a result, we suggest continued monitoring for adverse events as NSAIDs become more widely adopted following primary TJA.

### Ketorolac tromethamine [^113VobR4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Impaired Renal Function

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to these patients.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to ketorolac tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS - Pre-existing Asthma). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.

### Comparing the efficacy of combining ketorolac and paracetamol (acetaminophen) with paracetamol alone on postoperative pain after laminectomy. A double-blinded randomized clinical trial [^114eKoYZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This randomized double-blinded controlled trial was conducted at a Kowsar Hospital (Sanandaj, Iran) between March 2023 and December 2024, after the Kurdistan University of Medical Science ethics committee approval (IR.MUK.REC.1401.070 ethics.research.ac.ir). Clinical trial registration was done before patients' enrolment at(IRCT20221010056140N1, registration date: 2023/01/28). Informed consent was obtained from the patient before enrolment in the study.

Study population

Participants were adults who electively underwent a laminectomy (1–2 levels) and were hospitalized in the Kowsar Hospital Neurosurgery ward. The inclusion criteria are age between 18 and 65, Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 30, and American Society Anesthesiologist Score one or two. Additionally, the exclusion criteria: Addiction and daily use of opioids, alcohol, or painkiller, abuser or alcohol consumption before entering the operating room, allergy to the study drugs, contraindications to the medications used, cardiovascular disease, use of antidepressants, high blood pressure, seizures, liver or kidney dysfunction, and weight less than 50 kg.

The sampling method used for this study was that patients who met the inclusion criteria of the study, after recording the demographic data and obtaining informed consent, would be included in the study. However, considering the importance of random allocation in clinical trial studies to control possible confounders, the patient was randomly assigned to either the intervention (Acetaminophen with Ketorolac) or the control group (Acetaminophen alone). By this method, bias was minimized and the study's objectivity was ensured.

Randomization

Random allocation was performed by forming random blocks of 4 and then randomly selecting patients from these blocks. The surgeon, patients, researchers, and statistical consultants will be blinded in this study. To ensure the study was double-blinded, the drugs were dissolved in 100 mL of normal saline to make them indistinguishable in color and appearance. The drugs were injected with coded syringes (serum A for group A and serum B for group B) by a physician who was unaware of the details of the patients' treatment plan. The researcher and the statistical consultant were unaware of the type of drug each group received. By blinding the researcher who performed the intervention, the researcher remained unaware of the patients' recorded data until the end of the trial.

Postoperative Endpoints and Safety Assessment

Primary endpoints

♦ Efficacy: in-hospital mortality, organ malperfusion syndrome, requirement for permanent dialysis, need for tracheostomy, neurological impairment, postoperative mechanical circulatory support, unplanned cardiac reoperation
♦ Safety: gastrointestinal ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding, gastrointestinal perforation, postoperative hemorrhage (exceeding 1000 mL within 24 h), renal failure, liver failure, drug allergies, other serious adverse events related to drug administration.

Secondary Endpoints and other safety assessment

Inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and others (Additional file 1: Table S1). Surgical parameters: Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, total surgical time, aortic cross-clamping duration, among others (Table 1). Postoperative complications: Incidence of events such as cardiac arrest, stroke, and pneumonia (Table 2). Cytokine measurements: Levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), etc. (Additional file 1: Table S1). Ketorolac has a longstanding presence in clinical practice and is typically well tolerated. However, the ACC/AHA guidelines indicate that ketorolac may be associated with hypertension and renal impairment. We monitored and recorded the patients' creatinine, urea, and blood pressure preoperatively, as well as on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Additionally, safety assessment parameters will encompass hypertension (defined as blood pressure exceeding 140/90 mmHg) and stage II or III acute kidney injury (AKI), as diagnosed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Ketorolac) [^115pAZZJ]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated
in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal
impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired
renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor
of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency
are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the
risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to
these patients.

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in
patients without a known previous exposure or hypersensitivity to ketorolac
tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the
aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who
experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe,
potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS:
Preexisting Asthma). Anaphylactoid reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a
fatal outcome. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid
reaction occurs.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective
NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction and stroke, which
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms.
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events
and the steps to take if they occur.

Dose and Duration

Due to inconsistency between studies, it was difficult for this review to draw conclusions on optimal dose or duration. In ketorolac use, more favourable outcomes were seen in studies which looked at a single dose rather than multiple doses, where no effect was seen. However, the timings of these doses could be responsible for this trend, rather than dosage, as single doses were all intraoperative and multiple doses all postoperative. Dosage also appeared to be dependent on patient factors such as weight and renal function. Further research will be required to identify any dose-dependent difference in outcomes.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Sprix) [^116JwtXf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Exercise caution when treating the elderly (65 years and older) with SPRIX. Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.14), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. After observing the response to initial therapy with SPRIX, adjust the dose and frequency to suit an individual patient's needs.

Ketorolac and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, use caution in this patient population, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^112dK8BW]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can lead to a "functional" AKI (defined as an increase in serum creatinine). The prospective Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints for Acute Kidney Injury (TRIBE-AKI) study demonstrated that the graded increase in functional AKI (continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker greater than held angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker greater than no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use) was not accompanied by "structural" AKI (no difference in AKI risk between the three exposure groups, as assessed by four different urinary biomarkers for AKI). The results of a study can be dramatically altered based upon how AKI is defined (serum creatinine changes vs. biomarkers), and this discrepancy may be especially pronounced in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. This study demonstrates that a rise in serum creatinine is not always accompanied by tissue damage (and tissue damage does not always result in rising serum creatinine, i.e. subclinical AKI), highlighting one of the major limitations of serum creatinine as a biomarker.

Management of NSAIDs

NSAIDs have been used to effectively mitigate postoperative pain while decreasing the opioid requirement.NSAIDs can adversely affect renal via prostaglandin mediated afferent arteriolar dilation, which causes reduced glomerular perfusion, leading to acute interstitial nephritis. Drug-associated acute interstitial nephritis presents a cell-mediated immune response, characterized by acute loss of kidney function, interstitial infiltrates, edema, and tubulitis on biopsy (with relative sparing of glomerulus and vasculature). Because of this risk, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (London, United Kingdom) has recommend that NSAIDs be avoided in hypovolemic patients; however, best practices in low-risk patients remain unresolved. A 2018 meta-analysis found that although NSAIDs led to a slight increase in serum creatinine, this was of unclear clinical significance, and no reliable conclusions could be drawn regarding the association between NSAIDs and renal replacement therapy, hospital length of stay, or death. A secondary analysis of data from the Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial found that intraoperative NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor use was significantly associated with increased postoperative AKI, supporting the need for a randomized trial to better define the risk–benefit balance of these perioperative analgesic adjuncts. Emerging proteomic research sheds light on the molecular pathways, specifically differences in prostaglandin synthesis, driving NSAID-attributed AKI in the perioperative space.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

(see also Boxed WARNING)

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to ketorolac tromethamine.

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation and in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions, and PRECAUTIONS, Pre-existing Asthma).

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated as prophylactic analgesic before any major surgery.

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment or in patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion (see WARNINGS for correction of volume depletion).

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine musculature, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage.

Ketorolac tromethamine inhibits platelet function and is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis and those at high risk of bleeding (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients currently receiving aspirin or NSAIDs because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events.

The concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine and probenecid is contraindicated.

The concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine and pentoxifylline is contraindicated.

Ketorolac tromethamine injection is contraindicated for neuraxial (epidural or intrathecal) administration due to its alcohol content.

The Journal of Arthroplasty (2020). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in total joint arthroplasty — findings report no significant differences in adverse outcomes with oral NSAIDs, including any adverse event (0.93 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.85 to 1.02), vomiting (0.82 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.52 to 1.31), nausea (0.84 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.68 to 1.04), blood loss (-0.23 standard mean difference; 95% confidence interval of -0.54 to 0.08), pruritus (1.73 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.96 to 3.13), urinary retention (1.24 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.34 to 4.59), and sedation (0.46 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.16 to 1.26). Similar results were seen for intravenous (IV) ketorolac versus placebo, with direct meta-analysis not significant for any adverse events (0.94 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.59 to 1.50), nausea (0.89 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.70 to 1.12), vomiting (0.73 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.47 to 1.14), blood loss (-0.14 standard mean difference; 95% confidence interval of -0.46 to 0.17), pruritus (0.50 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.22 to 1.12), urinary retention (0.75 relative risk; 95% confidence interval of 0.43 to 1.32), and respiratory depression (-0.05 standard mean difference; 95% confidence interval of -0.28 to 0.18). Despite evidence favoring oral and IV NSAIDs to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption, the gastrointestinal and renal safety profile of oral and IV NSAIDs have not been thoroughly studied in patients following primary total joint arthroplasty. Although nausea and vomiting were frequently reported, more severe complications including upper gastrointestinal bleeding and acute renal failure were not reported. As a result, clinicians should consider the safety of perioperative NSAIDs.

Impaired Renal Function

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to these patients.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to ketorolac tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Pre-existing Asthma). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ketorolac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS).

### Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^114gcyV9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. However, the presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].

Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental exposure or overdose.

2.3 Initial Dosage

Initiate treatment with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day and at the lowest dosage necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to their initial dose of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.

2.4 Dosage Modification in Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, do not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours.

Impaired Renal Function

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated
in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal
impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired
renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor
of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency
are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the
risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to
these patients.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in
patients without a known previous exposure or hypersensitivity to ketorolac
tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the
aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who
experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe,
potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS:
Preexisting Asthma). Anaphylactoid reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a
fatal outcome. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid
reaction occurs.

Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective
NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction and stroke, which
can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a
similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may
be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in
patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the
shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms.
Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events
and the steps to take if they occur.

When administering ketorolac tromethamine injection, the intravenous bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The intramuscular administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins in ~30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing intravenous or intramuscular. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.

Single-Dose Treatment: The following regimen should be limited to single administration use only

Intramuscular Dosing

- Patients < 65 years of age: One dose of 60 mg.

- Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight:

One dose of 30 mg.

Intravenous Dosing

- Patients < 65 years of age: One dose of 30 mg.

- Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight:One dose of 15 mg.

Multiple-Dose Treatment (Intravenous or Intramuscular)

- Patients < 65 years of age: The recommended dose is 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should

not exceed 120 mg.

- For patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired patients (see WARNINGS), and patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs): The recommended dose is 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 60 mg.

For breakthrough pain, do not increase the dose or the frequency of ketorolac tromethamine. Consideration should be given to supplementing these regimens with low doses of opioids "as needed" unless otherwise contraindicated.

Pharmaceutical Information for Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection

Ketorolac tromethamine injection should not be mixed in a small volume (e.g., in a syringe) with morphine sulfate, meperidine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride or hydroxyzine hydrochloride; this will result in precipitation of ketorolac from solution.

NOTE: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Pain management in patients with end-stage renal disease and calciphylaxis-a survey of clinical practices among physicians [^1133xnWv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Avoid morphine, oxycodone, tramadol or codeine as background analgesia as they can rarely be titrated to effect in this population without opioid-induced neurotoxicity. Once pain is stable, transdermal fentanyl or buprenorphine may be used in place of opioids by continuous subcutaneous infusion. If the lesions heal and pain resolves it is important to reduce the opioids step by step and aim to withdraw them fully.

To address the neuropathic element of pain secondary to calciphylaxis, gabapentin 100 mg after each haemodialysis session or pregabalin 25 mg after each haemodialysis session may be used in conjunction with opioids. If the patient is not on haemodialysis, start with a dose of 100 mg of gabapentin on alternate days or 25 mg of pregabalin on alternate days. Caution is needed as gabapentinoids accumulate in ESRD though they are removed by dialysis.

Discuss the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the nephrology team as they are very effective for the management of the inflammatory aspect of pain secondary to calciphylaxis. If residual renal function is not important, use an oral or parenteral NSAID (e.g. ketorolac) by continuous subcutaneous infusion for pain that is not controlled with the measures outlined above. Cover with a proton pump inhibitor is recommended. In general, NSAIDs are best used at the minimally effective dose and for a short duration but their harms are weighed against their opioid sparing effect.

If background pain remains problematic or dose-limiting toxicity is encountered, consider the addition of methadone as a co-analgesic or rotation to methadone from the current opioid. This step may require hospice inpatient care and should only be undertaken with specialist palliative care guidance.

Breakthrough pain control

Even when background pain control is achieved, the patient may continue to experience spontaneous breakthrough pain. Oxycodone 1–2 mg may be used by oral or by subcutaneous injection on a four hourly to 6 hourly basis. In countries where hydromorphone is available, 0.5 mg of hydromorphone sublingually four hourly is useful.

### Expert consensus guidelines on management and best practices for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy [^114oixzQ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive medications should be discontinued 24 hours prior to IL-2 administration, and vital signs and urine output should be checked 2 hours prior to the first IL-2 dose so that abnormalities can be addressed. We recommend checking serum creatinine prior to beginning IL-2 and then two times per day during administration to monitor any changes in renal function. Avoiding intravenous contrast and other nephrotoxins is advisable to minimize renal insult.

Supportive therapy prior to IL-2 administration includes acetaminophen every 4–6 hours or equivalent, indomethacin every 6 hours or other NSAID equivalent (recommended but should not be used if baseline renal function is poor and should be discontinued with any sign of decreasing urine output, rising creatinine, and when platelets are < 50 000 x10ˆ9/L), pantoprazole 40 mg PO/intravenous daily or famotidine 20 mg PO/intravenous two times per day (or equivalent), meperidine 25–50 mg intravenous every 4 hours as needed and/or hydromorphone for rigors, antiemetics, and other medications as per institutional protocols. Maintenance fluids are typically not needed for IL-2 and fluids should be administered cautiously during active IL-2 treatment. Urine output should be assessed prior to each dose; the goal should be to maintain a urine output of at least 0.5 mL/kg/hour. We recommend holding IL-2 if the urine output falls below 4 mL/kg over a period of 8 hours.

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^111xnHqa]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Atkinson et al thoroughly reviewed literature on commonly used opioids in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) setting and ultimately hypothesized that opioids primarily undergoing hepatic phase II metabolism that yields inactive metabolites (such as tapentadol) are highly protein bound, have larger molecular weights, and have higher lipophilicity (to avoid being dialyzed), should be considered first in this population of patients.

NSAIDs have well-documented renal toxicities that can cause acute kidney injury and influence progression of CKD.–They have been shown to increase sodium retention and edema, cause hyperkalemia through decreased delivery of potassium to the distal tubule, cause acute renal failure through disruption of the renal hemodynamic balance, cause nephrotic syndrome by increasing lymphocyte recruitment and activation, and cause acute and chronic renal papillary necrosis through direct toxicity. Nonrenal toxicities include increased blood pressure, decreased antihypertensive effects of several medications, and increased gastrointestinal (GI) bleed risk.

The totality of these toxicities led the American Society of Nephrology to recommend that all patients with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD of all causes avoid NSAID use, in their "Choosing Wisely" campaign published in 2012. This recommendation should further be extended to patients on dialysis. Residual renal function has proven to be important even after commencement of dialysis, because of its implication on dialysis adequacy.NSAIDs have been shown to negatively impact residual renal function, and dialysis patients are more susceptible to fluid and electrolyte changes, have blood pressures that are more difficult to control, and are at higher risk for GI bleeds; thus dialysis patients may be at an even greater risk of harm from NSAID use than the general population.,

Acetaminophen is most commonly used to alleviate mild pain symptoms such as headaches, toothaches, or backaches. The mechanism in which acetaminophen provides analgesia remains unclear; however, it is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus and possibly the spinal cord, with minimal effects on the kidneys. The majority of data supports its renal safety when used in lower, intermittent doses, and only few cases have reported acute renal toxicity after ingestion of larger doses. Chronic high-dose acetaminophen may cause renal function decline (decrease in glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL/min) and has been reported in women who consumed > 3,000 g of acetaminophen over 11 years and has also been associated with tubular necrosis with long-term use (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.28–3.24).

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^11688bKK]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in older adults — potentially inappropriate analgesics: NSAIDs should "Avoid chronic use unless alternatives are not available. When used, combine with gastroprotective agent (e.g. PPI or misoprostol)" because of "Increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding", with a footnote indicating "Other than COX-2 selective agents (e.g., celecoxib)". Indomethacin and ketorolac are "Avoid" due to "Increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (more than other NSAIDs) and acute kidney injury". Skeletal muscle relaxants are "Avoid" as they are "Poorly tolerated due to anticholinergic effects". Tramadol, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) are "Use with caution" because they "May increase risk of SIADH or hyponatremia".

### Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for chronic pain in chronic kidney and end-stage renal disease [^116dFBej]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

There are two basic scenarios a provider will encounter with the treatment of opioids in CKD patients: inheriting the established opioid patient or initiating chronic opioid therapy. Inherited opioid patients should be assessed for risks versus benefits, with an "escape route" in mind if improvement is suboptimal or aberrancy is observed and confirmed.

Due to the risk of respiratory depression and abuse associated with opioids, patients need to be thoroughly evaluated before starting therapy and closely monitored for the duration of treatment. Therapeutic monitoring is complicated by little to no urine output that precludes the ability to perform urine drug monitoring. This should not allow the patient a "free pass" to avoid opioid compliance monitoring. Instead obtaining random serum blood levels should become the standard of care. The Risk Index for Overdose or Serious Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (RIOSORD) could be used to assess patients for opioid-induced respiratory depression and qualify these patients for "take home naloxone".

An obvious barrier for prescribing opioids in this population is the lack of guidance from major pain management organizations, for nearly all aspects of pain management in patients with CKD, which is directly attributable to the lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. Recommendations published in 2007 by Murtagh et al suggested fentanyl, methadone, and tramadol as opioids to be used in advanced CKD patients managed without dialysis. Although these opioids have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles when used in those with renal dysfunction, they still carry their own heightened risks. Methadone can prolong the QTc interval and increase risk of torsades de pointes; fentanyl has extremely variable absorption characteristics, which lead to variable serum concentrations that are not easily controlled; and both tramadol and methadone are ubiquitously fraught with toxicities and polymorphic variabilities associated with phase I cytochrome metabolism.

Hemorrhage

Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and NSAIDs affect platelet aggregation as well, use of ketorolac tromethamine in patients who have coagulation disorders should be undertaken very cautiously, and those patients should be carefully monitored. Patients on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or dicumarol derivatives) have an increased risk of bleeding complications if given ketorolac tromethamine concurrently; therefore, physicians should administer such concomitant therapy only extremely cautiously. The concurrent use of ketorolac tromethamine and therapy that affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low-dose heparin (2,500 to 5,000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans have not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are available, physicians should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks, and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only extremely cautiously. Patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis should be monitored closely.

In postmarketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with the peri-operative use of IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, peri-operative use of ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken with caution when hemostasis is critical (see PRECAUTIONS).

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Ketorolac tromethamine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished clearance of the drug (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and such patients should be followed closely. With the use of ketorolac tromethamine, there have been reports of acute renal failure, interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.

INTRATHECAL OR EPIDURAL ADMINISTRATION

Ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED for intrathecal or epidural administration due to its alcohol content.

RISK DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY

The use of ketorolac tromethamine in labor and delivery is CONTRAINDICATED because it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions.

CONCOMITANT USE WITH NSAIDs

Ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED in patients currently receiving aspirin or NSAIDs because of the cumulative risk of inducing serious NSAID-related side effects.

SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Dosage should be adjusted for patients 65 years or older, for patients under 50 kg (110 lbs.) of body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and for patients with moderately elevated serum creatinine (see WARNINGS). Doses of ketorolac tromethamine injection are not to exceed 60 mg (total dose per day) in these patients.

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^117BuoTs]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a well known and long history of use. Oral ibuprofen was approved in the USA over 40 years ago and has been a nonprescription drug for more than 30 years. IV ibuprofen (Caldolor ®, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. Nashville, TN, USA) was first approved in 2009 for the management of mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with narcotics, and for the reduction of fever in adults. It is the only IV NSAID approved for the treatment of fever in the USA. Since 2002, the safety and effectiveness of IV ibuprofen has been investigated in ten clinical studies, Phases II–IV, conducted under a corporate investigational new drug application (Table 1).

Two other IV NSAIDs are currently available in the US market, ketorolac tromethamine injection ("ketorolac", Toradol, Pfizer Inc. New York, NY, USA) and diclofenac sodium injection ("diclofenac", Dyloject™, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA). Ketorolac injection was approved in 1989 for the short-term management of moderately severe, acute pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. Ketorolac is contraindicated for use in excess of 5 days, for minor or chronic pain, and for use in pediatric patients. Additional limitations on ketorolac administration include prohibitions against all preoperative use, in patients with active ulcers or who are otherwise at a high risk of bleeding, those with advanced renal impairment, and women who are nursing. Diclofenac sodium injection was approved in December 2014 for the management of mild to moderate pain or moderate to severe pain either alone or in combination with opiates. Diclofenac is only approved for use in adults and is contraindicated in patients with known moderate to severe renal insufficiency who may become volume depleted. Neither of these IV NSAIDs are indicated for the treatment of fever.

### An Italian expert consensus on the use of opioids for the management of chronic non-oncological pain in clinical practice: focus on buprenorphine [^11298LQC]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate use of NSAIDS is particularly frequent in elderly people: a large population-based study conducted in Southern Italy recently demonstrated that 36.6% of elderly patients were incident NSAID users, and 9.2% were prescribed ketorolac/indomethacin, which should be avoided in elderly subjects. Furthermore, at least half of all elderly people with chronic kidney disease or congestive heart failure were prescribed NSAIDs, though these drugs should be avoided.

The 3-step approach of the WHO analgesic ladder for oncological pain is appropriate also for non-oncological chronic pain (Statement 3).

Comments: Complete disagreement with this statement was achieved both in the first (45.2%, median 3) and second (34.8%, median 3) round, confirming the need to identify treatment strategy alternatives to the WHO analgesic ladder, which better meet the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations of CNCP.

The WHO analgesic ladder, proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986, is a strategy developed following the recommendations of an international group of experts to provide adequate pain relief for cancer patients. Such strategy has undergone several modifications over the years and is currently applied for managing cancer pain, as well as non-cancer painful conditions associated with degenerative disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, neuropathic pain disorders, and other types of chronic pathologies.

The advantage of the analgesic ladder is its ease of use, even by non-pain medicine experts. However, one important limitation of the WHO pain ladder derives from the role attributed to NSAIDs as first step drugs, which could lead to a false belief that this represents the most secure treatment, favoring its long-term use. In fact, long-term use of NSAIDs combined with opioids for the treatment of moderate pain (second step) can lead to much more serious side effects than those described for opioids.

### Intravenous ibuprofen versus ketorolac for perioperative pain control in open abdominal hysterectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^115vgucE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This randomized double-blinded controlled trial was conducted at a University Hospital between November 2022 and May 2023, after the institutional ethics committee approval (MD-246–2022). Clinical trial registration was done before patients' enrolment at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05610384, Date of registration: 09/11/2022). Informed consent was obtained from the patient before enrolment in the study.

Participants were adult (40–65 years) women with American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification of I-II, scheduled for open elective abdominal hysterectomy with or without salpingo-oophorectomy.

Exclusion criteria were renal impairment (history of renal impairment or kidney function tests above normal reference range), history of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration, inflammatory bowel disease, allergy to any of the study's drugs, significant cardiac morbidity (impaired contractility, ischemic heart disease). Patients undergoing surgery for suspected gynecological cancer, patients on chronic analgesic medication, and patients deemed unable to understand the visual analogue scale (VAS) were also excluded from the study.

Randomization was done using an online randomizer in 1:1 ratio. The group assignment and drug preparation instructions were put inside sequentially-numbered opaque envelopes. An independent researcher handled the envelope-opening and drug-preparation. The three scheduled doses were prepared at once; and the unused preparations were stored in the refrigerator and were marked with the patient's name, hospital number and the time for administration. Ketorolac (Ketolac 30 mg/ 2 mL, AMRIYA PHARM. IND, Alexandria, Egypt) was prepared by diluting 30 mg in 200 mL normal saline; and ibuprofen (Ibuprofen-Arabcomed 100 mg/mL, ARABCOMED, Cairo, Egypt) was prepared by diluting 800 mg in 200 mL normal saline. The attending anesthetist, nurse, data collector and the patient were blinded to the group assignment.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^115KAVB8]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatic and renal impairment

Additional considerations for opioid rotation include the effects of hepatic and renal impairment on opioid dosing recommendations (Table 2). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends assessment of hepatic function based on Child-Pugh ratings (mild, moderate, severe)and defines moderate and severe renal impairment as a creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/minute and < 30 mL/minute, respectively. Many opioid drugs undergo hepatic phase I metabolism mediated by the CYP mono-oxygenases (primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2D6), enzymes that produce both active and inactive metabolites that vary among commonly used opioid agents (Table 3). Moreover, metabolism of opioids by CYP3A4 produces major metabolites of certain opioids that exhibit > 30-fold higher (eg, hydrocodone produces norhydrocodone) and lower (eg, buprenorphine produces norbuprenorphine) affinity for the μ-opioid receptor. Thus, for patients with hepatic or renal impairment undergoing pain management with opioid A, clinicians may consider the following guidance: 1) dose adjustments are required or recommended with a number of opioids, including morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and hydromorphone in patients with renal impairment;,2) patients with renal impairment may be rotated to fentanyl or buprenorphine, which are less affected by renal impairment;,3) tapentadol, tramadol, and methadone should be administered with great caution in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment;, and 4) consider rotation to fentanyl in patients with hepatic impairment, which appear not to alter levels of this opioid.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^113pLefB]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in older adults — standard unidimensional pain rating scales may require modification or be inappropriate for pain assessment in older adults. Physiologic changes that occur with aging may alter both pain perception and response to medications. Because older adults are more sensitive to sedating, gastric irritation, and anticholinergic effects of medications, starting doses need to be empirically reduced. The older adult population is the fastest growing segment of the population, and nearly half of trauma admissions are estimated to involve patients over 65 years by 2050. A complete medical history, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and herbal supplements is essential in order to avoid potentially harmful drug interactions. Age-related declines in hepatic function may reduce drug clearance by up to 40% in the older adult. Decreases in serum albumin concentrations reduce protein binding; increasing distribution volume and free concentration of highly-bound drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Due to changes in body composition, variable reductions in the glomerular filtration rate may be underestimated by standard laboratory values (e.g., serum creatinine). Diminished response by the central nervous system (CNS) to hypercapnia, combined with reduced pulmonary reserve, exaggerates the respiratory depressant effects of opioids and benzodiazepines. Variations in baseline prostaglandin concentrations may increase the risk of both renal and gastrointestinal injury with NSAID use. Decreased cholinergic receptors increase sensitivity to anticholinergic effects of medications.

Methods

Study design and population

Prior to commencement, this single-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial was approved by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board (COA no. Si123/2018) and registered at, NCT03486548, Registered 3 April 2018. The investigation was conducted on patients aged 50–85 years; had American Society of Anesthesiologists physical statuses of I–III; and were scheduled to undergo elective, unilateral, primary TKA at Siriraj Hospital May 2018–December 2019. The inclusion criteria were patients susceptible to the adverse effects of NSAIDs: history of chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 50 ml/min/1.73 m 2), coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, gastric ulcer, or an allergy to NSAIDs other than ketorolac. The exclusion criteria were a bodyweight of < 45 kg; allergy to bupivacaine, ketorolac, or dexamethasone; uncontrolled diabetes; contraindication to regional anesthesia; cognitive impairment; preexisting neuropathy; a neurological deficit in the lower extremities; and preexisting pain requiring the chronic use of oral morphine (20 mg/day or equivalent). Patients who declined to participate were also excluded.

Randomization and blinding

The patients (n = 50) were randomized into an intervention group and a control group in blocks of four. This was achieved by using the sealed-envelope technique and computer-generated randomization lists sourced from an internet-based application. In the intervention group (n = 25), the patients received an SNB with an infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine (20 ml) and dexamethasone (5 mg). As to the control group (n = 25), the patients received only a subcutaneous injection of 1% xylocaine (1 ml) in the popliteal area without an SNB. The patients and assessors were blinded to the treatment allocations.

### Can we not work together to help family practitioners become more effective pain managers? [^114fN8Pi]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Snyder et al recently published a review in American Family Physician titled, "Treating Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: An Update", which provided an overview of pharmacologic treatment options for providers; however, some of the recommendations made by the authors were concerning. Recommendations that caught our attention included statements around pregabalin adjustment for renal impairment, using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), classification of tramadol, tapentadol, and oxycodone in DPN.

While highlighting the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences between pregabalin and gabapentin, the statement regarding pregabalin having "no dosing adjustment requirement in patients with renal impairment" immediately caught our attention. That statement is not consistent with the current published literature and Food and Drug Administration guidance, and may therefore result in substantial confusion and adverse effects for patients if providers implement such misinformation into practice. Pregabalin is not metabolized hepatically and is excreted by the kidneys entirely unchanged and will, therefore, accumulate unless the dose is adjusted for renal dysfunction. The manufacturer labeling lists the maximum recommended dosing for pregabalin as 300 mg in two to three daily divided doses for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30–59 mL/min; 150 mg/day in one to two divided doses in patients with CrCl 15–29 mL/min; and 75 mg/day in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, supplemental doses of pregabalin at 25–75 mg daily after hemodialysis are recommended. Renal adjustment for pregabalin is overwhelmingly recommended in the literature, and according to rates of adverse effects and concentration-dependent toxicity, failure to adjust the dose will result in accumulation and poor treatment outcomes for patients.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^111MdUsT]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4.10.1

We recommend that non-steroidal anti-inflammatories should not be given (1C).

Rationale

Given that the risk of renal side effects from short-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients without pre-existing risk factors is considered to be rare, NSAIDs are currently recommended in the postpartum period for perineal pain when paracetamol provides insufficient relief of symptoms. Although the risk profile of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is considered to be different in CKD, evidence supporting this is mixed. Historical case-control studies show an increased rate of kidney injury and progression to end stage renal disease in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast, data from older-age cohorts taking high-dose NSAIDS are conflicting, Questionnaire data from a female cohort showed no measurable association between NSAID use and renal function decline over 11 years, although the mean eGFR at study commencement was 88 ml/min/1.73m 2. There are no data examining non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in women of reproductive age with risk factors for renal disease progression, in the context of peripartum haemodynamic change. The guideline committee therefore endorses existing recommendations that NSAIDs should be contraindicated in women with a (pre-pregnancy) eGFR < 30mls/min/1.73m 2 (estimated to be equivalent to serum creatinine > 150 μmol/L in pregnancy), and should be avoided where possible in all those with renal impairment due to the possibility of sodium and water retention and a deterioration in renal function.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (toronova SUIK) [^114RMPAF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Impaired Renal Function

Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving ketorolac tromethamine to these patients.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to ketorolac tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS–Pre-existing Asthma). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.

Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first few weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

### Ketoprofen [^111mC2NP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. Forhigh risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greater risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Acunivive 60) [^114g1VZU]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Ketorolac tromethamine, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is indicated for the short-term (up to 5 days in adults) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level. Oral ketorolac tromethamine is indicated only as continuation treatment following IV or IM dosing of ketorolac tromethamine, if necessary. The total combined duration of use of oral ketorolac tromethamine and ketorolac tromethamine injection should not exceed 5 days.

Ketorolac tromethamine is not indicated for use in paediatric patients and it is NOT indicated for minor or chronic painful conditions. Increasing the dose of ketorolac tromethamine beyond the label recommendations will not provide better efficacy but will increase the risk of developing serious adverse events.

GASTROINTESTINAL RISK

Ketorolac tromethamine can cause peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding and/or perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events (see WARNINGS).

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^111nzJGk]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Pregnant and lactating women

During pregnancy, women may experience LBP, joint pain, as well as abdominal and pelvic pain, among other conditions. Analgesic treatment during pregnancy and lactation may be difficult considering certain medications can potentially harm the fetus or may pass through breast milk and affect a nursing infant. Administration of NSAIDs in the first trimester has been linked to premature ductal closure and should be avoided. Aspirin may be used in the first trimester but should be avoided near term, as it may delay labor and cause hemostatic abnormalities. Paracetamol and opioids are relatively safer analgesics to use in pregnant women. In the case of lactating women, paracetamol and NSAIDs may be safe to use, while opioids should be avoided due to the risk of toxicity and dependence.

Renal impairment

A majority of analgesics are excreted by the renal route, and it is important to assess kidney function prior to administering analgesics for chronic pain. Since impaired renal function may lead to accumulation of drugs, there are chances of toxicity in such patients. Clinicians should conduct adequate assessment of kidney function by estimating serum creatinine values and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). An eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 may warrant dose adjustment.NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, naproxen, diclofenac and ibuprofen, have been shown to decrease the GFR and increase the possibility of edema due to prostaglandin-mediated inhibition of renin. Therefore, NSAIDs are best avoided in patients with renal impairment. Alternatives to NSAIDs are paracetamol and opioids such as codeine, tramadol or buprenorphine; morphine and codeine are undialyzable and should be avoided in patients who are undergoing hemodialysis. For moderate-to-severe pain, fentanyl can be safely administered to patients with renal dysfunction or those who require dialysis (although caution needs to be exercised in such patients as fentanyl is poorly dialyzable).

### Ketorolac tromethamine pretreatment suppresses sufentanil-induced cough during general anesthesia induction: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^113AkwJV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the possible adverse reactions and safety of ketorolac tromethamine injection pretreatment, we compared the mean arterial pressure, heart rate and blood oxygen saturation values of the two groups of patients at different time points. The results suggest that pretreatment with ketorolac tromethamine injection does not have adverse effects on the vital signs of patients. Additionally, the results showed that the incidence of nausea, delayed recovery, dizziness, drowsiness and respiratory depression was not significantly increased when ketorolac tromethamine was used in advance, making it safe for patients. However, it is undeniable that one of the main risks of NSAIDs, such as ketorolac tromethamine, is that they may affect bleeding during and after the operation by inhibiting platelet function. However, the dosage of drugs used in this study was not large and was within the scope of reasonable use in the instructions. In addition, this study has limited the research subjects; for example, patients who had a history of peptic ulcer or bleeding, liver or kidney disease, or blood system diseases before operation were excluded. Under these premises, ketorolac tromethamine will not have a significant impact on the operation or postoperative bleeding.

There are also some deficiencies in our research. First, due to the limitation of objective conditions, we have not studied the mechanism of ketorolac tromethamine in inhibition of the cough response and cannot give more reasonable inferences about the relevant mechanisms. We describe the relevant effects objectively because there is no relevant report about ketorolac tromethamine injection or other nonsteroidal drugs inhibiting sufentanil-induced cough. Second, the pretreatment dose of ketorolac tromethamine that was used (0.5 mg/kg) may not be the most appropriate dose for ketorolac tromethamine to inhibit the sufentanil-induced cough response, but it was given according to the early postoperative analgesic dose recommended in the drug instructions. Third, our study was a single center study with a small sample size. To determine whether pretreatment with ketorolac tromethamine injection can reduce the sufentanil-induced cough response, we still need a large sample and multicenter study.

### A methodology for determining dosing recommendations for anticancer drugs in patients with reduced kidney function [^114MTGqD]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Defining the clinical questions

The key clinical questions and the drugs to be addressed in Part 2 were prioritised by the Content Development Working Group and the Guideline Development Team. Three questions were formulated according to the PI/ECO (Patient/Problem, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison or Control, Outcome) approachto aid in the development of specific recommendations:
1 Should elimination by the kidney versus no elimination by the kidney be used to direct dosing of this anticancer drug? This question was answered in the affirmative for drugs with > 30% elimination by the kidney, or where the drug had nephrotoxic potential and/or altered pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in reduced kidney function.
2 Should the KDIGO Chronic Kidney Disease categories be used in the dose adjustment of this anticancer drug in reduced kidney function?
3 Should full dose versus reduced dose of this anticancer drug be used in patients with reduced kidney function?

See Supplementary Material 2 for details on each PI/ECO question.

Identifying evidence

The key clinical questions provided the strategy for a comprehensive literature search using PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMBASE databases, along with a grey literature search and investigation of registered drug product information (Australian, North American, and European) for 59 anticancer drugs (Supplementary Material 3 [literature search strategy]). The searches were limited to studies in humans, with laboratory and animal studies excluded. Identified records were screened for eligibility and assessed against the defined clinical questions by two independent reviewers within the Guideline Development Team (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
PRISMA diagram of studies included from the literature search.

Judgement about the certainty of the evidence

The GRADE approach was used to critically appraise the certainty and strength of evidence from the identified literature. Evidence profiles for each anticancer drug per clinical question were constructed assessing the certainty of evidence of the included studies (Supplementary Material 4) using the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Where the first clinical question was answered in the negative (i.e. not > 30% of the drug is eliminated by the kidney, no nephrotoxic potential and/or altered pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in reduced kidney function), the remaining clinical questions did not require evidence profiles. Thirty-three anticancer drugs required assessment against all three clinical questions, whilst 26 did not proceed beyond the first clinical question.

A final review of 1616 published articles and 177 registered product information monographs enabled 125 GRADE evidence profiles to be developed by the Guideline Development Team, addressing the clinical questions for the 59 anticancer drugs. These profiles were independently reviewed by two members of the Guideline Development Team.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^111stx8T]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute traumatic pain are supported as effective and opioid-sparing, with multiple studies establishing NSAIDs as equally effective to opioids for acute traumatic pain in adults and children, and when used alone or in combination with opioids, NSAIDs can greatly decrease opioid requirements. NSAIDs carry notable risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular events; most risks are associated with long-term use, and risks may vary by COX selectivity, even between drugs in the same class, and although the primary risk of NSAID therapy is gastrointestinal bleeding, all NSAIDs have antiplatelet activity contributing to an increased risk of bleeding at any site. Antiplatelet effects occur mainly through COX-1 inhibition; therefore, selective COX-2 NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib) have decreased risk of inhibiting platelet aggregation, and while no high-quality evidence exists regarding the use of NSAIDs in the presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or intracranial hemorrhage, most practitioners avoid the use of both COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors in this setting. Perioperatively, NSAIDs are sometimes held preoperatively depending upon type of case and surgeon preference, prophylactic use of preoperative ketorolac is contraindicated due to bleeding risk, and clinicians should weigh the risk and impact of bleeding against the benefit of analgesia on a case-by-case basis; use NSAIDs cautiously in patients after colorectal resection because limited evidence suggests an increased risk of anastomotic failure. In musculoskeletal and spine contexts, recent literature demonstrates that short-term, early NSAID use does not increase risk of fracture nonunion, and a similar dose and duration-dependent effect is seen in spinal fusion, with early short (less than 48 hours) administration not having a significant deleterious effect on bony fusion, but aiding in early mobilization and discharge; avoid longer term (2 weeks or longer) use of NSAIDs in the setting of fracture. Use of NSAIDs, particularly at scheduled intervals, may contribute to or complicate the differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury, which develops in at least 30% of patients in ICU settings, and NSAIDs require caution when used in coagulopathic patients or those otherwise at risk for stress-related mucosal bleeding.

Treatment strategy 2

Treatment strategy 2 consists of four scheduled classes of drugs given in a scheduled fashion around the clock: a central prostaglandin inhibitor (acetaminophen), an NSAID (ketorolac followed by naproxen), a gabapentinoid (gabapentin), and a local anesthetic (lidocaine patch). Acetaminophen is administered orally from the start. A single dose of ketorolac is administered in the emergency department followed by scheduled oral naproxen. Oral gabapentin is titrated as needed. Lidocaine patches are routinely scheduled.

Patients are randomized to one of the two initial treatment strategies in the emergency department. Both regimens can be broadened or narrowed by the bedside physician during hospitalization as indicated. Adjustments may include withholding or adjusting the dosage of a medication due to comorbidities such as kidney or liver disease; withholding a medication due to interactions with other medications; and removing medications once pain control is achieved.

In both regimens, oral medications are also available as needed for breakthrough (moderate and severe) pain — oxycodone in treatment strategy 1 and either tramadol or oxycodone in treatment strategy 2. Either regimen can be titrated up or down depending on the patient's level of pain. Adjuncts can also be added, including oral methadone for long-acting opioid pain relief, regional anesthesia, lidocaine infusion, and ketamine infusion. Although their use is discouraged, intravenous opioids can be administered as needed.

An order set is available within the electronic medical record to facilitate compliance with correct medication ordering.

Eligibility criteria

All adult patients (≥ 16 years of age) admitted to the adult trauma service are screened for eligibility. Pregnant women, prisoners, patients placed in observation, and non-acute trauma admissions, including readmissions, are excluded. Patients are not excluded if they have a contraindication to one or more medications in the MMPRs.

Renal Insufficiency

Based on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of ketorolac
tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours and is
dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between
creatinine clearance and total ketorolac tromethamine clearance in the elderly
and populations with renal impairment (r = 0.5).

In patients with renal disease, the AUC∞of each

CLINICAL STUDIES

Adult Patients

In a postoperative study, where all patients received morphine by a PCA device, patients treated with ketorolac tromethamine intravenous as fixed intermittent boluses (e.g., 30 mg initial dose followed by 15 mg every 3 hours), required significantly less morphine (26%) than the placebo group. Analgesia was significantly superior, at various postdosing pain assessment times, in the patients receiving ketorolac tromethamine intravenous plus PCA morphine as compared to patients receiving PCA-administered morphine alone.
