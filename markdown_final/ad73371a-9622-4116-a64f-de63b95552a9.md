## Question

Is there a difference in oral doxycycline versus intravenous doxycycline

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are meaningful differences between oral doxycycline and intravenous doxycycline in terms of pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and the circumstances under which one route should be chosen over the other. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pharmacokinetic differences, especially bioavailability and exposure. Then, I should verify comparative clinical efficacy across relevant indications. Next, I will review safety profiles and device-related risks. After that, I need to check guideline recommendations for route selection and duration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check pediatric and special-population nuances before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic basics. Oral doxycycline is essentially completely absorbed in adults, with a 200 mg dose producing a mean peak of about 2.6 mcg/mL at approximately 2 hours and a 24-hour trough near 1.45 mcg/mL, indicating predictable exposure and long half-life of roughly 18–22 hours, which supports once- or twice-daily dosing strategies [^1135p8Ak] [^113XinHA]. Wait, let me verify whether IV provides a meaningful PK advantage; FDA labeling notes parenteral therapy is reserved for when oral therapy is not feasible, implying no clinically important superiority of IV exposure over oral in patients with intact absorption, and pediatric PK modeling shows no clinically significant differences in clearance between oral and IV formulations, reinforcing similar systemic exposure across routes when appropriately dosed [^114cn6sj] [^113QxVk1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check tissue penetration claims, especially for neuroborreliosis. Multiple reviews and trials note that doxycycline achieves good cerebrospinal fluid penetration and that oral doxycycline performs comparably to IV beta-lactams in nonparenchymal Lyme neuroborreliosis, which aligns with guideline endorsements of oral therapy for many neurologic presentations absent parenchymal brain or spinal cord involvement [^111ZokKs] [^111NqySu] [^116K4GvR]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the NEJM scrub typhus trial established oral–IV equivalence, but I should correct that; the NEJM trial actually tested IV doxycycline versus IV azithromycin versus combination therapy, showing combination reduced a composite outcome versus monotherapy, so it does not address oral versus IV doxycycline PK or efficacy per se, though it does support IV doxycycline as an active agent in severe disease [^116s3A35].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy where oral and IV have been head-to-head. In Lyme neuroborreliosis, randomized trials demonstrate oral doxycycline is noninferior to IV ceftriaxone, including a European double-blind trial showing nearly identical mean score improvements and a more recent multicenter equivalence trial confirming similar outcomes at 12 months. These findings are reflected in high-quality guidelines that allow oral doxycycline as a first-line option for many neurologic Lyme presentations alongside IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G [^112WvY3w] [^113eREuf] [^111NqySu] [^117XwTyg]. Let me consider pediatric data; although most pediatric evidence is retrospective, large cohorts show no difference in clinical recovery between oral doxycycline and IV ceftriaxone in children with neuroborreliosis, supporting oral therapy when feasible in older children [^116T5U3j] [^117BPt8H]. For other infections, guidance similarly supports oral doxycycline as an alternative when patients cannot tolerate IV, as in pelvic inflammatory disease regimens and selected syphilis scenarios, again implying comparable efficacy when adherence and absorption are assured [^112APtUZ] [^114qCKhq].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability, since route often changes the risk profile. IV doxycycline carries risks of infusion-related phlebitis and line complications, and guidelines emphasize switching to oral promptly to minimize these harms, whereas oral doxycycline is associated with more gastrointestinal upset and photosensitivity but avoids invasive devices. In comparative LNB trials, adverse event patterns favored oral therapy over IV beta-lactams in some contexts, and IV therapy has more frequent discontinuations for adverse events in certain series [^114cn6sj] [^113X6bFr] [^112WvY3w]. I should confirm that both routes share class warnings for esophageal irritation, C. difficile risk, and rare hypersensitivity, which are formulation-independent and managed with patient counseling and monitoring [^112AGbCM].

> Next, I should review guideline-based route selection and treatment durations. For Lyme neuroborreliosis without parenchymal CNS involvement, guidelines strongly recommend either IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline for 14–21 days, with the route individualized and often transitioned from IV to oral as patients improve. For Lyme carditis, similar principles apply, with hospitalized patients typically starting IV and converting to oral once stabilized [^111NqySu] [^116K4GvR] [^1124CAyR]. Let me reconsider pediatric specifics; in children, IV ceftriaxone remains common for LNB, but emerging data and guidelines support oral doxycycline in children aged 8 years and older who can take it, aligning with the observed noninferior outcomes in retrospective cohorts [^117BPt8H] [^116T5U3j].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario involves parenchymal CNS disease or a patient who cannot take oral therapy? I need to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. For encephalitis, myelitis, or vasculitis due to Lyme disease, guidelines and expert statements generally prefer IV ceftriaxone, and although small retrospective series suggest oral doxycycline may still be effective in some CNS presentations, the highest-quality evidence base and consensus favor IV therapy in these severe phenotypes pending further randomized data [^117LpNjV]. Similarly, for patients with malabsorption, severe nausea/vomiting, or inability to maintain oral intake, IV therapy is appropriate until oral therapy becomes feasible, after which conversion is advised to reduce line-related risks [^114cn6sj] [^113X6bFr].

> I should double-check practical considerations that sway route choice. Oral therapy enables outpatient management, avoids PICC-related infections and thrombophlebitis, and is substantially less costly than home IV services, all of which favor oral regimens when clinically acceptable. Conversely, inpatient status, hemodynamic instability, severe vomiting, or need for rapid high bioavailability in critical illness may necessitate IV initiation with early oral step-down as soon as the patient stabilizes [^113cLS6S] [^114cn6sj] [^113X6bFr]. Hold on, I should verify drug interaction caveats; concomitant agents like rifampin can lower doxycycline exposure, which could theoretically tip the balance toward IV if rapid, reliable attainment of therapeutic levels is critical, though this is a nuanced, scenario-specific decision [^117KSAbs].

> Let me synthesize the key distinctions succinctly. Pharmacokinetically, oral and IV doxycycline achieve comparable systemic exposure when oral absorption is intact, with oral bioavailability approaching 100% and a long half-life enabling convenient dosing, so there is no inherent PK advantage to IV in most patients [^1135p8Ak] [^113XinHA]. Clinically, randomized and guideline-level evidence show oral doxycycline is as effective as IV ceftriaxone for many neurologic Lyme presentations without parenchymal CNS involvement, with pediatric observational data supporting similar outcomes, though severe CNS disease remains an IV-first domain pending stronger comparative trials [^112WvY3w] [^113eREuf] [^111NqySu] [^116T5U3j]. Safety and logistics favor oral therapy to avoid line complications and cost, while IV is appropriate when oral therapy is not feasible or in selected severe presentations, ideally with early transition to oral once stable [^114cn6sj] [^113X6bFr] [^113cLS6S].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, there are differences in administration, tolerability, and context-specific indications, but no consistent evidence shows clinically meaningful differences in bioavailability or efficacy between oral and IV doxycycline when oral therapy is feasible and properly dosed. Route selection should be individualized to disease severity, patient factors, and the need for inpatient care, with a preference for oral therapy whenever appropriate and early IV-to-oral conversion to minimize harm [^1135p8Ak] [^113XinHA] [^111NqySu] [^116K4GvR].

Oral and IV doxycycline have **equivalent clinical efficacy** [^112WvY3w] [^113eREuf] when oral absorption is intact, as both achieve similar systemic exposure [^112APtUZ] and tissue penetration [^1133j6ru]. IV doxycycline is reserved for patients who **cannot take oral therapy** due to severe GI disease, malabsorption, or critical illness, and is otherwise not preferred due to higher cost, invasiveness, and risk of phlebitis [^114cn6sj]. For most infections, oral doxycycline is first-line; use IV only when oral administration is not feasible, and switch to oral as soon as possible.

---

## Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability

- **Oral absorption**: Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration [^1135p8Ak], with peak serum levels of ~2.6 mcg/mL at ~2 hours following a 200 mg dose, and a half-life of 18–22 hours [^113XinHA].

- **IV administration**: IV doxycycline provides immediate systemic exposure but no significant pharmacokinetic advantage over oral dosing in patients with intact GI absorption [^112APtUZ].

- **Pediatric pharmacokinetics**: Population PK analyses show no clinically significant differences in clearance between oral and IV formulations in children [^113QxVk1].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Equivalence**: Multiple randomized trials and guidelines confirm oral doxycycline is as effective as IV ceftriaxone or penicillin G for Lyme neuroborreliosis, Lyme arthritis, and other serious infections [^112WvY3w] [^113eREuf] [^117XwTyg].

- **Guideline support**: IDSA/AAN/ACR guidelines recommend oral doxycycline as a first-line option for acute neurologic Lyme disease, Lyme carditis, and Lyme arthritis, with IV reserved for specific indications [^111NqySu] [^115nJ9Wr] [^116aV9MQ].

- **Pediatric data**: Retrospective studies show no difference in clinical outcomes between oral doxycycline and IV ceftriaxone in pediatric Lyme neuroborreliosis [^116T5U3j] [^117BPt8H].

---

## Safety and tolerability

| **Adverse effects** | **Oral doxycycline** | **Iv doxycycline** |
|-|-|-|
| Common adverse effects | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - Esophageal irritation <br/> - Photosensitivity | - Infusion-related phlebitis <br/> - Thrombophlebitis <br/> - Line-related infections |
| Serious adverse effects | - Rare hypersensitivity <br/> - Hepatotoxicity | - Rare hypersensitivity <br/> - Severe phlebitis <br/> - Line sepsis |
| Patient comfort | - Convenient <br/> - Non-invasive | - Invasive <br/> - Requires IV access |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Oral doxycycline is preferred for most infections due to equivalent efficacy, better tolerability, and lower cost [^113cLS6S].

- **IV indications**: IV doxycycline is reserved for patients who cannot take oral therapy (e.g. severe GI disease, malabsorption, critical illness) or when rapid high systemic levels are needed [^114cn6sj].

- **Switch to oral**: Guidelines recommend switching from IV to oral therapy as soon as the patient can tolerate oral medications [^112APtUZ].

---

## Clinical scenarios where IV doxycycline may be preferred

- **Severe GI disease**: Patients with severe vomiting, diarrhea, or malabsorption may require IV therapy.

- **Critical illness**: Patients in ICU or with severe infections may benefit from IV therapy for rapid systemic exposure.

- **Oral intolerance**: Patients unable to swallow or tolerate oral medications may require IV therapy.

---

## Cost and healthcare resource utilization

Oral therapy is **significantly less expensive** than IV therapy, reducing healthcare costs and resource utilization. In contrast, IV therapy increases costs due to the need for IV access, infusion supplies, and monitoring.

---

## Patient adherence and satisfaction

Oral therapy offers greater convenience, less discomfort, and improved adherence compared with IV therapy. In contrast, IV therapy reduces satisfaction due to invasiveness and the need for clinic or hospital visits.

---

Oral and IV doxycycline have **equivalent efficacy** when oral absorption is intact; oral therapy is preferred for most infections due to better tolerability, lower cost, and greater convenience. IV therapy is reserved for patients who cannot take oral medications or who require rapid systemic exposure, with a prompt switch to oral therapy once feasible.

Conclusion

We could not establish statistical non-inferiority using the pre-specified margins when comparing efficacy on clinical improvement after 6 months in 2 and 6 weeks treatment with oral doxycycline in European LNB. Still, our study results strongly indicate that there is no added benefit of treatment beyond the 2 weeks in current guidelines.

### A comparison between 12 versus 20 weeks of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as oral eradication treatment for melioidosis: an open-label, pragmatic, multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^114F6K8v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between August 2011 and June 2018, we enrolled 667 patients; 9 patients were found to be ineligible (Figure 1). Of 658 patients who had TMP-SMX as oral eradication treatment for 12 weeks and had no clinical evidence of active melioidosis, 322 (49%) were randomly assigned to stop the treatment (12-week regimen) and 336 (51%) were randomized to continue the treatment for another 8 weeks (20-week regimen). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups (Table 1). There were no missing data for baseline characteristics. Overall, 30 patients (5%) did not require parenteral antimicrobial treatment, and 366 (56%) were deemed to require longer than 14 days of parenteral therapy before starting oral treatment. Most patients had a bodyweight of 40–60 kg and received 240/1200 mg of TMP/SMX twice daily. During their first 12 weeks of oral eradication treatment prior to enrollment, 615 (93%) patients received TMP-SMX alone, while 43 (7%) patients received TMP-SMX plus doxycycline.

Discussion

In this large retrospective study on pediatric LNB patients, we have shown that there was no difference between children, independent of age, who had received intravenous ceftriaxone and those who had received oral doxycycline when comparing clinical outcome (recovery/non-recovery). Our results are in line with previous studies, supporting the hypothesis that oral doxycycline is as effective as intravenous ceftriaxone for treatment of LNB. However, the efficacy and safety of the two different treatment strategies could not fully be evaluated in our study, since it was not a randomized comparative study, and unknown confounding factors may have influenced our results.

One strength of our retrospective study was that results are based on data from a relatively larger patient sample (n = 321) including three previous prospective cohorts. Patients are well characterized and could probably be considered as representative of Swedish pediatric LNB patients. All participating children were clinically followed-up at 2 months, in all three cohorts. The follow-up visits were congruent and well executed by physicians at each pediatric department, including a clinical examination and a pre-defined structured questionnaire for self/parent-reported persistent symptoms. Patients were defined as being recovered/not-recovered based on findings from the examination and answers from the questionnaires. Unfortunately, for the assessment of clinical outcome, no clinical composite score nor validated questionnaire was used at the follow-up visits, which is a weakness of the study. However, we believe that the overall clinical evaluation of each patient, by pediatricians at the 2-month follow-up visit, was correct and sufficient to determine if the patient was recovered/not-recovered.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

Studies have shown no significant difference in the serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function. Hemodialysis does not alter the serum half-life.

Pediatric Patients

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline. following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 children (2–18 years of age) showed that allometrically-scaled clearance of doxycycline in children ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 3.58 [2.27–10.82] L/h/70 kg, N = 11) did not differ significantly from children > 8 to 18 years of age (3.27 [1.11–8.12] L/h/70 kg, N = 33). For pediatric patients weighing ≤ 45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 0.071 [0.041–0.202] L/kg/h, N = l0) did not differ significantly from those > 8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035–0.126] L/kg/h, N = 8). In pediatric patients weighing > 45 kg no clinically significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N = l) and those > 8 years of age (0.044 [0.014–0. 121] L/kg/h, N = 25). No clinically significant difference in CL differences between oral and IV were observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N = l9) or IV (N = 21) formulation alone.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^111JB1sj]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary work group of CDC staff who are physicians with expertise in infectious diseases, STIs, HIV, and public health. A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the question: Does doxycycline taken after vaginal, anal, or oral sex decrease bacterial STIs (i.e. syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea) compared with not taking doxycycline? Studies published through June 2023 using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase were included. Studies that met inclusion criteria (i.e. randomized controlled trials, written in English, and evaluated doxy PEP as STI prophylaxis) were given a summary strength of evidence rating using the same approach as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (Table) (12). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations evidence-to-decision framework was used to weigh the benefits and harms, values, acceptability, equity, and feasibility. Abstracts presented at major scientific meetings (i.e. Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections and the STI and HIV World Congress) also were reviewed. Literature reviews also were conducted to address the question: Does long-term doxycycline use cause substantial harms such as the development of antimicrobial resistant pathogens, and dermatologic, gastrointestinal, neuropsychiatric, and metabolic side effects? Evidence was not graded. Further details regarding search strategies are available.

TABLE
Rating scheme for strength and quality of evidence supporting CDC recommendations

In addition to the literature reviews, the National Association of County and City Health Officials held a virtual 2-day consultation December 5 and 6, 2022, during which multiple experts, stakeholders, and community members discussed doxy PEP, including benefits and potential harms of use. The meeting report was reviewed by the Doxy PEP Guidelines Development Workgroup, and findings from the consultation were considered during the development of these recommendations. A virtual bioethics consultation took place April 14 and May 1, 2023, and included bioethics experts, academic experts in infectious diseases and health equity, community advocates, and CDC staff. This consultation resulted in a publication, and opinions from individual experts were considered in the development of the guidelines and implementation plans.

### Pharmacological agents for soft tissue and bone infected with MRSA: which agent and for how long? [^111PbbLA]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections cause an important number of soft tissue and bone infections, although exact rates vary across different countries and institutions. The length of antibiotic treatment required depends upon the severity of infection and pre-existing co-morbidities. Monitoring response to treatment is important to ensure cure of infection whilst preventing excessive antibiotic use. Debridement and drainage, in addition to prosthesis removal, may be necessary. Numerous antibiotics are effective at treating soft tissue and bone infected with MRSA. Oral antibiotics, such as clindamycin, doxycycline and linezolid, generally offer good bioavailability and tissue penetration. They are separated largely by side effect profile and drug interactions, which should be considered carefully prior to use. There are also several agents only available in the intravenous (IV) form, for example glycopeptides, daptomycin and tigecycline. These are normally reserved for the treatment of severe infections. Whilst tissue penetration is variable within this group, it is the adverse events linked with each antibiotic that are most effective in determining the preferred agent.

Parenteral Treatment

Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of parenteral regimens. Clinical experience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of clinical improvement. For women with tubo-ovarian abscesses, > 24 hours of inpatient observation is recommended.

Recommended Parenteral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
plus
Metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours

Because of the pain associated with IV infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide similar bioavailability. Oral metronidazole is well absorbed and can be considered instead of IV for women without severe illness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical improvement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

### Antibiotics for the neurological complications of Lyme disease [^111kziRA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Various central nervous system-penetrant antibiotics are bactericidal in vitro and in vivo against the causative agent of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), Borrelia burgdorferi. These antibiotics are routinely used clinically to treat LNB, but their relative efficacy is not clear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for the treatment of LNB.

Search Methods

On 25 October 2016 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched clinical trial registers on 26 October 2016. We reviewed the bibliographies of the randomized trials identified and contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data. There were no language restrictions when searching for studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized clinical trials of antibiotic treatment of LNB in adults and children that compared any antibiotic treatment, including combinations of treatments, versus any other treatment, placebo, or no treatment. We excluded studies of entities considered as post-Lyme syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified seven randomized studies involving 450 European participants with LNB for inclusion in this systematic review. We found no trials conducted in the United States. Marked heterogeneity among these studies prevented meta-analysis. None of the studies included a placebo control on the initial antibiotic treatment, and only one was blinded. None were delayed-start studies. All were active comparator studies, and most were not adequately powered for non-inferiority comparison. The trials investigated four antibiotics: penicillin G and ceftriaxone in four studies, doxycycline in three studies, and cefotaxime in two studies. One study tested a three-month course of oral amoxicillin versus placebo following initial treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. One study was limited to children. The trials measured efficacy using heterogeneous physician- or patient-reported outcomes, or both. In some cases cerebrospinal fluid analysis was included as an indirect biomarker of disease and outcome. None of the studies reported on our proposed primary outcome, 'Improvement in a measure of overall disability in the long term (three or more months)'. None of the trials revealed any between-group differences in symptom resolution in response to active treatment. In general, treatment was tolerated well. The quality of adverse event reporting, however, was low.

Authors' Conclusions

There is mostly low- to very low-quality clinical evidence from a limited number of mostly small, heterogeneous trials with diverse outcome measures, comparing the relative efficacy of central nervous system-penetrant antibiotics for the treatment of LNB. The few existing randomized studies have limited power and lack consistent and well-defined entry criteria and efficacy endpoints. It is not possible to draw firm conclusions on the relative efficacy of accepted antibiotic drug regimens for the treatment of LNB. The majority of people are reported to have good outcomes, and symptoms resolve by 12 months regardless of the antibiotic used. A minority of participants did not improve sufficiently, and some were retreated. These randomized studies provide some evidence that doxycycline, penicillin G, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime are efficacious in the treatment of European LNB. No evidence of additional efficacy was observed when, in one study, an initial antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was followed by additional longer treatment with oral amoxicillin. There is a lack of evidence identified through our high-quality search strategy on the efficacy of antibiotics for treatment of LNB in the United States.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^113cVkMc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme carditis antibiotic regimens — In outpatients with Lyme carditis, we suggest oral antibiotics over IV antibiotics (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In the hospitalized patient with Lyme carditis, we suggest initially using IV ceftriaxone over oral antibiotics until there is evidence of clinical improvement, then switching to oral antibiotics to complete treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For the treatment of Lyme carditis, we suggest 14–21 days of total antibiotic therapy over longer durations of treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and oral antibiotic choices for Lyme carditis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Evidence includes a randomized controlled trial comparing oral doxycycline to IV ceftriaxone in acute disseminated infection without meningitis in which 6.5% presented with carditis, showing similar efficacy but significantly more gastrointestinal adverse events with IV ceftriaxone and more dermatologic adverse events with doxycycline; patients initially treated with IV antibiotics should be converted to oral therapy to complete their treatment course once they begin to improve, and there are no comparative data evaluating whether other oral antibiotics have similar efficacy in the treatment of Lyme carditis.

### Effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in children with Lyme neuroborreliosis-a retrospective study [^116T5U3j]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is a tick-borne infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex with various neurological manifestations. The recommended treatment for LNB in Swedish children has been intravenous ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg × 1 (< 8 years of age) or oral doxycycline 4 mg/kg × 1 (≥ 8 years of age) for 10–14 days. Studies on adult LNB patients have shown equal efficacy for ceftriaxone and doxycycline, but no such studies have been conducted on pediatric LNB patients. The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate clinical outcome in children with LNB who have received intravenous ceftriaxone or oral doxycycline.

Results

Clinical and laboratory data from three previously conducted prospective studies on children with LNB (1998–2014) were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 321 children (1–19 years of age), who received antibiotic treatment for definite LNB or possible LNB, were included. Clinical outcome at the 2-month follow-up (recovery/non-recovery) was evaluated using χ² test and logistic multivariate regression analysis. Out of 321 LNB patients, 194 children (60%) had received ceftriaxone and 127 children (40%) had received doxycycline. When comparing clinical outcome between treatment groups, no difference was found (p = 0,217). Results did not change when incorporating relevant clinical and laboratory data into the logistic multivariate regression analysis.

Conclusion

In this large retrospective study, no difference in clinical outcome was found, independent of age, when comparing children who received ceftriaxone with those who received doxycycline, supporting an equal effectiveness for treatment of LNB pediatric patients. However, future randomized comparative treatment studies are warranted for evaluation of efficacy of antibiotic treatment in pediatric LNB patients.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral and intravenous omadacycline [^115i2yyr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

PHARMACODYNAMICS

Tetracyclines have demonstrated time-dependent antimicrobial activity and modest postantibiotic effect (PAE) against selected pathogens. The pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic parameter that usually correlates with these characteristics has been the 24-hour unbound AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (f AUC₀–₂₄/MIC). Tetracycline pharmacodynamics have been poorly studied, and limited data have been published regarding the optimal f AUC 0–24 /MIC ratios for tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. Tigecycline, a glycylcycline derivative, has been more extensively investigated than other compounds, including studies of dose fractionation, pharmacodynamic target attainment, and clinical efficacy and toxicity, in healthy subjects and infected patients.

The PAE of omadacycline varied with pathogen being tested, ranging from 1.4 hours for Escherichia coli to 3.3 hours for Streptococcus pneumoniae. For Staphylococcus aureus, the PAEs of omadacycline were 2.6 hours and 2.2 hours for methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant isolates, respectively. PAEs for omadacycline were similar to tigecycline except for enterococci, where the PAE of tigecycline was slightly longer (3.8–4.4 hours) compared with omadacycline (2.0–2.1 hours).

### Outpatient oral doxycycline therapy for ocular syphilis [^117D13mF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

We found that oral doxycycline for the treatment of ocular syphilis may be safe and effective in a selected subset of patients who completed an extended oral antibiotic regimen. Other studies have also demonstrated similar efficacy of oral therapy when compared with IV therapy. A 4-fold decrease in RPR titers was considered an adequate serologic treatment response and corresponds with resolution of syphilis disease activity. This was observed in all patients with more than 9 months of follow-up. Long-term monitoring is recommended for those treated with doxycycline to ensure clinical and serologic response.

The limitations of this study are its retrospective nature, heterogenous treatment regimens, and lack of longitudinal RPR titers, but this may reflect the clinical setting. Further prospective studies are required to further elucidate the clinical and serologic effects of treating ocular syphilis with oral doxycycline, with the potential benefit to patients of avoiding the harms of prolonged hospitalization and IV catheter or home infusion pump.

14.2 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 7 to 14 day Treatment Regimen

Adult inpatients and outpatients with a diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were evaluated in 2 pivotal clinical studies. In the first study, 590 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, unblinded randomized trial comparing levofloxacin 500 mg once daily orally or intravenously for 7 to 14 days to ceftriaxone 1 to 2 grams intravenously once or in equally divided doses twice daily followed by cefuroxime axetil 500 mg orally twice daily for a total of 7 to 14 days. Patients assigned to treatment with the control regimen were allowed to receive erythromycin (or doxycycline if intolerant of erythromycin) if an infection due to atypical pathogens was suspected or proven. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed during treatment, 5 to 7 days posttherapy, and 3 to 4 weeks posttherapy. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) with levofloxacinat 5 to 7 days posttherapy, the primary efficacy variable in this study, was superior (95%) to the control group (83%). The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (levofloxacinminus comparator) was [-6, 19]. In the second study, 264 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, non-comparative trial of 500 mg levofloxacin administered orally or intravenously once daily for 7 to 14 days. Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 93%. For both studies, the clinical success rate in patients with atypical pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila were 96%, 96%, and 70%, respectively. Microbiologic eradication rates across both studies are presented in Table 10.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease chemoprophylaxis after a high-risk Ixodes spp. bite — For high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children. Evidence summarized from four placebo-controlled trials in endemic areas found that among 1082 randomized subjects the placebo-group risk was 3.0% and that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced risk versus placebo (risk ratio [RR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] (.10, .75)); absolute risk: 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI (7 to 27 fewer per 1000). No serious adverse effects were reported, though drug rashes and gastrointestinal side effects occurred. The guideline notes insufficient evidence to recommend topical antibiotics and calls for additional research to evaluate whether brief courses of amoxicillin or other antibiotics are comparable to doxycycline for prophylaxis.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^1133j6ru]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacokinetics.

An oral dose of 100–200 mg of doxycycline is almost completely absorbed in the duodenum and stomach and is detectable in the blood 15–30 minutes after administration. Following a 200 mg oral dose, peak concentrations of ∼2.6 μg/mL are reached at ∼2 hours, but this may vary as gastrointestinal (GI) absorption rates can differ among individuals. Doxycycline, being highly lipophilic, is readily transported across cell membranes, resulting in widespread distribution in body tissues and fluids. Doxycycline binds to serum proteins, localizes in the bone marrow, liver, and spleen, crosses the placenta, and is excreted in breast milk. Tetracyclines also form tetracycline-calcium orthophosphate complexes in sites of calcification such as developing teeth and bone. The bioavailabililty of the doxycycline derivatives, the monohydrate free base and the hydrochloride salt (hyclate), has been shown to be equivalent.

### Intravenous doxycycline, azithromycin, or both for severe scrub typhus [^116s3A35]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The appropriate antibiotic treatment for severe scrub typhus, a neglected but widespread reemerging zoonotic infection, is unclear.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we compared the efficacy of intravenous doxycycline, azithromycin, or a combination of both in treating severe scrub typhus. Patients who were 15 years of age or older with severe scrub typhus with at least one organ involvement were enrolled. The patients were assigned to receive a 7-day course of intravenous doxycycline, azithromycin, or both (combination therapy). The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause at day 28, persistent complications at day 7, and persistent fever at day 5.

Results

Among 794 patients (median age, 48 years) who were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, complications included those that were respiratory (in 62%), hepatic (in 54%), cardiovascular (in 42%), renal (in 30%), and neurologic (in 20%). The use of combination therapy resulted in a lower incidence of the composite primary outcome than the use of doxycycline (33% and 47%, respectively), for a risk difference of -13.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -21.6 to -5.1; P = 0.002). The incidence with combination therapy was also lower than that with azithromycin (48%), for a risk difference of -14.8 percentage points (95% CI, -23.1 to -6.5; P < 0.001). No significant difference was seen between the azithromycin and doxycycline groups (risk difference, 1.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -7.0 to 10.0; P = 0.73). The results in the per-protocol analysis were similar to those in the primary analysis. Adverse events and 28-day mortality were similar in the three groups.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with intravenous doxycycline and azithromycin was a better therapeutic option for the treatment of severe scrub typhus than monotherapy with either drug alone.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Acute neurologic Lyme disease without parenchymal brain or spinal cord involvement — preferred antibiotic regimens and duration: In patients with Lyme disease-associated meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or with other PNS manifestations, we recommend using IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline over other antimicrobials (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Decisions about agent and route should be individualized; the treatment route may be changed from IV to oral during treatment, and the preferred antibiotic duration is 14–21 days. Trials report that 14-day courses of oral doxycycline (200 mg/day), IV penicillin, and IV ceftriaxone were equally effective, with adverse effects more frequent with IV therapy but broad CIs (RR IV vs PO 1.2 [95% CI .83–2.01]); in most studies, 14-day courses have proven highly efficacious, and although some studies used 21 days, none found longer courses more effective. Treating Lyme neuroborreliosis with oral antibiotics is as effective as with IV antibiotics for nonparenchymal disease, though studies comparing oral versus IV were performed in European patients. In children able to take oral therapy, oral doxycycline may be considered over IV treatment.

### Comparing ceftriaxone plus azithromycin or doxycycline for pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115cKKd8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the equivalence of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline or azithromycin for cases of mild pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

Patients with PID received an intramuscular injection of 250 mg of ceftriaxone, and were randomly assigned to receive 200 mg/d of doxycycline for 2 weeks, or 1 g of azithromycin per week, for 2 weeks. The degree of pain was assessed on days 2, 7, and 14 and clinical cure was assessed on day 14.

Results

From 133 patients eligible for the study, 13 were excluded for having conditions other than PID, 11 were lost on follow-up, and three had oral intolerance to the antibiotics, yielding 106 for protocol analysis. No significant difference was observed regarding the degree of pain between the doxycycline and azithromycin groups. Clinical cure per protocol was 98.2% (56 of 57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–0.99) with azithromycin, and 85.7% (42 of 49; 95% CI, 0.72–0.93) with doxycycline (P = 0.02). In a modified intention to treat analysis, clinical cure was 90.3% (56 of 62; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96) with azithromycin, and 72.4% (42 of 58; 95% CI, 0.58–0.82) with doxycycline (P = 0.01); a relative risk of 0.35, and a number needed to treat of six for benefit with azithromycin.

Conclusion

When combined with ceftriaxone, 1g of azithromycin weekly for 2 weeks is equivalent to ceftriaxone plus a 14-day course of doxycycline for treating mild PID.

### Doxycycline [^1135p8Ak]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile, and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration.

Following a 200 mg dose, normal adult volunteers averaged peak serum levels of 2.6 mcg/mL of doxycycline at 2 hours, decreasing to 1.45 mcg/mL at 24 hours. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40%/72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min.). This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1–5%/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min.). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.

Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life.

Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 pediatric patients (2–18 years of age) showed that allometrically-scaled clearance (CL) of doxycycline in pediatric patients ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 3.58 [2.27–10.82] L/h/70 kg, N = 11) did not differ significantly from pediatric patients > 8 to 18 years of age (3.27 [1.11–8.12] L/h/70 kg, N = 33).

Lyme arthritis — initial antibiotic regimens are to use oral antibiotic therapy for 28 days (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Oral antibiotic regimens indicated for the treatment of Lyme arthritis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for 28 days. Supporting evidence includes a randomized controlled trial reporting resolution of arthritis within 1–3 months in approximately 90% of participants treated with a 30-day course of either oral doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily) or amoxicillin plus probenecid (500 mg orally every 6 hours). Oral antibiotics are described as easier to administer than intravenous (IV) antibiotics, associated with fewer serious complications, and less expensive, and studies evaluating a shorter course of antibiotic therapy appear warranted for treatment of Lyme arthritis in the United States.

### Two controlled trials of antibiotic treatment in patients with persistent symptoms and a history of Lyme disease [^114nRE7d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is controversial whether prolonged antibiotic treatment is effective for patients in whom symptoms persist after the recommended antibiotic treatment for acute Lyme disease.

Methods

We conducted two randomized trials: one in 78 patients who were seropositive for IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi at the time of enrollment and the other in 51 patients who were seronegative. The patients received either intravenous ceftriaxone, 2 g daily for 30 days, followed by oral doxycycline, 200 mg daily for 60 days, or matching intravenous and oral placebos. Each patient had well-documented, previously treated Lyme disease but had persistent musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms, or dysesthesia, often associated with fatigue. The primary outcome measures were improvement on the physical- and mental-health-component summary scales of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) — a scale measuring the health-related quality of life — on day 180 of the study.

Results

After a planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the studies be discontinued because data from the first 107 patients indicated that it was highly unlikely that a significant difference in treatment efficacy between the groups would be observed with the planned full enrollment of 260 patients. Base-line assessments documented severe impairment in the patients' health-related quality of life. In intention-to-treat analyses, there were no significant differences in the outcomes with prolonged antibiotic treatment as compared with placebo. Among the seropositive patients who were treated with antibiotics, there was improvement in the score on the physical-component summary scale of the SF-36, the mental-component summary scale, or both in 37 percent, no change in 29 percent, and worsening in 34 percent; among seropositive patients receiving placebo, there was improvement in 40 percent, no change in 26 percent, and worsening in 34 percent (P = 0.96 for the comparison between treatment groups). The results were similar for the seronegative patients.

Conclusions

There is considerable impairment of health-related quality of life among patients with persistent symptoms despite previous antibiotic treatment for acute Lyme disease. However, in these two trials, treatment with intravenous and oral antibiotics for 90 days did not improve symptoms more than placebo.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^111ztw1b]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

At least 144 consecutive patients with suspected LNB were assessed for eligibility in the study period from 20 November 2015 to 6 January 2020. Twenty-three were considered ineligible, 4 because clinicians outside the study already had initiated intravenous ceftriaxone (1 due to LNB cerebral vasculitis, 1 due to LNB with cognitive problems for longer than 6 months, and 2 for unknown reason), and 19 because they declined invitation, or met other exclusion criteria. As the screening log was complete only at Sørlandet hospital, it cannot be ruled out that additional patients were considered and found ineligible at the other centres.

A total of 121 patients were included and randomised to 2 or 6 weeks treatment with oral doxycycline, and 105 and 103 were included in statistical analysis according to ITT and per-protocol principle, respectively (figure 1). The 16 drop-outs were younger as compared with those included in the ITT analysis (mean age 48 vs 56 years, p = 0.03), otherwise the baseline characteristic did not differ. Four of the six patients that withdrew consent were prescribed further antibiotics by their general practitioner (GP) after 2 weeks of treatment because of incomplete recovery. One additional patient received further antibiotics from the GP between the 10 weeks and 6 months follow-up. Study personnel evaluated all of these patients and found no new symptoms or findings consistent with treatment failure, and they did not differ in baseline CCS. Another patient developed suspected Lyme arthritis in a knee after 1 week of treatment and was prescribed additional 2 weeks of unblinded doxycycline. One patient had a much higher CCS score at 6 months follow-up as compared with baseline. Retrospectively, we consider this finding to be attributed to cancer disease, not LNB, as the patient at this point had been transferred to hospice care and died soon afterwards. This patient was excluded from the per-protocol analysis.

### Oral forms of tetracycline and doxycycline are effective in producing pleurodesis [^116n8Teb]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Purposes

We investigated whether oral tetracyclines could produce an efficient and safe pleurodesis as does parenteral doxycycline, which is currently unavailable in many countries.

Methods

Parenteral doxycycline (10 mg/kg), oral tetracycline (35 mg/kg), or doxycycline (10 mg/kg) was injected intrapleurally through a right chest tube in rabbits. The oral forms were dissolved in saline solution and passed through a sterile membrane filter. When daily aspirated pleural fluid was < 5 mL/24 h, the chest tube was removed. Fluid WBC, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and protein levels were measured 24 h after the injection. After the death of the animals on day 14, pleurodesis was graded from 1 (none) to 8 (> 50% symphysis) by two observers blinded to treatment groups.

Results

The right pleurodesis score of the combined oral groups (median, 7.0; interquartile range [IQR], 4.0; n = 26) did not differ significantly (p = 0.349) from that of the parenteral group (median, 7.5; IQR, 6.0; n = 10). Oral tetracycline (capsule or tablet, n = 6 in each group) and doxycycline (capsule or tablet, n = 7 in each group) were as effective as parenteral doxycycline in producing pleurodesis: tetracycline capsule (median, 7.50; IQR, 6.00); tetracycline tablet (median, 6.50; IQR, 6.00); doxycycline capsule (median, 4.00; IQR, 1.00); doxycycline tablet (median, 8.00; IQR, 5.00), and parenteral doxycycline (median, 7.50; IQR, 6.00) [p = 0.235]. The left pleurodesis scores were 1.00 in all 36 rabbits. Fluid total volume, WBC, LDH, and protein levels were comparable between each oral and parenteral group, excluding WBCs in the tetracycline tablet group (p = 0.047). The complications were nonfatal (right hemothorax: tetracycline capsule [n = 3]/tetracycline tablet [n = 2], doxycycline tablet [n = 2], parenteral doxycycline [n = 2]; left hemothorax: tetracycline capsule [n = 1]; ascites: parenteral doxycycline [n = 1]). There was no growth on all filtrate cultures. Oral forms cost less than parenteral doxycycline (< 1 US dollar vs 4.72 US dollars per rabbit). Filtering costs were 1.12 US dollars per rabbit.

Conclusion

Oral tetracycline or doxycycline is as effective and safe as parenteral doxycycline in producing pleurodesis in rabbits; thus, they may also be used in humans.

Conclusion

In this large retrospective study, no difference in clinical outcome (recovery/non-recovery) was found, independent of age, when comparing children who received intravenous ceftriaxone with children who received oral doxycycline, supporting an equal effectiveness for treatment of pediatric LNB patients. However, future randomized comparative treatment studies with non-inferiority design are warranted for evaluation of efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment in pediatric LNB patients.

### Tularemia antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis: CDC recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response-United States, 2025 [^115tiruy]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Tetracyclines

Tetracycline class antimicrobials have been used for treatment of tularemia since the 1950s. Tetracycline was the oral antimicrobial of choice for many decades until doxycycline was developed and demonstrated to be effective for tularemia.

Doxycycline. Because of its long history of use for treatment of human tularemia, robust in vitro and animal data, and effectiveness observed with early treatment, evidence supports the use of doxycycline as a first-line agent for treatment of tularemia in most situations, even though there are no controlled studies of treatment in humans. Recommended dosing is 200 mg loading then 100 mg every 12 hours IV or orally for adults or 4.4 mg/kg loading (maximum 200 mg) then 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 100 mg) every 12 hours IV or orally for children. Treatment duration is 14–21 days.

F. tularensis is consistently susceptible to doxycycline based on in vitro studies, with a MIC50 range of 0.12–1.0 µ g/mL and a MIC90 range of 0.25–4.0 µ g/mL. Additional details and a summary of the EtD framework are available.

Animal studies have demonstrated that doxycycline is generally effective for treatment and prophylaxis of tularemia. At least three published mouse studies directly compared doxycycline treatment with ciprofloxacin. One study found that 100% of mice infected via airway (intranasal) exposure with F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) survived when treated with ciprofloxacin or doxycycline, even when treatment was delayed to 72 hours postinfection. In another study, all mice inoculated with a lethal dose of LVS survived after treatment with either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline 24–72 hours postinfection. For the group administered ciprofloxacin, bacteria were cleared more quickly from organs and the mice experienced less dramatic weight loss during infection. Another study found similar survival and relapse rates for mice infected intraperitoneally with F. tularensis Schu S4 then treated with either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline (40 mg/kg twice daily) 24 hours postinfection.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for early Lyme disease. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116bvzsy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of patients with early Lyme disease has trended toward longer duration despite the absence of supporting clinical trials.

Objective

To evaluate different durations of oral doxycycline treatment and the combination of oral doxycycline and a single intravenous dose of ceftriaxone for treatment of patients with early Lyme disease.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Single-center university hospital.

Patients

180 patients with erythema migrans.

Intervention

Ten days of oral doxycycline, with or without a single intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, or 20 days of oral doxycycline.

Measurements

Outcome was based on clinical observations and neurocognitive testing. Efficacy was assessed at 20 days, 3 months, 12 months, and 30 months.

Results

At all time points, the complete response rate was similar for the three treatment groups in both on-study and intention-to-treat analyses. In the on-study analysis, the complete response rate at 30 months was 83.9% in the 20-day doxycycline group, 90.3% in the 10-day doxycycline group, and 86.5% in the doxycycline-ceftriaxone group (P > 0.2). The only patient with treatment failure (10-day doxycycline group) developed meningitis on day 18. There were no significant differences in the results of neurocognitive testing among the three treatment groups and a separate control group without Lyme disease. Diarrhea occurred significantly more often in the doxycycline-ceftriaxone group (35%) than in either of the other two groups (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Extending treatment with doxycycline from 10 to 20 days or adding one dose of ceftriaxone to the beginning of a 10-day course of doxycycline did not enhance therapeutic efficacy in patients with erythema migrans. Regardless of regimen, objective evidence of treatment failure was extremely rare.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

NOTE: Rapid administration is to be avoided. Parenteral therapy is indicated only when oral therapy is not indicated. Oral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible. If intravenous therapy is given over prolonged periods of time, thrombophlebitis may result.

The usual dosage and frequency of administration of Doxycycline for Injection (100 to 200 mg/day) differs from that of the other tetracyclines (1 to 2 g/day). Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects.

Studies to date have indicated that doxycycline hyclate at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of the antibiotic in patients with renal impairment.

Adults

The usual dosage of doxycycline for injection is 200 mg on the first day of treatment administered in one or two infusions. Subsequent daily dosage is 100 to 200 mg depending upon the severity of infection, with 200 mg administered in one or two infusions.

In the treatment of primary and secondary syphilis, the recommended dosage is 300 mg daily for at least 10 days.

In the treatment of inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) the recommended dose is 100 mg of doxycycline, twice a day. Parenteral therapy is only indicated when oral therapy is not indicated and should not be continued over a prolonged period of time. Oral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible. Therapy must continue for a total of 60 days.

### Effect of prolonged antibiotic treatment on cognition in patients with Lyme borreliosis [^114Q2Jjb]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether longer-term antibiotic treatment improves cognitive performance in patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis.

Methods

Data were collected during the Persistent Lyme Empiric Antibiotic Study Europe (PLEASE) trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Study participants passed performance-validity testing (measure for detecting suboptimal effort) and had persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. All patients received a 2-week open-label regimen of intravenous ceftriaxone before the 12-week blinded oral regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin/hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline and after 14, 26, and 40 weeks with neuropsychological tests covering the cognitive domains of episodic memory, attention/working memory, verbal fluency, speed of information processing, and executive function.

Results

Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled (n = 239) were comparable in all treatment groups. After 14 weeks, performance on none of the cognitive domains differed significantly between the treatment arms (p = 0.49–0.82). At follow-up, no additional treatment effect (p = 0.35–0.98) or difference between groups (p = 0.37–0.93) was found at any time point. Patients performed significantly better in several cognitive domains at weeks 14, 26, and 40 compared to baseline, but this was not specific to a treatment group.

Conclusions

A 2-week treatment with ceftriaxone followed by a 12-week regimen of doxycycline or clarithromycin/hydroxychloroquine did not lead to better cognitive performance compared to a 2-week regimen of ceftriaxone in patients with Lyme disease–attributed persistent symptoms.

Pediatric Patients

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 children (2–18 years of age) showed that allometrically-scaled clearance of doxycycline in children ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 3.58 [2.27–10.82] L/h/70 kg, N = 11) did not differ significantly from children > 8 to 18 years of age (3.27 [1.11–8.12] L/h/70 kg, N = 33). For pediatric patients weighing ≤ 45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 0.071 [0.041–0.202] L/kg/h, N = 10) did not differ significantly from those > 8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035–0.126] L/kg/h, N = 8). In pediatric patients weighing > 45 kg no clinically significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N = 1) and those > 8 years of age (0.044 [0.014–0.121] L/kg/h, N = 25). No clinically significant difference in CL differences between oral and IV were observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N = 19) or IV (N = 21) formulation alone.

A second trial randomized 54 subjects to 28 days of IV ceftriaxone vs IV placebo and at 6-month follow up showed improved fatigue vs baseline only in the treatment arm, with no improvement in other domains. A third trial compared IV ceftriaxone (23 subjects) to IV placebo (14 subjects) for 10 weeks; a cognitive index score at week 24 did not differ, though a secondary outcome improved at week 12 and was sustained to week 24 for pain and physical functioning, but not fatigue, and placebo groups also improved in fatigue (9.1% and 14.5%). In a more recent trial, 281 patients (89% previously treated) received 14 days of IV ceftriaxone followed by 12 weeks of doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo; at 52 weeks, health-related quality of life did not differ significantly among the 3 groups.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^1166Ypu5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Recommended Uses and Dosing of Doxycycline

Doxycycline can be used by travelers to all malaria-endemic areas for malaria prophylaxis. When used in conjunction with other medications, doxycycline can also be used to treat malaria.

Prophylaxis.

Doxycycline can be used for the prevention of malaria in travelers to malaria-endemic areas and is a good option for areas with chloroquine or multidrug-resistant P. falciparum. For prophylaxis, doxycycline is taken once daily beginning 1–2 days before travel, while in malarious areas, and for 4 weeks after leaving. Daily dosage for children ≥ 8 years of age is 2.2 mg/kg (not to exceed the adult dose of 100 mg) and for adults 100 mg.

Treatment.

Doxycycline should always be used in conjunction with another drug for treatment of malaria. Quinine with doxycycline can be used for uncomplicated malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum or P. vivax. When used for severe malaria doxycycline should be used with intravenous quinidine. The treatment dose of doxcycyline in adults is 100 mg twice a day and for children 2.2 mg/kg twice a day up to a maximum of 100 mg twice daily. For those unable to tolerate oral medications, doxycycline is available in a parenteral form and can be made in concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mg/mL. If pain occurs while receiving doxycycline intravenously, it is recommended to use more dilute concentrations (no lower than 0.1 mg/mL) infused at rates no higher than 1 mg/min; switch to an oral formulation once the patient is able to tolerate medications by mouth. If treating P. vivax or P. ovale, in addition to the aforementioned drugs, primaquine must also be given to prevent relapses (see Pharmacodynamics section).

### Doxycycline (okebo) [^112c1aTq]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.

Adults

The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

Pediatric Patients:

For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g. anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule is 4.4 mg per kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg per kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.

The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage.

When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.

Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS)

If gastric irritation occurs, it is recommended that doxycycline be given with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk.

Studies to date have indicated that administration of doxycycline at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of doxycycline in patients with renal impairment.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infections in Adults (Except Anorectal Infections in Men)

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.

Acute Epididymo-orchitis Caused by N. gonorrhoeae

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 10 days.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease [^111sp7H5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) affects 4% to 12% of women of reproductive age. The main intervention for acute PID is broad-spectrum antibiotics administered intravenously, intramuscularly or orally. We assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens to treat PID.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2020, located through hand and electronic searching; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; four other databases; and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to a comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and conducted GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 39 RCTs (6894 women) in this review, adding two new RCTs at this update. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. None of the studies reported quinolones and cephalosporins, or the outcomes laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID based on physician opinion or fertility outcomes. Length of stay results were insufficiently reported for analysis. Regimens containing azithromycin versus regimens containing doxycycline We are uncertain whether there was a clinically relevant difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55; 2 RCTs, 243 women; I² = 72%; very low-quality evidence). The analyses may result in little or no difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 309 women; low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34; 3 RCTs, 552 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin probably improves the rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67; 133 women; moderate-quality evidence), compared to doxycycline. Regimens containing quinolone versus regimens containing cephalosporin The analysis shows there may be little or no clinically relevant difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 772 women; I² = 15%; low-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 313 women; I² = 7%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there was a difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72; 6 RCTs, 1085 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens with nitroimidazole versus regimens without nitroimidazole There was probably little or no difference between regimens with or without nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 6 RCTs, 2660 women; I² = 50%; moderate-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 11 RCTs, 1383 women; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.61; 17 studies, 4021 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, there was little or no difference for rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; 3 RCTs, 1434 women; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone We are uncertain whether quinolone have little to no effect in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to clindamycin plus aminoglycoside (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; 1 RCT, 25 women; very low-quality evidence). The analysis may result in little or no difference between quinolone vs. clindamycin plus aminoglycoside in severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19; 2 studies, 151 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether quinolone reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72; 3 RCTs, 163 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus regimens containing cephalosporin We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside improves the rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 2 RCTs, 150 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). There was probably little or no difference in rates of cure in severe PID with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 10 RCTs, 959 women; I² = 21%; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment compared to cephalosporin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42; 10 RCTs, 1172 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether one treatment was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of mild-moderate or severe PID Based on a single study at a low risk of bias, a macrolide (azithromycin) probably improves the rates of cure of mild-moderate PID, compared to tetracycline (doxycycline).

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^115p8iCz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Summary

Indications.

The only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indication for the use of doxycycline for malaria is for prophylaxis of Plasmodium falciparum in short-term travelers (< 4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine-resistant strains. Although not FDA approved, doxycycline is recommended for prophylaxis of other species of malariaand may be used long term. When used in conjunction with other medications, doxycycline can be used for the treatment of malaria in non-pregnant adults and children ≥ 8 years of age: with quinine sulfate for uncomplicated, chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; with both quinine sulfate and primaquine for uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax; and with parenteral quinidine for severe malaria.

Dosing.

Available in multiple dosage forms and strengths, doxycycline tablets or capsules of 100 mg are most often used for malaria prophylaxis or treatment. Tablets or capsules should be swallowed with an adequate amount of fluid and should be taken with food. Intravenous (IV) formulation is available for patients unable to take oral medications for treatment. For IV, avoid rapid administration.

Adults.

Prophylaxis: 100 mg base once daily starting 1–2 days before travel, then daily during travel, and daily for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area.

Treatment: 100 mg twice a day for 7 days; must be used in conjunction with a fast acting schizontocide. Primaquine is also required if treating P. vivax or Plasmodium ovale.

Children.

For children ≥ 8 years of age.

Prophylaxis: 2.2 mg/kg (up to adult dose of 100 mg) daily starting 1–2 days before travel, daily during travel, and daily for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area.

Treatment: 2.2 mg/kg (up to adult dose of 100 mg) twice a day for 7 days; must be used in conjunction with a fast acting schizontocide. Primaquine is also required if treating P. vivax or P. ovale.

Efficacy.

Prophylaxis: Protective efficacy of doxycycline has been shown in three randomized placebo-controlled trials to be between 92% and 96% for P. falciparum and 98% for primary P. vivax infection.

Treatment: When used in combination with a fast acting schizontocide, treatment efficacy of doxycycline has been shown to be 96–100% in three open-label trials.

### Effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in children with Lyme neuroborreliosis-a retrospective study [^117RRetP]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In Norway, a non-inferiority trial was performed in 2007 on adult LNB patients. Participants (n = 118) were randomly allocated to receive intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g × 1 or oral doxycycline 200 mg × 1 for 14 days, 102 patients completed the study. After 4 months, patients were evaluated for clinical outcome by using a composite clinical score (range 0–64, 0 = complete recovery and 64 = no recovery). In the doxycycline group, 26 out of 54 (48%) patients were completely recovered and in the ceftriaxone group, 16 out of 48 (33%) patients were completely recovered. The study showed that oral doxycycline had an efficacy equal to intravenous ceftriaxone for treatment of LNB in adult patients. Recently, another Finnish study by Kortela et al. was published, comparing oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriaxone in adult LNB patients, further supporting these results.

In 2016 a systematic review was conducted on efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for LNB in children. Two randomized-control trials and four non-randomized studies on treatment of LNB in patients younger than 18 years of age were included. The authors conclude that there were no differences between the two strategies of antibiotic treatment (oral doxycycline versus intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics) in children with LNB, but the quality of evidence (GRADE) of the included studies was deemed very low. In addition, no evidence was found to support prolonged antibiotic treatment. In summary, there is still an important gap in knowledge concerning the most efficient strategy for antibiotic treatment in pediatric LNB patients.

The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate clinical outcome in children who have received intravenous ceftriaxone as compared to children who have receive oral doxycycline as antibiotic treatment for LNB.

### Doxycycline hyclate (doxycyclate hyclate) [^111VNH8X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile, and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration.

Following a 200 mg dose, normal adult volunteers averaged peak serum levels of 2.6 mcg/mL of doxycycline at 2 hours, decreasing to 1.45 mcg/mL at 24 hours. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40% per 72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min.). This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1 to 5% per 72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min.). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.

Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life.

Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 pediatric patients (2–18 years of age) showed that allometrically -scaled clearance (CL) of doxycycline in pediatric patients ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 3.58 [2.27–10.82] L/h/70 kg, N = 11) did not differ significantly from pediatric patients > 8 to 18 years of age (3.27 [1.11–8.12] L/h/70 kg, N = 33). For pediatric patients weighing ≤ 45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 0.071 [0.041–0.202] L/kg/h, N = 10) did not differ significantly from those > 8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035–0.126] L/kg/h, N = 8). In pediatric patients weighing > 45 kg, no clinically significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N = l) and those > 8 to 18 years of age (0.044 [0.014–0.121] L/kg/h, N = 25). No clinically significant difference in CL between oral and IV dosing was observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N = 19) or IV (N = 2l) formulation alone.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme carditis — antibiotic route and duration: In outpatients, we suggest oral antibiotics over IV antibiotics (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), while in hospitalized patients we suggest initially using IV ceftriaxone over oral antibiotics until there is evidence of clinical improvement, then switching to oral antibiotics to complete treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For total duration, we suggest 14–21 days of total antibiotic therapy over longer durations of treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Oral antibiotic choices for Lyme carditis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin.

### Cognitive function in post-treatment Lyme disease: do additional antibiotics help? [^114hHbsm]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It is controversial whether additional antibiotic treatment will improve cognitive function in patients with post-treatment chronic Lyme disease (PTCLD).

Objective

To determine whether antibiotic therapy improves cognitive function in two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies of patients with PTCLD.

Methods

A total of 129 patients with a physician-documented history of Lyme disease from three study sites in the northeast United States were studied. Seventy-eight were seropositive for IgG antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, and 51 were seronegative. Patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 30 days followed by oral doxycycline 200 mg daily for 60 days or matching IV and oral placebos. Assessments were made at 90 and 180 days after treatment. Symptom severity was measured from the cognitive functioning, pain, and role functioning scales of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS). Memory, attention, and executive functioning were assessed using objective tests. Mood was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.

Results

There were no significant baseline differences between seropositive and seronegative groups. Both groups reported a high frequency of MOS symptoms, depression, and somatic complaints but had normal baseline neuropsychological test scores. The combined groups showed significant decreases in MOS symptoms, higher objective test scores, and improved mood between baseline and 90 days. However, there were no significant differences between those receiving antibiotics and placebo.

Conclusion

Patients with post-treatment chronic Lyme disease who have symptoms but show no evidence of persisting Borrelia infection do not show objective evidence of cognitive impairment. Additional antibiotic therapy was not more beneficial than administering placebo.

### Oral doxycycline compared to intravenous ceftriaxone in the treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicenter, equivalence, randomized, open-label trial [^113eREuf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is often treated with intravenous ceftriaxone even if doxycycline is suggested to be noninferior to ceftriaxone. We evaluated the efficacy of oral doxycycline in comparison to ceftriaxone in the treatment of LNB.

Methods

Patients with neurological symptoms suggestive of LNB without other obvious reasons were recruited. The inclusion criteria were (1) production of Borrelia burgdorferi-specific antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum; (2) B. burgdorferi DNA in the CSF; or (3) an erythema migrans during the past 3 months. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, or intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 3 weeks. The participants described their subjective condition with a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (0 = normal; 10 = worst) before the treatment, and 4 and 12 months after the treatment. The primary outcome was the change in the VAS score at 12 months.

Results

Between 14 September 2012 and 28 December 2017, 210 adults with suspected LNB were assigned to receive doxycycline (n = 104) or ceftriaxone (n = 106). The per-protocol analysis comprised 82 patients with doxycycline and 84 patients with ceftriaxone. The mean change in the VAS score was -3.9 in the doxycycline group and -3.8 in the ceftriaxone group (mean difference, 0.17 [95% confidence interval, -.59 to .92], which is within the prespecified equivalence margins of -1 to 1 units). Participants in both groups improved equally.

Conclusions

Oral doxycycline is equally effective as intravenous ceftriaxone in the treatment of LNB.

### Are white matter hyperintensities associated with neuroborreliosis? The answer is twofold [^114pYSho]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Participants

In total, there were 74 patients and 65 control subjects with MRI scan from one or both assessment time points. Clinical trial participants (n = 63) were randomized, and received two or six weeks of oral doxycycline, and the remaining participants received oral doxycycline (1/11), initial intravenous ceftriaxone/penicillin followed by oral doxycycline (5/11) or intravenous ceftriaxone (5/11). There was no difference in sex distribution between the groups, odds ratio for patient male was 1.17 (95% confidence interval(CI) 0.60–2.27), (continuity corrected χ² = 0.080, p = 0.78, φ = 0.038). Mean age (SD, range) was similar in the groups, 57.4 (13.5, 20.5–81.8) years for the patients, and 57.7 (12.9, 25.7–81.3) years for the controls, mean difference was 0.23 (95% CI -4.68–4.21) years (t = -0.10, p = 0.92, Cohen's d = -0.017). Further patient characteristics are provided in Table 1.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Randomized trial of longer-term therapy for symptoms attributed to Lyme disease [^113B9N27]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. We assessed whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease leads to better outcomes than does shorter-term treatment.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Europe, we assigned patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease — either related temporally to proven Lyme disease or accompanied by a positive IgG or IgM immunoblot assay for Borrelia burgdorferi — to receive a 12-week oral course of doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo. All study groups received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for 2 weeks before initiating the randomized regimen. The primary outcome measure was health-related quality of life, as assessed by the physical-component summary score of the RAND-36 Health Status Inventory (RAND SF-36) (range, 15 to 61, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), at the end of the treatment period at week 14, after the 2-week course of ceftriaxone and the 12-week course of the randomized study drug or placebo had been completed.

Results

Of the 281 patients who underwent randomization, 280 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (86 patients in the doxycycline group, 96 in the clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine group, and 98 in the placebo group). The SF-36 physical-component summary score did not differ significantly among the three study groups at the end of the treatment period, with mean scores of 35.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.5 to 36.5) in the doxycycline group, 35.6 (95% CI, 34.2 to 37.1) in the clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine group, and 34.8 (95% CI, 33.4 to 36.2) in the placebo group (P = 0.69; a difference of 0.2 [95% CI, -2.4 to 2.8] in the doxycycline group vs. the placebo group and a difference of 0.9 [95% CI, -1.6 to 3.3] in the clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine group vs. the placebo group); the score also did not differ significantly among the groups at subsequent study visits (P = 0.35). In all study groups, the SF-36 physical-component summary score increased significantly from baseline to the end of the treatment period (P < 0.001). The rates of adverse events were similar among the study groups. Four serious adverse events thought to be related to drug use occurred during the 2-week open-label ceftriaxone phase, and no serious drug-related adverse event occurred during the 12-week randomized phase.

Conclusions

In patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment.

### Oral doxycycline versus intravenous ceftriaxone for European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blind, randomised trial [^112WvY3w]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of intravenous penicillin and ceftriaxone to treat Lyme neuroborreliosis is well documented, although oral doxycycline could be a cost-effective alternative. We aimed to compare the efficacy of oral doxycycline with intravenous ceftriaxone for the treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis.

Methods

From April, 2004, to October, 2007, we recruited consecutive adult patients from nine hospitals in southern Norway into a non-inferiority trial. Inclusion criteria were neurological symptoms suggestive of Lyme neuroborreliosis without other obvious causes, and presence of any of the following: a CSF white-cell count of more than five per mL; intrathecal production of specific Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies; or acrodermatitis chronicum atrophicans. Patients were randomly allocated to receive 200 mg oral doxycycline or 2 g intravenous ceftriaxone once per day for 14 days, in a double-blind, double-dummy design. A composite clinical score (range 0 to 64, 0 = best) was based on standardised interviews and clinical neurological examination. The primary outcome was reduction in clinical score at 4 months after the start of treatment. Analysis was per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00138801.

Findings

Of 118 patients who underwent randomisation, 102 completed the study (mean clinical score at baseline 8.5 [SD 4.1]). 4 months after the start of treatment, mean score improvement in the doxycycline group (n = 54) was 4.5 (95% CI 3.6 to 5.5) points and that in the ceftriaxone group (n = 48) was 4.4 (3.4 to 5.4) points (95% CI for difference between groups -0.9 to 1.1; p = 0.84). 26 (48%) patients in the doxycycline group and 16 (33%) in the ceftriaxone group had total recovery (95% CI for difference between groups -4% to 34%; p = 0.13). Side-effects possibly related to treatment were reported in 21 (37%) and 26 (46%) patients in these groups, respectively (-28% to 9%; p = 0.30). Three patients discontinued ceftriaxone treatment owing to adverse events.

Interpretation

Oral doxycycline is as efficient as intravenous ceftriaxone for the treatment of European adults with Lyme neuroborreliosis.

### Oral administration of doxycycline allows tight control of transgene expression: a key step towards gene therapy of retinal diseases [^1179Qu89]. Gene Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Gene transfer of neurotrophic or antiangiogenic factors has been shown to improve photoreceptor survival in retinal degenerative disorders (that is retinitis pigmentosa) and to prevent neovascularization in retinal vascular diseases (that is age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy). Expression of such neurotrophic or antiangiogenic factors after gene transfer requires the use of a regulatory system to control transgene expression to avoid unwanted side effects in cases of overexpression. In a previous study, we demonstrated that rAAV-mediated gene transfer of the tetracycline-regulatable (tetR) system allows transgene regulation in the retina of nonhuman primates after intravenous administration of doxycycline (Dox). The purpose of this study was to evaluate oral administration of Dox to control transgene expression in the retina, since the pharmacokinetics after oral administration of the inducer drug represent a key factor when considering advancing to clinical trials. We report on the outcome of this evaluation and demonstrate that oral administration of Dox at a dose that is clinically used in humans (5 mg kg⁻¹ per day) is capable to continuously induce transgene expression in all macaques tested for 6 months. Moreover, control of transgene expression persists up to 4 years post-subretinal injection, with maximal induced levels of transgene product remaining stable over time.

### Nervous system Lyme disease [^111ZokKs]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Medium credibility.

Nervous system Lyme disease — comparative data show oral doxycycline has similar efficacy to parenteral regimens in neuroborreliosis, with aggregation of eight studies finding the overall response rate to doxycycline was 98.6% of that to parenteral penicillin or ceftriaxone (95% CIs 94.8% to 102.5%) and summed relative risk RR is 0.986 (95% CIs 0.948 to 1.025). In a Class II study of Lyme meningitis, doxycycline 200 mg orally daily for 14 days (n = 31) was shown to be comparable to IV penicillin 3 g every 6 hours for 14 days (n = 23), and a non-randomized comparison reported comparable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and clinical responses with ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 10 to 14 days (n = 29) and oral doxycycline 200 mg/day for 10 to 14 days (n = 36). In no study were outcomes demonstrably different whether patients received doxycycline or parenteral beta-lactam regimens; altogether, these studies provide data on 300 patients with definite neuroborreliosis treated with doxycycline, with 15 retreated for persistent symptoms and none developing late neurologic sequelae during follow-up as long as several years. Separately, a Finnish Class III series described prolonged therapy in 60 patients treated for 100 days — half receiving 2 weeks of ceftriaxone followed by oral amoxicillin and half oral cefixime for the entire period — with 29/30 patients in each group considered cured at 1 year follow-up.

### Doxycycline versus prednisolone as an initial treatment strategy for bullous pemphigoid: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^116Xhxqk]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

This study provides new evidence that doxycycline has a positive effect in controlling bullous pemphigoid blisters when used for initial treatment as part of a long-term treatment strategy. The study confirms that oral prednisolone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day is highly effective for mild-to-moderate disease, albeit at the expense of potentially serious, life-threatening, and fatal related adverse events compared with doxycycline. Both drugs are relatively cheap and available worldwide.

Where whole-body application of super-potent topical corticosteroids for months is not practical, a strategy of starting oral doxycycline plus localised application of potent topical corticosteroids to blistersmight be considered in preference to the current standard practice of starting such patients on oral prednisolone. The estimates of the trade-off between reduced short-term effectiveness versus long-term safety gains according to disease severity obtained from this study now provide clear data to inform shared treatment decisions between health-care professionals and patients with bullous pemphigoid or their carers.

### Nervous system Lyme disease [^1131pS8i]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Medium credibility.

Nervous system Lyme disease — antimicrobial regimens and dosing are summarized as follows: Oral doxycycline (preferred) is listed with an adult dose of 100(-200) mg BID and pediatric dosing for those ≥ 8 y at 4–8 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses with a maximum 200 mg/dose (classification B). When doxycycline is contraindicated, amoxicillin is dosed at 500 mg TID for adults and 50 mg/kg/d in 3 divided doses with a maximum 500 mg/dose (classification C), and cefuroxime axetil is dosed at 500 mg BID for adults and 30 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses with a maximum 500 mg/dose (classification B). Parenteral options include ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily for adults and 50–75 mg/kg/d in 1 dose, max 2 g (classification B), cefotaxime 2 g IV Q8H for adults and 150–200 mg/kg/d in 3–4 divided doses with a max 6 g/day (classification B), and penicillin G 18–24 MU/d in divided doses Q4H for adults and 200–400,000 U/kg/d divided Q4H with a max 18–24 MU/day (classification B). For all regimens, recommended duration is 14 days, although courses ranging from 10 to 28 days have been used without significantly different outcomes; tetracyclines are relatively contraindicated in children < 8 years of age or in pregnant or lactating women; two oral alternatives (amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil) are effective in non–nervous system Lyme borreliosis with no efficacy data in neuroborreliosis and may be an oral alternative in individuals who cannot take doxycycline; and antibiotic dosage should be reduced for patients with impaired renal function.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile, and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration.

Following a 200 mg dose, normal adult volunteers averaged peak serum levels of 2.6 mcg/mL of doxycycline at 2 hours, decreasing to 1.45 mcg/mL at 24 hours. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40% per 72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min). This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1 to 5% per 72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half‑life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.

Hemodialysis does not alter serum half‑life.

Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 pediatric patients (2–18 years of age) showed that allometrically-scaled clearance (CL) of doxycycline in pediatric patients ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 3.58 [2.27–10.82] L/h/70 kg, N = 11) did not differ significantly from pediatric-patients > 8 to 18 years of age (3.27 [1.11–8.12] L/h/70 kg, N = 33). For pediatric patients weighing ≤ 45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years of age (median [range] 0.071 [0.041–0.202] L/kg/h, N = 10) did not differ significantly from those > 8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035–0.126] L/kg/h, N = 8). In pediatric patients weighing > 45 kg, no clinically significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥ 2 to ≤ 8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N = 1) and those > 8 to 18 years of age (0.044 [0.014–0.121] L/kg/h, N = 25). No clinically significant difference in CL between oral and IV dosing was observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N = 19) or IV (N = 21) formulation alone.

### Oral doxycycline for Lyme neuroborreliosis with symptoms of encephalitis, myelitis, vasculitis or intracranial hypertension [^1139BeCS]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The treatment recommendation for Lyme neuroborreliosis with central nervous system (CNS) symptoms is intravenous ceftriaxone, according to current American and European guidelines. For Lyme neuroborreliosis with peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms, treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline is considered equally effective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral doxycycline in the treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis with CNS symptoms.

Methods

Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis who had undergone cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling before and after treatment at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, during the period 1990–2012, were included in this retrospective study. The CSF mononuclear cell count was used as a surrogate marker of treatment outcome. Comparisons of CSF mononuclear cell counts were made between patients with CNS symptoms and patients with PNS symptoms before and after treatment with oral doxycycline.

Results

Twenty-six patients classified as having CNS symptoms and 115 patients classified as having PNS symptoms were included. The decline in CSF mononuclear cell counts did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients. All patients with CNS disease showed a marked clinical improvement after treatment, even though 62% had remaining symptoms at the end of follow-up.

Conclusion

Treatment with oral doxycycline resulted in a similar decrease in CSF mononuclear cell counts in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis with CNS symptoms compared with patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis with PNS symptoms. The results indicate that oral doxycycline is an effective treatment for Lyme neuroborreliosis irrespective of the severity of symptoms.

### When a patient suspected with juvenile idiopathic arthritis turns out to be diagnosed with an infectious disease-a review of Lyme arthritis in children [^115pPbN9]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment

According to current recommendations (B/III level) from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), children with LA should be treated initially with a 28-day course of oral antibiotics: doxycycline 4 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses (maximum of 100 mg per dose), cefuroxime axetil 30 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses (maximum of 500 mg per dose) or amoxicillin 50 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses (maximum of 500 mg per dose). Doxycycline is typically preferred because of its activity against B. burgdorferi sensu lato. However, doxycycline is not recommended for children < 8 years of age due to its contribution to discoloration of teeth.

In patients who are still symptomatic after the recommended treatment, another 4-week course of oral antibiotics or a 2–4-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone should be administered. Nevertheless, there is no benefit in further prolongation of antibiotic therapy. In a study performed by Berende et al. there was no significant difference of health-related quality of life between groups of patients who received 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone and then continued treatment with a 12-week course of oral doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine or placebo.

As even antibiotic-refractory cases of LA were shown by Steere et al. to eventually improve, further treatment is questionable. In persistent cases, symptomatic therapies with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or intra-articular corticosteroids are recommended in the United States according to the IDSA. Oral or intra-articular corticosteroids are contraindicated until antibiotic treatment is completed since these drugs permit greater growth of spirochetes, and because intra-articular steroid injections were reported to prolong duration of LA. DMARDs are typically prescribed for only 6–12 months rather than indefinitely as in the treatment of patients with JIA. Arthroscopic synovectomy may be an option when pharmacotherapy is eventually ineffective.

Spirochetal infection provides plethora of potential therapeutic targets for new designer drugs. These include, among others: ClpP protease which is upregulated by spirochetal persister cells and HtrA protease which plays a role in pathogenicity of B. burgdorferi.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

NOTE: Rapid administration is to be avoided. Parenteral therapy is indicated only when oral therapy is not indicated. Oral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible. If intravenous therapy is given over prolonged periods of time, thrombophlebitis may result.

The usual dosage and frequency of administration of Doxycycline for Injection (100 to 200 mg/day) differs from that of the other tetracyclines (1 to 2 g/day). Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects.

Studies to date have indicated that doxycycline hyclate at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of the antibiotic in patients with renal impairment.

Adults

The usual dosage of doxycycline for injection is 200 mg on the first day of treatment administered in one or two infusions. Subsequent daily dosage is 100 to 200 mg depending upon the severity of infection, with 200 mg administered in one or two infusions.

In the treatment of primary and secondary syphilis, the recommended dosage is 300 mg daily for at least 10 days.

In the treatment of inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) the recommended dose is 100 mg of doxycycline, twice a day. Parenteral therapy is only indicated when oral therapy is not indicated and should not be continued over a prolonged period of time. Oral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible. Therapy must continue for a total of 60 days.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^117LpNjV]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

European Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) typically presents with painful meningoradiculitis and/or cranial neuritis, accompanied with malaise and fatigue. More rare clinical manifestations are plexus neuritis, mononeuritis and central nervous system (CNS) syndromes such as myelitis, vasculitis and encephalitis. It is an unambiguous agreement that patients with LNB should be treated with antibiotics as soon as possible, but both the choice of antibiotic type and treatment duration have been subjects for discussion.

Intravenously administered beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin G, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) and orally administered doxycycline are proven effective and hold relatively good cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration. Orally administered doxycycline has been shown to be non-inferior to intravenous ceftriaxone in typical LNB, and probably effective in LNB with mainly CNS involvement. In line with this knowledge, European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines from 2010recommend treatment with either a beta-lactam antibiotic or doxycycline in adults. The final choice of antibiotic type depends on individual factors such as age, tolerability, pregnancy, breast-feeding and preferred mode of administration. According to the guidelines, patients with encephalitis, myelitis or vasculitis should be treated with intravenous ceftriaxone.

The recommendations regarding treatment duration are divergent. The EFNS guidelines recommend 2 weeks for early LNB, defined as pretreatment symptom duration under 6 months and 3 weeks for late LNB, defined as pretreatment symptom duration over 6 months. The German guidelines from 2020are in accordance with EFNS guidelines, but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines from 2018 recommend 3 weeks irrespective of symptom duration. These recommendations are mainly based on clinical experience, as scientific evidence is scarce. To our knowledge, there is only one previous randomised trial comparing treatment lengths in disseminated Lyme borreliosis. In that trial, including 62 with definite and 53 with possible LNB, the long-term outcome did not differ in patients treated for 3 weeks with intravenous ceftriaxone as compared with patients treated 3 weeks with intravenous ceftriaxone, followed by amoxicillin for 100 days. It is also noticeable that several studies have evaluated prolonged antibiotic treatment in patients suffering from so-called post-Lyme disease without demonstrating benefits.

### Outpatient oral doxycycline therapy for ocular syphilis [^112HSx6d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

A total of 32 patients with ocular syphilis (median [IQR] age, 46 [36–56] years; 25 males [78%]) were identified and met the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature classification criteria for syphilitic uveitisor had isolated luetic optic neuritis. Sixteen patients (50%) received oral doxycycline (7 patients [44%] received only oral doxycycline; 9 patients [56%] received a short course of parenteral penicillin followed by a full course of oral doxycycline) and 16 patients (50%) received a full course of IV penicillin. There was no difference in the age, sex, race, HIV infection rate, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, treponemal test positivity, or ocular manifestations between the doxycycline vs penicillin groups (Table 1). The median visual acuity at presentation and at final follow up was better in the doxycycline group than the penicillin group (Table 2). Visual acuity improved or remained stable for 30 of 32 patients (94%). There was no difference in the rates of ocular inflammation resolution among patients who were treated with doxycycline or penicillin. Eleven of 12 patients (92%) were successfully treated with doxycycline without requiring an IV line or hospitalization. A 4-fold decrease in rapid plasma regain (RPR) titers was seen in all patients with at least 9 months of follow up (4 of 4 patients receiving doxycycline [100%]; 7 of 7 patients receiving penicillin [100%]). A sensitivity analysis separating the oral doxycycline only and mixed parenteral penicillin and oral doxycycline subgroups was consistent with the primary analysis results.

### Oral treatment of Whipple's disease with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine versus intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in Germany: a phase 2 / 3, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^115JuC4Q]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

Previous studies have shown that intravenous ceftriaxone or meropenem for 14 days, followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 1 year, cures 98% of people with Whipple's disease. However, intravenous therapy requires hospitalisation and carries risks for treatment-associated complications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether oral-only treatment for Whipple's disease is non-inferior to intravenous therapy.

Methods

This phase 2/3, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial enrolled individuals aged 18 years or older with confirmed Whipple's disease from across Germany who had received treatment for less than 1 month at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with block randomisation to receive either intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g once per day) for 14 days, followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (960 mg twice per day) for 12 months, or oral doxycycline (100 mg twice per day) plus hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice per day) for 12 months. Ten participants who had already received intravenous ceftriaxone were non-randomly assigned to the intravenous treatment group. Participants in the oral-only treatment group were PCR-positive for Tropheryma whipplei in cerebrospinal fluid received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (960 mg five times per day) until clearance. The primary outcome was complete clinical remission without recurrence during the observation period of 24 months, assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was -18%. Safety was a secondary endpoint, assessed in the ITT population. The study was registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT 2008–003951–54, and is completed.

Findings

Between May 26, 2010, and Oct 30, 2018, we screened 310 individuals and enrolled 64 participants in the study. After exclusion of four individuals whose diagnosis was not confirmed, 31 participants were assigned to the intravenous treatment group and 29 to the oral-only treatment group. By ITT, 25 (81%) of 31 participants in the intravenous treatment group and 28 (97%) of 29 participants in the oral-only treatment group had complete clinical remission without recurrence. The risk difference was 15.9 percentage points (95% CI -1.2 to 33.1), with the lower bound of the 95% CI above our non-inferiority margin of -18%. A post-hoc per-protocol analysis confirmed the non-inferiority of oral-only treatment. No participant relapsed, but two participants in the intravenous treatment group died from nosocomial infections. Serious adverse events occurred in 13 (42%) of 31 participants in the intravenous treatment group and eight (28%) of 29 participants in the oral-only treatment group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.244).

Interpretation

Oral-only treatment of Whipple's disease was safe and non-inferior to sequential intravenous-oral treatment. Oral treatment facilitates patient management and might reduce hospital-acquired treatment complications and costs.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR): 2020 guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^113cLS6S]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease — antimicrobial treatment principles and durations — uses agents active against Borrelia burgdorferi, with erythema migrans cases "treated with 7–14 days on an appropriate antibiotic depending on which drug is prescribed", while "other clinical manifestations are typically treated with 14–28 days of an appropriate antibiotic" based on the manifestation. Commonly used antibiotics in North America include "doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin", and "under most circumstances, oral therapy is effective and preferred over intravenous (IV) therapy due to equivalent efficacies, better tolerability, and lower cost", though indications for IV therapy such as hospitalization are discussed elsewhere in the guideline.
