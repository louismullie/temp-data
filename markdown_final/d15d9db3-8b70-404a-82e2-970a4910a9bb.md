## Question

can fatty liver disease be diagnosed via clinical diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fatty liver disease can be diagnosed clinically, and if so, how to structure that reasoning step-by-step with supporting references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "clinical diagnosis" means in this context. Then, I should verify the formal diagnostic criteria for NAFLD versus MAFLD. Next, I will review the role of noninvasive tests versus liver biopsy. After that, I should outline a pragmatic clinical diagnostic pathway and note its limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and caveats, ensuring I align with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. By "clinical diagnosis", I mean a diagnosis made at the bedside using history, exam, laboratory tests, and noninvasive imaging, without tissue confirmation, reserving biopsy for uncertain or advanced cases, which is the prevailing approach in contemporary practice for NAFLD/MASLD risk stratification and management [^1174D9GG].

> I need to check the formal diagnostic criteria next. For NAFLD, the classic definition requires evidence of hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology and exclusion of other causes such as significant alcohol intake, steatogenic medications, or monogenic disorders; histologically, ≥ 5% steatosis defines steatosis, and NASH adds inflammation with hepatocyte ballooning, with or without fibrosis [^117StPTZ]. For MAFLD (now MASLD), the newer framework uses positive criteria: presence of steatosis plus overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, or metabolic dysregulation, without requiring exclusion of other liver diseases, which operationalizes a clinical diagnosis anchored in metabolic risk [^1164UyWK] [^115Fx7pu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I should confirm which noninvasive modalities are appropriate for confirming steatosis in routine care. Ultrasound is widely available but has limited sensitivity for mild steatosis; controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) improves detection and can be used with transient elastography, while MRI–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) is the most sensitive and accurate for quantifying steatosis and tracking change, though access and cost vary [^116GN7V6] [^115xKUdj]. Wait, I initially thought standard ultrasound was first-line for everyone; I should correct that — AASLD notes standard ultrasound is not recommended to identify steatosis due to low sensitivity, whereas CAP or MRI-PDFF are preferred when available, which reframes the imaging hierarchy in practice [^116GN7V6].

> Next, I should review how to exclude competing etiologies without biopsy in most patients. I need to ensure alcohol intake is assessed carefully, since thresholds of ≥ 30 g/day in men and ≥ 20 g/day in women are commonly used to define "significant" intake that would reclassify disease toward alcohol-related liver disease rather than NAFLD; medication and viral etiologies should also be screened and excluded when suspected [^117StPTZ] [^1128RHGj]. But wait, what if alcohol and metabolic risk coexist? The new nomenclature recognizes MetALD as a distinct category when significant alcohol use accompanies metabolic dysfunction, which affects prognosis and may alter management considerations, so I should document this explicitly rather than forcing an exclusion framework that no longer universally applies [^116pUXU3].

> I will now examine risk stratification for fibrosis, because prognosis and treatment decisions hinge on fibrosis stage. Let me verify the recommended first-line tools: FIB-4 and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score are validated, widely available, and recommended to stratify risk; transient elastography (VCTE) and MR elastography (MRE) provide liver stiffness estimates that correlate with fibrosis and can adjudicate indeterminate cases or those with high clinical suspicion of advanced disease [^1128RHGj] [^111YVYwf]. Hold on, I should double-check thresholds and prognostic use — MRE ≥ 5.7–6.8 kPa predicts decompensation and mortality in NAFLD cohorts, and VCTE ≥ 25 kPa supports clinically significant portal hypertension in appropriate contexts, which guides surveillance and referral decisions without immediate recourse to biopsy [^111YVYwf].

> Let me consider when liver biopsy is actually necessary, because I need to ensure I'm not overcalling noninvasive pathways. Biopsy remains the reference standard to distinguish simple steatosis from NASH and to stage fibrosis, but it is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, discordant noninvasive tests, atypical features, or when histology will change management or is required for clinical trials; importantly, cirrhosis-based management can be initiated on clinical and noninvasive grounds without biopsy when suspicion is high [^116vCw3T] [^114V6RrY] [^115uMjg5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied biopsy is obsolete — it is not; it is simply impractical at scale and carries risks, so noninvasive algorithms are prioritized for most patients while biopsy remains pivotal in selected scenarios [^1174D9GG].

> Next, I should review the practical clinical diagnostic pathway to ensure internal consistency. In a patient with metabolic risk factors or incidentally detected steatosis, I would confirm steatosis with CAP or MRI-PDFF when available, exclude other causes including alcohol, medications, and viral hepatitis, apply FIB-4 to triage fibrosis risk, and if intermediate/high risk, proceed to VCTE or MRE. If results are discordant or clinical suspicion remains high, I would refer for biopsy and specialist evaluation, aligning with AGA and AASLD pathways [^1126AaMa] [^117XJt7D]. I should confirm that this approach is consistent with primary care guidance as well — yes, AAFP similarly recommends FIB-4 first, followed by elastography or ELF when indicated, to efficiently identify advanced fibrosis in at-risk populations [^114PPifh].

> But wait, what about limitations of a purely clinical diagnosis? I need to ensure I acknowledge them transparently. Noninvasive tests cannot reliably distinguish NASH from simple steatosis in individual patients, and ALT is an imperfect gatekeeper since up to half of patients with NAFLD, especially with diabetes, may have normal aminotransferases; thus, a clinical diagnosis of "NAFLD" is feasible, but "NASH" still requires biopsy unless noninvasive surrogates are explicitly validated for that purpose in the specific clinical context [^114QeykZ] [^114PPifh]. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance still positions biopsy as the reference for NASH — yes, biopsy remains the gold standard for NASH and early fibrosis characterization when histology will influence management or trial eligibility [^116vCw3T].

> Let me reconsider the overarching question and synthesize. Can fatty liver disease be diagnosed clinically? Yes, for the broad category of NAFLD/MASLD, a clinical diagnosis is standard in routine practice: confirm steatosis noninvasively, apply exclusion criteria for NAFLD or positive metabolic criteria for MAFLD/MASLD, and risk-stratify fibrosis with validated tools; biopsy is reserved for uncertainty or advanced disease evaluation, and this approach is endorsed by multisociety guidance and expert pathways [^117StPTZ] [^1164UyWK] [^1126AaMa] [^117XJt7D]. I should double-check that my conclusion aligns with contemporary reviews — yes, noninvasive assessment is now the cornerstone for diagnosis and monitoring in most patients, with biopsy used selectively, which operationalizes a clinically grounded diagnostic strategy [^1174D9GG].

Fatty liver disease can be diagnosed clinically when **imaging confirms steatosis** (ultrasound, CAP, or MRI-PDFF) and other causes are excluded, especially alcohol and viral hepatitis [^115xKUdj] [^112TeHbB]. Aminotransferases may be normal or mildly elevated, so **normal LFTs do not exclude disease** [^111Kcogb]. Clinical diagnosis is appropriate for most patients, but **biopsy is reserved** for diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, or suspected advanced fibrosis [^114V6RrY] [^116GP2Mz]. Noninvasive fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NFS) and elastography (VCTE/MRE) are used to stage disease and guide management [^111YVYwf] [^111Rtjcv].

---

## Clinical features and risk factors

Patients are often asymptomatic or have nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant discomfort) [^112MQWNc]; risk factors include obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome [^114Kzz3Z]. Many patients have **normal or mildly elevated aminotransferases**, so normal LFTs do not exclude disease [^114Kzz3Z].

---

## Clinical diagnosis criteria

Clinical diagnosis of fatty liver disease requires:

- **Evidence of hepatic steatosis**: Imaging (ultrasound, CAP, or MRI-PDFF) or histology [^115xKUdj] [^117StPTZ].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Significant alcohol intake, steatogenic medications, viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, and metabolic disorders [^1128RHGj] [^111Rtjcv].
- **Metabolic risk factors**: Overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, or metabolic dysregulation [^1164UyWK].

---

## Role of imaging in clinical diagnosis

Imaging is central to clinical diagnosis, providing **noninvasive confirmation of steatosis**:

| **Imaging modality** | **Sensitivity and specificity** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | Moderate sensitivity; high specificity | First-line for steatosis detection; widely available [^115zFRcq] |
| Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) | High sensitivity; moderate specificity | Quantifies steatosis; integrates with elastography [^115xKUdj] |
| MRI-PDFF | High sensitivity and specificity | Quantifies steatosis; detects low-grade fat; monitors change [^115xKUdj] |

---

## Laboratory tests and biomarkers

Laboratory tests support diagnosis and risk stratification but are **not definitive**:

- **Aminotransferases**: Often normal or mildly elevated; normal LFTs do not exclude disease [^111Kcogb].
- **Noninvasive fibrosis scores**: FIB-4 and NFS identify advanced fibrosis risk [^111Rtjcv].
- **Elastography**: VCTE and MRE assess fibrosis stage and guide management [^111Rtjcv].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Clinical diagnosis has limitations: imaging cannot reliably distinguish simple steatosis from NASH or stage fibrosis, and **histology remains the gold standard** for definitive diagnosis and staging [^114QeykZ] [^115ccwNS]. Overdiagnosis can occur if other causes are not adequately excluded, and underdiagnosis is common due to nonspecific symptoms and normal LFTs [^114hnrrF] [^114kUQB1].

---

## Indications for liver biopsy

Liver biopsy is indicated when:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Competing etiologies or atypical features [^114V6RrY].
- **Advanced fibrosis suspected**: Discordant noninvasive tests or high-risk clinical features [^116GP2Mz].
- **Clinical trial participation**: Histologic confirmation required [^114B4ynY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **noninvasive, risk-stratified approach**: screen high-risk patients (e.g. type 2 diabetes, obesity) with FIB-4 and elastography, and reserve biopsy for diagnostic uncertainty or suspected advanced fibrosis [^117XJt7D] [^114V6RrY]. Lifestyle modification and weight loss are first-line therapy, with pharmacotherapy for high-risk patients [^115DTQEk].

---

Fatty liver disease can be diagnosed clinically using imaging and exclusion of other causes, with **noninvasive fibrosis assessment** guiding management; biopsy is reserved for uncertainty or advanced disease [^112F4mYT].

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels in both developed and developing countries. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of NAFLD, are at risk for progressive liver disease and in need of effective treatment options. A practical approach may be pursued by identifying patients with NAFLD with the highest likelihood for histologic evidence of NASH. Despite decades of clinical trials, no single treatment can be recommended to all patients with NASH. Importantly, there is no evidence that pioglitazone or vitamin E improves fibrosis. Bariatric surgeries may improve hepatic histology in morbidly obese patients with NASH, although randomized clinical trials are lacking. Currently, NASH is the second leading etiology of liver disease among adults awaiting liver transplantation in the United States. The primary and secondary prevention of NAFLD may require aggressive strategies for managing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113VC52i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally in the primary care or hospital setting on the basis of elevated liver enzyme levels or hepatic steatosis on imaging. NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum: The vast majority of patients have nonprogressive nonalcoholic fatty liver, and a few of those develop progressive liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, a condition termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Persons with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis have increased liver-related mortality. In the absence of regulatory agency-approved drugs, lifestyle modification and weight loss remain the cornerstones of NAFLD therapy.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): diagnosis, pitfalls, and staging [^113BYw8q]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly prevalent and strongly associated with obesity, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, not only in the Western societies, but also in most regions of the world in the 21st century. The spectrum of its histopathology ranges from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with risk for progressive fibrosis that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Benign and malignant liver tumors have also been more frequently reported with the increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes. This review addresses the pathology of NAFLD and NASH, and their diagnostic features, diagnostic pitfalls, grading and staging, and clinical correlation.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^114221NJ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the UK with approximately a third of the population being affected. The exact prevalence is not known, but population studies from the USA and China using magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimate that approximately 30% of the general population have steatosis. It is a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), through to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. The majority have simple steatosis, but approximately 10–30% develop NASH and the development of NASH cirrhosis is associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Patients with NASH have increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality. Many patients with NAFLD remain undiagnosed, and recognising those at risk is the first step. Clinicians overly rely on abnormal liver enzymes to identify patients with NAFLD, so patients with significant liver disease can be overlooked, potentially missing opportunities for intervention. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard method for diagnosing and staging NAFLD, the majority of patients can be effectively diagnosed non-invasively with tests that are routinely available in the clinic today. This review discusses a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and staging of NAFLD so that patients at the highest risk of liver-related complications can be identified.

Miscellaneous guidance statements pertinent to clinical practice — screening in NAFLD/NASH: Patients with NASH cirrhosis should be screened for gastroesophageal varices according to the AASLD and ACG practice guidelines. Patients with cirrhosis suspected because of NAFLD should be considered for HCC screening according to the AASLD practice guidelines. Current evidence does not support routine screening and surveillance for HCC in patients with noncirrhotic NASH. Current evidence does not support routinely repeating a liver biopsy in patients with NAFL or NASH, but this may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Pathology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112TM4WV]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant complication of obesity and is recognized as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. The process occurs in adults and children and is characterized by the presence of increased amounts of fat in the liver (steatosis). With inflammation, cell death and scarring (fibrosis), the process may result in end-stage liver disease, or be a precursor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Excess hepatic fat is now recognized as an independent marker for increased cardiovascular risk. Even though imaging studies and laboratory-based tests are accurate at detecting significant steatosis and/or advanced fibrosis, respectively, the diagnosis and characterization of NAFLD ultimately depend on histopathologic evaluation, as the parenchymal alterations that comprise the spectrum of injury in NAFLD include patterns as well as specific lesions. Histologic findings in children may differ from those in adults. In this Review, the histologic features that are diagnostic and discriminatory between steatosis and steatohepatitis, the significance of the distinction between steatosis and steatohepatitis, the types and locations of fibrosis, and the histologic variances between adult and pediatric NAFLD are discussed. Clinical advantages as well as potential drawbacks of liver biopsy are presented. Current pathophysiologic concepts relevant to histologic findings are discussed.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. NAFLD is a spectrum of the disease characterized by hepatic steatosis when no other causes for secondary hepatic fat accumulation (e.g. excessive alcohol consumption) can be identified. NAFLD ranges from the more benign condition of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is at the more severe end of the spectrum. NAFLD may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. In NAFLD, hepatic steatosis is present without evidence of inflammation, whereas in NASH, hepatic steatosis is associated with lobular inflammation and apoptosis that can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Before the middle of the last decade, NASH was widely considered a serious condition, occurring almost exclusively in females with obesity, often associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and relatively benign prognosis, that are predictive risk factors of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. The prevalence of liver disease (NAFLD) has risen rapidly in Western countries, with a worldwide prevalence of 25%. NAFLD is becoming more common chronic liver disease in Western industrialized countries, particularly in patients with central obesity, T2DM, dyslipidaemia, and metabolic syndrome.

In terms of diagnostic tests, the gold standard to investigate any form of liver inflammation e.g. damage is a liver biopsy. In the diagnosis of NAFLD and related disorders, liver biopsies can be extremely helpful and its findings can range from triglyceride deposition as droplets in the hepatocyte to more extensive forms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is normally characterised by the earlier mentioned lipid droplets in hepatocytes, with concomitant inflammation and a variable degree of hepatic fibrosis. In the majority of the liver steatosis patients, the disease is 'non-progressive', however a small portion of these patients develop the earlier mentioned NASH, which can lead to liver failure and even hepatocellular carcinoma.

NAFLD management's US guidelines define NAFLD as steatosis with ≥ 5% fat infiltration in imaging or histology and b) no alcohol, drug, or viral-induced steatosis. NAFLD patients may present with elevated liver enzymes.

### Noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: present and future [^111TukCw]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. It currently affects approximately 30% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. NAFLD represents a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from simple fatty liver which in general follows a benign nonprogressive clinical course, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a more serious form of NAFLD that may progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. At present, a liver biopsy remains the only reliable way to diagnose NASH and establish the presence of fibrosis. Current noninvasive clinically available tests lack accuracy and reliability. In light of the dramatic increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in conjunction with the significant research effort in developing novel therapies for patients with NASH, noninvasive, simple, reproducible, and reliable biomarkers are greatly needed. They will not only help in the diagnosis of NASH, but also be useful for assessment of treatment response and prognosis and remain a research priority in the NAFLD field.

### A new noninvasive technique for estimating hepatic triglyceride: will liver biopsy become redundant in diagnosing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? [^116oi1Np]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Future perspectives

Multi-echo MRI is an attractive noninvasive technique to measure the grade of steatosis. However, as long as the grade of hepatic fat has no direct effect on liver disease, in contrast to NASH, multi-echo MRI at best measures an intermediate endpoint. Histopathological assessment of hepatitis and fibrosis, by means of a biopsy, remains the gold standard to differentiate between NAFLD and NASH. Therefore the use of multi-echo MRI is probably restricted to clinical research. On a different note, we encourage the development of new noninvasive techniques to grade steatosis because they can be of great value in patients with NASH. There, these techniques can play a role in monitoring the reduction of steatosis through lifestyle changes. In such cases, steatosis is a worthwhile intermediate endpoint that is associated with improved histological lesions that occur in NASH, such as hepatitis, hepatocellular ballooning and fibrosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^111YKHvC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Alcoholic liver disease — clinical spectrum, diagnosis, severity, and management highlights are as follows: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications, and most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with limited data on early disease. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. Alcoholic hepatitis presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice and, in severe cases, may transition to acute on chronic liver failure with risk for mortality that may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH, and long-term mortality is related to the severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures for hospitalized ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis and may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to endocrinologists, primary care clinicians, health care professionals, and other stakeholders.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology conducted literature searches for relevant articles published from January 1, 2010, to November 15, 2021. A task force of medical experts developed evidence-based guideline recommendations based on a review of clinical evidence, expertise, and informal consensus, according to established American Association of Clinical Endocrinology protocol for guideline development.

Recommendation Summary

This guideline includes 34 evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of persons with NAFLD and/or NASH and contains 385 citations that inform the evidence base.

Conclusion

NAFLD is a major public health problem that will only worsen in the future, as it is closely linked to the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given this link, endocrinologists and primary care physicians are in an ideal position to identify persons at risk on to prevent the development of cirrhosis and comorbidities. While no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medications to treat NAFLD are currently available, management can include lifestyle changes that promote an energy deficit leading to weight loss; consideration of weight loss medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; and bariatric surgery, for persons who have obesity, as well as some diabetes medications, such as pioglitazone and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NASH. Management should also promote cardiometabolic health and reduce the increased cardiovascular risk associated with this complex disease.

### Paediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: an approach to pathological evaluation [^116LK6e7]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming an increasingly important healthcare issue along with the rising rates of obesity worldwide. It is the most common chronic liver disease in the paediatric population and the fastest growing indication for liver transplant in young adults. The pathogenesis is complex with contributions from multiple factors and genetic predisposition. While non-invasive laboratory tests and imaging modalities are being increasingly used, the liver biopsy continues to play a crucial role in the diagnosis and prognosis of NAFLD. Histologically, the assessment of paediatric fatty liver disease requires special considerations with respect to a periportal predominant pattern seen in prepubertal patients, as well as a different set of disease processes in the differential diagnosis. In this review, we provide a summary of current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical course of paediatric NAFLD as well as the clinical guidelines on diagnosis and management. We discuss the indications and limitations of liver biopsy, histological patterns seen in paediatric NAFLD, other entities to be considered in the differential diagnosis, and conclude with appropriate triaging of liver biopsies and essential elements of pathology reporting.

Purpose

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic disorder that frequently coexists with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The NAFLD spectrum, ranging from hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, can be associated with long-term hepatic (hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extrahepatic complications. Diagnosis of NAFLD requires detection of liver steatosis with exclusion of other causes of chronic liver disease. Screening for NAFLD and identification of individuals at risk of end-stage liver disease represent substantial challenges that have yet to be met. NAFLD affects up to 25% of adults, yet only a small proportion will progress beyond steatosis to develop advanced disease (steatohepatitis and fibrosis) associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Identification of this cohort has required the gold standard liver biopsy, which is both invasive and expensive. The use of serum biomarkers and noninvasive imaging techniques is an area of significant clinical relevance. This narrative review outlines current and emerging technologies for the diagnosis of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and hepatic fibrosis.

Methods

We reviewed the literature using PubMed and reviewed national and international guidelines and conference proceedings to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence.

Findings

Significant advances have been made during the past 2 decades that have enhanced noninvasive assessment of NAFLD without the need for liver biopsy. For the detection of steatosis, abdominal ultrasonography remains the first-line investigation, although a controlled attenuation parameter using transient elastography is more sensitive. For detecting fibrosis, noninvasive serum markers of fibrosis and algorithms based on routine biochemistry are available, in addition to transient elastography. These techniques are well validated and have been incorporated into national and international screening guidelines. These approaches have facilitated more judicious use of liver biopsy but are yet to entirely replace it. Although serum biomarkers present a pragmatic and widely available screening approach for NAFLD in large population-based studies, magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer the benefit of achieving high degrees of accuracy in disease grading, tumor staging, and assessing therapeutic response.

Implications

This diagnostic clinical and research field is rapidly evolving; increasingly combined applications of biomarkers and transient elastography or imaging of selective (intermediate or high risk) cases are being used for clinical and research purposes. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard investigation, particularly in the context of clinical trials, but noninvasive options are emerging, using multimodality assessment, that are quicker, more tolerable, more widely available and have greater patient acceptability.

### Identification and characterization of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114kUQB1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by substantial diagnostic and evaluation gaps with no systematic screening. Even recognized cases are undercoded because of the perceived benign nature of disease and current absence of approved pharmacologic treatment. NAFLD is often detected incidentally, particularly in the asymptomatic early phase. We doubled NAFLD detection via natural language processing of 1 million imaging reports combined with laboratory data from an unselected population. We describe NAFLD comorbidities and health care utilization as compared with age, sex, and body mass index matched control subjects.

### Updates in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^113dYHbB]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in childhood. There is an increase in disease prevalence and diagnoses as it is difficult to diagnose the problem. There are currently no effective medications. Management of NAFLD is a challenge for primary care clinicians and subspecialists. This paper provides guidelines for disease screening, diagnosis, management, and algorithm for subspecialty referral.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112TeHbB]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Initial evaluation of a patient with NAFLD states that patients with NAFLD are most commonly referred with incidentally noted hepatic steatosis on imaging or elevated liver chemistries; normal laboratory reference ranges may exceed what is appropriate for NAFLD, in which a true normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ranges from 29 to 33 U/L in men and from 19 to 25 U/L in women; initial evaluation should include screening for metabolic comorbidities, assessment of alcohol intake, exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and physical examination to identify signs of insulin resistance and advanced liver disease; and when the clinical profile is atypical or accompanied by additional signs or symptoms suggesting additional/alternate etiologies, less common causes of steatosis or steatohepatitis should be excluded.

### Biopsy and noninvasive methods to assess progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1125CqgP]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of histopathologic features, ranging from isolated hepatic steatosis, to steatohepatitis with evidence of hepatocellular injury and fibrosis, to cirrhosis. The diagnosis and determination of NAFLD prognosis requires clinical and histopathologic assessments. Liver biopsy still is regarded as the reference for differentiating steatosis (NAFL) from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, for staging hepatic fibrosis, and for identifying NAFLD in patients with other chronic liver disease. Standardized grading and staging histologic scoring systems, such as the NAFLD activity score and the steatosis, activity, and fibrosis score, can help guide clinical decisions and assess outcomes of clinical trials. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of NAFLD and technologic advances have led to algorithms that can be used to assess serum biomarkers and imaging methods that are noninvasive alternatives to biopsy collection and analysis. We review the advantages and limitations of biopsy analysis and noninvasive tests as diagnostic and prognostic tools for patients with NAFLD. We also discuss techniques to improve dynamic histopathology assessment, and emerging blood and imaging biomarkers of fibrogenesis.

Transaminase interpretation — limitations and thresholds are noted: Serum AST levels are often used clinically but can be normal in patients with diabetes, NASH, and advanced hepatic fibrosis; although AST levels are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying NAFLD/NASH with advanced fibrosis, intermittently or chronically (≥ 6–12 mo) elevated ALT or AST above a threshold of 30 U/L may suggest the presence of chronic liver injury, with these thresholds exceeding many laboratory upper reference ranges.

### How would you manage this patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115HtRtX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common diagnosis in the United States and other developed countries, has been increasing in prevalence. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recently published updated practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing NAFLD, including the following recommendations: Routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups is not advised because of uncertainties surrounding test and treatment options, along with a lack of knowledge about cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits. Noninvasive studies, including biomarkers from laboratory tests and liver stiffness measured through elastography, are clinically useful tools for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or advanced fibrosis. Weight loss of at least 3% to 5% generally reduces NASH, but greater weight loss (7% to 10%) is needed to improve most histopathologic features, including fibrosis. Pharmacologic therapies (such as pioglitazone and vitamin E) should be considered only in patients with biopsy-proven NASH. Patients with NAFLD should not consume heavy amounts of alcohol, although insufficient data exist to provide advice about other levels of alcohol use. Here, 2 clinicians with expertise in this area debate whether to screen for NAFLD in primary care, how to monitor patients with NAFLD, and what interventions should be used to manage this condition.

### MAFLD: a consensus-driven proposed nomenclature for metabolic associated fatty liver disease [^116DcxSn]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fatty liver associated with metabolic dysfunction is common, affects a quarter of the population, and has no approved drug therapy. Although pharmacotherapies are in development, response rates appear modest. The heterogeneous pathogenesis of metabolic fatty liver diseases and inaccuracies in terminology and definitions necessitate a reappraisal of nomenclature to inform clinical trial design and drug development. A group of experts sought to integrate current understanding of patient heterogeneity captured under the acronym nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and provide suggestions on terminology that more accurately reflects pathogenesis and can help in patient stratification for management. Experts reached consensus that NAFLD does not reflect current knowledge, and metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease "MAFLD" was suggested as a more appropriate overarching term. This opens the door for efforts from the research community to update the nomenclature and subphenotype the disease to accelerate the translational path to new treatments.

Introduction

Thanks to the pioneering insights into scientists like Thomas Addison who in 1845 used the term 'fatty liver', Klatskin in 1979, and Jurgen Ludwig in 1980 who coined non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), our knowledge about this disease has exponentially increased. This legacy of scientific discovery for improving human health has transformed the lives of thousands of patients. On this journey, we often think of disease definitions as immutable. However, in reality, diagnostic criteria organically change over time, a key outcome of an expanding knowledge base.

Metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a multisystem disorder with a heterogeneous disease course and outcomes that, for a majority, are clinically speaking, relatively silent. With its multifaceted origin, it is not surprising that no single clinical, laboratory, histological or radiographic feature can serve as a 'gold standard' for diagnosis or for classification. A natural outcome, particularly when initially described using the 'non' term, signifies that it is not another disease, in this case, alcohol-related. Because of this, the diagnosis of 'NAFLD' is still frequently delayed, sometimes for decades, with most patients diagnosed at the time of cirrhosis. This highlights the core issues of both disease awareness and diagnostic criteria. The problem is compounded in practice by serious concerns about the consequences of missing MAFLD in the context of other known liver diseases.

### Noninvasive biomarkers in NAFLD and NASH-current progress and future promise [^1138bWzH]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25% of the global adult population and is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the active form of NAFLD, with hepatic necroinflammation and faster fibrosis progression. With an increasing number of patients developing NASH-related end-stage liver disease and pharmacological treatments on the horizon, there is a pressing need to develop NAFLD and NASH biomarkers for prognostication, selection of patients for treatment and monitoring. This requirement is particularly true as liver biopsy utility is limited by its invasive nature, poor patient acceptability and sampling variability. This article reviews current and potential biomarkers for different features of NAFLD, namely, steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis. For each biomarker, we evaluate its accuracy, reproducibility, responsiveness, feasibility and limitations. We cover biochemical, imaging and genetic biomarkers and discuss biomarker discovery in the omics era.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115Lg8iU]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Future directions for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) highlight that the number of trials in NASH has increased exponentially over the last 10 years, and several therapeutic agents for NASH are in late-stage development, with safety and histological efficacy profiles that may be soon approvable by the FDA. Further validation of biomarkers that predict liver-related outcomes, identify patients who may benefit from treatment, and predict response to therapeutic intervention is underway, and the anticipated acceptance of biomarkers as surrogates of future liver-related events and treatment response will greatly accelerate drug development for single or combination approaches. Adoption of AI-based technologies will allow more accurate quantification of fibrosis and highlight early signs of treatment response, and AI may help diminish variability in histological assessment currently plaguing early-stage trials. Finally, rapidly growing knowledge in genetic disease relationships (eg, PNPLA3 and others) and the identification of distinct disease phenotypes using descriptive techniques will enable more individualized approaches to the future management of patients with NAFLD, and these advances will likely lead to rapid changes in the current recommendations (Table 7) for diagnosis and management of patients with NAFLD.

### Features, diagnosis, and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^116eht6r]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

As the global incidence of obesity has increased, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a worldwide health concern. NAFLD occurs in children and adults of all ethnicities and includes isolated fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Patients with NASH are at risk for developing cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma and have increased all-cause mortality. NAFLD is associated with a variety of clinical conditions and is an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of NAFLD and the specific steps that lead to NASH and advanced fibrosis are not fully understood, although researchers have found that a combination of environmental, genetic, and metabolic factors lead to advanced disease. There have been improvements in noninvasive radiographic methods to diagnose NAFLD, especially for advanced disease. However, liver biopsy is still the standard method of diagnosis for NASH. There are many challenges to treating patients with NASH, and no therapies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; multimodal approaches are being developed and becoming the standard of care. We review pathogenesis and treatment approaches for the West's largest liver-related public health concern.

Metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide – with an estimated global prevalence of 37%. Different from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is an exclusion diagnosis, MAFLD is defined by a set of positive criteria. This recent change in terminology is challenging because MAFLD and NAFLD denote two similar, albeit not identical, clinical populations. When the diagnostic criteria for MAFLD are applied, liver histology appears more severe and clinical outcomes are less favorable. However, the clinical management of MAFLD and NAFLD remains similar. While liver biopsy is still the reference standard for achieving a final diagnosis, noninvasive imaging- or biomarker-based diagnostic modalities are currently gaining momentum. However, liver biopsy should be recommended when diagnostic challenges exist. In this review, we compared the epidemiology, natural history, and diagnosis of MAFLD with respect to the traditional NAFLD definition.

Introduction — Definition, diagnosis and clinical staging of NAFLD

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the liver disease epidemic of the 21st century, since prevalence rates range between 23% and 32% depending on the geographical region with numbers predicted to rise further globally. The term NAFLD itself summarizes a broad disease spectrum: non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), which is characterized by simple steatosis but absent inflammation or hepatocyte ballooning, represents the mildest manifestation. Non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), however, is characterized by not only steatosis of the liver but also inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, and is a more severe presentation of the disease spectrum which may lead to advanced fibrosis or even cirrhosis. In approximately 5% of patients with NAFLD complications of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma may occur during long‐term follow‐up. Of note, however, most patients with non‐advanced NAFLD (i.e. Fibrosis Stage 0–2) primarily show extrahepatic events during follow‐up and the predominant cause of death in these patients derives from cardiovascular disease rather than from liver‐related events. Apart from the importance of distinguishing between a diagnosis of NAFL or NASH and grading of disease activity, presence and stage of fibrosis need to be determined in every patient since it has been shown that prognosis is mostly influenced by the grade of fibrosis rather than presence/absence of NASH.

Suspicion of NAFLD should be raised in patients presenting with either elevated liver enzymes (i.e. liver transaminases and/or gamma‐glutamyltransferase) or those who show hepatic steatosis on abdominal ultrasound. Most importantly before diagnosing NAFLD the most common other etiologies of chronic liver disease (i.e. hepatitis, autoimmune, hereditary or cholestatic) and especially relevant alcohol consumption (≥ 30 g/day in men, ≥ 20 g/day in women) should be excluded. Typically, patients presenting with one‐ or more components of the metabolic syndrome are at high risk for developing NAFLD and hepatic steatosis on imaging and/or elevated liver enzymes should raise the suspicion for NAFLD.

A wide spectrum of non‐invasive diagnostic methods have been developed and clinically tested over the last years, the most important‐ and tested ones being vibration‐controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and non‐invasive fibrosis tests (i.e. NAFLD Fibrosis Score or FIB‐4 Score). However, non‐invasive diagnostic algorithms and risk stratification for NAFLD are out of the scope of this article but have been reviewed elsewhere.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — liver biopsy indications: Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for characterizing liver histological alterations in patients with NAFLD, but it is expensive, requires expertise for interpretation, and carries some morbidity and very rare mortality risk; therefore it should be performed in those who would benefit the most from diagnosis, therapeutic guidance, and prognostic information.

Background

The incidence of obesity is increasing worldwide at an alarmingly fast pace, mainly because of a combination of cultural, social, and economic factors that affect lifestyle. Currently, one out of every three Americans is considered to be obese. Obesity is the main driver for the onset of metabolic syndrome, which is a group of metabolic abnormalities that share the cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Presence of metabolic syndrome including obesity is a strong predictor for hepatic steatosis, defined as lipid deposition in hepatocytes. Its phenotype ranges from non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD), to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH - fatty changes with inflammation and hepatocellular injury or fibrosis), to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Similar to obesity, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions with a prevalence of 20% to 30% in western populations. Because NAFLD constitutes a risk factor for NASH, it is to be expected that the prevalence of complicated liver disease in patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome will rise. As such, prevention of metabolic syndrome is a therapeutic target and lifestyle changes for patients at risk should be encouraged.

The question then arises, how to detect liver steatosis? Ultrasound is by far the most frequently used modality to detect liver steatosis. Fatty filtration of the liver produces a diffuse increase in echogenicity (a bright liver) and blurring of vascular margins and the diaphragm. Ultrasound, however, has some inherent disadvantages, such as a limited sensitivity to detect steatosis when less than 30% of hepatocytes contains fat, and its accuracy is compromised in patients who are obese. In addition, ultrasound cannot identify relevant liver disease in the context of NASH, such as steatohepatitis or fibrosis.

The gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD and to differentiate it from NASH is liver biopsy. A liver biopsy should be considered in patients with liver steatosis on imaging who are at increased risk of steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis, such as patients with competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis (for example, diabetes mellitus) and with co-existing liver disease. However, the invasive nature of liver biopsy with its risk for major complications, such as bleeding in approximately 1% of cases, precludes widespread use. Therefore, an accurate, easy to conduct, and less invasive technique is needed in diagnosing NAFLD. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive modalities for quantifying steatosis. However, none of these imaging techniques have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to stage the disease and cannot distinguish between NAFLD and NASH.

Key Points for Practice
- NAFLD and NASH are common in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity.
- If testing for NAFLD, start with the fibrosis-4 index, which uses platelet and transaminase measurements. Evaluate intermediate- or higher-risk patients with transient elastography or an enhanced liver fibrosis laboratory panel. Most of the serious sequelae from NAFLD come from those with NASH. Approximately 20% of patients with NASH will develop significant liver disease. NASH is among the top causes of hepato-cellular carcinoma. Diagnosis HIGH-RISK PATIENTS Because of the high prevalence of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, screening these patients should be considered. Similarly, people with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes are at increased risk of fibrosis and mortality and can be considered for screening.

Liver biopsy at the time of bariatric surgery should be considered because nearly 1 in 12 patients will have significant fibrosis, and up to 1 in 25 patients will have cirrhosis. Patients with persistently elevated transaminase levels are at high risk of NAFLD and developing hepatic fibrosis. TESTING FOR NAFLD The first step to testing for NAFLD is to estimate fibrosis through the fibrosis-4 index, the most highly validated initial test, which uses platelet and transaminase measurements. The fibrosis-4 index has a high negative predictive value but low positive predictive value. Other suggested fibrosis indexes appear to further overestimate fibrosis. Alanine transaminase levels alone cannot rule out NAFLD because one-half of patients with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes have levels in the normal range. Liver ultrasonography is not effective for screening because of low sensitivity for mild to moderate steatosis.

For an intermediate- or high-risk fibrosis-4 index, liver stiffness should be measured using transient elastography. This testing can rule out fibrosis with negative predictive values between 91% and 99%, depending on the specification used. Magnetic resonance elastography is also accurate, but it is less widely available. If transient elastography is not available, an enhanced liver fibrosis laboratory panel can be used to estimate the rate of liver extracellular matrix metabolism. Use of the fibrosis-4 index and enhanced liver fibrosis testing reduces unnecessary hepatology referrals and increases identification of patients with advanced fibrosis.

### Diagnostic modalities for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and associated fibrosis [^112Kz3uB]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum comprised of isolated steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The majority of NAFLD subjects do not have NASH and do not carry a significant risk for liver-related adverse outcomes (cirrhosis and mortality). Globally, the prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 25%. In Asia, a gradient of high to low prevalence rates is noted from urban to rural areas. Given the prevalence of NAFLD, the clinical and economic burden of NAFLD and NASH can be substantial. With increasing recognition of NASH as an important liver disease, the diagnosis of NASH still requires a liver biopsy that is suboptimal. Although liver biopsy is the most accurate modality to diagnose and stage the severity of NASH, this method suffers from being invasive, costly, associated with potential complications, and plagued with interobserver variability of individual pathological features. A number of noninvasive modalities to diagnose NASH and stage liver fibrosis are being developed. These modalities include predictive models (NAFLD fibrosis score) and serum biomarkers such as enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF). Other tests are based on radiological techniques, such as transient elastography (TE) or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), which are used to estimate liver stiffness as a potential surrogate of hepatic fibrosis. Although a dynamic field of research, most of these diagnostic modalities have area under the curve ranging between 0.76 and 0.90%, with MRE having the best predictive performance. In summary, developing safe and easily accessible noninvasive modalities to accurately diagnose and monitor NASH and associated fibrosis is of utmost importance in clinical practice and clinical research. These tests are not only important to risk stratify subjects at the greatest risk for progressive liver disease, but also to serve as appropriate surrogate endpoints for therapeutic clinical trials of NASH.

### New horizon of ultrasound for screening and surveillance of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease spectrum [^114uAKok]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects almost one quarter of adults worldwide, and its progressive subtype, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can progress to advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. It is critical to screen and grade NAFLD patients for management decisions to rationalize the utilization of medical resources. Conventional ultrasound is widely applied for NAFLD screening, however, some inherent weaknesses hinder its utility. This limitation has spurred the development of acoustic parameters-based quantitative ultrasound techniques that allow a more accurate evaluation of the histological features of NAFLD (e.g. steatosis, necroinflammation, fibrosis/cirrhosis). Herein, this paper reviews the research advances in emerging ultrasound techniques for screening and surveillance across NAFLD spectrum and summarize their principles, feasibility, accuracy, reproducibility, and limitations of each technique. The challenges and future directions are also discussed to advance clinical practice.

### A multisociety Delphi consensus statement on new fatty liver disease nomenclature [^116pUXU3]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

This process focuses on the nomenclature and definition of NAFLD rather than a determination of what constitutes hepatic steatosis or assessment of disease severity. There is extensive literature on the confirmation of hepatic steatosis, which we did not seek to interrogate; often, this is a pragmatic determination in clinical practice, which is where this guidance starts. Moreover, this nomenclature process, in line with published guidance, is not advocating for the routine use of tests to confirm hepatic steatosis although, in reality, most, if not all, patients will usually have imaging at some point. Finally, we recognise it is the evaluation of fibrosis either as part of screening strategies or individual clinical decisions, which is relevant for most clinical settings. That remains unchanged after this process, other than the name (eg, MASLD with advanced fibrosis).

Contrary to the initial proposal by Eslam and colleagues, the Delphi process revealed that most experts consider that MetALD patients should be classified in a category distinct from MASLD, mainly because of the added pathogenic value of alcohol consumption and consequential prognostic implications. The condition MetALD provides an opportunity to better define the natural history of such patients and the development of biomarkers and therapies that are currently lacking for this group of patients. ALD is a distinct liver disease (of which steatosis is one of the features) and, thus, is categorised under the SLD umbrella. This should raise awareness of alcohol as a driver of steatosis and highlight the impact of excessive alcohol consumption (ie, > 50–60 g daily in females and males, respectively) irrespective of their association with metabolic dysfunction. Studies have shown that, even in excessive drinkers, obesity increases the prevalence of cirrhosis, and glycaemic dysregulation increases fibrosis severity. Patterns of alcohol use must also be taken into consideration as bingeing (even within the total weekly "allowable limit" for MASLD) can be detrimental. We also recognise that objective tools are not available or sufficiently validated to determine the relative contribution of MASLD and ALD in patients with MetALD, and hence, we rely on self-reported alcohol intake, which can be inaccurate. In that regard, this is a conceptual construct and might be better seen as a disease spectrum with differing of modifiable disease drivers (CMRFs and alcohol). This is also relevant for the distinction between patients with MetALD and those drinking more heavily, which are termed as having ALD. Also, the category of ALD without metabolic factors is relatively rare among patients with significant fibrosis, but it was felt to represent part of the spectrum.

### From the origin of NASH to the future of metabolic fatty liver disease [^111CgUXF]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Understanding the pathological and molecular hallmarks from its first description to definitions of disease entities, classifications and molecular phenotypes is crucial for both appropriate clinical management and research in this complex disease. We provide an overview through almost two hundred years of clinical research from the beginnings as a nebulous disease entity of unknown origin in the 19th century to the most frequent and vigorously investigated liver disease today. The clinical discrimination between alcohol-related liver disease and NAFLD was uncommon until the 1950s and likely contributed to the late acceptance of NAFLD as a metabolic disease entity for long time. Although the term 'fatty liver hepatitis' first appeared in 1962, it was in 1980 that the term 'non-alcoholic steatohepatitis' (NASH) was coined and the histopathological hallmarks that are still valid today were defined. The 2005 NASH Clinical Research Network scoring was the first globally accepted grading and staging system for the full spectrum of NAFLD and is still used to semiquantify main histological features. In 2021, liver biopsy remains the only diagnostic procedure that can reliably assess the presence of NASH and early fibrosis but increasing efforts are made towards non-invasive testing and molecular classification of NAFLD subtypes.

### Non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^1174D9GG]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent form of chronic liver disease that poses challenges in diagnosis and risk stratification. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more progressive form of NAFLD, is particularly challenging to diagnose in the absence of histology. Liver biopsy is infrequently performed due to its invasive nature, potential for sampling error, and lack of inter-rater reliability. Non-invasive tests that can accurately identify patients with at-risk NASH (ie, individuals with biopsy-proven NASH with NAFLD activity score [NAS] ≥ 4 and fibrosis stage ≥ 2) are key tools to identify candidates for pharmacologic therapy in registrational trials for the treatment of NASH-related fibrosis. With emerging pharmacotherapy, non-invasive tests are required to track treatment response. Lastly, there is an unmet need for non-invasive tests to assess risk for clinical outcomes including progression to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, liver-related mortality, and overall mortality. In this Review we examine advances in non-invasive tests to diagnose and monitor NAFLD and NASH.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a rapidly rising prevalence worldwide and is the most common cause of liver disease in developed countries. In this article, we discuss the spectrum of disease of NAFLD with a focus on the earlier spectrum of the disease that is commonly encountered by non-specialists, as well as the hepatic and extra-hepatic associations of the disease. We discuss in detail the two common presentations of NAFLD, incidentally detected hepatic steatosis and asymptomatic raised liver enzymes, and provide an algorithm for management and continued to follow up for these patients. Considerations for the management of cardiovascular comorbidities in these patients are also discussed. Finally, we cover the topic of screening for NAFLD in high-risk populations.

Because NAFLD is largely asymptomatic and optimal timing of treatment depends on accurate staging of fibrosis risk, screening at the primary care level is critical. The pathway assists clinicians in diagnosing and managing NAFLD with clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2–F4) and is intended to be applicable in any setting where care for patients with NAFLD is provided, including primary care, endocrine, obesity medicine, and gastroenterology practices; most patients with NAFLD and NASH are seen in primary care or endocrine clinics.

### What's new in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? [^113PRZtF]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 25% in the Western World. NAFLD is a broad spectrum of disease states and while most people with NAFLD do not have progressive disease, 10–20% of patients develop histological features of inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), fibrosis, cirrhosis and its complications. Despite this large disease burden of significant clinical impact, most people living with NAFLD are undiagnosed, disease course prediction is imprecise and there are no treatments licensed for this condition. In this review, we discuss some of the recent developments in NAFLD, focusing on disease definition and diagnosis, risk stratification and treatments.

### Community pathways for the early detection and risk stratification of chronic liver disease: a narrative systematic review [^115q5VCP]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with chronic liver disease are often diagnosed during an index presentation to hospital with decompensated cirrhosis or liver-related events, and these presentations are associated with high mortality. However, there is often a long asymptomatic phase, in which there is an opportunity for earlier diagnosis and interventions to prevent progression to advanced disease. Therefore, strategies for early diagnosis and interventions (including behavioural changes and pharmacological treatments) that prevent patients progressing to cirrhosis and its associated complications probably have substantial benefits for patients and health-care services. Many community pathways have been generated. Some pathways focus on abnormal liver function tests as a starting point to diagnose liver disease. Other pathways target groups at greater risk of chronic liver disease-particularly people with harmful alcohol consumption, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. This systematic review summarises the existing strategies available for the early detection or risk stratification of liver disease, focusing primarily on alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conducting randomised clinical trials that compare different strategies will be essential to elucidate which pathways are acceptable to patients, feasible, provide high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of liver disease, improve liver-related outcomes, and are most cost-effective at the population level.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: non-invasive investigation and risk stratification [^114gvEPF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a histological spectrum of liver disease, from simple steatosis through to cirrhosis. As the worldwide rates of obesity have increased, NAFLD has become the commonest cause of liver disease in many developed countries, affecting up to a third of the population. The majority of patients have simple steatosis that carries a relatively benign prognosis. However, a significant minority have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and have increased liver related and cardiovascular mortality. Identifying those at risk of progressive disease is crucial. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard investigation for assessing stage of disease but its invasive nature makes it impractical for widespread use as a prognostic tool. Non-invasive tools for diagnosis and disease staging are required, reserving liver biopsy for those patients where it offers clinically relevant additional information. This review discusses the non-invasive modalities available for assessing steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. We propose a pragmatic approach for the assessment of patients with NAFLD to identify those at high risk of progressive disease who require referral to specialist services.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: controlling an emerging epidemic, challenges, and future directions [^1126njY2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects over 30% of the United States population and is projected to become a leading cause of chronic liver disease by 2020. As a result, the economic and societal burden of NAFLD is far-reaching. The cost of managing NAFLD complications has an estimated 10 year economic burden of $908 billion. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on NAFLD, with emphasis on identifying gaps in its diagnosis and management, and proposes future directions to address these limitations. Despite the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, there is limited knowledge and practice regarding its natural history, staging, diagnosis, and management. Though a challenging task, opportunities for bridging these gaps should focus on the development of noninvasive biomarkers, the elucidation of biological pathways, the creation of up-to-date screening guidelines, and the organization of clinical trials of longer duration to determine clinical endpoints and assess the safety of new treatment options.

Imaging-detected unsuspected hepatic steatosis — when patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging have symptoms or signs attributable to liver disease or have abnormal liver biochemistries, they should be evaluated as though they have suspected NAFLD and worked-up accordingly (Strength – 1, Evidence - A); in patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who lack any liver-related symptoms or signs and have normal liver biochemistries, it is reasonable to assess for metabolic risk factors (e.g., obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia) and alternate causes for hepatic steatosis such as significant alcohol consumption or medications (Strength – 1, Evidence - A); in patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who are asymptomatic and have normal liver biochemistries, a liver biopsy cannot be recommended (Strength – 1, Evidence - B).

When to obtain a liver biopsy in NAFLD — Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for characterizing liver histology in NAFLD but is expensive and carries some morbidity and very rare mortality risk; it should be performed in those who would benefit the most from diagnostic, therapeutic guidance, and prognostic perspectives. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk to have steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis (Strength – 1, Evidence – B). The presence of metabolic syndrome and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score may be used for identifying patients who are at risk for steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis (Strength – 1, Evidence – B). Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with suspected NAFLD in whom competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis and co-existing chronic liver diseases cannot be excluded without a liver biopsy (Strength – 1, Evidence – B).

Objective

The inflammatory subtype of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, is becoming one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease. In this article, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical and radiologic diagnosis of the subtypes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Conclusion

We discuss the current and evolving imaging tests in the evaluation of hepatic fatty content, inflammation, and fibrosis.

Conclusion

In conclusion, although ultrasonography is the most widely used tests for the diagnosis of fatty liver, numerous other tests are available and have their respective roles in the armamentarium for non-invasive assessment of MAFLD; from simple blood-based scores for diagnosis of hepatic steatosis in epidemiological studies, to simultaneous diagnosis of hepatic steatosis using attenuation parameter when performing liver stiffness measurement for patients with other chronic liver diseases, to the highly accurate MRI-based techniques for quantification of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis for clinical trial purposes; and from combination of blood-based and imaging biomarkers for diagnosis of fibrotic NASH to the use of simple blood-based fibrosis scores to exclude advanced liver fibrosis followed by liver stiffness measurement for intermediate- and high-risk patients for further risk stratification and prognostication. Further studies are needed to refine the use of these non-invasive tests, particularly for selection of patients for pharmacological treatment and monitoring their response to the treatment.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^112F4mYT]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

A pragmatic approach to diagnosis and staging of NAFLD in clinical practice

NAFLD is very common and the majority of patients have mild disease, but patients with advanced NASH need to be identified to offer treatment and surveillance for liver-related complications. With the current lack of a simple, widely available biomarker for NASH, a pragmatic diagnostic and staging approach is needed. One such approach for the investigation and assessment of disease severity in patients with NAFLD is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1
Example of algorithm for clinical assessment of patients at risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. CK-18 levels are not routinely available in many centres, so patients at intermediate and high risk have to be managed according to the high-risk arm of the algorithm (red arrows). 'Screen'- blood tests to rule out common causes of liver disease; USS, ultrasound; MS, metabolic syndrome; IR, insulin resistance; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.

In brief, the first stage involves the identification of patients with NAFLD either with metabolic risk factor profiling, LFTs or imaging. If steatosis is confirmed and other causes of liver disease are excluded, a clinical diagnosis of NAFLD can be made. The second stage involves risk stratification to determine a patient's stage of disease. This should be initially undertaken non-invasively with a locally available test (eg, FIB-4 score, NAFLD fibrosis score, TE, ARFI, CK-18). Patients who are identified as 'low' risk of NASH or advanced fibrosis can be managed in primary care with modification of their metabolic risk factors. Patients who are 'indeterminate' or 'high' risk should undergo further assessment (often requiring a liver biopsy) to determine the stage of disease. Risk stratification means patients can then be managed appropriately as will be discussed in 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to management' by Dyson et al.

Machado et al have recently proposed a similar algorithm for patients with NAFLD to guide when liver biopsy is needed. They used the NAFLD Fibrosis Score and TE to evaluate fibrosis and CK-18 fragments to evaluate NASH. The management pathway for patients would be very similar as with the algorithm we propose, but CK-18, and even TE, are not available in many centres, which is reflected in our algorithm.

### Noninvasive evaluation for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^116XjFkB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and has the potential risk for progressing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with a greater risk for complications of chronic liver disease. Noninvasive testing has been evaluated for diagnosis, risk stratification, disease progression, and assessing response to therapy. The purpose of this narrative review was to outline the current noninvasive testing modalities for the diagnostic evaluation of NAFLD and NASH, while discussing possible markers that could be used for monitoring response to therapies.

Methods

The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles that evaluated the diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH with serum biomarkers and/or imaging.

Findings

Serum biomarkers, imaging modalities, and combinations/serial algorithms involved in the diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH are outlined. In addition, noninvasive modalities that have been used for assessing response to therapies in clinical trials are discussed.

Implications

Liver biopsy currently remains the gold standard for diagnosis and is often used in clinical trials to assess treatment response. However, developing safe and accessible noninvasive modalities for diagnosis and monitoring will have greater impact and relevance, as biopsy may not always be feasible in all clinical settings.

Liver biopsy

In light of the continuous nature of hepatic inflammation, the definition of MAFLD avoids the traditional dichotomous classification of NASH versus non-NASH. In this scenario, disease activity and fibrosis are considered the main prognostic drivers. Although liver biopsy is still considered the reference standard for achieving a final diagnosis, its use should be carefully weighed in light of its procedural risks, invasive nature, and possible sampling errors. In general, it is recommended to obtain a biopsy in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery or in presence of conflicting results on noninvasive tests. Moreover, liver biopsy is mandatory in presence of diagnostic uncertainties (e.g. dual etiology) or inclusion in clinical trials.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^114vk2Zm]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in many developed countries. Up to a third of the population have evidence of steatosis on imaging, with the majority (70%–90%) having simple steatosis. However, 10%–30% of subjects with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis, which puts patients at risk of liver-related complications. Due to the metabolic risk factors that are common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, patients with NASH have an increased risk of cardiovascular death as well as liver-related mortality. In the first part of this review, we discussed the diagnosis and staging of patients with NAFLD and the importance of risk stratification. Here we will discuss the management of patients with NAFLD.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 2020: the state of the disease [^1174u3Za]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease, with a worldwide prevalence of 25%. In the United States, NAFLD and its subtype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, affect 30% and 5% of the population, respectively. Considering the ongoing obesity epidemic beginning in childhood, the rise in diabetes, and other factors, the prevalence of NAFLD along with the proportion of those with advanced liver disease is projected to continue to increase. This will have an important impact on public health reflected in health care costs, including impact on the need for liver transplantation, for which nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is already close to becoming the most common indication. NAFLD patients with evidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis are at markedly increased risk of adverse outcomes, including overall mortality, and liver-specific morbidity and mortality, respectively. Identification of this cohort of NAFLD patients is paramount, given the associated poorer outcomes, in order to target resources to those who need it most. Various noninvasive tools have been developed in this regard. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, clinical and prognostic features, and diagnostic approach to patients with NAFLD.

NAFLD — Assessment and management notes limitations of liver enzymes and preferred imaging for steatosis. Aminotransferase levels may be normal in advanced NASH and should not exclude disease with clinically significant fibrosis. Most laboratory "normal" ALT thresholds are high; as a general rule, ALT > 30 U/L should be considered abnormal. Standard ultrasound is not recommended to identify steatosis due to low sensitivity, whereas controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) may be used to identify steatosis and MRI–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) can quantify steatosis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the presence of ectopic fat deposition within the liver not attributable to alcohol or secondary causes of hepatic steatosis. 1 NAFLD, as the aetiology of chronic liver disease, has increased rapidly over the past three decades in the United States and is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease accounting for nearly 75% of all chronic liver diseases and affecting nearly one in three individuals. 2, 3 NAFLD is commonly associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension 4, 5, 6 and is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. 7 NAFLD comprises a histological spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) characterized by the presence of hepatic steatosis with none or minimal inflammation to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by lobular inflammation, ballooning and varying degrees of hepatic fibrosis. 8 Serum liver enzymes, which are often the first clinical clue to presence of liver disease, can be normal or mildly elevated in a majority of patients with NAFLD, therefore making it difficult to detect NAFLD, which has led to underdiagnosis of NAFLD. 9, 10 This, coupled with the lack of therapeutic options for NAFLD, has resulted in increased prevalence of cirrhosis and end‐stage liver disease associated with NAFLD. 11, 12 Thus, there is great interest in risk stratification of patients with NAFLD to optimize clinical care. The current review will focus on serum‐based models and biomarkers validated in patients with NAFLD.

Guidance statements — screening and risk assessment directives are as follows: 9. General population-based screening for NAFLD is not advised. 10. All patients with hepatic steatosis or clinically suspected NAFLD based on the presence of obesity and metabolic risk factors should undergo primary risk assessment with FIB-4. 11. High-risk individuals, such as those with T2DM, medically complicated obesity, family history of cirrhosis, or more than mild alcohol consumption, should be screened for advanced fibrosis.

### Imaging-based quantification of hepatic fat: methods and clinical applications [^114QvfS2]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Fatty liver disease comprises a spectrum of conditions (simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis with inflammatory changes, and end-stage liver disease with fibrosis and cirrhosis). Hepatic steatosis is often associated with diabetes and obesity and may be secondary to alcohol and drug use, toxins, viral infections, and metabolic diseases. Detection and quantification of liver fat have many clinical applications, and early recognition is crucial to institute appropriate management and prevent progression. Histopathologic analysis is the reference standard to detect and quantify fat in the liver, but results are vulnerable to sampling error. Moreover, it can cause morbidity and complications and cannot be repeated often enough to monitor treatment response. Imaging can be repeated regularly and allows assessment of the entire liver, thus avoiding sampling error. Selection of appropriate imaging methods demands understanding of their advantages and limitations and the suitable clinical setting. Ultrasonography is effective for detecting moderate or severe fatty infiltration but is limited by lack of interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility. Computed tomography allows quantitative and qualitative evaluation and is generally highly accurate and reliable; however, the results may be confounded by hepatic parenchymal changes due to cirrhosis or depositional diseases. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with appropriate sequences (eg, chemical shift techniques) has similarly high sensitivity, and MR spectroscopy provides unique advantages for some applications. However, both are expensive and too complex to be used to monitor steatosis.

### Overdiagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease… [^114hnrrF]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Three months later, her A1C improved to 6. 6%, but her weight and transaminase levels were stable. She had not consumed alcohol, although she admitted to not adhering to a diabetes-friendly diet. She did not have abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in bowel movements. Liver ultrasonography showed hepatic steatosis consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Clinical Commentary NAFLD is a diagnosis first recognized in the 1980s, with detection increasing as technology advanced during the following decades. NAFLD is defined by a fatty liver with a similar histologic appearance to alcoholic liver disease. The cardinal finding is macrovesicular hepatic steatosis on biopsy. Higher levels of inflammation and fibrosis are linked to worse outcomes. Elevated transaminase levels and hepatic steatosis on ultrasonography are the hallmarks of NAFLD, especially in people who are obese and have high blood glucose levels.

4 People with NAFLD are generally not symptomatic, and because liver biopsy is the only definitive way to diagnose and distinguish mild NAFLD from NASH, the true prevalence is unknown. Elevated transaminase levels alone are not diagnostic of NAFLD, and ultrasonography has a 15% false-positive rate for NAFLD, which can lead to significant overdiagnosis if performed on all people with predisposing factors.
5. One retrospective study in Iceland found that people with NAFLD had a mean survival of 24 years after diagnosis. Although 7% ultimately progressed to cirrhosis, virtually none died of liver-related disease, with more than one-half dying of heart disease. CONCLUSION NAFLD is one of many manifestations of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Most people with NAFLD do not develop clinically significant liver disease.

It is unclear how many and how quickly people with NAFLD progress to cirrhosis due to the absence of prospective, population-based studies, and current treatments have not been studied for patient-oriented outcomes. It is unlikely that diagnosing NAFLD benefits patients or predicts their prognosis. The best approach to patients with metabolic syndrome is not labeling them with more diseases, but addressing the root causes of their poor health. |Screening for NAFLD with serum transaminase levels or periodic imaging in people with known NAFLD is unlikely to improve prognosis and could lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment because of the low hepatic mortality, high false-positive rates, and lack of viable pharmacologic treatment. |.

### Role of noninvasive tests in clinical gastroenterology practices to identify patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis At high risk of adverse outcomes: expert panel recommendations [^112sDYks]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is generally considered a silent and potentially reversible condition. The subtype of NAFLD that can be classified as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Because of the metabolic nature of the pathogenic mechanism underlying NAFLD and NASH, it is often accompanied by common comorbidities such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The increase in the prevalence of these comorbidities has resulted in a parallel increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH, globally, nationally, and even in children. In recent years, it has been identified that the stage of fibrosis is the most important predictor of liver outcomes; therefore, identifying patients with NAFLD and NASH with more advanced stages of fibrosis can be essential for optimal management. Several noninvasive tools for diagnosing and staging NAFLD and NASH are available, but simple and straightforward recommendations on the use of these tools are not. Recognizing these unmet needs, hepatologists who are members of the American College of Gastroenterology and the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation created a practical decision tree/algorithm to risk stratify NAFLD/NASH as a resource in gastroenterology/hepatology clinical practices. This review will provide insight into how this algorithm was developed, describe it in detail, and provide recommendations for its use in clinical practice.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) provides diagnostic and prognostic thresholds: LSM by VCTE ≥ 25 kPa reliably diagnosed clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) across multiple etiologies of compensated advanced chronic liver disease; in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), LSM ≤ 15 kPa plus platelets ≥ 150,000/mm³ ruled out CSPH, LSM by VCTE ≥ 25 kPa is sufficient to rule in CSPH in nonobese patients, and CSPH can be diagnosed using the ANTICIPATE model if platelet count is < 150,000/mm3 and LSM by VCTE ≥ 20 kPa; baseline LSM by MRE predicts future hepatic decompensation, with approximately 30% of patients with baseline LSM-MRE of ≥ 5.7 kPa developing hepatic decompensation and 66% with baseline LSM-MRE of ≥ 6.8 kPa having either death or transplantation; among patients with NAFLD with compensated cirrhosis by MRE, progression in LSM (≥ 19% change from baseline) predicted hepatic decompensation; change in LSM on repeat VCTE correlated with liver decompensation in addition to all-cause mortality. A growing body of evidence suggests that LSM by both VCTE and MRE can predict CSPH and clinical outcomes in NAFLD.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117StPTZ]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definitions — NAFLD requires evidence of hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology and absence of secondary causes such as significant alcohol consumption, long-term use of a steatogenic medication, or monogenic hereditary disorders; histologically, NAFLD is categorized as nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFL is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS without evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of hepatocyte ballooning. NASH is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (e.g., ballooning), with or without any fibrosis. For "advanced" fibrosis, this guidance refers specifically to stages 3 or 4, that is, bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.

### Role of liver biopsy in the assessment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^116ZvMnm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Assessments of liver biopsies are important in the diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Histology remains the 'gold standard' for making the important distinction between simple steatosis, which is generally non-progressive and readily reversible, and steatohepatitis, which has the potential to progress to severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. Liver biopsy may also identify other causes of liver disease in patients thought to have fatty liver disease and vice versa. Histological grading and staging of fatty liver disease require further study but these are potentially important approaches for studying disease severity and progression, particularly in the context of clinical trials to assess novel therapeutic approaches.

Conclusion

The recent rebranding of NAFLD to MAFLD has prompted research efforts to compare the two conditions with respect to a number of aspects. While large overlaps exist between the MAFLD and NAFLD populations, it is clear that the two terms do not denote the same clinical entity. In addition, although the diagnostic modalities remain similar, the two acronyms should not be used interchangeably. Notably, growing evidence indicates that patients with MAFLD tend to have less favorable outcomes than those with NAFLD.

### Pathobiology of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease [^114bm3P8]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is highly associated with the metabolic syndrome. Given its high heterogeneity in patients along with unpredictable clinical outcomes, MAFLD is difficult to diagnose and manage. MAFLD is associated with obesity, diabetes, metabolic derangements, lipid disorders, cardiovascular disorders, sleep apnea, sarcopenia, gut dysbiosis, and sex hormone-related disorders. Identification of risk factors is imperative in understanding disease heterogeneity and clinical presentation to reliably diagnose and manage patients. The complexity of MAFLD pathobiology is discussed in this review in relation to its association with common metabolic and nonmetabolic disorders.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease from a primary care perspective [^111GHhpa]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to one-third of the US population. Approximately one-fifth of patients with NAFLD have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by hepatocyte damage and inflammation with or without fibrosis. NASH leads to greater risk of liver-related complications and liver-related mortality, with the poorest outcomes seen in patients with advanced fibrosis. NASH is also associated with other metabolic comorbidities and conveys an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and extrahepatic cancers. Despite its high prevalence, NAFLD is frequently underdiagnosed. This is a significant concern, given that early diagnosis of NAFLD is a key step in preventing progression to NASH. In this review, we describe the clinical impact of NASH from the perspective of both the clinician and the patient. In addition, we provide practical guidance on the diagnosis and management of NASH for primary care providers, who play a pivotal role in the frontline care of patients with NASH, and we use case studies to illustrate real-world scenarios encountered in the primary care setting.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^113wNBjj]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NAFLD is a very common condition affecting approximately 30% of the population and can cause significant liver disease in a proportion of patients. Accurate diagnosis and staging is important in determining the appropriate long-term management for patients with NAFLD.

Key points

Alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are a poor predictor of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Ultrasound is the first-line imaging test for patients with suspected steatosis (good accuracy if > 30% of hepatocytes are steatotic).
Liver fat decreases as fibrosis increases.
Risk of NAFLD/NASH directly related to presence and severity of the metabolic syndrome.
Simple steatosis carries benign prognosis.
NASH carries poor prognosis with increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality.
Aims: to identify individuals at risk of NAFLD to risk stratify patients with NAFLD to focus care on patients with NASH.

### Evaluation and management of obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1117peQQ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

The clinicopathologic spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis has a relatively benign clinical course, but NASH can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD occurs in the absence of significant alcohol use and is considered to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. NAFLD affects approximately 30% of the US population and the incidence seems to be rising as the obesity epidemic continues. At present, the most accurate modality for the diagnosis of NASH is liver biopsy; however, many patients do not have a liver biopsy, and in the absence of more-accurate imaging technologies and serum markers, the diagnosis is frequently one of exclusion. As yet there is no convincingly effective treatment for NAFLD — a multimodal treatment plan that targets obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and hypertension might be the best option for these patients.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases which occurs in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The goals of treatment include (1) correction of the underlying risk factors, (2) avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease, and (3) specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A decalogue from the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) expert committee [^116vXkW3]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

We report the evidence-based Italian Association for the Study of Liver guidelines for the appropriate diagnosis and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in clinical practice and its related research agenda. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease varies according to age, gender and ethnicity. In the general population, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is about 25% and the incidence is of two new cases/100 people/year. 2–3% of individuals in the general population will suffer from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Uncomplicated steatosis will usually follow a benign course. Individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, however, have a reduced life expectancy, mainly owing to vascular diseases and liver-related causes. Moreover, steatosis has deleterious effects on the natural history of HCV infection. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is usually diagnosed in asymptomatic patients prompted by the occasional discovery of increased liver enzymes and/or of ultrasonographic steatosis. Medical history, complete physical examination, etiologic screening of liver injury, liver biochemistry tests, serum lipids and insulin sensitivity tests should be performed in every patient. Occult alcohol abuse should be ruled out. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging technique. Liver biopsy, the gold standard in diagnosis and prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is an invasive procedure and its results will not influence treatment in most cases but will provide prognostic information. Assessment of fibrosis by composite scores, specific laboratory parameters and transient elastography might reduce the number of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients requiring liver biopsy. Dieting and physical training reinforced by behavioural therapy are associated with improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome should be ruled out at timed intervals in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients should undergo periodic evaluation of cardiovascular risk and of advancement of their liver disease; those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-cirrhosis should be evaluated for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

This review of the literature consists of three sections. First, papers concerning non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) awareness among the general population, general practitioners, and liver and non-liver specialists were retrieved and analyzed to highlight the perception of disease, verify knowledge of current recommendations, and identify the main difficulties experienced in clinical practice. Next, position papers and clinical practice guidelines issued by International and National Hepatological Scientific Societies were identified and critically assessed in order to pinpoint the areas of convergence/difference. Finally, practical suggestions on NAFLD diagnosis and management in daily practice are provided and the open questions highlighted.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasingly being recognized as an important and common condition, affecting approximately 20% of the general population. Although liver biopsy is currently the gold standard for diagnosis, there is a need for less invasive methods. Imaging by ultrasound, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance are all able to demonstrate fat. In this paper, these three imaging techniques are critically assessed. Ultrasound, although probably not the most reliable imaging method, has many advantages and, when positive, gives a high degree of certainty of the diagnosis depending on the prevalence of fatty liver in the population being studied. Unlike liver biopsy, none of these techniques is able to differentiate simple steatosis from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: update and impact of new nomenclature on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115Fx7pu]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

This commentary discusses how clinicians and various stakeholders can utilize the recently published American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (AASLD NAFLD) Practice Guidance in light of the change in the nomenclature to steatotic liver disease and its subcategories. The new terminologies explained in this commentary make it easier for the readers to interchangeably use metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in place of NAFLD and metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) instead of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively, as they read the NAFLD Practice Guidance. The guidance document is relevant and can be utilized for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients with MASLD. This commentary serves as an accompanying article to the NAFLD Practice Guidance and helps it clinical application in the light of the new nomenclature.

### Management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a 60-year-old man with probable nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: weight reduction, liver biopsy, or both? [^111wQU4N]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common hepatic disorders in the United States, but uncertainty remains as to the optimal way to manage it. Using the case of Mr T, a 60-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and increased serum transaminase levels, an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment is discussed. Diagnosis of NAFLD is based on patient clinical profile and risk factors for metabolic syndrome, the exclusion of other liver diseases, radiologic imaging and sometimes biopsy. At this point in Mr T's disease, the most important step is differentiation between simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis has a benign natural history, but NASH is progressive and may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by lack of large randomized trials, particularly of combinations of therapies, but weight loss, exercise, and medical therapies targeted at the mechanism of liver injury in NASH are recommended. Improved noninvasive diagnostic tests, a clearer understanding of the natural history of NAFLD, and large, well-designed clinical trials are needed.

### The role of noninvasive biomarkers in diagnosis and risk stratification in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112MQWNc]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronically elevated liver enzymes. Diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD remains clinically challenge as patients with NAFLD are either asymptomatic or have nonspecific presenting complaints and may have normal liver enzymes. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the clinically aggressive variant of NAFLD, is also difficult to differentiate noninvasively, and a liver biopsy is required to definitively diagnose NASH. Thus, the definitive diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD is embedded in histological assessment of the liver. Several clinical aides been investigated in an attempt to risk stratify and identify patients noninvasively as doing a liver biopsy in all patients with NAFLD are not feasible. Since these biomarkers are unable to differentiate NASH from non‐NASH, they have leveraged biochemical changes within the liver as patients progress to varying degree of hepatic fibrosis to identify patients with moderate fibrosis (fibrosis stage 2 or greater) and advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage 3 or greater) to help guide the need for additional and more definitive workup. These clinical aides span from by‐products of apoptosis to statistical modelling of clinically available data to identify 'at‐risk' patients with NAFLD. The current review will focus the diagnostic performance of these noninvasive serum‐based biomarkers in NAFLD.

### Treatment of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current views and perspectives [^113MKrFU]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a component of the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity. Problems still exist concerning non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients in clinical practice, for example: (a) how to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its type; (b) how to select patients candidate to treatment; (c) how to treat selected patients. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but only non-alcoholic steatohepatitis evolves into cirrhosis and the absolute risk of mortality for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is low. As yet, no tools, other than liver biopsy, are available to differentiate the various types of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many drugs are, currently, under study to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, even if well-performed trials are until necessary to define the best treatment. At the moment, the entity of the problem and the characteristics of patients frequently put the physician, in clinical practice, to choose the therapeutic approach arbitrarily which is considered more effective for each individual patient. Probably the future will consider the possibility of treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with more than one drug, by considering the various aspects and degree of this syndrome. Actually each physician should select the individual treatment on the basis of his/her knowledge and experience, by never forgetting the old saying 'primum non nocere'. However, the epidemiological entity of the problem, the characteristics of the patients, generally young, the frequent lack of clinical evidence of involvement of the liver, are all the factors that require vast well-performed clinical trials in order to define the best therapeutic approach for each individual patient.

### AGA clinical practice update: diagnosis and management of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in lean individuals: expert Review [^111Rtjcv]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is well recognized as a leading etiology for chronic liver disease, affecting > 25% of the US and global populations. Up to 1 in 4 individuals with NAFLD have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although NAFLD is observed predominantly in persons with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, an estimated 7%-20% of individuals with NAFLD have lean body habitus. Limited guidance is available to clinicians on appropriate clinical evaluation in lean individuals with NAFLD, such as for inherited/genetic disorders, lipodystrophy, drug-induced NAFLD, and inflammatory disorders. Emerging data now provide more robust evidence to define the epidemiology, natural history, prognosis, and mortality of lean individuals with NAFLD. Multiple studies have found that NAFLD among lean individuals is associated with increased cardiovascular, liver, and all-cause mortality relative to those without NAFLD. This American Gastroenterological Association Clinical Practice Update provides Best Practice Advice to assist clinicians in evidence-based approaches to the diagnosis, staging, and management of NAFLD in lean individuals.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Lean NAFLD should be diagnosed in individuals with NAFLD and body mass index < 25 kg/m 2 (non-Asian race) or body mass index < 23 kg/m 2 (Asian race). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Lean individuals with NAFLD should be evaluated routinely for comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Lean individuals with NAFLD should be risk stratified for hepatic fibrosis to identify those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Lean individuals in the general population should not undergo routine screening for NAFLD; however, screening should be considered for individuals older than 40 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: NAFLD should be considered in lean individuals with metabolic diseases (such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), elevated liver biochemical tests, or incidentally noted hepatic steatosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Clinicians should query patients routinely regarding alcohol consumption patterns in all patients with lean NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: In patients with lean NAFLD, other causes of liver disease should be ruled out, including other causes of fatty liver, such as HIV, lipodystrophy, lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, and medication-induced hepatic steatosis (methotrexate, amiodarone, tamoxifen, and steroids). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Current evidence is inadequate to support routine testing for genetic variants in patients with lean NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Liver biopsy, as the reference standard, should be considered if there is uncertainty regarding contributing causes of liver injury and/or the stage of liver fibrosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Serum indices (NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibrosis-4 score) and imaging techniques (transient elastography and magnetic resonance elastography) may be used as alternatives to liver biopsy for fibrosis staging and patient follow-up. These tests can be performed at the time of diagnosis and repeated at intervals of 6 months to 2 years, depending on fibrosis stage and the patient's response to intervention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: If noninvasive tests (eg, Fibrosis-4 and NAFLD fibrosis score) are indeterminate, a second noninvasive test (eg, transient elastography or magnetic resonance elastography) should be performed to confirm the stage and prognosis of NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In lean patients with NAFLD, lifestyle intervention, including exercise, diet modification, and avoidance of fructose- and sugar-sweetened drinks, to target a modest weight loss of 3%-5% is suggested. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Administration of vitamin E may be considered in lean persons with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but without type 2 diabetes mellitus or cirrhosis. Oral pioglitazone 30 mg daily may be considered in lean persons with biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis without cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: The therapeutic role of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in the management of lean NAFLD is not fully defined and requires further investigation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance with abdominal ultrasound with or without serum α-fetoprotein twice per year is suggested in patients with lean NAFLD and clinical markers compatible with liver cirrhosis.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113KhuUT]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD — Biomarker and imaging surrogates for histological improvement specify actionable thresholds. Improvement in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or reduction in liver fat content by imaging in response to an intervention may indicate histological improvement in disease activity, and a guidance statement notes such changes can be used as a surrogate. A key point identifies an ALT reduction of ≥ 17 U/L as associated with histological improvement, noting thresholds may differ by histological response type.

### A new noninvasive technique for estimating hepatic triglyceride: will liver biopsy become redundant in diagnosing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? [^112JDg5T]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Obesity and metabolic syndrome are healthcare problems that continue to rise in frequency worldwide. Both phenotypes are a strong predictor for development of liver steatosis in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Ultrasound may detect steatosis, but its sensitivity is limited and liver biopsy is still considered to be the gold standard. Less invasive techniques that accurately quantify liver steatosis are warranted. Jiménez-Agüero and colleagues propose that multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging might be such a diagnostic tool. They validated multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging with measured hepatic triglyceride concentration. Their results show that this innovative technique measures the grade of steatosis in different clinical situations. Therefore, multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging might be considered for monitoring liver steatosis as an intermediate endpoint. Wide clinical applicability is limited though, as it does not allow differentiation between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^115DTQEk]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to a third of the population in many developed countries. Between 10% and 30% of patients with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis. There are metabolic risk factors common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, so patients with NASH have an increased risk of liver-related and cardiovascular death. Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis.

Alcoholic fatty liver disease — diagnosis and role of biopsy: "Liver biopsy is not routinely recommended for diagnosis of alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, liver biopsy and noninvasive tools of fibrosis may be considered for diagnosis of steatohepatitis and/or liver fibrosis". Alcoholic fatty liver disease "is diagnosed in a patient with AUD with hepatic steatosis on ultrasound and/or elevation in liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > alanine aminotransferase (ALT)), serum bilirubin < 3 mg/dL, and the absence of other causes of liver disease".

### A new definition for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: an international expert consensus statement [^1164UyWK]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The exclusion of other chronic liver diseases including "excess" alcohol intake has until now been necessary to establish a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, given our current understanding of the pathogenesis of MAFLD and its rising prevalence, "positive criteria" to diagnose the disease are required. In this work, a panel of international experts from 22 countries propose a new definition for the diagnosis of MAFLD that is both comprehensive and simple, and is independent of other liver diseases. The criteria are based on evidence of hepatic steatosis, in addition to one of the following three criteria, namely overweight/obesity, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or evidence of metabolic dysregulation. We propose that disease assessment and stratification of severity should extend beyond a simple dichotomous classification to steatohepatitis vs. non-steatohepatitis. The group also suggests a set of criteria to define MAFLD-associated cirrhosis and proposes a conceptual framework to consider other causes of fatty liver disease. Finally, we bring clarity to the distinction between diagnostic criteria and inclusion criteria for research studies and clinical trials. Reaching consensus on the criteria for MAFLD will help unify the terminology (e.g. for ICD-coding), enhance the legitimacy of clinical practice and clinical trials, improve clinical care and move the clinical and scientific field of liver research forward.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver disease in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114QeykZ]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to afflict approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. In a subset of NAFLD patients, who have the progressive form of NAFLD termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), it can progress to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related morbidity and mortality. NASH is typically characterized by a specific pattern on liver histology, including steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning with or without peri-sinusoidal fibrosis. Thus, key issues in NAFLD patients are the differentiation of NASH from simple steatosis and identification of advanced hepatic fibrosis. Until now, liver biopsy has been the gold standard for identifying these 2 critical end points, but has well-known limitations, including invasiveness; rare but potentially life-threatening complications; poor acceptability; sampling variability; and cost. Furthermore, due to the epidemic proportion of individuals with NAFLD worldwide, liver biopsy evaluation is impractical, and noninvasive assessment for the diagnosis of NASH and fibrosis is needed. Although much of the work remains to be done in establishing cost-effective strategies for screening for NASH, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis, in this review, we summarize the current state of the noninvasive assessment of liver disease in NAFLD, and we provide an expert synthesis of how these noninvasive tools could be utilized in clinical practice. Finally, we also list the key areas of research priorities in this area to move forward clinical practice.
