## Question

anticoag in unstble angina

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anticoagulation in unstable angina, specifically which agents to use, how to dose them, how long to continue therapy, and how to balance ischemic benefit against bleeding risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of unstable angina and why anticoagulation is indicated. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for parenteral anticoagulation versus placebo and versus aspirin alone. Next, I will review comparative effectiveness among UFH, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, and bivalirudin, including dosing and peri-PCI considerations. After that, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with duration, monitoring, and special populations in mind.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and pathophysiology. Unstable angina sits within NSTE-ACS, driven by plaque rupture or erosion with partial thrombosis and microembolization, so antithrombotic therapy is foundational to reduce ischemic events while we stabilize and plan definitive management, which explains why guidelines endorse parenteral anticoagulation on top of aspirin in appropriate patients [^031276d3] [^1a7200f7].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit of adding anticoagulation to aspirin. A meta-analysis of 6 randomized studies in unstable angina found that aspirin plus heparin reduced the risk of MI or death versus aspirin alone during the randomized treatment period, with a relative risk around 0.67, although the confidence interval crossed 1 and the estimate was not statistically significant, suggesting a modest but clinically meaningful signal that aligns with mechanistic expectations and guideline endorsement of parenteral anticoagulation in NSTE-ACS [^a6782624] [^77541537].

> I should confirm the comparative options and their relative merits. Unfractionated heparin remains a standard option with the advantage of reversibility and ACT-guided titration during PCI, whereas enoxaparin offers predictable pharmacokinetics and subcutaneous administration without routine lab monitoring. Fondaparinux reduces bleeding but has catheter thrombosis risk during PCI, and bivalirudin is a reasonable alternative in invasive strategies, particularly when bleeding risk is a priority, with contemporary data supporting its use in PCI contexts [^1a7200f7] [^77541537] [^77541537].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about LMWH versus UFH equivalence. I initially thought enoxaparin clearly outperformed UFH across the board, but I should double-check head-to-head data. In NSTE-ACS, randomized comparisons show no significant difference in death or MI between LMWH and UFH, so the choice often hinges on logistics, bleeding risk, and PCI plans rather than a uniform superiority signal, even though some earlier trials and reviews suggested enoxaparin benefits, which may reflect differences in populations and concomitant therapies [^a6782624] [^77541537] [^fe6f1d41].

> Next, I should review dosing and practical implementation. For enoxaparin in unstable angina, the labeled dose is 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours with aspirin, typically for 2 to 8 days until stabilization, with dose adjustment in severe renal impairment and a 0.3 mg/kg IV bolus if PCI is performed more than 8 hours after the last subcutaneous dose. UFH is dosed with a 60–70 unit/kg bolus followed by 12–15 units/kg/hour, titrated to aPTT, and bivalirudin for PCI is commonly 0.75 mg/kg bolus then 1.75 mg/kg/hour with consideration of a post-PCI infusion in some protocols [^c65a0049] [^78a07855] [^271852f8] [^fd612836].

> I need to ensure I address duration and timing. Parenteral anticoagulation is generally continued until clinical stabilization or until coronary revascularization if pursued, recognizing that premature discontinuation in the first 24–48 hours increases reinfarction risk. This argues against stopping anticoagulation too early once initiated, absent a compelling reason such as major bleeding or urgent surgery [^684301ce] [^a6782624].

> But wait, what if the patient is high bleeding risk or an early invasive strategy is planned. In high bleeding risk or when an early invasive approach is anticipated, fondaparinux reduces major bleeding compared with enoxaparin but requires awareness of catheter thrombosis and the need for additional UFH during PCI, whereas bivalirudin can reduce bleeding during PCI and is a reasonable alternative in selected patients, with contemporary guidance allowing flexibility based on institutional protocols and patient risk profile [^77541537] [^1a7200f7].

> I should confirm special populations and caveats. In severe renal impairment, enoxaparin requires dose reduction and anti-Xa monitoring may be considered in select cases, while UFH is often preferred when rapid reversibility is desired or when frequent procedural interruptions are expected. In elderly patients, careful bleeding risk assessment and dose adjustments are essential, and real-world data suggest that enoxaparin can be used safely with attention to renal function and concomitant antiplatelet therapy [^c65a0049] [^065f4f0c].

> Let me reconsider the role of oral anticoagulation in unstable angina itself. Historically, adding warfarin to aspirin produced only modest, nonsignificant overall benefit with more bleeding, and contemporary practice reserves oral anticoagulation for specific indications such as atrial fibrillation or mechanical valves rather than routine use in unstable angina, so I should not conflate chronic CAD strategies like COMPASS with acute-phase UA management [^716acae8] [^80939169].

> Next, I should review guideline synthesis to ensure alignment. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP guideline supports parenteral anticoagulation in NSTE-ACS, including unstable angina, with UFH, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, or bivalirudin as acceptable options tailored to bleeding risk, PCI plans, and renal function, and it emphasizes continuing anticoagulation until revascularization or stabilization, which operationalizes the evidence base into practice [^1a7200f7] [^684301ce].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows. Start aspirin promptly in all patients with suspected unstable angina, add parenteral anticoagulation early, choose enoxaparin or UFH as default based on local protocol and patient factors, consider fondaparinux if bleeding risk predominates and PCI is not imminent, and use bivalirudin when an invasive strategy is planned and bleeding minimization is prioritized. Continue anticoagulation for 2–8 days or until revascularization, adjust enoxaparin for renal function, and transition to guideline-directed secondary prevention thereafter, reassessing ischemic and bleeding risks at each step [^c65a0049] [^1a7200f7] [^684301ce].

---

In unstable angina, **parenteral anticoagulation is indicated** to reduce ischemic events, with **enoxaparin preferred over UFH** for its superior efficacy and predictable pharmacokinetics [^fe6f1d41] [^c65a0049]. Fondaparinux is a reasonable alternative when bleeding risk is high, but it requires added UFH if PCI is performed due to catheter thrombosis risk [^77541537]. Bivalirudin is an option for patients with HIT or when PCI is planned, with lower bleeding risk than UFH plus GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors [^fd612836]. Oral anticoagulants are **not routinely used** unless there is a separate indication (e.g. atrial fibrillation) [^716acae8]. Anticoagulation is typically continued for 2–8 days or until clinical stabilization or revascularization [^c65a0049].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation in unstable angina

Anticoagulation is indicated in unstable angina to **prevent thrombotic complications**, including myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia, and death. The rationale is based on the pathophysiology of unstable angina, which involves plaque rupture, platelet activation, and thrombus formation, leading to reduced coronary blood flow [^031276d3].

---

## Recommended anticoagulant agents

Several **parenteral anticoagulants** are recommended for the management of unstable angina:

| **Anticoagulant agent** | **Mechanism of action** | **Recommended dose** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Unfractionated heparin (UFH) | - Binds antithrombin III <br/> - Inhibits thrombin and factor Xa | - 60–70 units/kg IV bolus <br/> - Then 12–15 units/kg/h infusion | - Requires frequent monitoring (aPTT) <br/> - Risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) [^271852f8] |
| Enoxaparin (LMWH) | - Inhibits factor Xa and thrombin <br/> - Predictable pharmacokinetics | - 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours | - No routine monitoring required <br/> - Lower risk of HIT <br/> - Superior efficacy vs UFH in some trials [^fe6f1d41] [^c65a0049] |
| Fondaparinux | Selective factor Xa inhibitor | - 2.5 mg SC daily | - Low bleeding risk <br/> - Add UFH if PCI due to catheter thrombosis risk [^77541537] |
| Bivalirudin | Direct thrombin inhibitor | - 0.75 mg/kg IV bolus <br/> - Then 1.75 mg/kg/h infusion | - Useful in HIT <br/> - Lower bleeding risk vs UFH + GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors [^fd612836] |

---

## Comparative effectiveness of anticoagulants

- **Enoxaparin vs UFH**: Enoxaparin has been shown to reduce the composite endpoint of death, MI, or recurrent angina compared to UFH, with a favorable safety profile [^fe6f1d41] [^c65a0049].
- **Fondaparinux vs enoxaparin**: Fondaparinux is non-inferior to enoxaparin in preventing ischemic events and significantly reduces major bleeding, but requires adjunctive UFH during PCI [^77541537].
- **Bivalirudin vs UFH**: Bivalirudin is non-inferior to UFH plus GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in preventing ischemic events, with significantly lower bleeding risk [^fd612836].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation therapy in unstable angina is typically continued for **2–8 days**, or until clinical stabilization or revascularization is performed [^c65a0049]. Prolonged anticoagulation beyond this period is generally not recommended unless there are specific indications, such as atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves.

---

## Risks and benefits of anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation therapy in unstable angina provides significant benefits in reducing ischemic events, but it also carries risks, particularly **bleeding complications**. The balance between ischemic benefit and bleeding risk must be carefully considered, especially in elderly patients, those with renal impairment, or those at high bleeding risk [^5cb3ebd6].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Enoxaparin requires dose adjustment in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) [^c65a0049].
- **Elderly patients**: Increased bleeding risk necessitates careful monitoring and dose adjustments.
- **Patients with HIT**: Bivalirudin is the preferred anticoagulant due to its lack of interaction with heparin antibodies [^fd612836].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend **parenteral anticoagulation** for patients with unstable angina, with enoxaparin preferred over UFH due to its superior efficacy and safety profile. Fondaparinux and bivalirudin are reasonable alternatives based on patient-specific factors and clinical context [^1a7200f7] [^77541537].

---

Anticoagulation therapy is a cornerstone in the management of unstable angina, with **enoxaparin preferred over UFH** due to its superior efficacy and safety. Fondaparinux and bivalirudin are alternatives based on patient-specific factors. The duration of anticoagulation is typically 2–8 days, and the balance between ischemic benefit and bleeding risk must be carefully considered.

### Application of current guidelines to the management of unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^6858a64c]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) is a common but heterogeneous disorder with patients exhibiting widely varying risks. Early risk stratification is at the center of the management program and can be achieved using clinical criteria and biomarkers, or a combination. In addition to anti-ischemic therapy and aspirin, the thienopyridine clopidogrel is indicated except in patients who are potential candidates for urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonists are indicated in high-risk patients likely to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but are not indicated in the management of lower-risk patients who do not undergo PCI. There is a growing body of evidence to support the substitution of the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin for unfractionated heparin (UFH). Three recent trials have demonstrated the benefit of an early invasive strategy with catheterization followed by revascularization in patients at high and intermediate risk. Lower-risk patients should undergo early noninvasive stress testing. An intensive program of secondary prevention is mandatory and should be begun before hospital discharge.

### 2007 guideline update for unstable angina / non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: focus on antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies [^2dff0c3f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize key changes in the 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline recommendations for pharmacologic therapy as they relate to antiplatelets and anticoagulants, and to evaluate the evidence from several landmark trials that was used to support the guideline updates for these agents.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1950-January 2008) using the search terms acute coronary syndromes, unstable angina (UA), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), antiplatelet, and anticoagulant. All papers were cross-referenced to identify additional studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

ACC/AHA guidelines, relevant original research articles, and review articles were evaluated. Studies with more than 1000 patients were the focus of the review.

Data Synthesis

UA and NSTEMI are the most common presentations of acute coronary syndrome. The recently updated ACC/AHA guidelines for management of this condition were based on significant advances in pharmacotherapy including expanded use of drug-eluting stents, pretreatment with clopidogrel, and newer anticoagulants such as bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Landmark trials have been published that describe advances in the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants. According to the guidelines, unfractionated heparin (UFH) and enoxaparin are preferred options for both invasive and conservative management. Enoxaparin was noninferior to UFH for invasive management in the SYNERGY trial, although it was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding. Other alternatives for an invasive strategy per the guidelines include bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Bivalirudin (alone or with glycoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitor) was compared with heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor in the ACUITY trial of patients undergoing early invasive management. The bivalirudin groups were noninferior to standard of care, although bivalirudin alone was associated with less bleeding. Fondaparinux was found to be noninferior to enoxaparin and was associated with fewer bleeding events in the OASIS-5 study of patients who were not treated with an early invasive approach. Accordingly, the guidelines 1list fondaparinux as an alternative for a conservative strategy or in patients at increased risk of bleeding.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be familiar with the updated 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines and the clinical trial evidence that serves as the basis for these recommendations. It is paramount for institutions to outline a preferred and consistent treatment approach. These decisions should involve a review of established efficacy, bleeding risk, need for anticoagulant reversal, costs, and clinician familiarity with different treatment regimens.

### Acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation: implementation of new guidelines [^cf6a1168]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Unstable angina and non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction have in recent years been recognised as frequent and important clinical manifestations of coronary-artery disease. The European (ESC) and American (ACC/AHA) professional societies last year released guidelines on diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of these disorders. These guidelines summarise similarly the current evidence and translate them to clinical practice. Most important changes relate to the inclusion of troponins into the risk stratification algorithm, the addition of low-molecular-weight heparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists to medical treatment, and the role of invasive management for improved long-term outcome. Guidelines are constantly challenged by newly emerging study results. Recently, early invasive management and clopidogrel have been found to exert further benefit to this high-risk group of patients. Accordingly, the societies on both sides of the Atlantic will work together closely to update and implement these guidelines.

### Oral antiplatelet therapy in unstable angina / non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention: is it time for a guideline update? [^b90c0aba]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Oral antiplatelet drugs are central in the management of acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the mechanisms that confer the benefits of these agents also increase bleeding risk. Thus, the selection of appropriate pharmacotherapy requires close attention to the delicate balance between reducing the risk of ischemic events and minimizing bleeding risk. A critical review of the 2007 guidelines in these areas and new clinical data with currently available and soon-to-be-approved antiplatelet agents are presented.

### The medical management of acute coronary syndromes and potential roles for new antithrombotic agents [^0e43e64a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Antithrombic therapy is recommended to prevent ischemic complications in patients with high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes, including patients with unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing fibrinolysis with fibrin-specific agents. Ischemic benefit from these agents must be balanced against an increased risk of bleeding, which may itself carry adverse long-term consequences. Recent trials suggest that the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin may be superior to unfractionated heparin for preventing ischemic complications, although it also may be associated with an increase in bleeding risk. In two other contemporary trials, the Factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux improved mortality and morbidity in patients with unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing fibrinolytic reperfusion, without increasing bleeding risk. These data underscore the promise of new antithrombotic agents to improve outcomes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients being medically managed.

### Bench to bedside: pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes and implications for therapy [^3ab62e97]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) myocardial infarction (MI) [commonly referred to as NSTE acute coronary syndrome(s) (ACS)] has evolved considerably over the years, with atherothrombosis playing a pivotal role. This review discusses the molecular interactions in coronary thrombosis that may serve as therapeutic targets for more effective management of these syndromes. The purposes of this review are: 1) to discuss current understanding of the pathophysiology of NSTE ACS; 2) to describe recent studies with novel antithrombotic agents [e.g., low-molecular-weight heparin, thienopyridines, glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa inhibitors] in patients with NSTE ACS; and 3) to highlight recommendations for management of patients with NSTE ACS in the recently updated American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, including the appropriate use of antithrombotic therapies.

### What US cardiology can learn from the 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^4a3f1bae]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Recognizing that acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) constitute a spectrum encompassing unstable angina, non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of ACSs addressed all three. This differs from the prior US guidelines that individually addressed unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. The 2023 ESCACS Guidelines thus encompass comprehensive patient management from admission to long‐term care, again including what in prior US guidelines would have been a secondary prevention guideline. In addition, the task force included a patient member who provided a patient perspective that is highlighted in the European publication.

### Acute coronary syndrome update for hospitalists [^579ee097]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) — unstable angina, non-ST-segment (ST, part of an electrocardiogram between the QRS complex and the T wave) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) — remain extremely common and clinically challenging. In addition to electrocardiography and biomarkers, formal risk stratification using risk scores has become an important part of the initial evaluation of patients with ACS. On the basis of the estimated risk of subsequent ischemic events, the optimal use and timing of cardiac catheterization and revascularization procedures can be determined. Additionally, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy can be instituted, with consideration given to both the ischemic and bleeding risks in an individual patient. A particular challenge in ACS management has been the rapid evolution of guidelines in response to new randomized clinical trial and registry data. Understanding and implementing the recommendations in these evidence-based guidelines are important parts of hospitalists' practice.

### Diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome: an evidence-based update [^2f602915]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) describes the range of myocardial ischemic states that includes unstable angina, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (MI), or ST-elevated MI. ACS is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and places a large financial burden on the health care system. The diagnosis of ACS begins with a thorough clinical assessment of a patient's presenting symptoms, electrocardiogram, and cardiac troponin levels as well as a review of past medical history. Early risk stratification can assist clinicians in determining whether an early invasive management strategy or an initial conservative strategy should be pursued and can help determine appropriate pharmacologic therapies. Key components in the management of ACS include coronary revascularization when indicated; prompt initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation; and consideration of adjuvant agents including β blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, and HmG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. It is essential for clinicians to take an individualized approach to treatment and consider long-term safety and efficacy when managing patients with a history of ACS after hospital discharge.

11 Summary

In summary, the highlights of the ECS‐ACS Guidelines include the concept that ACS encompasses a spectrum from unstable angina to NSTEMI to STEMI. The serial approach involves thinking A.C.S. at initial assessment; thinking invasive management; thinking antithrombotic therapy; thinking revascularization; and thinking secondary prevention.

### Effects of long-term, moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation in addition to aspirin in unstable angina. the organization to assess strategies for ischemic syndromes (OASIS) investigators [^716acae8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to evaluate whether oral anticoagulant (AC) therapy given for five months was superior to standard (control) therapy in patients with unstable angina receiving aspirin.

Background

The long-term risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or death remains high in patients with unstable angina, despite the use of aspirin. Therefore, additional treatments are necessary.

Methods

Of the 10,141 patients entering the main trial, 3,712 were randomized 12 to 48 h later to receive oral AC therapy (n = 1,848) or standard therapy (n = 1,864).

Results

One-hundred forty patients (7.6%) suffered from cardiovascular death, MI or stroke while receiving oral AC, compared with 155 patients (8.3%) on standard therapy (relative risk [RR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 1.14; p = 0.40). The rates of the primary outcomes plus refractory angina were 16.7% (n = 308) versus 17.5% (n = 327) (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.11; p = 0.53). Countries were divided into good or poor compliers (based on the use of oral AC above or below 70% at 35 days), without knowledge of results by country. In good-complier countries, oral AC was discontinued in only 10.4% of patients at seven days and in 23.6% by five months, compared with 27.6% and 44.9%, respectively, in poor complier countries. There were significant reductions in the risks of both the primary (6.1% vs. 8.9%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; p = 0.02) and secondary outcomes (11.9% vs. 16.5%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90; p = 0.005) with oral AC in the good-complier countries. There was little difference in the poor-complier countries (9.0% vs. 7.8% for the primary and 21.3% vs. 18.5% for the secondary outcomes, tests for interactions comparing the RRs for the primary and secondary outcomes were p < 0.02 and p = 0.002, respectively, between the two sets of countries). In the overall study, there was an excess of major bleeding (2.7% vs. 1.3%; p = 0.004), which was larger in the good-complier countries (RR 2.71) compared with the poor-complier countries (RR 1.58). There were also reductions in cardiac catheterization (RR 0.80; p = 0.004) and coronary revascularization procedures (RR 0.82; p = 0.06) in the good-complier countries, but not in the poor-complier countries (RR 0.98 and 1.06, respectively, p for interaction of 0.06 and 0.04, respectively).

Conclusions

Overall, oral AC led to a small, nonsignificant reduction in the risk of the primary and secondary outcomes. Stratifying the countries or centers by their rates of compliance to oral AC suggested that good compliance to oral AC could potentially lead to clinically important reductions in major ischemic cardiovascular events.

### 2011 ACCF / AHA focused update of the guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina / non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (updating the 2007 guideline): highlights for the clinician [^be7eebfe]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The 2011 Update to the Unstable Angina/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) Guideline is based in evolving data or expert opinion and incorporates information from late-breaking clinical trials presented at the 2008–2009 Scientific Sessions of the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology, among others, as well as selected data through April 2010. The 5 key issues highlighted in this summary are: (1) the timing of acute interventional therapy in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; (2) emphasis on the timing, duration, and application of dual and triple antiplatelet therapy; (3) specific recommendations for patients with diabetes mellitus; (4) the role and potential benefit of invasive therapy in patients with advanced renal dysfunction; and (5) issues of quality improvement for acute coronary syndromes.

### The role of low-molecular-weight heparin in the management of acute coronary syndromes [^fe6f1d41]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

A substantial number of clinical studies have consistently demonstrated that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) compounds are effective and safe alternative anticoagulants to unfractionated heparins (UFHs). They have been found to improve clinical outcomes in acute coronary syndromes and to provide a more predictable therapeutic response, longer and more stable anticoagulation, and a lower incidence of UFH-induced thrombocytopenia. Of the several LMWH agents that have been studied in large clinical trials, including enoxaparin, dalteparin, and nadroparin, not all have shown better efficacy than UFH. Enoxaparin is the only LMWH compound to have demonstrated sustained clinical and economic benefits in comparison with UFH in the management of unstable angina/ non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Also, LMWH appears to be a reliable and effective antithrombotic treatment as adjunctive therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Clinical trials with enoxaparin indicate that LMWH is effective and safe in this indication, with or without the addition of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The efficacy demonstrated by enoxaparin in improving clinical outcomes in unstable angina/NSTEMI patients has led to investigations of its role in the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Initial results are very encouraging, and they indicate that enoxaparin may potentially substitute for UFH as adjunctive therapy in fibrin-specific thrombolytic regimens and improve coronary reperfusion rates in streptokinase-based regimens.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with prior ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease — adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulation: For patients with a history of ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, the usefulness of adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulants is uncertain for purposes of reducing the risk of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Unstable angina and coronary artery stenting represent special circumstances in which management may warrant dual antiplatelet/oral anticoagulation.

### Defining the scope of evidence-based practice for low-molecular-weight heparin therapy in high-risk patients with unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^a0f5621b]. Clinical Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Various therapies have been utilized for the treatment of unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Each therapy has both advantages and disadvantages with regard to clinical outcomes and an increased risk of bleeding. One emerging primary therapy is low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Concerns have emerged, however, over the use of LMWH in patients going to the catheterization laboratory or who receive platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Available trial data point to the safety and efficacy of LMWH in these patients. Eventually, LMWH will probably replace unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the majority of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). At present, however, practitioners need to consider individually how comfortable they are with the available data.

Aspirin — long-term secondary prevention in high-risk vascular disease confers a conclusive net benefit, with proportional reductions in vascular events ranging from 20% to 25% across settings; relative effects vary from no statistically significant benefit in peripheral arterial disease to an ~50% risk reduction in unstable angina, and absolute benefits translate into avoidance of a major vascular event in 50 of 1,000 unstable angina patients treated for 6 months to 36 of 1,000 patients with prior MI, stroke, or TIA treated for ~30 months.

In 2002, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association published an update to their guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. These revised guidelines make specific recommendations regarding the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. This article briefly reviews the evidence supporting the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, before moving on to discuss interpretation of these new guidelines.

### The role of clopidogrel in the management of acute coronary syndromes [^ced8a9ce]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite significant advances in the management of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction (MI) is still associated with a mortality rate of 45%. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been the oral antiplatelet drug of choice until recently. Thienopyridines such as clopidogrel have been shown to provide significant benefits in the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), either as an alternative to or in combination with ASA therapy.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to review the available scientific literature evaluating the use of clopidogrel in the management of ACS.

Methods

Relevant published data were identified through searches of the English-language literature indexed on MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts through April 2003. Search terms included thienopyridines, platelet aggregation inhibitors, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention. Pertinent conference abstracts were also included.

Results

The results of 3 large clinical trials-Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE), Effect of Pretreatment with Clopidogrel and Aspirin Followed by Long-Term Therapy in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI-CURE), and Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO)-support prolonged use of clopidogrel (up to 12 months) in combination with ASA in patients with non-ST-segment elevation MI and patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A significant increase in bleeding events was observed in the group that received clopidogrel plus ASA compared with ASA alone in the CURE (major bleeding, P = 0.001; minor bleeding, P < 0.001) and PCI-CURE (minor bleeding, P = 0.03) trials. Use of the combination of clopidogrel and ASA with other antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents has not been studied extensively.

Conclusions

Use of the combination of clopidogrel and ASA for up to 9 months is recommended for the medical management of non-ST-segment elevation MI and after a PCI. The increased risk of bleeding must be taken into account, and use of this combination with other agents that affect bleeding risk should be considered carefully.

### Antithrombotic strategies to reduce adverse clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^3e18ef34]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), which include ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina, present a considerable burden to the health care system. Furthermore, many patients with a first ACS event will develop another event within 1 year. To prevent this, higher-risk patients with ACS are revascularized when possible after presentation and then prescribed ongoing treatments to prevent recurrent vascular events. These include agents that prevent platelet aggregation and subsequent coronary thrombosis. However, some patients will develop a recurrent event despite treatment with these drugs, prompting a search for additional strategies to augment the effectiveness of current therapies. One such approach is add-on therapy with oral anticoagulant drugs. These agents may act synergistically with antiplatelet agents in preventing thrombosis. In conclusion, new oral anticoagulants might represent an attractive therapeutic strategy if they do not result in unacceptable bleeding.

### The use of adjunctive anticoagulants in patients with acute coronary syndrome transitioning to percutaneous coronary intervention [^aaa69c61]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) need to be quickly diagnosed, risk-stratified, and treated accordingly. Anticoagulants used in the ED should be easy to use and suitable for all patients with acute coronary syndromes, regardless of treatment strategy. In patients with ST-segment myocardial infarction, current guidelines recommend unfractionated heparin regardless of reperfusion strategy or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as an alternative in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The LMWH enoxaparin is approved for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients managed medically or undergoing PCI. The recently updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction recommend unfractionated heparin or the LMWH enoxaparin (class IA recommendation), or the factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux or the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin (class IB recommendation) for patients managed invasively. This review discusses each of these anticoagulant options in the context of patients transitioning to PCI.

### Heparin versus placebo for non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes [^c4c4586f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS) represent a spectrum of disease including unstable angina and non-ST segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Despite treatment with aspirin, beta-blockers and nitroglycerin, unstable angina/NSTEMI is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although evidence suggests that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is more efficacious compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH), there is limited data to support the role of heparins as a drug class in the treatment of NSTEACS. This is an update of a review last published in 2008.

Objectives

To determine the effect of heparins (UFH and LMWH) compared with placebo for the treatment of patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or NSTEMI).

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Heart Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to January week 1 2014), EMBASE (OVID, 1947 to 2014 week 02), CINAHL (1937 to 15 January 2014) and LILACS (1982 to 15 January 2014). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of parenteral UFH or LMWH versus placebo in people with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or NSTEMI).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed quality of studies and independently extracted data.

Main Results

There were no new included studies for this update. Eight studies (3118 participants) were included in this review. We found no evidence for difference in overall mortality between the groups treated with heparin and placebo (risk ratio (RR) = 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.98). Heparins compared with placebo, reduced the occurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63, number needed to benefit (NNTB) = 33). There was a trend towards more major bleeds in the heparin studies compared to control studies (RR = 2.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.60). From a limited data set, there appeared to be no difference between patients treated with heparins compared to control in the occurrence of thrombocytopenia (RR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.24). Assessment of overall risk of bias in these studies was limited as most of the studies did not give sufficient detail to allow assessment of potential risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with placebo, patients treated with heparins had a similar risk of mortality, revascularization, recurrent angina, and thrombocytopenia. However, those treated with heparins had a decreased risk of myocardial infarction and a higher incidence of minor bleeding. Overall, the evidence assessed in this review was classified as low quality according to the GRADE approach. The results presented in this review must therefore be interpreted with caution.

### 2007 update to the ACC / AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: implications for emergency department practice [^e1754f43]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have updated their guidelines for the management of non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome for the first time since 2002. In the interim, several important studies affecting choices of therapy potentially begun in the emergency department have been completed, and care patterns have changed and matured significantly. In this review, we present the new recommendations that are pertinent to emergency medicine practice and comment on their potential implementation into an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to the evaluation and management of this challenging patient population.

### 2000 ACC / AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a practical summary for emergency physicians [^ff8bd054]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

There have been numerous significant clinical advances in both the diagnosis and therapy of acute coronary syndrome during the past several years. Even the term "acute coronary syndrome" is a recent creation meant to expand clinical attention in patients with chest pain of coronary origin beyond identification of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy and to include the evaluation and management of those patients with unstable angina (UA) or myocardial injury that does not cause ST-segment elevation. Many of these advances have been studied and first implemented outside the emergency department, leading some emergency physicians to be slow to embrace them, and leaving others without a viable practical option to use them outside of the cardiac catheterization laboratory or the coronary care unit. In September 2000, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued practice guidelines for the care of patients with UA and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The guidelines specifically address the diagnosis and management of UA and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the ED, suggesting evidence-based standards for risk stratification, for the use of biologic markers of myocardial damage and other adjunctive diagnostic tests, and for the appropriate use of antiplatelet and antithrombin therapeutic agents. This article provides an overview of the ED-pertinent analyses and recommendations from the 93-page document. A commentary on the implementation of these recommendations in the ED follows in a separate article.

Acute coronary syndromes — Evidence on parenteral anticoagulants and periprocedural considerations includes the following: in unstable angina, a meta-analysis including 1353 patients from 6 randomized studies found a lower, albeit nonstatistically significant, risk with aspirin plus heparin during the randomized treatment period (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.44–1.02]); in high-risk NSTE-ACS, about 40% underwent PCI and fondaparinux increased guiding-catheter thrombosis versus enoxaparin (0.9% versus 0.3%); across 12 171 ACS patients without ST-segment elevation in 5 randomized trials, low-molecular-weight heparin versus UFH showed no significant difference in death or MI (2.2% versus 2.3%); for patients undergoing coronary revascularization, parenteral anticoagulation is indicated until revascularization, and premature discontinuation is associated with the greatest risk for reinfarction in the first 8 to 48 hours; UFH has traditionally been the preferred anticoagulant to support PCI with activated clotting time used to guide dosing; bivalirudin can support PCI and in BRIGHT-4 used a bolus 0.75 mg/kg then 1.75 mg/kg per hour with a post-PCI infusion 1.75 mg/kg per hour for 2 to 4 hours, and bivalirudin with the full dose post-PCI infusion was superior to UFH in reducing a 30-day composite outcome.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^77541537]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — evidence and procedural guidance are summarized as follows: In unstable angina, a meta-analysis including 1353 patients enrolled from 6 randomized studies reported risk for MI or death lower with aspirin plus heparin versus aspirin alone during the randomized treatment period (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.44–1.02]). In high-risk NSTE-ACS in OASIS-5, fondaparinux was similar to enoxaparin in risk for ischemic events at 9 days and reduced major bleeding, but an increase in guiding-catheter thrombosis occurred with fondaparinux (0.9% versus 0.3%). In randomized comparisons of low-molecular-weight heparin versus UFH in NSTE-ACS, there was no significant difference in death or MI (2.2% versus 2.3%). For patients with ACS undergoing coronary revascularization (CABG or PCI), parenteral anticoagulation is indicated until revascularization, and the greatest risk for reinfarction is in the first 8 to 48 hours after the discontinuation of anticoagulation. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has traditionally been the preferred anticoagulant to support PCI in patients with NSTE-ACS, activated clotting time is used to guide dosing during PCI, and its anticoagulant effect is reversible with the administration of protamine. Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor evaluated in both NSTE-ACS and STEMI that can be used to support PCI; in BRIGHT-4 of STEMI patients undergoing PPCI using radial access (93%), the bivalirudin regimen included 0.75 mg/kg, then 1.75 mg/kg per hour plus a post-PCI infusion at the full dose (1.75 mg/kg per hour) for 2 to 4 hours, and bivalirudin with the full dose post-PCI infusion was superior to UFH in reducing the 30-day composite of all-cause death or BARC.

### The warfarin and antiplatelet therapy in heart failure trial (WATCH): rationale, design, and baseline patient characteristics [^df9c482b]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The role of anticoagulation in patients with chronic heart failure has long been an area of interest and controversy. Traditionally the goal of anticoagulation has been to prevent embolic events, but recent trials also demonstrated that oral anticoagulation also prevents vascular events in patients with prior myocardial infarction, who constitute the majority of heart failure patients. Although antiplatelet agents also reduce postinfarction vascular events, few data are available in heart failure patients, and some evidence suggests that aspirin may also have the potential to worsen heart failure morbidity and mortality, possibly by interfering with the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Methods and results The Warfarin and Antiplatelet Therapy in Chronic Heart Failure (WATCH) trial was undertaken to determine the optimal antithrombotic agent for heart failure patients. WATCH was a prospective-randomized trial in which symptomatic heart failure patients in sinus rhythm with ejection fractions ≤ 35% taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (unless not tolerated) and diuretics were randomized to open-label warfarin (target International Normalized Ratio 2.5–3.0) or double-blind antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 162 mg or clopidogrel 75 mg. Two primary comparisons were specified: anticoagulation with warfarin versus antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel versus antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. The primary outcome is the composite of death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke analyzed as time to first event using the intent-to-treat approach. The secondary endpoint was the broader composite of death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, and systemic or pulmonary artery embolic events. Additional prespecified analyses include heart failure events, coronary events, and resource utilization.

Conclusions

Although the trial was designed to enter 4500 patients, it was terminated 18 months prematurely in June 2003 by the VA Cooperative Study Program because of poor enrollment with a resulting reduction of its power to achieve its original objective. This manuscript describes the study rationale, protocol design, and the baseline characteristics of the 1587 patients who were entered into the study. The WATCH trial will help define the optimal approach to antithrombotic therapy in the contemporary management of patients with chronic heart failure resulting from left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Acute coronary syndromes — The American College of Cardiology recommends a heparin bolus of 60 to 70 units/kg (maximum, 5,000 units) followed by an infusion of 12 to 15 units/kg/h (maximum, 1,000 units/h) for unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and even lower doses are recommended with fibrinolytic therapy for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in which the bolus is about 60 units/kg (maximum, 4,000 units) and the infusion is 12 units/kg/h (maximum of 1,000 units/h).

### Evaluation and management of patients With stable angina: beyond the ischemia paradigm: JACC state-of-the-art review [^2ec7ea7a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronary heart disease is a chronic, systemic disease with a wide range of associated symptoms, clinical outcomes, and health care expenditure. Adverse events from coronary heart disease can be mitigated or avoided with lifestyle and risk factor modifications, and medical therapy. These measures are effective in slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease and in reducing the risk of thrombosis in the setting of plaque disruptions. With increasing effectiveness of prevention and medical therapy, the role of coronary artery revascularization has decreased and is largely confined to subgroups of patients with unacceptable angina, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or high-risk coronary anatomy. There is a compelling need to allocate resources appropriately to improve prevention. Herein, we review the scientific evidence in support of medical therapy and revascularization for the management of patients with stable coronary heart disease and discuss implications for the evaluation of patients with stable angina and public policy.

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, "A" relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), "C" considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and "S" for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

### Quality of care among elderly patients hospitalized with unstable angina [^d8d3727a]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the management of unstable angina have been published by the United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (currently known as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality); however, little information is available about the quality of unstable angina care, particularly among elderly patients.

Methods

We examined 1196 elderly Medicare-insured patients hospitalized with unstable angina (ruled out for acute myocardial infarction) at Connecticut hospitals between August and November 1995 to evaluate quality of care provided during hospitalization. Patients without therapeutic contraindications were evaluated for the use of 5 Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guideline-recommended measures: electrocardiographic examination within 20 minutes of admission, use of aspirin on admission, intravenous heparin on admission, achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation among patients provided heparin, and prescription of aspirin on discharge.

Results

Less than half (49.6%) of patients underwent electrocardiographic examination within 20 minutes of admission. After excluding patients with contraindications, aspirin was provided to 80.1% of patients and intravenous heparin to 59.2% of indicated patients, of whom only 43.3% achieved therapeutic anticoagulation. Aspirin was prescribed to 82.3% of eligible patients at discharge. Performance on the 5 quality measures varied widely among hospitals.

Conclusions

Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guideline-recommended risk stratification and therapeutic interventions are underused in elderly patients hospitalized with unstable angina, with quality of care varying widely among hospitals.

Stable chronic coronary disease (CCD) with atrial fibrillation — AFIRE trial outcomes: The AFIRE trial randomized 2236 patients with AF who had previous PCI or CABG > 1 year earlier or who had CCD to rivaroxaban versus rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent (70.2% received aspirin, and 26.8% received a P2Y12 inhibitor), with a primary composite endpoint of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause and a safety endpoint of major bleeding. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy for efficacy and was superior for safety among patients with AF and stable CAD, and in stable CCD with AF, adding antiplatelet therapy to a vitamin K antagonist does not reduce recurrent coronary events or thrombosis and leads to significantly increased bleeding risk.

### Rationales and uncertainties for aspirin use in COVID-19: a narrative review [^2d7831bc]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary prevention of arterial thrombosis during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines and European Society for Cardiology (ESC) Guidance for the Diagnosis and Management of CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic do not include any recommendations regarding aspirin for the primary prevention of arterial atherothrombosis during this pandemic. This role is controversial in literature before the COVID-19 era(table 1).

Table 1
Primary prevention of arterial atherothrombosis events in guidelines

The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada in collaboration with the Canadian Stroke Consortium does not recommend the use of aspirin for primary prevention in individuals without a history of symptomatic CVD as the harms of daily aspirin use could potentially outweigh the benefits.

Secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel and the ESC recommend that patients who are receiving antiplatelet therapies (eg, aspirin) or anticoagulant for underlying conditions should continue these medications if they receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 unless there are contraindications such as the excessive risk of bleeding or planned invasive surgical procedures. These underlying conditions are acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, previous MI or revascularisation, postpercutaneous coronary interventions, transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke. A recent retrospective cohort study revealed that prehospital aspirin use in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with established coronary artery disease was not associated with increased all-cause mortality.

Prevention of venous thromboembolic events during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel does not recommend anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy for VTE prophylaxis or at therapeutic doses in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 unless there are other indications. These indications may be for arterial thrombosis prevention as mentioned above or for the prevention of VTE following total hip or knee replacementafter a risk assessment of postoperative VTE.

The clinical practice guidelines most relevant to cardiologists in the UK are those produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Contemporary guidance is based on the same (or a very similar) evidence base, yet recommendations from the two bodies may differ.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with AF, anticoagulation therapy, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support adding antiplatelet therapy to OACs for purposes of reducing the risk of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with a history of ischemic stroke, AF, and coronary artery disease. Consider initiating dual antiplatelet/oral anticoagulation in patients with unstable angina and coronary artery stenting.

### Are activated clotting times helpful in the management of anticoagulation with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin? [^8f7df2d8]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Enoxaparin has recently been shown to be superior to unfractionated heparin in patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Theoretical advantages of low-molecular-weight heparin versus unfractionated heparin include a higher ratio of anti-Xa to anti-IIa activity (3:1 for enoxaparin), a more predictable dose response that precludes the need for frequent monitoring, and the convenience of subcutaneous administration. Both activated partial thromboplastin time and activated clotting time (ACT) are used to monitor anticoagulation with heparin, and ACTs are now standard during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with heparin. At doses of up to 90 mg, subcutaneous enoxaparin leads to a modest dose-related increase in activated partial thromboplastin time, but the effect on ACT is unknown.

Methods

Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 11A was a multicenter, dose-ranging trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous enoxaparin in patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. We obtained peak (mean 4.3 hours after enoxaparin) and trough (mean 11.5 hours after enoxaparin) anti-Xa levels and ACTs for 26 patients in the TIMI 11A trial.

Results

Despite doses of enoxaparin in the range of 89 ± 19 mg every 12 hours and significant increases in anti-Xa levels even at trough, there was no change in the ACT measured by HemoTec and only a small increase with Hemachron. The correlation of peak Hemachron ACT with peak anti-Xa levels was poor (R = 0.5, P = 0.08).

Conclusions

In contrast to heparin, ACTs are not useful for assessment of anticoagulation with subcutaneous enoxaparin and should not be relied on in patients receiving enoxaparin who require acute PCI. Studies to determine the optimal dose, safety, and efficacy of enoxaparin in patients undergoing PCI are underway.

Comparison of guidelines

Guideline development

NICE published separate guidelines for diagnosis in 2010, and for the management of stable angina in 2011 (table 1). Its recommendations regarding lipid modification and hypertension are specified in its own (separate) guidelines in these areas, both of which have been updated since the publication of the NICE guidance on stable angina. The ESC guidance incorporates diagnosis and management into a single document, which was published in 2013. It refers to its own guidelines on myocardial revascularisation, which were updated in 2014.

Table 1
Summary of methodology used in the development of the clinical practice guidelines for the management of stable angina/stable coronary artery disease from NICE and the ESC

NICE includes in its diagnostic guideline adults with or without a prior diagnosis of cardiovascular disease who have recent onset chest pain suspected to be stable angina. Its management guideline is for adults who have been diagnosed with stable angina due to atherosclerotic disease. The ESC guidance incorporates a broader group which also includes patients with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and low-risk acute coronary syndromes.

In its guideline development, NICE posed 'key clinical questions', undertook a review of the relevant literature, critically appraised the quality of evidence, and made recommendation statements. The ESC made recommendations supported by a class of recommendation and level of evidence. Analyses of health economic data were considered by NICE but not by the ESC.

Baseline risk estimation after ACS — Because baseline risks vary widely, control group risks are taken from Clopidogrel In Unstable Angina To Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) when aspirin is the control and from Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) when aspirin and clopidogrel constitute the control group; CURE and PLATO were selected because they were large, simple trials that used accepted definitions for both vascular and bleeding events and included a large proportion of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization/PCI, reflecting current practice in high-income countries.

### Anticoagulants in ischemia-guided management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^e8126aa4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The most recent joint guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) on the management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) are a result of a substantial and considered undertaking, and those involved deserve much recognition for their efforts. However, the handling of anticoagulants seems somewhat inadequate, and this is a highly-relevant matter when managing NSTE-ACS.

Objective Of The Review

Among areas of potential uncertainty, emergency medicine professionals might still be left wondering about the particulars of anticoagulant therapy when pursuing ischemia-guided management of NSTE-ACS (that is, managing NSTE-ACS without an intent for early invasive measures, such as coronary angiography and revascularization). This review seeks to provide insight into this question.

Discussion

Relevant clinical trials are appraised and translated into clinical context for emergency medicine professionals, including the implications of noteworthy advancements in the management of NSTE-ACS.

Conclusions

Although current guidelines from the AHA and ACC suggest enoxaparin has better evidence than other anticoagulants in the setting of NSTE-ACS management, careful review of the evidence shows this is not actually clearly supported by the available evidence in the era of contemporary management. Unless and until better contemporary data emerge, emergency medicine professionals must carefully weigh the available evidence, its limitations, and the possible clinical implications of the various anticoagulant options when managing NSTE-ACS.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^e6b8f2d3]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Epidemiology and general principles of chronic coronary disease (CCD) — CCD is a heterogeneous group that includes obstructive and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) with or without previous myocardial infarction (MI) or revascularization, ischemic heart disease diagnosed only by noninvasive testing, and chronic angina syndromes with varying underlying causes. In the United States, approximately 20.1 million persons live with CCD, 11.1 million Americans have chronic stable angina pectoris, and approximately one-quarter (n = 200,000) of all MIs occur among the 8.8 million persons with CCD who have had a previous MI. Despite an approximate 25% overall relative decline in death from coronary heart disease (CHD) over the past decade, CHD remains the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide and is associated with substantial individual, economic, and societal burdens. The prevalence of CCD and chronic stable angina varies by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and geographic region, and the role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in both risk and outcomes is increasingly recognized. Comorbidities shape care: older age and chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly coexist with CCD and raise unique considerations for diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment; at the intersection with atrial fibrillation (AF), new information informs use of antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation; and as CCD and cancer survival improve, concurrent disease more often coexists with cardio-oncology emerging to address related challenges.

5 Antithrombotic Therapy

The guidelines further delineate the antithrombotic therapy regimens that are appropriate for patients with and without indications for oral anticoagulation and present antiplatelet drug strategies designed to reduce bleeding risk in the first year after an ACS. For example, for patients with very high bleeding risk, 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT — P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin) may be feasible (IIb, B). In those with a lower bleeding risk, 3 months of such therapy may be considered. In general, 6 months of DAPT is reasonable (IIa, A), although optimal is 1 year of DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy, with the latter preferred. An alternative DAPT de‐escalation strategy involves a change from aspirin plus prasugrel or aspirin plus ticagrelor to aspirin plus clopidogrel. In patients who require oral anticoagulation, NOAC monotherapy is a Class 1 indication after a year of DAPT.

### Treatment of patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [^35f6421f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Emergency department (ED) management of patients who present with suspected unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is especially challenging. Therapies that demonstrate benefit in patients who experience proven disease may not be indicated in patients who present with suspected disease. The emergency practitioner must have a clear understanding of the benefit and harm of each therapy, allowing formulation of a simple approach to treatment selection based on disease presentation. This article reviews current literature and discusses the treatment recommendations from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) for patients who experience UA and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

### Lipid management in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes: a review [^202b228d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite many improvements in its prevention and management, coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major cause of death in the developed world. 1 Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) constitutes the most severe clinical manifestation of CAD and includes unstable angina, non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (MI), and ST‐segment–elevation MI. Recent data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute suggest that the annual incidence of MI in the United States is 805 000. 2 The treatment of ACS has progressed tremendously since the 1950s and 1960s when it was associated with in‐hospital mortality as high as 30%. 3 By determining the underlying pathophysiological features and conducting large‐scale randomized controlled trials, the management of ACS evolved and in‐hospital mortality was reduced to ≈3% to 8%. 4 Nonetheless, in the current era, ≈20% of ACS survivors experience a subsequent ischemic cardiovascular event within 24 months, and 5‐year mortality ranges from 19% to 22%. 5, 6 Even when nonemergent and uncomplicated, repeated revascularization following percutaneous coronary intervention has been associated with long‐term mortality. 7, 8, 9 A recurrent ACS is associated with increased mortality to an even greater extent. 10 There are limits to the amount of antithrombotic medication that can be prescribed for secondary prevention, as increased intensity of antithrombotic therapy decreases recurrent ischemic events at the cost of increased bleeding events, which are also associated with subsequent mortality. 10

As lipids play a critical role in the development of coronary atherosclerosis lesions, obtaining a significant reduction of the lipid‐related risk has long been a crucial aspect of secondary prevention following ACS. Several additions to the available arsenal of lipid‐lowering therapies have recently been made or will soon be made, leaving clinicians with various therapeutic strategies to be used according to the clinical setting. This review details the current state of evidence on lipid management in patients presenting with ACS, provides directions for identification of patients who may benefit from early escalation of lipid‐lowering therapy, and discusses novel lipid‐lowering medication that is currently under investigation in clinical trials.

### Management of acute coronary syndrome: achievements and goals still to pursue. novel developments in diagnosis and treatment [^5cb3ebd6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes contribute a substantial part of the global disease burden. To realize a reduction in mortality and morbidity, the management of patients with these conditions involves the integration of several different approaches. Timely delivery of appropriate care is a key factor, as the beneficial effect of reperfusion is greatest when performed as soon as possible. Innovations in antithrombotic therapy have also contributed significantly to improvements in the prevention of ischaemic complications. However, with the use of such treatment, an increase in the risk of bleeding is inevitable. Therefore, the greatest challenge is now to obtain an optimal balance between the prevention of ischaemic complications and the risk of bleeding. In this regard, identification of patients at highest risk of either one is essential.

### Diagnosis and management of stable angina: a review [^ba629ce3]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Nearly 10 million US adults experience stable angina, which occurs when myocardial oxygen supply does not meet demand, resulting in myocardial ischemia. Stable angina is associated with an average annual risk of 3% to 4% for myocardial infarction or death. Diagnostic tests and medical therapies for stable angina have evolved over the last decade with a better understanding of the optimal use of coronary revascularization.

Observations

Coronary computed tomographic angiography is a first-line diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients with stable angina due to higher sensitivity and comparable specificity compared with imaging-based stress testing. Moreover, coronary computed tomographic angiography allows detection of nonobstructive atherosclerosis that would not be identified with other noninvasive imaging modalities, improving risk assessment and potentially triggering more appropriate allocation of preventive therapies. Novel therapies treating lipids (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, and icosapent ethyl) and type 2 diabetes (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) have improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stable ischemic heart disease when added to usual care. Randomized clinical trials showed no improvement in the rates of mortality or myocardial infarction with revascularization (largely by percutaneous coronary intervention) compared with optimal medical therapy alone, even in the setting of moderate to severe ischemia. In contrast, revascularization provides a meaningful benefit on angina and quality of life compared with antianginal therapies. Measures of the effect of angina on a patient's quality of life should be integrated into the clinic encounter to assist with the decision to proceed with revascularization.

Conclusions and Relevance

For patients with stable angina, emphasis should be placed on optimizing lifestyle factors and preventive medications such as lipid-lowering and antiplatelet agents to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events and death. Antianginal medications, such as β-blockers, nitrates, or calcium channel blockers, should be initiated to improve angina symptoms. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention should be reserved for patients in whom angina symptoms negatively influence quality of life, generally after a trial of antianginal medical therapy. Shared decision-making with an informed patient is important for effective treatment of stable angina.

### Updates and current recommendations for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: what it means for clinical practice [^daa445a1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have recently updated their joint guidelines for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS, including unstable angina [UA] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). These guidelines replace the 2007 guidelines and the focused updates from 2011 and 2012 and now combine UA and NSTEMI into a new classification, NSTE-ACS, and updating the terminology around noninvasive management to ischemia-guided strategy. The latest guidelines include updated recommendations for the use of the oral antiplatelet agents (P2Y12 inhibitors) prasugrel and ticagrelor as part of dual-antiplatelet therapy-the cornerstone of treatment for these patients. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the new and modified recommendations for the management of patients with NSTE-ACS and the evidence supporting them. Also, where appropriate, similarities and differences between the current recommendations of the AHA/ACC and those of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are highlighted. For example, the AHA/ACC recommends the P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor over clopidogrel in all patients with NSTE-ACS and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention is planned, whereas the ESC guidelines specifically recommend individual P2Y12 inhibitors for particular patient subgroups.

### Bleeding in cardiac patients prescribed antithrombotic drugs: electronic health record phenotyping algorithms, incidence, trends and prognosis [^ae5a162c]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

We sought to address the following questions: First, how can population-based EHR, spanning primary and hospital care, be used to define valid, replicable algorithms of bleeding occurrence and bleeding severity? Second, what is the long-term cumulative incidence of bleeding events across patients with incident AF, acute MI and unstable and stable angina who are prescribed with different antiplatelet and anticoagulation regimens? Third, to what extent has the incidence of bleeding increased over time with the changes in antithrombotic management? Fourth, to what extent is bleeding of differing severity associated with long-term prognosis in terms of all-cause mortality, atherothrombotic events and recurrent bleeding?

We used the CALIBER research platform of linked primary, hospital, myocardial ischaemia registry and mortality data. EHR phenotypes have been developed in CALIBER for acute MI, AF and stable coronary disease. Cohort studies of their associations with blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol consumption and neutrophil counts have supported their validity.

### Long-term outcomes of chronic coronary syndrome worldwide: insights from the international CLARIFY registry [^df129f93]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the state of coronary arteries is an important determinant of outcome in patients with angina. Given the expected higher prevalence of vulnerable plaques in patients with previous MI, it is expected that the latter will fare worst irrespective of the severity or even extent of atheromatous disease. The implications of this finding are clear: patients with prior MI and angina symptoms represent 14% of the chronic coronary syndrome population and are at highest risk. They deserve more intensive monitoring and management and particular attention should be devoted to implementing secondary prevention strategies and ensuring targets are met. A clearer understanding of which patient profiles have the worst outcomes is necessary to focus follow-up efforts and appropriately target new therapies that are either expensive or can have carry risks and side effect (e.g. rivaroxaban, PCSK9 inhibitors, or canakinumab). In contrast, patients with angina but no prior MI may not deserve aggressive non-invasive testing.

### Low-molecular-weight heparin for unstable angina… [^6734f68e]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The current standard of care for patients admitted to the hospital because of a non–Q-wave myocardial infarction or unstable angina consists of oral aspirin and intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin. However, this regimen is not consistently effective, since the anticoagulant response to heparin is unpredictable, and heparin may be neutralized by protein binding and platelets. Low-molecular-weight heparin has the advantage of being more predictable than unfractionated heparin in its therapeutic effect. Laboratory monitoring of anticoagulation is not required with low-molecular-weight heparin, and it is less commonly associated with thrombocytopenia. Cohen and colleagues compared the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous enoxaparin and intravenous heparin in patients with non–Q-wave coronary events.

Patients were randomized to receive either 1 mg per kg of enoxaparin subcutaneously every 12 hours plus intravenous placebo or intravenous heparin plus subcutaneous placebo injections. Treatment was continued for at least 48 hours, up to a maximum of eight days. In addition, aspirin was given in a daily dosage of 100 to 325 mg, depending on physician preference. The median duration of anticoagulant therapy was 2. 6 days for both groups. After 14 days of therapy, the risk of death, myocardial infarction and unstable angina was significantly lower among the patients who had received enoxaparin. This same pattern was seen at 30 days after treatment. The risk of the composite end point was 6 percent in the enoxaparin-treated patients, compared with 7. 3 percent in the intravenous heparin group.

The authors conclude that antithrombotic therapy with enoxaparin plus aspirin is more effective than intravenous heparin plus aspirin in reducing the incidence of ischemic events in patients with non–Q-wave myocardial infarction or unstable angina. A decrease in morbidity and mortality is seen for at least 30 days after initiation of therapy.

19. The beneficial effects of aspirin in patients with unstable angina were demonstrated in several studies conducted in the 1980s, 2–5 including a study conducted at the Montreal Heart Institute.

4 In that study, 479 patients with unstable angina were randomized to treatment with aspirin, intravenous heparin sodium, both, or neither. Although the thienopyridines have become an integral part of pharmacological therapy in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation, there remain only scant data on the role of these agents in patients with acute coronary syndromes. In an Italian study, 652 patients with unstable angina were treated with ticlopidine hydrochloride, 250 mg twice daily, plus conventional therapy or with conventional therapy alone during hospitalization, with continued therapy for approximately 6 months after discharge. 8 Treatment with ticlopidine decreased the incidences of nonfatal MI and vascular death by 46%.

In the Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppresion Using Integrilin Therapy study, 15 almost 11 000 patients with non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes were randomized to treatment with eptifibatide or placebo; heparin therapy was encouraged but not mandated. In the Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non–Q-Wave Coronary Events study, the 14-day incidence of the combined end point of death, MI, or recurrent angina was lower in patients treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium (1 mg.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Angina pectoris is a common manifestation of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and negatively affects quality of life. – Lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatment, and coronary revascularization can improve symptoms. – However, in most randomized trials exploring antianginal strategies or drugs in stable CAD, the burden of angina improved over time in the control group.– Although this improvement could be a result of optimization of medical treatments and cardiovascular risk factors during the trial, it could also reflect the natural history of the condition.

Angina pectoris is also associated with poor outcomes.– However, antianginal treatments have not been proven to improve outcomes in chronic stable angina. Even β-blockers, largely used on the basis of a mortality reduction after myocardial infarction, have not been associated with improved outcomes in stable angina. Likewise, invasive management with a view to coronary revascularization does not reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina or myocardial ischemia, although it improves symptoms.,

In the era of effective antianginals treatments, evidence-based secondary prevention therapy, and widespread use of coronary revascularization, we sought to describe the prevalence and time course of angina in patients with stable CAD as well as the effect of changes in anginal status on outcomes.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^c65a0049]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Unstable Angina and Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily) in patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction. Treat with enoxaparin sodium for a minimum of 2 days and continue until clinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Reduce the dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Unless contraindicated, administer aspirin to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI and continue dosing with 75 to 325 mg once daily.

When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non–fibrin specific), administer enoxaparin sodium between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of enoxaparin sodium therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge.

For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if the last enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous administration was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, administer an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

8 New Recommendations

A number of new recommendations (subsequent to the prior guidelines) deserve emphasis. For patients who stop DAPT to undergo CABG, resumption of DAPT after surgery should be continued for a total of at least 12 months (I, C). P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy may be an alternative to aspirin monotherapy for long‐term treatment (IIb, A). In patients requiring oral anticoagulation, after antiplatelet therapies plus anticoagulation for 6 months, continuing only oral anticoagulants may be considered (IIb, B). There is emphasis that de‐escalation of antiplatelet therapy in the first 30 days after an ACS event is not recommended (III, B).

In patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), PCI is recommended only for patients with ongoing myocardial ischemia, a large area of myocardium in jeopardy, and reduced antegrade flow (I, C). For patients with multiple vessel disease presenting in cardiogenic shock, staged PCI of the non‐infarct‐related artery (non‐IRA) should be considered (IIa, C). However, in hemodynamically stable STEMI patients, PCI of the non‐IRA (culprit artery) should be considered, depending on angiographic severity (I, B).

Regarding ACS complications, if high degree AV block does not resolve within 5 days following MI, implantation of a permanent pacemaker is recommended (I, C). With high clinical suspicion of an LV thrombus (IIa, C) and an equivocal echocardiographic image, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging should be considered.

### Enoxaparin in unstable angina patients who would have been excluded from randomized pivotal trials [^065f4f0c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

In the present study, we describe the characteristics and examine the anticoagulation levels and safety of subcutaneous enoxaparin in unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients who would not have been eligible in the Efficacy Safety Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non-Q-wave Coronary Events (ESSENCE) and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)-11B trials.

Background

It is not known whether the benefit shown with enoxaparin in the selected population of pivotal trials can be extended to the real world.

Methods

In our center, all patients with UA/NSTEMI are anticoagulated with subcutaneous enoxaparin adjusted to creatinine clearance. Among 515 consecutive patients, we identified 174 who would not have been eligible for ESSENCE or TIMI-11B ("EP" group for excluded patients). We evaluated cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), as well as major and minor bleeding events, at 30 days in the EP group and in patients without any of the exclusion criteria ("NEP" group for non-excluded patients).

Results

This EP group was older, had a higher female/male ratio, and more frequently had a history of MI or a diagnosis of non-Q MI on admission than the NEP group. The distribution of the anti-Xa activity was similar in both groups. The bleeding rates (major and minor) at 30 days were similar in the EP and NEP groups (2.3% vs. 2.9%, respectively, P = NS). On multivariate analysis, the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and the presence of hypertension were the only independent predictors of bleeding found in the whole population. Compared with the NEP group, the EP group had a fourfold increased rate of death or MI at 30 days (15.5% vs. 4.1%, p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of death or MI at 30 days were NSTEMI on admission, creatinine clearance, and heart failure.

Conclusions

Patients who do not fit the enrollment criteria of ESSENCE/TIMI-11B have higher risk baseline characteristics for both bleeding and ischemic events. In these patients, enoxaparin with dose adjustment to creatinine clearance provides adequate anti-Xa levels and no excess of bleeding.

Conclusion

Despite an improvement in the management of high‐risk ACS patients during the past decade, they are still undertreated with guideline‐recommended therapies. Nevertheless, the outcome of high‐risk ACS patients has improved significantly in the past decade; therefore, these patients should not be denied these therapies.

In‐Hospital Bleeding

Clinical guidelines for management of MI are based on randomized trials that have largely excluded patients on chronic warfarin or DOAC therapy. 34 The clinical dilemma for AF patients requiring urgent or emergent PCI includes how to choose between acute antithrombotic therapies while carefully balancing the risks of bleeding and ischemic events. A higher risk of bleeding has been described early after MI and PCI in patients with AF on warfarin, 17, 19 whereas such data in the era of DOACs are lacking. One of our key findings is that patients with STEMI on warfarin or DOACs receive reperfusion therapy without clinically significant delay in door‐to‐balloon times and, importantly, without increase in in‐hospital bleeding. Similarly, prior analysis of the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the ACC/AHA Guidelines) registry suggested that in patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation ACS on home warfarin, the adjusted risk of major bleeding was similar to that of nonanticoagulated patients (odds ratio: 1.02; 95% CI, 0.93–1.11). 35 A meta‐analysis of primarily observational studies suggests that coronary angiography and PCI can be safely performed on uninterrupted anticoagulation with warfarin. 26 However, prior studies of MI patients with AF lack data on frequency of subtherapeutic INR levels. 35 Notably in our study, 55% of STEMI and 43% of NSTEMI patients presenting on warfarin had INR values < 2.0, which is consistent with subtherapeutic INR levels in population studies of patients on warfarin presenting to emergency departments. 27 Importantly, our data provide further insight regarding acute hemorrhagic risks in vulnerable MI patients, with novel evidence for those on home DOACs. Given the underlying concerns about performing procedures on fully anticoagulated patients, it is reassuring to demonstrate a lack of increased bleeding with uninterrupted DOACs. Recent data suggest that performing other invasive cardiovascular procedures in AF patients might also be safer with uninterrupted DOAC therapy. In patients undergoing AF ablation in the RE‐CIRCUIT (Randomized Evaluation of Dabigatran Etexilate Compared to Warfarin in Pulmonary Vein Ablation: Assessment of an Uninterrupted Periprocedural Anticoagulation Strategy) trial, anticoagulation with uninterrupted dabigatran was associated with fewer bleeding complications than uninterrupted warfarin. 36

Contemporary angina classification by pathophysiology

The clinical history is of paramount importance to initially establish whether the nature of the presenting symptoms is consistent with angina (box 1). Indeed, recent data supports specialist physicians under-recognise angina in up to half of their patients. Furthermore, contemporary clinical trials of revascularisation in stable IHD including the ISCHEMIA trial highlight the importance of good clinical history and listening to our patients to determine the nature and frequency of symptoms which helps to plan management. We propose a classification of angina that aligns with underlying aetiology and related management (table 1).

The study VA Cooperative Study was published by Lewis HD Jr and colleagues in 1983 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Unstable angina. In the VA Cooperative Study study, the trial question was: what is the role of aspirin in male patients with unstable angina? In the VA Cooperative Study study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the VA Cooperative Study study, the population was: 1266 male patients. The inclusion criteria were male patients with unstable angina. The key exclusion criteria were congestive HF NYHA IV, tachyarrhythmia, anemia, contraindications to aspirin, bleeding tendency, myocardial infarction within 6 weeks, or other illness that might limit 1 year survival. In the VA Cooperative Study study, the interventions were: n = 625 aspirin (324 mg in buffered solution daily for 12 weeks) n = 641 placebo (matching placebo daily for 24 weeks). In the VA Cooperative Study study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death or acute MI (5% vs. 10.1%; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.76). In the VA Cooperative Study study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction (3.4% vs. 6.9%; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.83) Borderline significant decrease in death (1.6% vs. 3.3%; RR 0.48, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.97). In the VA Cooperative Study study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in gastrointestinal symptoms or evidence of blood loss. In the VA Cooperative Study study, the conclusion was: in male patients with unstable angina, aspirin was superior to placebo with respect to death or acute MI.

### Achieving optimal medical therapy: insights from the ORBITA trial [^b4bb3839]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment aims for patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and to improve angina symptoms. 1 Reducing the risk of future cardiovascular events is achieved by slowing disease progression, reducing plaque instability, and reducing thrombus aggregation. This is achieved with lifestyle modification, high‐intensity statin therapy, and antiplatelets. 2 Large randomized controlled trials in stable CAD have demonstrated that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not confer a survival benefit or a reduced risk of myocardial infarction, when added to optimal medical therapy. 3, 4 In the ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial, even in the context of moderate or severe ischemia, PCI did not prevent myocardial infarction or death. 5

The second aim of treatment is symptom relief. National and international guidelines recommend initial use of antianginal medications, which can be used in combination to reduce symptoms. If a patient's angina is not well controlled with the use of short‐acting nitrates alone, recommended first‐line therapy is either a β blocker or a calcium channel antagonist. Second‐ and third‐line agents, including long‐acting nitrates, nicorandil, ivabradine, and ranolazine, should be chosen according to comorbidities, contraindications, patient preference, and medication cost. Revascularization is considered for patients who remain symptomatic despite treatment with at least 2 antianginal agents or are intolerant of medical therapy. 6, 7

In contrast to the post‐ACS population, in which the efficacy of rivaroxaban is countered by an excess of bleeding, the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) 9 trial established a role for rivaroxaban in treatment of patients with stable coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease. COMPASS investigated the use of rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy among patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, 91% of whom had stable coronary artery disease. Patients requiring dual antiplatelet, nonaspirin antiplatelet therapy, or oral anticoagulation were excluded from the trial. Patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 5 mg bid alone, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid with aspirin, or aspirin alone. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid plus aspirin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke, or MI by 24% compared with aspirin alone. Major bleeding was more common in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group compared with aspirin alone, but there was no difference in fatal or intracranial bleeding or bleeding into a critical organ; thus, the net clinical benefit favored rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid plus aspirin. Based on the findings of COMPASS, rivaroxaban now carries a US Food and Drug Administration indication for reducing cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary or peripheral arterial disease.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) definition and classification — ACS are typically caused by the disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete coronary artery thrombosis and/or microemboli, resulting in diminished blood flow to the myocardium and subsequent myocardial ischemia. ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: (1) unstable angina, (2) non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and (3) STEMI. The initial diagnosis and classification of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpretation of the ECG, and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is defined by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished flow in the absence of significant myonecrosis detected by circulating troponin, whereas more prolonged or severe myocardial ischemia is diagnosed as MI with elevated biomarkers of myonecrosis. Patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia, while those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction. ACS can be dynamic, with rapid progression between unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI during presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. Other, less common causes of myocardial ischemia include coronary artery spasm, embolism, and dissection. This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS, including unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI, presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis, which under the Universal Definition would be classified as type 1 MI events.

Discussion

This analysis shows that for unstable CAD subsets, PCI reduces all-cause mortality by 16%, cardiovascular mortality by 31%, and MI by 26%. In contrast, PCI had no impact on these end points in patients with stable CAD. Our analysis incorporates results from 2 large, contemporary RCTs examining the role of PCI in different scenarios of CAD: the COMPLETE trial for multivessel disease in STEMI and the ISCHEMIA trial in stable CAD.

Effect of PCI in Varying Clinical Syndromes

PCI is established to have a clear benefit in mortality over fibrinolysis, which itself almost halves the mortality of patients with STEMI. There is, therefore, no doubt over the survival benefit of primary PCI at the time of presentation with STEMI. The utility of PCI in other clinical syndromes, however, has been controversial. Outside the context of an ongoing STEMI lies not a simple unitary entity but a broad clinical spectrum.

As the years have passed and technology evolved, there has been an increasingly sophisticated categorization of patients between these groups. For example, in the first decades of angioplasty, a patient who had survived a STEMI to discharge and had subsequently been found to have a positive exercise test would be considered to have stable CAD, in much the same way as a patient with a several year-history of exertional angina. Modern practice, however, would be to consider the unrevascularized post-MI patient as requiring urgent angiography and revascularization if indicated. Doctors in current practice can certainly gain from trials of yesteryear but can do this best when trial patients are contextualized in the relevant part of the modern view of the clinical spectrum. This meta-analysis lays out this context simply and underlines the importance of placing patients in the correct categorization when deciding on whether they may benefit from PCI.

There is no evidence that PCI reduces mortality, cardiovascular mortality or MI in patients who have true stable CAD. Patients who have suffered an MI, however, do derive benefit from PCI. This grouping includes patients with NSTEACS, patients who have been discharged after an unrevascularized MI and also patients who have had PCI for the culprit artery in a STEMI, but who have residual coronary disease. It should be noted that the unrevascularized post-MI cohort is a group of trials from a time when STEMI was routinely managed with fibrinolysis and without angiography.

Our analysis underlines that these patients, who have had an unstable event, are distinct, and have specific therapeutic needs.

Bivalirudin — mechanism, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and indications include that bivalirudin forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with thrombin, but once bound thrombin cleaves the Pro-Arg bond thereby allowing recovery of thrombin activity; bivalirudin has a plasma half-life of 25 min after IV injection, and only 20% is excreted via the kidneys; it is licensed as an alternative to heparin in patients undergoing percutaneous interventions for unstable angina or non-ST-elevation or ST-elevation myocardial infarction and in patients with HIT (with or without thrombosis) who require percutaneous coronary interventions; the currently recommended dose is a bolus of 0.75 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg/kg/h for the duration of the procedure, and dose reduction should be considered in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment; in contrast to hirudin, bivalirudin is not immunogenic, but antibodies against hirudin can cross-react with bivalirudin in vitro and the clinical consequences of this cross-reactivity are uncertain.

Advances in pharmacotherapy for stable angina have produced a wide choice of drugs with various mechanisms of action, potentially enabling individualized, patient-specific treatment strategies to be developed. In this Review, the various treatment options for patients with stable angina are discussed. Data from randomized, clinical trials of established and novel drugs are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the proposed mechanisms of action, benefits of therapy, and adverse-effect profiles. The role of coronary revascularization in conjunction with optimal medical therapy as a treatment strategy is discussed, although drug therapy might reduce the need for prompt revascularization if the procedure is being considered solely for the purpose of alleviating angina. Finally, trials to investigate stimulation of angiogenesis using growth-factor, gene, and cell therapy are used to illustrate the challenges of chemically inducing the growth of adequate, durable blood vessels.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — symptom relief and quality of life with invasive strategies: In stable chronic coronary disease (CCD), invasive management improved patient-reported health status in multiple trials. In ISCHEMIA, Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) summary scores were higher with an invasive strategy versus a conservative strategy and sustained over 36 months, with greater improvements when baseline angina frequency was higher (daily/ weekly > monthly > none), and the probability of being angina-free was greater among those with angina at baseline but minimal among asymptomatic participants. In the ORBITA trial, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) objectively reduced ischemia and produced more patient-reported freedom from angina than placebo despite no SAQ score difference. A pooled FAME/FAME-2 analysis found that lower fractional flow reserve (FFR), greater post-PCI FFR improvement, and higher baseline angina class were associated with the greatest magnitude of quality of life (QOL) improvement at 1 month and at 1 year. In COURAGE, crossover from guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to early revascularization was associated with worse baseline SAQ scores and, compared with patients randomized to PCI, worse health status and more unstable angina admissions during the initial year.
