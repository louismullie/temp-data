## Question

large renal mass in young patient and renal biopsy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a renal mass biopsy should be performed for a large renal mass in a young patient, and how to weigh the risks, benefits, and guideline-based indications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how "large" and "young" shift pretest probabilities and management thresholds. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (AUA, EAU, NCCN) say about when renal mass biopsy changes management. Next, I will examine diagnostic performance, safety, and limitations of biopsy. After that, I need to consider age-specific issues like hereditary syndromes and nephron-sparing priorities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline counseling points and alternatives if biopsy is deferred.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. A "large" solid renal mass is typically > 4 cm and often corresponds to T1b–T2 disease, which carries higher metastatic potential than small renal masses, while "young" generally means under about 46 years, an age threshold that triggers consideration of hereditary renal cancer syndromes and often a lower threshold for definitive oncologic therapy. Importantly, contemporary series show that even among surgically removed small renal masses, roughly 15–20% are benign, underscoring the risk of overtreatment if we assume malignancy solely from imaging [^1131iwzt] [^112amoY8].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before jumping to conclusions. The AUA recommends a utility-based approach to renal mass biopsy: obtain it when results are likely to change management, and do not require it when the patient is young and healthy and unwilling to accept uncertainties, or when an older/frail patient will be managed conservatively regardless of biopsy results. This means biopsy is not mandated solely by age or size; it hinges on whether histology will alter treatment decisions [^117B1t2H] [^111k2VaV]. The EAU advises preoperative biopsy in patients with unclear kidney lesions before management, which often applies when imaging is indeterminate or when nonoperative strategies are being considered, again reflecting a utility-based perspective rather than blanket use [^1117UqGT]. NCCN supports considering biopsy to establish diagnosis and guide surveillance or ablation, and specifically recommends biopsy prior to or at the time of thermal ablation, while noting that imaging alone is often sufficient when classic RCC features are present; they also advise genetic evaluation in patients ≤ 46 years or with multifocal/bilateral masses or family history, which is highly relevant in young patients [^111aHp55] [^112EY2hj] [^113cJzTQ].

> I need to check diagnostic performance and safety to balance benefit and risk. Contemporary core needle biopsy achieves high sensitivity and specificity for malignancy when tissue is obtained, with pooled sensitivity around 96–97% and specificity around 94–97%, and a nondiagnostic rate near 14% that drops with repeat biopsy; importantly, there are no reported cases of tumor seeding with modern coaxial techniques, and major complications are uncommon, though hematoma and hematuria can occur and antithrombotics increase bleeding risk [^115DingL] [^113soM8B] [^112KHLJr]. Hold on, I should verify the limitation: grading accuracy is imperfect, with upgrading on surgical pathology in about 16% of cases, so a low-grade biopsy result does not fully exclude higher-grade disease and must be interpreted in context [^116c8cz4].

> Let me consider the young-patient specifics. Age ≤ 46 years is a trigger for genetic counseling because 4–6% of RCC cases are hereditary; identifying a syndrome changes surveillance, family screening, and sometimes surgical planning, so even if biopsy is deferred, genetic evaluation should be offered in appropriate phenotypes. Additionally, young patients have longer expected survival and greater vulnerability to chronic kidney disease from nephrectomy, so nephron-sparing strategies are prioritized when feasible, which can make preoperative histology valuable for planning partial nephrectomy or selecting ablation in select cases [^111q2xY7] [^111wGBsw] [^1118tV76]. But wait, what if the mass is clearly resectable and the patient prefers definitive surgery without biopsy? The AUA explicitly allows deferring biopsy in young, healthy patients who accept uncertainty, so shared decision-making is essential here [^117B1t2H].

> Next, I should review scenarios where biopsy meaningfully changes management in this exact context. If the plan is active surveillance, biopsy helps confirm malignancy and grade to calibrate surveillance intensity and the threshold for intervention. If ablation is planned, biopsy is recommended beforehand to secure a diagnosis and guide follow-up. If imaging is atypical or suggests urothelial carcinoma, lymphoma, or metastasis, biopsy is indicated to redirect therapy. And if nephron-sparing surgery is technically challenging or renal function is marginal, knowing histology and grade can influence the choice between partial and radical nephrectomy or even ablation in select cases [^111aHp55] [^116VNSUM] [^117RGwh3] [^111VaMgv]. Hold on, I should verify that these are guideline-endorsed: yes, AUA, EAU, and NCCN all align on these indications, reinforcing a selective, utility-based approach rather than routine biopsy for all large masses [^117B1t2H] [^1117UqGT] [^111aHp55].

> I will now examine when biopsy may reasonably be deferred. In a young, healthy patient with a classic enhancing solid mass > 4 cm and a normal contralateral kidney, proceeding directly to partial or radical nephrectomy is acceptable if the patient understands and accepts the possibility of a benign final pathology and prefers to avoid the nondiagnostic risk and delays associated with biopsy. This is consistent with AUA guidance that biopsy is not required when results are unlikely to change management or when the patient is unwilling to accept uncertainties [^117B1t2H] [^111k2VaV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "most large masses are malignant, so biopsy just delays care", but I should correct that: even large masses can be benign or indolent, and while malignancy risk rises with size, overtreatment remains a concern; thus, the decision still rests on whether biopsy will alter the surgical plan or patient choice [^112amoY8] [^1131iwzt].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. For a large solid renal mass in a young patient, I would favor renal mass biopsy when any of the following apply: imaging is atypical or suggests non-RCC etiologies; active surveillance is being considered; ablation is planned; nephron-sparing surgery is technically challenging and histology would influence approach; or there is concern for hereditary syndrome where tissue could inform genetic testing. Conversely, biopsy can reasonably be deferred if the imaging is classic for RCC, the patient prefers definitive surgical excision without delay, and accepts the risk of overtreatment, provided genetic counseling is still offered when indicated by age or phenotype [^117B1t2H] [^1117UqGT] [^111aHp55] [^111q2xY7]. I should double-check that this aligns with the strength of evidence: yes, these are largely moderate recommendations or expert opinions, underscoring the need for shared decision-making and individualized judgment [^1171wm6f].

> Next, I should review counseling elements if biopsy is pursued. Patients should be told that core biopsy is preferred over FNA, typically 2–3 cores with 16–18 gauge needles under CT or ultrasound guidance, with a roughly 14% nondiagnostic rate that falls with repeat biopsy; malignancy on biopsy is highly reliable, but benign results can reflect sampling error and may warrant repeat biopsy or continued surveillance; complications are uncommon but include hematoma and hematuria, and antithrombotics should be held when feasible; and there is no evidence of tumor seeding with modern coaxial techniques [^1155QcEH] [^1136rbnB] [^112KHLJr] [^111kPDWc]. Hold on, I should verify the antithrombotic guidance: yes, AUA provides specific advice on holding agents based on bleeding risk, which should be integrated with the patient's cardiovascular profile [^112KHLJr].

> Finally, I need to ensure we address alternatives and follow-up if biopsy is deferred. If surgery is chosen without biopsy, partial nephrectomy is preferred when technically feasible to preserve renal function, with radical nephrectomy reserved for complex tumors or when partial nephrectomy is not feasible; postoperative surveillance should follow risk-adapted protocols, and patients should be counseled on renal function implications and the possibility of adjuvant therapy in selected high-risk scenarios. If surveillance is chosen, obtain baseline cross-sectional imaging and repeat imaging in 3–6 months, with escalation if growth exceeds about 3–5 mm/year or new concerning features emerge, recognizing that growth kinetics and size are stronger predictors of intervention than biopsy status in some cohorts [^111VaMgv] [^111yf8ga] [^116fLQzw] [^1111n2ak]. I should confirm that these surveillance principles are guideline-concordant: yes, AUA and NCCN endorse risk-adapted surveillance with early-interval imaging and individualized intensity thereafter [^111yf8ga] [^112kJ7rz].

In a young patient with a large renal mass, **biopsy is indicated when imaging is indeterminate** [^1117UqGT] or when histology will change management — such as before ablation, in suspected hereditary syndromes, or when considering active surveillance [^111aHp55] [^111dgVAb] [^114bKDiQ]. Biopsy is **not routinely required** if imaging is classic for RCC and the patient will proceed to surgery, but it should be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain or if nephron-sparing decisions hinge on histology [^117B1t2H] [^1151UUjJ]. Modern core biopsy is safe, with low complication rates and high diagnostic yield, but a nondiagnostic result is possible (~10–15%) and may require repeat biopsy or surgical excision [^112KHLJr] [^113soM8B] [^115BnagD]. Shared decision-making is essential, especially given the higher likelihood of hereditary disease in young patients [^111wGBsw].

## Indications for renal mass biopsy in young patients with large renal masses

Renal mass biopsy is **not universally indicated** for all large renal masses; its use should be guided by clinical context, imaging characteristics, and patient-specific factors. In young patients, the threshold for biopsy may be lower due to the higher likelihood of hereditary syndromes and the potential impact on long-term renal function and oncologic outcomes [^notfound].

Key indications for RMB in this population include:

- **Indeterminate imaging**: When imaging cannot confidently distinguish between benign and malignant lesions, or when atypical features are present [^1117UqGT] [^1154taUL].

- **Suspected hereditary syndromes**: Young patients (≤ 46 years) with renal masses, especially if multifocal or bilateral, or with a family history of renal malignancies, should be considered for genetic evaluation, and biopsy may provide valuable histologic information [^111wGBsw] [^111q2xY7].

- **Active surveillance**: If active surveillance is being considered, biopsy can provide histologic confirmation and aid in risk stratification [^111dgVAb] [^114bKDiQ].

- **Minimally invasive treatments**: Prior to ablation or other minimally invasive therapies, biopsy is recommended to confirm diagnosis and guide follow-up [^111aHp55] [^116VNSUM].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and limitations

Renal mass biopsy has evolved significantly, with contemporary series demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for malignancy are approximately 96.7% and 94.4%, respectively [^115DingL]. However, limitations include a **nondiagnostic rate of approximately 10–15%** [^113soM8B] and difficulty accurately grading tumors, with upgrading occurring in 16% of cases compared to surgical pathology [^116c8cz4]. These limitations must be discussed with patients during counseling.

---

## Risks and complications

Renal mass biopsy is generally safe, with low complication rates. Major complications, such as significant hemorrhage requiring transfusion, occur in **less than 1%** of cases [^112KHLJr]. Minor complications, including hematoma, gross hematuria, and pneumothorax, occur in approximately 5–10% but are typically self-limited [^112KHLJr]. The risk of tumor seeding along the biopsy tract is extremely rare with modern coaxial techniques [^111kPDWc].

---

## Impact on management decisions

Biopsy results can significantly alter management by identifying benign lesions that may obviate surgery, guiding nephron-sparing approaches, and informing surveillance strategies. In young patients, preserving renal function is critical; therefore, **histologic confirmation** may influence the choice between partial and radical nephrectomy or alternative therapies [^111VaMgv].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize a **utility-based approach** to renal mass biopsy. The AUA recommends RMB when results are likely to influence management, particularly in patients considering active surveillance or minimally invasive treatments [^117B1t2H] [^1152xNeK]. The EAU similarly recommends preoperative biopsy in patients with unclear lesions or when management would be altered by histologic information [^1117UqGT]. NCCN guidelines support biopsy in select scenarios, including young patients with suspected hereditary syndromes or when active surveillance is contemplated [^111aHp55].

---

## Alternative diagnostic approaches

While biopsy provides histologic confirmation, **imaging remains the cornerstone** of renal mass evaluation. Multiphasic CT or MRI can accurately characterize most renal masses, distinguishing benign lesions such as angiomyolipoma from malignant tumors [^116TZRjH]. Emerging molecular imaging techniques and advanced MRI sequences may further refine noninvasive diagnosis, but they are not yet standard of care [^116LQAHG].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In young patients with large renal masses, **renal mass biopsy should be considered** when imaging is indeterminate, when hereditary syndromes are suspected, or when management decisions hinge on histologic confirmation. Biopsy is generally safe, with high diagnostic accuracy, but nondiagnostic results and potential upgrading must be discussed. A utility-based approach, incorporating patient preferences and clinical context, is essential. If imaging is classic for RCC and the patient will proceed to surgery, biopsy may be omitted. However, in young patients, the threshold for biopsy should be low given the potential impact on long-term outcomes and the possibility of hereditary disease [^111wGBsw].

The incidence and prevalence of small renal masses (SRMs) continues to rise and with increased detection comes increases in surgical management, although the probability of an SRM being benign is upward of 30%. An extirpative treatment first diagnose-later strategy persists and clinical tools for risk stratification such as renal mass biopsy remain severely underutilized. The overtreatment of SRMs has multiple detrimental effects including surgical complications, psychosocial stress, financial loss, and reduced renal function leading to downstream effects such as the need for dialysis and cardiovascular disease.

### Renal mass biopsy-a practical and clinicopathologically relevant approach to diagnosis [^1151UUjJ]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Advancements in imaging modalities have increased the frequency of renal mass discovery. Imaging has typically been considered sufficient to guide management for a large proportion of these tumours, but renal mass biopsies (RMBs) have an increasing role in determining malignancy and can be a valuable tool for preventing unnecessary surgery in patients with benign tumours. A structured approach should be used to help to navigate the expanding repertoire of renal tumours, many of which are molecularly defined. In terms of tumour subtyping, the pathologist's strategy should focus on stratifying patients into clinically different prognostic groups according to our current knowledge of tumour behaviour, including benign, low-grade or indolent, intermediate malignant or highly aggressive. Crucial pathological features and morphological mimicry of tumours can alter the tumour's prognostic group. Thus, pathologists and urologists can use RMB to select patients with tumours at a reduced risk of progression, which can be safely managed with active surveillance within a tailored imaging schedule, versus tumours for which ablation or surgical intervention is indicated. RMB is also crucial in the oncological setting to distinguish between different high-grade tumours and guide tailored management strategies.

### Biopsy of a renal mass: where are we now? [^111TrQk2]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the most recent literature concerning renal mass biopsy with special consideration to three points: variation in results related to the standard used as comparison, biopsy in small renal masses (up to 4 cm in diameter) and the case for nondiagnostic biopsy.

Recent Findings

The overall rate of failed and indeterminate biopsies shows a trend for improvement. However, selection bias and the lack of a uniform index test for comparison preclude a definitive statement. Fine-needle aspiration may equal results of core biopsy, but its role in the diagnostic algorithm is not yet defined. In-vivo accuracy decreases in small renal masses with the same limitations exposed for the overall literature on renal mass biopsy. When nondiagnostic biopsies are considered, there is a need for standardization of the nomenclature in order to compare results. Re-biopsies or surgery after a nondiagnostic biopsy shows malignancy in up to 75% of the cases of renal cell carcinoma.

Summary

There is a trend in increasing interest and accuracy on the subject of percutaneous biopsy of renal masses as well as a decreasing trend in the rate of nondiagnostic biopsies. In the small renal masses, most likely to be benign, a diagnostic percutaneous biopsy may have a definitive role. However, the higher rate of nondiagnostic results in this population calls for prospective studies with standard definitions and when possible homogenous index test to properly assess the diagnostic performance of the biopsy.

### The current role of renal mass biopsy [^113ZRXz3]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal masses are increasingly detected incidentally on abdominal imaging. Upon discovery, dedicated renal imaging, typically multiphasic computed tomography or MR imaging, is performed for characterization. Noninvasive risk-stratification systems, such as the Bosniak classification for cystic masses and the clear cell likelihood score for solid masses, continue to improve characterization. Despite these improvements in imaging, management dilemmas persist. These challenges arise from the limitations in specificity of imaging and the often indolent behavior of small renal masses. This review outlines the techniques of renal mass biopsy and discusses key clinical scenarios where biopsy findings inform management.

### Renal mass biopsy – a renaissance? [^113A9YTH]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Advances in our understanding of the natural history and limited aggressive potential of many small renal masses, expanding treatment options and the integration of molecular factors into prognostic and therapeutic algorithms have stimulated renewed interest in percutaneous renal mass biopsy.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature review was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed to evaluate the indications, techniques, complications and efficacy of renal mass biopsy.

Results

Reported techniques of renal mass biopsy vary widely with different modes of radiographic guidance, needle size, number of cores and pathological analyses. Percutaneous renal mass biopsy with 2 or 3 cores using 18 gauge needles may improve diagnostic accuracy without increasing morbidity. Serious complications of percutaneous biopsy are rare and the minor complication rate in recent series has been less than 5%. The reported rate of technical failure of renal mass biopsy due to insufficient material was about 9% before 2001 and 5% in more recent studies. The likelihood of indeterminate or inaccurate pathological findings has decreased from 10% to 4% when comparing clinical studies before and since 2001. Currently a total success rate of greater than 90% is attainable using renal mass biopsy with standard histopathological analysis. Recent studies demonstrated that combining immunohistochemical and molecular analyses may further improve renal mass biopsy accuracy.

Conclusions

Research on expanded analysis of percutaneous renal mass biopsy specimens should remain a top priority. Enhanced renal mass biopsy should not change treatment in most patients with small renal masses, who should be treated with surgical excision. However, future clinical algorithms will likely incorporate enhanced biopsy in situations in which decision making is more challenging.

### Patient information: renal cell carcinoma… [^113ACvP1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Risk factors for renal cell carcinoma include high blood pressure, smoking, kidney disease, environmental exposures to heavy metals or industrial solvents, obesity, and certain hereditary cancer disorders. Renal cell carcinoma symptoms may include pain in 1 side of the body between the ribs and waist, an abdominal mass, and blood in the urine. However, only 10% of patients with renal cell carcinoma have all 3 of these symptoms. Other signs and symptoms of renal cell carcinoma may include fever, elevated blood calcium levels, anemia, increased platelet count, and a high concentration of red blood cells. For many patients, renal cell carcinoma is detected during an abdominal imaging study such as an ultrasound or computed tomography scan that was performed for another reason. Individuals with symptoms characteristic of renal cell carcinoma should undergo an abdominal CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging.

Patients diagnosed with a kidney mass should be referred to a urologist for further evaluation and treatment. First-line treatment for renal cell carcinoma confined to the kidney is surgery to remove part or all of the kidney, followed by treatment with the medication pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, that is prescribed after surgery in some patients. Another treatment option for small masses is active surveillance, which involves monitoring of the tumor with ultrasound or abdominal CT at intervals of 3 months, then every 6 months for up to 3 years, then yearly. If the tumor grows during surveillance, patients may undergo surgery to remove part or all of the kidney, ablation therapy, or radiation precisely targeted at the tumor. Ablation therapy may also be an alternative to surgery for patients with small renal cell tumors who are considered to have a high risk of complications from surgery.

Patients with renal cell carcinoma that has spread beyond the kidney are treated with medications, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients with early-stage renal cell carcinoma who undergo partial or total kidney removal have a 5-year survival rate of more than 94%. Average 5-year survival rates are 90% for stage II renal cell carcinoma and 63% to 78% for stage III. Although the survival rate of stage IV renal cell carcinoma varies among individuals, the average 5-year survival is 28%.

### Small renal masses: risk prediction and contemporary management [^111WdjRK]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The majority of kidney cancer tumors are small renal masses (SRMs). Partial nephrectomy is now established as the preferred treatment modality. In some patients the potential morbidity may outweigh the oncologic risk. Based on active surveillance studies, restriction of radical therapy to patients with aggressive tumors has been proposed. This has spurred renewed interest in development of radiologic and biopsy-based diagnostic techniques that can identify high-risk disease. This article discusses the natural history and pathologic features of SRMs, the evolving role of biopsy, and provides an overview of outcomes of various treatment approaches and current recommendations for management.

### Histologic diagnosis of renal mass biopsy [^1172ooCK]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Core biopsy has been increasingly used for clinical decision-making in the management of patients with renal masses. The sensitivity and specificity of histologic diagnoses of renal mass biopsies depend on many factors such as adequate sampling and tissue processing, diagnostic skill and experience, and appropriate use of ancillary techniques.

Objective —

To review the indications, emphasize the importance of obtaining adequate diagnostic material, and introduce a general diagnostic approach, in conjunction with immunohistochemistry, in diagnosis of renal mass biopsies.

Data Sources —

Literature review and personal experiences in daily practice and consultation diagnosis of renal masses in a large tertiary medical center.

Conclusions —

For renal mass biopsies, it is critical to obtain adequate diagnostic material and establish a standard laboratory procedure in working with small biopsy specimens. The key for the diagnosis is to be familiar with different tumor entities with characteristic morphology and to understand the wide spectrum of tumor heterogeneity. By developing a systematic approach, one can categorize the tumor and create a sensible differential diagnosis based on the growth pattern and cellular morphology. Immunohistochemistry is particularly helpful for renal mass biopsy diagnosis in selected situations.

### Renal mass biopsy [^116aNMVr]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Kidney cancer accounts for 2% of cancer related deaths. Historically, a patient with a solid renal mass would undergo surgery without biopsy given the previously low diagnostic yield of biopsy and the fear of tumor seeding. This led to a high rate of resection for benign masses. With the rising incidence of renal masses discovered on imaging, improvements in biopsy technique and advancements in pathologic evaluation of biopsy samples of renal masses, renal mass biopsy now plays an important role in selected patients with renal masses. Coaxial core needle biopsy is the preferred technique with a low rate of complications and a high diagnostic yield. This article will discuss indications, methods, utility, limitations and complications of renal mass biopsy.

### Optimal management of small renal masses [^113BByod]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of small renal masses is increasing. Limited data suggest that although most are malignant, they are also likely to show indolent behavior. The tendency of these tumors to occur in older patient populations with multiple comorbidities raises important issues. Retrospective and prospective studies suggest that a substantial proportion of these small renal masses can be observed without compromising the opportunity for cure or subjecting patients to invasive procedures that might impact negatively on quality of life. Less-invasive treatment modalities, including partial nephrectomy and energy ablation techniques, provide multiple options for some patients. This article reviews selected aspects of the management of small renal masses, including their natural history, imaging, diagnostic biopsies, and treatment options.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^1167QRxh]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

The increased diagnosis of small renal masses (SRMs) poses the challenge of how best to manage patients with tumours that are not likely to progress and cause death during their lifetime. Concerns regarding overdiagnosis and overtreatment of patients with low-risk or indolent disease has led to the introduction of active surveillance as an alternative to immediate intervention in select candidates. However, differentiating between benign or low-grade lesions and high-grade aggressive phenotypes is difficult. Renal biopsy, radiographic assessment, and clinical nomograms have been used before surgery to evaluate the probability of whether an SRM will exhibit characteristics of an aggressive cancer. SRM growth trends have been studied over periods of observation but no characteristics have been found to correlate with aggressive growth kinetics. Stratification of patients with SRMs according to risk status is crucial when considering whether active surveillance might be an appropriate treatment option. Factors that should be taken into account include comorbidities, a history of malignancy, pre-existing chronic kidney disease, life expectancy and patient preference. Standardized active surveillance protocols are currently lacking, and clinical trials designed to randomize patients with SRMs to receive either active surveillance or immediate treatment are sorely needed to address the existing evidence gap.

### The evolving role of percutaneous biopsy in renal masses [^113XWjig]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current literature concerning the role of biopsy for renal masses.

Recent Findings

Improvements in biopsy techniques lead to a redefinition of the role of renal mass biopsy (RMB). Additionally, several studies highlighted the safety, high diagnostic accuracy, and very low rate of clinically relevant complications of RMB. As the knowledge about the nature of renal masses has expanded, and management options for small renal masses are increasing, the current indications for RMB and its role for the management of small renal masses are also expanding.

Summary

The future role of RMB will be influenced by the combination of pathological, molecular, and genetic information that will, heighten and improve our knowledge about these lesions and set the stage for risk-adapted personalized medicine.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^111oCjmq]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Follow-up after intervention — proposed guidelines for renal cancer attempt to provide a risk-based approach to surveillance and monitoring, yet few high-quality studies currently exist to help formulate surveillance regimens and many of the Panel's recommendations are based primarily on expert opinion; any cancer surveillance regimen is described as a balancing act including the likelihood of recurrence at various sites, temporal considerations, potential benefits and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions based on timing of detection, improvements in diagnostic and initial interventions, patient characteristics, and the burden and cost of monitoring; as electronic medical records and quality and safety initiatives increase, tracking outcomes will become increasingly codified and more usable for research purposes, and these data can inform the proper sequencing, timing, duration, and type of follow-up to improve outcomes with the most parsimonious monitoring.

### The evolving management of small renal masses [^116uvgdJ]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Small renal masses (SRMs) are a heterogeneous group of tumours with varying metastatic potential. The increasing use and improving quality of abdominal imaging have led to increasingly early diagnosis of incidental SRMs that are asymptomatic and organ confined. Despite improvements in imaging and the growing use of renal mass biopsy, diagnosis of malignancy before treatment remains challenging. Management of SRMs has shifted away from radical nephrectomy, with active surveillance and nephron-sparing surgery taking over as the primary modalities of treatment. The optimal treatment strategy for SRMs continues to evolve as factors affecting short-term and long-term outcomes in this patient cohort are elucidated through studies from prospective data registries. Evidence from rapidly evolving research in biomarkers, imaging modalities, and machine learning shows promise in improving understanding of the biology and management of this patient cohort.

### Percutaneous renal biopsy: approach, diagnostic accuracy and risks [^1171EndT]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article provides a review of recent advances and issues regarding the controversial topic of renal mass biopsy (RMB). The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current status of renal biopsy based on recently published literature. Here, we particularly focus on articles that have been published within the last 12 months.

Recent Findings

The main topics covered in this review are the approach, diagnostic accuracy and risks related to RMB.

Summary

Current literature suggests that improvements in both technique and technological advancements of RMB have led to greater diagnostic accuracy and low risks to the patient. Newer technologies are leading toward innovative and harmless ways to diagnose kidney cancer, including liquid and image-based biopsy. However, it appears that the question of whether or not to instate renal biopsy as standard clinical practice has remained a highly debated controversy.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^116c8cz4]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Renal mass biopsy (RMB) limitations and negative results include that the non-diagnostic rate of RMB is approximately 14%, which can be substantially reduced with repeat biopsy; in a systematic review, the NPV was 63% and among patients undergoing extirpation despite a negative biopsy, 37% had malignant disease on final surgical pathology; the accuracy of tumor grade diagnosis with RMB is highly variable, ranging from 52–76% in the literature, and Sixteen percent (16%) of tumors were upgraded from low-grade to high-grade at surgical pathology; this is particularly pertinent for patients with small renal masses, where 80–90% of tumors are low-grade.

### Surveillance of small renal masses [^112yrURT]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The widespread utilization of imaging has led to an increasing incidence of small renal masses (SRMs). However, at least 20% are benign. Nevertheless, nephron-sparing surgery is the standard treatment for SRMs without pretreatment characterization with biopsy. Elderly patients and patients with multiple comorbidities and limited life expectancy may safely be managed with active surveillance with low risk of disease progression and mortality. An initial period of observation to determine tumor growth kinetics is safe and appropriate in select candidates. Renal tumor biopsy is accurate, safe and should be considered for SRMs prior to finalizing treatment plans.

Renal mass biopsy (RMB) counseling and safety emphasize that RMB is generally safe with low risk of significant complications (bleeding) and no reported cases of tumor seeding using contemporary techniques, and that a diagnosis of malignancy or RCC on RMB is highly reliable; potential limitations include that a benign lesion must be distinguished from a non-diagnostic biopsy (renal parenchyma or connective tissues), a benign biopsy may not always correlate with resected histology, grading of tumor from RMB compared with resected tissue is imperfect, oncocytic neoplasms may represent a diagnostic dilemma, and biopsy or aspiration of cystic renal masses is generally not advised due to concerns regarding tumor spillage and a high likelihood of obtaining a non-informative result due to sampling error.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 Kidney cancer — diagnostic imaging, biopsy, and genetic evaluation: For a central renal mass suspicious for urothelial carcinoma, urine cytology, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous mass biopsy should be considered. Bone scan is not routinely performed unless there is elevated serum alkaline phosphatase or bone pain, and brain MRI can be obtained when clinical signs or symptoms suggest brain metastases. Because abdominal imaging provides high diagnostic accuracy, a needle biopsy is not always necessary before surgery, but may be considered to establish renal cell carcinoma (RCC) diagnosis and to guide active surveillance; biopsy should be performed prior to or at the time of radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, or radiation therapy, and should also be considered for central lesions or homogeneous renal parenchymal infiltration to rule out urothelial carcinoma or lymphoma. The value of PET remains to be determined, and currently PET or PET/CT is not an imaging tool that is recommended to diagnose kidney cancer or to follow for evidence of relapse after nephrectomy. Patients with multiple renal masses, those ≤ 46 years of age at diagnosis, or those with a family history of RCC should consider genetic evaluation.

### Current management of small renal masses, including patient selection, renal tumor biopsy, active surveillance, and thermal ablation [^111eJDYk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Renal cancer represents 2% to 3% of all cancers, and its incidence is rising. The increased use of ultrasonography and cross-sectional imaging has resulted in the clinical dilemma of incidentally detected small renal masses (SRMs). SRMs represent a heterogeneous group of tumors that span the full spectrum of metastatic potential, including benign, indolent, and more aggressive tumors. Currently, no composite model or biomarker exists that accurately predicts the diagnosis of kidney cancer before treatment selection, and the use of renal mass biopsy remains controversial. The management of SRMs has changed dramatically over the last two decades as our understanding of tumor biology and competing risks of mortality in this population has improved. In this review, we critically assess published consensus guidelines and recent literature on the diagnosis and management of SRMs, with a focus on patient treatment selection and use of renal mass biopsy, active surveillance, and thermal ablation. Finally, we highlight important opportunities for leveraging recent research discoveries to identify patients with SRMs at high risk for renal cell carcinoma-related mortality and minimize overtreatment and patient morbidity.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^1124RiGr]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most renal masses in the United States are incidentally detected via abdominal imaging. This has led to an increase in the incidence of small renal masses (≤ 4 cm). Active surveillance is, an oncologically safe option in slow growing and indolent tumors in other organs and has recently become more widely studied in small renal masses. For selected patients, particularly those who harbor significant comorbidities, active surveillance is a safe option for small renal masses. Renal biopsy may be helpful in the decision making process, but remains an optional component for the active surveillance of small renal masses.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^112EY2hj]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma [RCC]) — diagnostic workup states that a central renal mass may suggest urothelial carcinoma; if so, urine cytology, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous mass biopsy should be considered. Most bone and brain metastases are symptomatic at diagnosis; therefore, a bone scan is not routinely performed unless the patient has an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase or bone pain, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can be performed if clinical signs, presentation, and symptoms suggest brain metastases. The recommended abdominal imaging studies provide high diagnostic accuracy; therefore, a needle biopsy is not always necessary before surgery, especially when imaging is consistent with RCC, although needle biopsy may be considered to establish the diagnosis and to guide active surveillance strategies. Biopsy should be performed prior to or at the time of radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, or radiation therapy to confirm diagnosis and to guide surveillance strategies, and should also be considered if a central lesion or homogeneous infiltration of renal parenchyma is observed on scans to rule out urothelial carcinoma or lymphoma, respectively. The value of PET in RCC remains to be determined, and currently PET or PET/CT is not an imaging tool that is recommended to diagnose kidney cancer or to follow for evidence of relapse after nephrectomy. If patients present with multiple renal masses, are ≤ 46 years of age at diagnosis, or have a family history of RCC, they should consider genetic evaluation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria indeterminate renal mass [^1154taUL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Renal masses are increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals as incidental findings. An indeterminate renal mass is one that cannot be diagnosed confidently as benign or malignant at the time it is discovered. CT, ultrasonography, and MRI of renal masses with fast-scan techniques and intravenous (IV) contrast are the mainstays of evaluation. Dual-energy CT, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, PET/CT, and percutaneous biopsy are all technologies that are gaining traction in the characterization of the indeterminate renal mass. In cases in which IV contrast cannot be used, whether because of IV contrast allergy or renal insufficiency, renal mass classification with CT is markedly limited. In the absence of IV contrast, ultrasonography, MRI, and biopsy have some advantages. Owing to the low malignant and metastatic potential of small renal cell carcinomas (≤ 4 cm in diameter), active surveillance is additionally emerging as a diagnostic strategy for patients who have high surgical risk or limited life expectancy. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and application by the panel of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^116fLQzw]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Active surveillance (AS) imaging — frequency, modalities, and biopsy: Patients with no prior imaging should have surveillance imaging initially every 3 to 6 months to assess for interval growth and other changes in a small renal mass. The preferred modality is not well established, but initial imaging should preferably consist of contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, after which subsequent imaging may include the same or when appropriate an abdominal ultrasound (US) can be substituted. Abdominal US (as opposed to retroperitoneal US) may have the additional benefit of a survey of the intraabdominal organs for progression, and differences in tumor dimension measurements between these different modalities may be significant and should be interpreted with caution when making treatment decisions. For risk stratification during AS, renal mass biopsy (RMB) can be considered for additional risk stratification for patients with solid masses on AS, whereas for patients with predominantly cystic lesions, RMB should be avoided.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^111yf8ga]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — follow-up after intervention: Clinicians coordinating follow-up for patients who have undergone intervention for a renal mass should recognize the importance of pathologic findings, including tumor stage, grade, and histology including the risks of recurrence and possible sequelae of treatment; patients with pathologically-proven benign renal masses should undergo occasional clinical evaluation and laboratory testing for sequelae of treatment but most do not require routine periodic imaging (Expert Opinion). After intervention, providers should discuss with patients the information available on the pathology report, including tumor histology, stage, grade, and surgical margin status, as well as risk of recurrence based on established nomograms/calculators, and post-procedural renal function and nephrology referral should be discussed, as needed. Given the reduced oncologic potential, routine postoperative imaging is not required in most patients after surgical treatment for a benign renal mass; however, such patients should undergo at least one postoperative visit to assess patient recovery and laboratory testing to assess renal function, with ongoing surveillance for adverse sequelae of treatment selectively, and patients who have only had a biopsy without definitive management may carry a small risk of a missed malignancy and should be considered for attenuated surveillance. Patients with treated malignant renal masses should undergo periodic medical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging directed at detecting signs and symptoms of metastatic spread and/or local recurrence as well as evaluation for possible sequelae of treatment (Clinical Principle).

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^1171wm6f]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) renal mass guideline — recommendation strength and evidence grades are defined as follows: "Strong Recommendations are directive statements that an action should (benefits outweigh risks/burdens) or should not (risks/burdens outweigh benefits) be undertaken because net benefit or net harm is substantial". "Moderate Recommendations are directive statements that an action should (benefits outweigh risks/burdens) or should not (risks/burdens outweigh benefits) be undertaken because net benefit or net harm is moderate". "Conditional Recommendations are non-directive statements used when the evidence indicates that there is no apparent net benefit or harm or when the balance between benefits and risks/burden is unclear". Evidence grades specify confidence: "Body of evidence strength Grade A in support of a Strong Recommendation indicates that the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances and that future research is unlikely to change confidence". "Body of evidence strength Grade B in support of a Strong or Moderate Recommendation indicates that the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances but that better evidence could change confidence". "Body of evidence strength Grade C in support of a Strong or Moderate Recommendation indicates that the statement can be applied to most patients in most circumstances but that better evidence is likely to change confidence". For Conditional Recommendations specifically, "When body of evidence strength Grade A, the statement indicates that benefits and risks/burdens appear balanced, and the best action depends on patient circumstances", "When body of evidence strength Grade B, benefits and risks/burdens appear balanced, the best action also depends on individual patient circumstances and better evidence could change confidence", and "When body of evidence strength Grade C is used, there is uncertainty regarding the balance between benefits and risks/burdens, alternative strategies are likely to be equally reasonable, and better evidence is likely to change confidence". The guideline also defines consensus tools: "A Clinical Principle is a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature", and "Expert Opinion refers to a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there is no evidence".

### Update on indications for percutaneous renal mass biopsy in the era of advanced CT and MRI [^111YLA4j]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2019). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The objective of this article is to review the burgeoning role of percutaneous renal mass biopsy (RMB). CONCLUSION. Percutaneous RMB is safe, accurate, and indicated for an expanded list of clinical scenarios. The chief scenarios among them are to prevent treatment of benign masses and help select patients for active surveillance (AS). Imaging characterization of renal masses has improved; however, management decisions often depend on a histologic diagnosis and an assessment of biologic behavior of renal cancers, both of which are currently best achieved with RMB.

### A review of the recommendations and strength of evidence for clinical practice guidelines on the management of small renal masses [^111gRFuo]. Journal of Endourology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction: With the rise in the detection of incidental small renal masses (SRM), the management paradigm for these patients has become an issue of increasing concern. We aim to identify areas of consensus, controversy, and opportunities for improvement among recently published guidelines and assess the strength of evidence for the management of SRMs. Methods: We reviewed practice guidelines for SRMs promulgated by the American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology. Levels of evidence and strength of recommendations for evaluation, management and follow-up were analyzed with regard to consensus, conflict, and neglect. Results: There is consensus among guidelines for the initial evaluation and treatment of SRMs; however, discrepancies exist with regard to indications for active surveillance, thermal ablation, and timing/method of follow-up after treatment. Routine renal mass biopsy is not recommended by any guideline. Overwhelmingly, guideline statements are based on low to moderate levels of evidence; only 23% of the reviewed guidelines were based on high-level evidence, 38% based on moderate-level, and 39% on low-level evidence or expert opinion. Conclusions: Despite all six guidelines sharing a consensus on most management topics regarding SRMs, the ongoing lack of high-level evidence precludes gold standard recommendations in the areas of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. More high-quality studies are needed to develop a stronger, data-supported universal guideline for the management of SRMs.

### Risk assessment in small renal masses: a review article [^111QmGbY]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been steadily increasing, in large part because of the increased use of imaging. Optimizing the management of localized RCC has become one of the leading priorities and foremost challenges within the urologic-oncologic community. Adequate risk stratification of patients following the diagnosis of localized RCC has become meaningful in deciding whether to treat, how to treat, and how intensively to treat. This article characterizes the existing risk assessment models that can be useful as treatment decision aids for patients with localized RCC.

### Percutaneous kidney biopsy for a small renal mass: a critical appraisal of results [^115BnagD]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We report the diagnostic accuracy of renal mass biopsy for a small renal mass (4 cm or less) and identify predictors of successful renal mass biopsy in a contemporary cohort of patients from 2 large tertiary referral centers.

Materials and Methods

A total of 442 biopsies of renal tumors 4 cm or less at 2 tertiary centers between 2008 and 2015 were included in study. Biopsy outcomes (malignant, benign or nondiagnostic) and concordance rates between renal mass biopsy and final surgical pathology were determined. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors indicative of nondiagnostic biopsy.

Results

The initial biopsy was diagnostic in 393 cases (88.9%) and nondiagnostic in 49 (11.1%). Of diagnostic biopsies 76% revealed renal cell carcinoma and 24% were benign. Renal cell carcinoma histological subtyping and grading was possible in 90.2% and 31.3% of cases, respectively. A second biopsy was performed in 11 of the 49 nondiagnostic cases and a diagnosis was possible in 100%, including renal cell carcinoma in 10 and oncocytoma in 1. Small tumor size, cystic nature of tumors and biopsy during the initial years of the study were independent predictors of nondiagnostic biopsy. The rates of accuracy in identifying malignancies, histiotyping and 2-tier grading between renal mass biopsy and surgical pathology were 97.1%, 95.1% and 68.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

Renal mass biopsy for a small renal mass can be performed accurately. Nondiagnostic renal mass biopsy was common for smaller masses and cystic masses, and during the initial years of the study. A second biopsy should be considered in nondiagnostic biopsy cases.

### Management of the small renal mass: a 2020 update [^1128hiEK]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Small renal masses (≤ cT1a, less than 4 cm) are a subset of renal tumors with low malignant and metastatic potential but increasing incidence given increased use of cross-sectional imaging. Here, we review the diagnostic and treatment options available for the lesions.

Recent Findings

While the low metastatic potential of SRMs has been known, recent studies show that 30% of SRMs removed surgically are benign. Renal biopsy is a tool that can be implemented to help with diagnosis before treatment (options of which include active surveillance, ablation, and surgery). Active surveillance might be associated with worse cancer-specific survival but all interventional methods appear to fare similarly. Advancements have also been made in percutaneous ablation techniques, and they now are included on multiple guideline statements. Active surveillance, surgery (PN and RN), and thermal ablation are all treatment options for SRMs with similar outcomes but varying side effects.

### Roles for active surveillance in renal cancer [^112qkngn]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

With this review, we describe the most recent advances in active surveillance as well as diagnosis and management of small renal masses (SRMs).

Recent Findings

We discuss diagnosis, differentiation of solid from cystic lesions, risk prediction and treatment of the SRM. A better understanding of the disease facilitates the use of more conservatory treatments, such as active surveillance. Active surveillance has been increasingly accepted not only for SRM, but also for larger tumors and even metastatic patients. Exiting advances in risk prediction will help us define which patients can be safely managed with active surveillance and which require immediate treatment. Meanwhile, the use of renal tumor biopsies is still an important tool for these cases.

Summary

Active surveillance is an option for many patients with renal masses. Noninvasive methods for diagnosis and risk prediction are being developed, but meanwhile, renal tumor biopsy is a useful tool. A better understanding of the disease increases the number of patients who can undergo active surveillance fully certain of the safety of their management.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part II [^111ifB2D]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This AUA Guideline focuses on active surveillance (AS) and follow-up after intervention for adult patients with clinically-localized renal masses suspicious for cancer, including solid enhancing tumors and Bosniak 3/4 complex cystic lesions.

Materials and Methods

In January 2021, the Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer guideline underwent additional amendment based on a current literature-search. This literature search retrieved additional studies published between July 2016 to October 2020 using the same Key Questions and search criteria from the Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned strength-rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1[Table: see text]).

Results

AS with potential delayed intervention should be considered for patients with solid, enhancing renal masses < 2cm or Bosniak 3–4 lesions that are predominantly-cystic. Shared decision-making about AS should consider risks of intervention/competing mortality versus the potential oncologic benefits of intervention. Recommendations for renal mass biopsy and considerations for periodic clinical/imaging-based surveillance are discussed. After intervention, risk-based surveillance protocols are defined incorporating clinical/laboratory evaluation and abdominal/chest imaging designed to detect local/systemic recurrences and possible treatment-related sequelae, such as progressive renal-insufficiency.

Conclusion

AS is a potential management strategy for some patients with clinically-localized renal masses that requires careful risk-assessment, shared decision-making and periodic-reassessment. Follow-up after intervention is designed to identify local/systemic recurrences and potential treatment-related sequelae. A risk-based approach should be prioritized with selective use of laboratory/imaging resources.

### Pretreatment diagnosis of the small renal mass: status of renal biopsy in the United States of America [^112sTQPo]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

We surveyed United States of America-based urologists to characterize practice patterns and indications to perform a renal mass biopsy for small renal masses.

Materials and Methods

Members of the American Urological Association who practice in the United States were invited to participate in a 11-question web-based survey that was distributed via SurveyMonkey ® from December 2016 to January 2017.

Results

There were 1131 respondents. The respondents equally represented all regions of the United States; the majority were in private practice. Overall, 32% of American urologists would "never" perform a biopsy of a renal mass ≤ 4cm. Those who saw fewer than five small renal masses per year were more likely to "never" perform a renal biopsy on either a renal mass ≤ 4cm or a renal mass 2-3cm compared with those who saw more than five small renal masses per year (p < 0.001). Urologists who practiced at an academic hospital were more likely to perform a renal biopsy on both a renal mass ≤ 4cm and a renal mass 2-3cm compared with private practice and government-based urologists (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008 respectively). The primary reason for not performing a biopsy, cited by 68% of responding urologists, was that the results of a biopsy "would not change their management of the renal mass". Respondents independently performed only 2% of biopsies; however, almost half stated that they would be interested in learning office-based ultrasound-guided biopsy of a small renal mass.

Conclusions

Among members of the American Urological Association, biopsy of a small renal mass remains an underutilized diagnostic procedure, especially in light of 6000 unnecessary surgeries annually; nonuniversity-based urologists and those who see < 5 renal mass cases each year infrequently perform a biopsy. Currently, interventional radiologists perform almost all small renal mass biopsies.

Regarding medical management for renal cysts, more specifically with respect to expectant management, Bosniak III-IV, AUA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider renal mass biopsy for further oncologic risk stratification in patients with a Bosniak III or IV complex cystic renal mass with an equivocal risk/benefit ratio for treatment electing active surveillance. Obtain repeat cross-sectional imaging approximately 3–6 months later to assess for interval growth. Consider deciding on periodic clinical/imaging surveillance based on growth rate and shared decision-making with offering intervention if substantial interval growth is observed or if other clinical/imaging findings suggest that the risk/benefit analysis is no longer equivocal or favorable for continued active surveillance.

NCCN Kidney Cancer — Stage I follow-up during active surveillance includes history and physical (H&P) annually and laboratory tests annually, as clinically indicated. Abdomen imaging specifies abdomen computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) both with and without IV contrast within 6 months of surveillance initiation, then CT, MRI, or ultrasound (US) at least annually. Chest imaging uses chest x-ray or CT at baseline and annually as clinically indicated to assess for pulmonary metastases, and consider repeat chest imaging if intervention is being contemplated. Consider renal mass biopsy at initiation of active surveillance or at follow-up, as clinically indicated, and follow-up may be individualized based on surgical status, treatment schedules, side effects, comorbidities, and symptoms.

### Should renal mass biopsy Be performed prior to or concomitantly with thermal ablation? [^112Vi3W9]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine diagnostic yield of renal biopsies performed in patients referred for image-guided tumor ablation (IGTA) and the frequency with which biopsy results would have obviated the need for subsequent ablation.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of an internal ablation database of a single institution revealed 401 consecutive percutaneous renal mass IGTAs performed from April 2000 to April 2015. Of 401 ablations, 32 were excluded, yielding 369 ablation events in 342 patients, which represented the study cohort. Patients were subdivided into groups according to whether or not biopsy was performed. Lesions were categorized according to size, malignancy/benignity, and pathology.

Results

IGTA was performed with biopsy for 317/369 (85.9%) and without biopsy for 52/369 (14.1%) lesions. Overall diagnostic yield for percutaneous biopsy was 94.3% (299/317). Based on biopsy results, 82.6% (262/317) were classified as malignant or suspicious, 9.5% (30/317) were classified as likely benign, and 2.2% (7/317) were classified as definitively benign. Only definitively benign lesions were designated as obviating the need for IGTA. IGTA was supported by biopsy results in the remaining 97.8% (310/317), including renal cell carcinomas, oncocytic neoplasms, metastases, and nondiagnostic biopsy results.

Conclusions

Biopsy of renal masses with suspicious imaging features rarely (2.2%) obviated the need for IGTA. For patients who have undergone counseling and have elected to forgo active surveillance and surgical options, biopsy can safely be performed concomitantly with ablation.

Renal mass biopsy (RMB) — patient counseling, safety profile, and antithrombotic management are specified: When considering the utility of RMB, patients should be counseled regarding rationale, positive and negative predictive values, potential risks and non-diagnostic rates of RMB. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). RMB is an important diagnostic adjunct for selected patients with renal masses suspicious for localized renal cancer, and patients should understand that RMB is generally a safe diagnostic test, with the risk of complications low and the most common being renal hematoma (4.9%), clinically significant hematoma (1.2%), gross hematuria (1.0%), pneumothorax (0.6%), hemorrhage requiring transfusion (0.4%). While the risk of post-procedure hemorrhage is small, these risks may be amplified by aspirin, NSAIA, second or third generation antiplatelet agents (i.e., dipyridamole, clopidogrel), vitamin K factor X inhibitors (i.e., warfarin, apixaban), and low molecular weight heparin (i.e., enoxaparin), and prior discontinuation of these agents is advised if the risk/benefit ratio allows.

### The cost-effectiveness of immediate treatment, percutaneous biopsy and active surveillance for the diagnosis of the small solid renal mass: evidence from a Markov model [^117Brr39]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The most effective diagnostic strategy for the very small, incidentally detected solid renal mass is uncertain. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding percutaneous biopsy or active surveillance to the diagnosis of a 2 cm or less solid renal mass.

Materials and Methods

A Markov state transition model was developed to observe a hypothetical cohort of healthy 60-year-old men with an incidentally detected, 2 or less cm solid renal mass, comparing percutaneous biopsy, immediate treatment and active surveillance. The primary outcomes assessed were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio measured by cost per life-year gained at a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000. Model results were assessed by sensitivity analysis.

Results

Immediate treatment was the highest cost, most effective diagnostic strategy, providing the longest overall survival of 18.53 life-years. Active surveillance was the lowest cost, least effective diagnostic strategy. On cost-effectiveness analysis using a societal willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 active surveillance was the preferred choice at a $75,000 willingness to pay threshold while biopsy and treatment were acceptable ($56,644 and $70,149 per life-year, respectively). When analysis was adjusted for quality of life, biopsy dominated immediate treatment as the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy at $33,840 per quality adjusted life-year gained.

Conclusions

Percutaneous biopsy may have a greater role in optimizing the diagnosis of an incidentally detected, 2 cm or less solid renal mass.

### Diagnostic accuracy and risks of biopsy in the diagnosis of a renal mass suspicious for localized renal cell carcinoma: systematic review of the literature [^113soM8B]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Clinical practice varies widely on the diagnostic role of biopsy for clinically localized renal masses suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of the available literature to quantify the accuracy and rate of adverse events of renal mass biopsy.

Materials and Methods

MEDLINE®, Embase® and the Cochrane databases were searched (January 1997 to May 2015) for relevant studies. The systematic review process established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was followed. Nondiagnostic biopsies were excluded from diagnostic accuracy calculations.

Results

A total of 20 studies with 2,979 patients and 3,113 biopsies were included in the study. The overall nondiagnostic rate was 14.1% with 90.4% of those undergoing surgery found to have malignancy. Repeat biopsy led to diagnosis in 80% of patients. The false-positive rate was low (4.0%), histological and renal cell carcinoma subtype concordance was substantial, and Fuhrman upgrading notable (16%) from low grade (1 to 2) to high grade (3 to 4). Core biopsy was highly sensitive (97.5%, CI 96.5–98.5) and specific (96.2%, CI 90.7–100) when a diagnostic result was obtained, but most patients (∼80%) did not undergo surgery after a benign biopsy. Among patients undergoing extirpation 36.7% with a negative biopsy had malignant disease on surgical pathology (negative predictive value 63.3%, CI 52.4–74.2). Direct complications included hematoma (4.9%), clinically significant pain (1.2%), gross hematuria (1.0%), pneumothorax (0.6%) and hemorrhage (0.4%).

Conclusions

Diagnostic accuracy was generally high for biopsy of localized renal masses with a low complication rate, but the nondiagnostic rate and negative predictive value were concerning. Renal mass sampling should be used judiciously as further research will determine its true clinical utility.

In this setting, RN is preferred if high tumor complexity makes partial nephrectomy (PN) challenging even in experienced hands, there is no preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) or proteinuria, and the normal contralateral kidney predicts a new baseline eGFR greater than 45 mL/min/1.73 m² even if RN is performed. If all criteria are not met, PN should be considered unless there are overriding concerns about the safety or oncologic efficacy of PN (Expert Opinion).

Active surveillance (AS) intensity and decision support: It is recognized that not all patients on AS will require the same intensity of surveillance as their tumor biology, risk calculations and tradeoffs, and personal objectives may differ, and some patients may therefore require more intensive AS while others require less intensive AS. The decision as to the frequency and type of imaging modality must therefore be customized and informed by robust communication focusing on goals, risks and triggers for intervention, and RMB can be a helpful adjunct to guide these clinical decisions (see statement 10).

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^116TZRjH]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Imaging evaluation and renal mass biopsy — In general, solid renal masses that enhance greater than 15–20 HU with intravenous contrast and do not exhibit fat density should be considered suspicious for RCC. Approximately 5–10% of AML's are fat poor and difficult to identify on imaging. Complex cystic renal masses that have thickened irregular walls or septa in which measurable enhancement is present are classified as Bosniak 3, and approximately 50% of such lesions prove to be malignant on final pathology. Bosniak 4 complex cystic renal masses are very suspicious for malignancy as they contain enhancing soft tissue components and about 75–90% of such lesions prove to be RCC on final pathology. Bone scans should be reserved primarily for patients with bone pain or elevated alkaline phosphatase and brain imaging for those with neurologic symptoms, and PET scan has a very limited role in the routine evaluation or staging of RCC. RMB currently has an adjunctive role in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with renal masses suspicious for renal cancer.

### Evaluating renal masses using image-guided biopsy… [^113Ax4vd]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The use of image-guided biopsy has played a limited role in the evaluation of renal masses. Intervention is based on the appearance of renal masses on imaging tests. Because of this, any renal mass that was labeled as suspicious required surgical intervention. With recent advances in computed tomographic technology, more renal masses are being labeled as suspicious. Wood and associates retrospectively studied the indications, complications and outcomes of image-guided biopsy in patients with renal masses. Seventy-nine image-guided renal mass biopsies were reviewed in this retrospective study of 73 patients. Fifty-seven of the masses were solid, and 22 were complex cystic or mixed cystic/solid masses. The images, histologic findings and clinical features of the masses were reviewed, and management changes from planned surgical intervention were recorded. Patients were followed after the procedure to determine outcome.

A definitive diagnosis was made for 94 percent of the masses after the image-guided renal biopsy. Forty-nine masses were malignant; 25 were negative for any malignancy. Treatment plans changed from surgical intervention to nonsurgical treatment in 44 percent of the patients. No major complications occurred during any of the procedures. The most common indication for image-guided renal mass biopsy was the presence of a solid or complex mass found during imaging studies. The authors conclude that image-guided biopsies are not only safe in patients with solid or complex renal masses, but that this procedure can reduce the number of surgical interventions in these patients. The procedure also is reliable in assisting physicians in the diagnosis of renal masses.

### Active surveillance of small renal masses [^1131iwzt]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal masses: indications for active surveillance

Small renal masses are the ones most indicated to be included in AS. Since SRMs tend to be indolent, with slow growth rates (1–3 mm per year), and are associated with a relatively low risk of metastasis (1–3%). AS is the most adequate treatment approach. Large renal masses (LRM), which are defined as solid localized renal masses greater than 4 cm in size usually corresponding to T1b and T2 RCC, can also be followed by AS, although the more rapid growth (4–8 mm per year) and higher risk of M1 metastasis (4–6%) require that this approach be made with caution.

In the absence of level I evidence, the criteria for patients with SRMs to be eligible to receive AS are difficult to define. In various urologic guidelines, AS is considered to be a treatment option in elderly patients (although none defines a specific cutoff age), as well as in patients with multiple comorbidities and a limited life expectancy or with high perioperative morbid-mortality risk. AS is also considered in chronic kidney disease or individual kidney patients in whom an observation period can be considered. Only the recent American Urology Association (AUA) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for SRMs provide an in-depth description of the indications of AS.

According to the 2017 AUA guidelines:
AS is an option for initial management in patients with renal masses suspicious for cancer, especially those smaller than 2 cm.
AS or expectant management should be a priority when the anticipated risk of intervention or competing risks of death outweigh the potential oncologic benefits of active treatment.
When the results of a risk-versus-benefit analysis of the treatment are equivocal and the patient elects to undergo AS.
When the oncologic benefits of intervention outweigh the risks of treatment and competing risks of death, physicians should recommend active treatment. In this setting AS with potential for delayed intervention may be pursued only if the patient understands and is willing to accept the associated oncologic risk.

The ASCO guidelines define the indications of AS as follows:
Absolute indications: high risk for anesthesia and intervention or life expectancy less than 5 years
Relative indications: significant risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if treated, SRM less than 1 cm, or life expectancy less than 10 years

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1136XKmW]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — kidney biopsy for chronic kidney disease states that kidney biopsy is an important part of the investigations for the cause of CKD; many people with CKD would choose to undergo a kidney biopsy, yet some may prefer to decline, so the decision to pursue biopsy should be a shared decision. To optimize benefit and safety, a standardized approach for kidney biopsy with a vetted and standardized operating protocol designed for local implementation is warranted, and because most studies used ultrasound-guided biopsies and higher bleeding rates in older literature were in the absence of guided biopsies, there is a potential for higher rate of harms in 'blind'/unguided biopsies. Evidence appears to confer low risk of harm, supporting our suggestion that kidney biopsies should be considered when they can provide information to identify cause, facilitate prognostication, and inform treatment strategies. Resource constraints may limit access and analysis and may influence whether to perform a biopsy based on expected yield and perceived value. In pediatrics, children and young people with kidney failure are more likely to have a genetic cause than adults and, in some settings, genetic testing may be pursued first, obviating the need for kidney biopsy and the associated risks.

### Diagnostic value of CT-guided biopsy of indeterminate renal masses [^115wxEkX]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the role of percutaneous core biopsies in the diagnosis of renal masses that could not be classified as benign or malignant based upon imaging alone.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analysed core biopsies of indeterminate renal masses of 23 patients who were referred to us for computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy from 1996–2001. Follow-up ranged from 1–5 years. Analysis was based on indications for biopsy, size and characteristics of the lesion and accuracy of biopsy results.

Results

There was one technical failure in 22 patients included in the analysis. Fifteen core biopsies revealed malignancies that were confirmed either clinically or surgically. Seven were benign, one of which was false-negative. The sensitivity was 93%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 75%. The results in tumours ≤ = 3 cm were similar to those in larger lesions.

Conclusions

We recommend the use of core biopsy as a diagnostic tool for indeterminate renal masses, regardless of mass size. Renal core biopsy can influence the management of lesions: primary renal lesions are resected, while treatment for metastatic disease is tailored to the primary tumour. Tumours with benign biopsy results should be re-evaluated and either referred for resection of the mass or followed up closely with clinical observation and of imaging studies.

### Renal cell carcinoma: diagnosis and management… [^115H6kSg]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The management of hypertension and obesity, and the avoidance of tobacco use are the only established methods of primary prevention. IMAGING A contrast-enhanced, triple-phase helical CT scan that images the urinary tract before, during, and after contrast load is the preferred imaging study for evaluating renal masses or persistent microscopic hematuria. 19, 20 CT detects 90% of renal masses, identifies benign and pathologic features, and evaluates surrounding anatomy to detect lymphadenopathy or an associated thrombus. A contrast-enhanced CT scan will also identify benign masses that do not require further testing. Solid tumors are managed according to size. Masses measuring less than 1 cm are observed, and masses greater than 1 cm are usually excised or biopsied. There is an increasing role for renal mass biopsy, instead of partial or radical nephrectomy, because active surveillance is a treatment option for renal cell carcinoma.

23 In select patients, nephron-sparing partial nephrectomy is recommended with a priority of achieving negative surgical margins while preserving nephron mass. Radical nephrectomy is indicated in patients with an increased oncologic risk based on clinical indicators and in patients who plan to undergo targeted pharmaceutical treatment. 12, 23 Lymph node dissection should be performed for staging purposes in patients with clinically concerning regional lymphadenopathy. Adrenalectomy should be performed in patients where imaging and/or intraoperative indications of adrenal invasion are evident. 23 Other options for treatment of renal masses less than 3 cm include thermal ablation, cryoablation, and radiofrequency ablation.

All patients undergoing these treatment options should have a renal mass biopsy performed to allow histologic diagnosis and guide subsequent surveillance. The patient must also understand the increased risk of local recurrence or persistence of the tumor with these treatment options. 12, 23 Active surveillance is an acceptable option in some patients when the renal mass measures less than 2 cm. A plan of active surveillance with repeat imaging every three to six months is acceptable when it is preferred by the patient or when risk of an intervention outweighs the benefits because of complicated comorbidities that decrease life expectancy or increase the risk of death. Renal mass biopsy should be considered for further risk stratification for patients considering active surveillance.

### Management of renal cell carcinoma: promising biomarkers and the challenges to reach the clinic [^114urG31]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The high recurrence rates for some patient groups may be explained by presence of micrometastatic disease prior to surgery, which is undetectable with current imaging modalities.

For patients in the Leibovich "intermediate risk" group (26% of all patients with localized disease), a clinical dilemma exists, because their risk of relapsing is 25%. On one hand this risk is significant, but is it sufficient for offering adjuvant treatment, with the risk of adverse events this carries? Or should we rely on frequent scans? On the contrary, 75% of these patients will never relapse, and are therefore treated unnecessary with either adjuvant therapy or unnecessary and costly scans.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) is known to be closely linked to disease recurrence. Currently, no detection method for MRD is used in the clinic, even though MRD is undetectable with current imaging modalities. However, research of liquid biopsy-based biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), shows promising results for sensitive real-time cancer detection and profiling. Detection of MRD would provide an opportunity of intensified monitoring and early intervention, thus increasing the likelihood of successful treatment.

Small renal masses

Another clinical challenge is how to treat small renal masses (reviewed in ref.). With the number of abdominal imaging increasing in the diagnostic setting, the detection of small renal masses, which are often indolent, is increasing. Thus, there is potential harm derived from overdiagnosis and consequently unnecessary treatment of patients with RCC. This raises the question of how we determine whether a small renal mass is potentially harmful for the patient and thus needs to be removed, or whether a lesion is benign or progressing so slowly that it is not a risk to the patient.

A clinical study is currently evaluating active surveillance of patients with renal masses smaller or equal to 2 cm (NCT03804320) with patients being followed by CT scans every 3 months for the first year, and then annually for up to 5 years. This study is expected to have completed follow-up by the end of 2023, and the results from this study could potentially change the clinical management of small renal masses.

The most optimal treatment of small renal masses might in the future be determined by pretreatment characterization of biopsies. The aim will be to identify the masses with aggressive biology for treatment and spare those with indolent characteristics.

### 2017 AUA renal mass and localized renal cancer guidelines: imaging implications [^116Tkn3B]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common cancer that is increasing in incidence because of the increased prevalence of risk factors, including tobacco use, hypertension, and obesity, and the improved detection of these tumors due to increased use of imaging. Localized renal cancer now accounts for more than 60%-70% of new RCC cases. Renal masses suggestive of cancer include enhancing solid renal lesions and Bosniak III and IV complex cystic lesions. Most of these tumors are detected incidentally, and many are slow growing with little propensity to metastasize. Radiologists have a vital role in evaluation of these tumors and subsequent patient counseling. Options for managing RCC include radical nephrectomy (RN), partial nephrectomy (PN), thermal ablation, and active surveillance. However, historically, the use of these strategies has varied among practices. Improved understanding of the biologic features of these tumors and data indicating the heterogeneous clinical course of many clinically localized renal tumors led to the development of the American Urological Association (AUA) Localized Renal Cancer Panel Guidelines in 2009, and these guidelines were updated in 2017. The format of the updated guidelines has moved from management recommendations based on index patients to individualized decision making, taking into account patient age and comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and important renal function considerations. A distinct role for RN is defined for cases of tumors with increased oncologic potential in patients with a normal contralateral kidney. Beyond this, nephron-sparing options, particularly PN, should be a priority. The updated guidelines also recommend increased use of renal mass biopsy, thermal ablation, and active surveillance in appropriately selected patients. The 2017 AUA guidelines are reviewed, with emphasis on the implications for practicing radiologists. © RSNA, 2018.

### Contemporary management of small renal masses [^111Rqnsy]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Context

An increasing number of small renal masses (SRMs) with heterogeneous histology and clinical behaviour are being detected with modern radiologic imaging. Although surgical removal is the standard of care for small renal tumours, alternative minimally invasive and conservative treatment options are possible in selected patients with shorter life expectancy.

Objective

To systematically review indications, techniques, and outcomes of surgical and conservative treatments of SRMs.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature search of English-language publications was performed using the Medline database from January 2000 to February 2011 using the terms renal mass and renal carcinoma in conjunction with the evaluated management options. The articles that provided the highest level of evidence were selected with the consensus of all the authors and reviewed.

Evidence Synthesis

Only one randomised controlled trial comparing the results of elective nephron-sparing surgery and radical nephrectomy for low-stage renal tumours is available. Few comparative studies of different treatment options for SRMs have been published. The assessment of oncologic outcomes is therefore based mainly on observational studies. Most series of nonsurgical therapies have strong selection biases and relatively short follow-up. Treatment selection is based on the clinical and histologic characteristics of SRMs, on patient age and comorbidities, and on personal preferences and experience of the urologist.

Conclusions

Partial nephrectomy (PN) is the standard treatment for solitary SRMs whenever it is technically feasible. Laparoscopic PN is an alternative to open PN in experienced hands. The rationale of ablative treatments is to treat incidental cortical SRMs in patients at high surgical risk with potentially reduced morbidity. Active surveillance is considered an appropriate strategy for the elderly or for patients with significant comorbidity who have a shorter life expectancy. Percutaneous biopsies are increasingly being used to establish histology of SRMs and support treatment decisions, especially for patients who are candidates for nonsurgical treatment.

A kidney biopsy is an important diagnostic procedure in nephrology and can aid in determining the appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for specific patients. Based upon physical examination, urinalysis and blood tests, physicians attempt to make a clinical diagnosis which is used to guide treatment. This is not always feasible using non-invasive tools, and in such cases a kidney biopsy may need to be performed to confirm or determine the diagnosis, severity, and urgency of therapy.

A kidney biopsy may not always provide information that is needed or pertinent to the clinical scenario. Sometimes an adequate tissue sample of the kidneys cannot be obtained or the information provided from the biopsy fails to shed any light on the patients' symptoms or clinical data. Due to the invasiveness of the procedure, it is important, when recommending a biopsy for an individual patient, to bear in mind not only the risks of the procedure itself but the distinct possibility that it might prove unhelpful in the patient's management.

There are a number of recent studies that have detailed the array of diagnoses obtained from kidney biopsies in adults and children with renal disease. Other reports have assessed the clinical impact that a biopsy may have, but they focused primarily on the risk factors and resulting complications of performing renal biopsies. In this study, we defined a novel system that enabled us to ascertain the usefulness of a particular biopsy by analyzing predictions of the diagnosis pre-biopsy and the physician's treatment decision post biopsy. Using this scheme, we tested the hypothesis that at least 80% of native kidney biopsies provided clinically valuable information that rationally guided the formulation of the patient's prognosis and treatment.

### Is surveillance an option for the treatment of small renal masses? [^116mbu2B]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the natural history and biological potential of small renal masses in order to evaluate whether surveillance is an option for treatment of small renal masses.

Methods

Literature search of MEDLINE and additional references from non-MEDLINE-indexed publications concerning surveillance of small renal masses.

Results

Because approximately 26–33% of observed small renal masses do not show radiographic growth, it has been suggested that a brief period of active surveillance may be feasible for selected renal masses, with treatment limited to tumours showing growth. Even though tumour growth might be absent or slow, a proportion of these tumours will express significant malignant behaviour. The biological behaviour of a tumour cannot be unambiguously predicted at present. Surveillance of small renal masses should only be considered in elderly and/or infirm patients with competing health risks, in those with limited life expectancy, and in those for whom surgery is not an option. In all other patients, active surveillance can be considered in the context of a study protocol only. In the majority of the patients, nephron-sparing surgery remains the gold standard treatment.

Conclusions

Surveillance should only be considered as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of small renal masses in selected patients. It should always be combined with close follow-up imaging and should be allowed only when the patient and the urologist accept the calculated risk. Long-term, prospective studies are needed to provide a more accurate assessment of the natural history and metastastic potential of small renal masses.

Renal mass and localized renal cancer — scope and follow-up: The guideline focuses on the evaluation and management of clinically localized sporadic renal masses suspicious for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in adults, including solid enhancing renal tumors and Bosniak 3 and 4 complex cystic renal masses. It addresses follow-up after intervention with recommendations for periodic clinical follow-up and abdominal and chest imaging and notes controversies about the role of renal mass biopsy (RMB) and concerns for potential overutilization of radical nephrectomy (RN). It also directs readers to associated Renal Mass and Localized Renal Cancer Treatment and Follow-up after Intervention algorithms.

### Predictors of delayed intervention for patients on active surveillance for small renal masses: does renal mass biopsy influence our decision? [^1111n2ak]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review our clinical T1a renal mass active surveillance (AS) cohort to determine whether renal mass biopsy was associated with maintenance of AS.

Materials and Methods

From our prospectively maintained database we identified patients starting AS from June 2009 to December 2011 who had at least 5 months of radiologic follow-up, unless limited by unexpected death or delayed intervention. The primary outcome was delayed intervention. Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic variables were compared. We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival curves for maintenance of AS. Cox multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of delayed intervention.

Results

We identified 118 patients who met criteria for inclusion with a median radiologic follow-up of 29.5 months. The delayed intervention group had greater initial mass size and faster growth rate compared to those who continued AS. Rate of renal mass biopsy was similar between the 2 groups. In the multivariable analysis, size > 2cm (hazard ratio [HR] 3.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–10.38, P = 0.015), growth rate (continuous by mm/year: HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12–1.41, P < .001), but not renal biopsy (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.70–3.30, P = 0.29), were associated with increased risk of delayed intervention. Time-to-event curves also showed that size was closely associated with delayed intervention whereas renal mass biopsy was not.

Conclusion

At our institution, growth rate and initial tumor size appear to be more influential than renal mass biopsy results in determining delayed intervention after a period of AS. Further analysis is required to determine the role of renal biopsy in the management of patients being considered for AS.

Renal masses background and United States epidemiology indicates heterogeneity and burden: "Renal masses are a biologically heterogeneous group of tumors ranging from benign masses to cancers that can be indolent or aggressive", and "The true incidence of renal masses (including benign masses) is unknown". Among surgically resected small tumors, "benign masses comprise approximately 15–20 percent of surgically resected tumors < 4 cm", and "The vast majority (greater than 90%) of kidney cancers in the United States are renal cortical tumors known as RCC". For U.S. incidence, "It is estimated there will be over 73,000 new cases of kidney cancer in the United States in 2020", with rates that "has been increasing steadily since the 1970's in part due to more prevalent use of axial imaging (CT and MRI)" and, over the past decade, "approximately 1% per year". The increase has been concentrated in "small, clinically localized renal masses which now represent at least 40 percent of incident tumors".
