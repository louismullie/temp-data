## Question

Can ivacaftor be used to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ivacaftor can be used to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and if not, what the evidence-based rationale is for or against such use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about ivacaftor's mechanism and FDA-labeled indications. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and established disease-modifying therapy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Next, I will check authoritative guidelines and trials to see if any role for CFTR modulators in AATD has been proposed. Finally, I will consider potential off-label or emerging therapeutics and synthesize a clear recommendation with supporting citations.

> Let me first confirm ivacaftor's intended use and dosing so I don't anchor on a false premise. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator indicated for cystic fibrosis in patients with at least one ivacaftor-responsive CFTR mutation, with adult dosing of 150 mg orally every 12 hours as per label and pharmacogenetic guidance; it is not labeled for other pulmonary disorders outside CFTR mutation–positive cystic fibrosis, and CFF/CPIC recommendations align with this scope of use [^115E2yAt] [^1127TSTM] [^113xZY9w] [^112xo2EC].

> Now, I should review the biology and standard of care for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency to ensure I'm mapping mechanisms correctly. AATD arises from SERPINA1 mutations (most often Pi✱ZZ) that lead to low circulating functional AAT and unopposed neutrophil elastase in the lung, producing emphysema; the disease-modifying therapy is intravenous augmentation with plasma-purified AAT to restore protective levels, typically considered in severe deficiency with appropriate genotypes, serum thresholds around 11 μM, and defined lung function contexts per guidelines [^111ZZ65x] [^111LHfA5] [^116tuMLG] [^11559VbY].

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative guidance mentions CFTR modulators in AATD at all. ERS 2017, Alpha-1 Foundation/ATS–ERS 2016, CTS 2025, and GOLD 2025 discuss testing, surveillance, and IV-AAT augmentation to slow emphysema progression or preserve CT lung density and survival, but they do not list CFTR modulators like ivacaftor as treatment options for AATD, nor do FDA labels for ivacaftor include AATD [^116tuMLG] [^116znhz4] [^111LHfA5] [^11559VbY] [^115E2yAt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; mechanistic plausibility matters. Ivacaftor potentiates CFTR chloride channel function in CF, whereas AATD is a serpin deficiency due to SERPINA1 mutations with protease–antiprotease imbalance; these are distinct pathways with no shared target that would predict benefit of CFTR potentiation in AATD, and reviews contrasting CF and AATD emphasize this divergence in pathophysiology [^112xo2EC] [^111ZZ65x] [^112Qb6cS].

> Next, I should review the interventional evidence base in AATD to ensure I'm not missing any signals for non–AAT replacement therapies. The RAPID randomized trial and its extension showed that IV-AAT slows loss of CT-measured lung density, and contemporary multinational registry analyses suggest survival benefits, with guideline endorsements reflecting these data; across these sources, there is no evaluation of CFTR modulators in AATD cohorts, which reinforces the absence of an evidentiary or trial-based role for ivacaftor in AATD [^1124A2Nq] [^111qLfXn] [^114WVRyT] [^116tuMLG].

> But wait, what if there is an off-label or exploratory use being tested somewhere? I need to check emerging therapies discussed in hepatology and pulmonary pipelines for AATD. Development efforts focus on AAT gene or protein replacement strategies, hepatocyte-targeted approaches to reduce Z-AAT polymer burden, inhaled AAT, and anti-inflammatory modalities; CFTR modulators are not featured among proposed AATD interventions in these overviews, which supports that ivacaftor has no role here mechanistically or clinically [^1131TKAP] [^112KDs3g].

> I should confirm boundary conditions to avoid misapplication of established AATD therapies as well. Guidelines caution against IV-AAT in phenotypes without clear evidence of benefit (for example, PiMZ heterozygotes) and in ongoing smokers, underscoring that AATD management is evidence- and phenotype-driven; this careful framing further argues against introducing unrelated agents like ivacaftor in AATD outside trials, given the absence of a biologic or clinical rationale [^116fJuUC] [^112raz5H].

> Putting this together, I need to be explicit in the recommendation. No, ivacaftor should not be used to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; it is a CFTR-specific therapy indicated for cystic fibrosis with responsive CFTR mutations, whereas AATD is a SERPINA1-related serpin deficiency managed with IV-AAT augmentation in eligible patients alongside smoking cessation and guideline-based COPD care, with no evidence or guideline support for CFTR modulators in AATD [^115E2yAt] [^116tuMLG] [^111LHfA5] [^11559VbY].

---

Ivacaftor is **not indicated or effective for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)** because it targets CFTR gating mutations in cystic fibrosis [^115E2yAt] rather than the SERPINA1 mutations that cause AATD [^111ZZ65x]. No evidence or guidelines support ivacaftor in AATD [^116tuMLG], and the **standard of care remains intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy** [^11559VbY] for severe deficiency with emphysema [^111LHfA5]. Ivacaftor should not be used for AATD [^115E2yAt].

---

## Mechanism of action of ivacaftor

Ivacaftor is a **CFTR potentiator** [^115E2yAt] that increases chloride transport in patients with CFTR gating mutations, improving lung function and reducing exacerbations in cystic fibrosis [^113xZY9w]. It is approved [^112xo2EC] for those with at least one ivacaftor-responsive CFTR mutation [^115E2yAt].

---

## Pathophysiology of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency

AATD is **caused by SERPINA1 mutations** [^111ZZ65x], most commonly the Z allele, resulting in misfolded AAT retained in hepatocytes [^111ifNB2], reduced circulating AAT, and unopposed neutrophil elastase that damages lung tissue and causes emphysema. The Z variant (Glu366Lys) lowers plasma AAT to 10–15% of normal [^114ah8cT], increasing emphysema risk [^113MZMZb].

---

## Current standard of care for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency

The standard of care for severe AATD with emphysema is **intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy** [^116tuMLG], which slows emphysema progression [^1124A2Nq] and improves survival [^111qLfXn] [^11559VbY]. Guidelines [^112kMJoa] recommend augmentation therapy for severe deficiency with documented emphysema and reduced lung function [^111LHfA5].

---

## Evidence regarding ivacaftor in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency

There is **no evidence that ivacaftor is effective in AATD**, as it does not address SERPINA1 mutations or AAT deficiency [^115E2yAt]. No clinical trials or other studies support its use, and no guidelines recommend it for this condition [^116tuMLG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines **do not recommend ivacaftor for AATD** [^116tuMLG]. The standard of care remains intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy [^11559VbY] for severe deficiency with emphysema [^111LHfA5].

---

## Safety considerations

Ivacaftor has known adverse effects in cystic fibrosis, including elevated liver enzymes, cataracts, and drug interactions [^115E2yAt]. There are **no safety data for ivacaftor in AATD**, and its use is not recommended.

---

## Ongoing research and clinical trials

There are **no ongoing clinical trials investigating ivacaftor in AATD**. Research in AATD focuses on augmentation therapy [^113YYN4D] and other targeted approaches, not on CFTR modulators [^113YRjTa].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ivacaftor is **not indicated or effective for AATD** [^115E2yAt] because it does not address the underlying SERPINA1 mutation or AAT deficiency [^111ZZ65x]. The standard of care remains intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy [^111LHfA5] for severe deficiency with emphysema [^111qLfXn]. Ivacaftor should not be used for AATD [^115E2yAt].

### Intravenous augmentation treatment and lung density in severe α1 antitrypsin deficiency (RAPID): A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1124A2Nq]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

The efficacy of α1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI) augmentation treatment for α1 antitrypsin deficiency has not been substantiated by a randomised, placebo-controlled trial. CT-measured lung density is a more sensitive measure of disease progression in α1 antitrypsin deficiency emphysema than spirometry. Therefore, we aimed to assess the efficacy of augmentation treatment using this measure.

- **Methods**: The RAPID study was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial of A1PI treatment in patients with α1 antitrypsin deficiency. We recruited eligible non-smokers (aged 18–65 years) from 28 international study centres across 13 countries if they had severe α1 antitrypsin deficiency (serum concentration < 11 μM) with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 35–70% predicted. We excluded patients who had undergone, or were on the waiting list to undergo, lung transplantation, lobectomy, or lung volume-reduction surgery, or who had selective IgA deficiency. We randomly assigned patients (1:1; done by Accovion) using a computerised pseudorandom number generator (block size of four) with centre stratification to receive A1PI intravenously at 60 mg/kg per week or a placebo for 24 months. All patients and study investigators (including those assessing outcomes) remained unaware of the treatment allocation throughout the study. The primary endpoints were CT lung density at total lung capacity (TLC) and functional residual capacity (FRC) combined, and the two separately, at 0, 3, 12, 21, and 24 months, analysed by modified intention to treat. Patients needed to have at least one evaluation.

### Longitudinal follow-up of patients with alpha(1)-protease inhibitor deficiency before and during therapy with IV alpha(1)-protease inhibitor [^111w9B5u]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

The efficacy of IV augmentation therapy with human alpha(1)-protease inhibitor (alpha(1)-Pi) in patients with severe alpha(1)-Pi deficiency is still under debate. The study aimed to evaluate the progression of emphysema in patients with alpha(1)-Pi deficiency before and during a period in which they received treatment with alpha(1)-Pi.

- **Design**: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study.
- **Setting**: Outpatient clinics of 26 university clinics and pulmonary hospitals.
- **Patients**: Ninety-six patients with severe alpha(1)-Pi deficiency receiving weekly augmentation therapy with human alpha(1)-Pi, 60 mg/kg of body weight, had a minimum of two lung function measurements before and two lung function measurements after augmentation therapy was started. Lung function data were followed up for a minimum of 12 months both before and during treatment (mean, 47.5 months and 50.2 months, respectively).

- **Measurements and results**: Patients were grouped according to the severity of their lung function impairment. The change in FEV₁ was compared during nontreatment and treatment periods. In the whole group, the decline in FEV₁ was significantly lower during the treatment period (49.2 mL/yr vs 34.2 mL/yr, p = 0.019). In patients with FEV₁ > 65%, IV alpha(1)-Pi treatment reduced the decline in FEV₁ by 73.6 mL/yr (p = 0.045). Seven individuals had a rapid decline of FEV₁ before treatment, and the loss in FEV₁ could be reduced from 256 mL/yr to 53 mL/yr (p = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Some patients with severe alpha(1)-Pi deficiency and well-preserved lung function show a rapid decline in FEV₁ before treatment, which can be significantly reduced with IV augmentation therapy.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy in individuals with the PI*MZ genotype: a pro/con debate on a working hypothesis [^115DpaQe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a significantly under-diagnosed genetic condition caused by reduced levels and/or functionality of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), predisposing individuals to lung, liver, or other systemic diseases. The management of individuals with the PI*MZ genotype, characterized by mild or moderate AAT deficiency, is less clear than in those with the most common severe deficiency genotype (PI*ZZ). Recent genetic data suggest that the PI*MZ genotype may be significantly more prevalent than currently thought. The only specific treatment for lung disease associated with severe AATD is the intravenous infusion of AAT augmentation therapy, which has been shown to slow disease progression in PI*ZZ individuals.

There is no specific evidence for the clinical benefit of AAT therapy in PI*MZ individuals, and the risk of emphysema development in this group remains controversial. As such, guidelines do not support the use of AAT augmentation in PI*MZ individuals. Here, we discuss the limited data on the PI*MZ genotype and offer pro and con perspectives on pursuing an AAT-specific therapeutic strategy in PI*MZ individuals with lung disease. Ultimately, further research to demonstrate the safety, risk/benefit balance, and efficacy of AAT therapy in PI*MZ individuals is needed.

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline-a multinational registry analysis [^114WVRyT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Compared with other studies investigating the use of IV-AAT to slow the rate of FEV1 decline, we found that IV-AAT had a significant effect on FEV1 decline at a lower GOLD stage than had been previously described. Our cohort declined at a slower rate than observed in previous studies, regardless of lung index status, although the use of lung index status to subtype the groups makes direct comparisons more difficult. Our study also found effects on survival that were similar to the findings of a previous study, with an HR of 0.64 in favor of mortality reduction found in that study and 0.61 in ours.

In the biggest studies of IV-AAT at the time of writing (RAPID studies), there was a significant effect on the loss of lung density as measured by computed tomography scan but no appreciable effect on spirometric decline. On review of the patient populations in these studies, it is clear that most are lung indexes over 50 years old, a group in a lower, static "plateau" phase of spirometry, as evidenced by our multinational data (mean age at trial commencement in RAPID, 53.8). The present study shows a decoupling of survival from change in FEV1.

Table E3, in particular, would suggest that the optimal individual for a clinical trial, using FEV1 as an endpoint, is a lung-index individual between the ages of 20 and 50 or a non–lung-index individual between the ages of 50 and 80. It is possible that younger lung indexes are in the rapid decline phase, as seen in Figure 1B, and then enter a phase of relatively less rapid decline that may indicate a parenchymal elastin burnout.

### Diagnosis and management of patients with α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency [^116EdwUC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Alpha(1)-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an autosomal codominant disease that can cause chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in children and adults, and increases risk for emphysema in adults. The development of symptomatic disease varies; some patients have life-threatening symptoms in childhood, whereas others remain asymptomatic and healthy into old age. As a result of this variability, patients present across multiple disciplines, including pediatrics, adult medicine, hepatology, genetics, and pulmonology. This can give physicians the mistaken impression that the condition is less common than it actually is, and can lead to fragmented care that omits critical interventions commonly performed by other specialists. We sought to present a rational approach for hepatologists to manage adult patients with A1AT deficiency.

### Advances in managing COPD related to α-antitrypsin deficiency: An under-recognized genetic disorder [^112auVHA]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

α1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor (PI) that protects lung tissue from proteolytic damage by inhibiting neutrophil elastase, a powerful enzyme with broad substrate specificity. Therefore, individuals with AAT deficiency (AATD), an autosomal co-dominant condition, are at increased risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, these individuals are often at risk of liver disease due to the polymerization and retention of AAT in hepatocytes, where the majority of AAT is produced.

Between 0.02% and 0.04% of individuals suffer from AATD. However, despite being commonly described as a rare disease, AATD is highly under-recognized, with less than 10% of individuals with AATD identified and with delays of more than 5 years between initial symptoms and diagnosis. Although younger individuals who are often asymptomatic may understandably escape medical attention, data suggest that, despite a majority of adults with the deficiency allele PI*ZZ manifesting COPD-related symptoms in the fourth and fifth decades, few clinicians identify AATD as the cause. The lack or delay of a diagnosis of AATD inevitably delays the initiation of augmentation therapy with AAT if indicated, transplantation, supportive therapies such as smoking cessation, and genetic and psychological counseling.

Since the discovery of AATD in the 1960s, knowledge and understanding of AAT and its deficiency have progressed significantly, although effective screening methods and non-intravenous therapy have remained elusive.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [^113MZMZb]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects about one in 2,000–5,000 individuals. It is clinically characterised by liver disease and early-onset emphysema. Although alpha1 antitrypsin is mainly produced in the liver, its main function is to protect the lung against proteolytic damage from neutrophil elastase. The most frequent mutation that causes severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency arises in the SERPINA1 gene and gives rise to the Z allele. This mutation reduces concentrations in serum of alpha1 antitrypsin by retaining polymerised molecules within hepatocytes; an amount below the serum protective threshold of 11 micromol/L increases the risk for emphysema.

In addition to the usual treatments for emphysema, infusion of purified alpha1 antitrypsin from pooled human plasma represents a specific treatment and raises the concentrations in serum and epithelial-lining fluid above the protective threshold. Evidence suggests that this approach is safe, slows the decline of lung function, could reduce infection rates, and might enhance survival. However, uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of this expensive treatment remains.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, particularly concerning liver disease, the Alpha-1 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining certain evaluations at annual intervals, or more frequently as indicated by clinical circumstances, to monitor for liver disease in patients with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency:

- **Physical examination**: Including a focused examination for signs of liver disease.

- **Liver ultrasound**

- **Laboratory monitoring**: AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyltransferase, albumin, bilirubin, INR, and platelets.

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline-a multinational registry analysis [^117R2bRu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although this is one of the largest studies, at the time of writing, of the real-world effects of IV-AAT in severely deficient individuals, we acknowledge its limitations. This is a retrospective, observational study, although the reasons for conducting such a study have been outlined earlier. There are some discrepancies in the data collected across the three participating countries, limiting some analyses; notably, D CO was unavailable in Austria, and FEF 25–75 measurements were only available in Ireland. Quality-of-life measures, which would add further valuable insights, were not available for analysis. Differences in follow-up length between the three countries may have reduced power to detect differences in survival. In addition, the observed decline by age of diagnosis may be a result of similar heterogeneity in follow-up length.

A potential cause of this heterogeneity could be related to different characteristics between individuals who dropped out early and those who remained a part of the registry for a longer duration. We cannot account for differences because of additional genetic modifiers of SERPINA1 expression that may exist in differing frequencies between the populations of the three countries, or because of ethnicity and socioeconomic status, as these were not captured in the registry data. Finally, we are unable to account for what medications or inhalers each participant was receiving at each time point in each country, although we note that prescribing practices were consistent and guideline-based across all three countries.

### Monocyte NLRP3 inflammasome and interleukin-1β activation modulated by alpha-1 antitrypsin therapy in deficient individuals [^111ifNB2]. Thorax (2024). High credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a 52 kDa glycosylated protein synthesized primarily by hepatocytes. It is the archetypal serine protease inhibitor, capable of exerting potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. AAT deficiency (AATD) is a rare hereditary disorder, accounting for 2%–3% of all instances of emphysema, and results from mutations in the SERPINA1 gene on the long arm of chromosome 14.

The most pathogenic allele is Pi*Z, which occurs in over 95% of individuals with AATD, with homozygosity affecting severe plasma deficiency. In ZZ-AATD, the misfolded Z protein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes, leading to a gain of function and predisposition to liver cirrhosis, but also a failure to secrete protective levels of AAT into the systemic circulation. The subsequent loss of function is characterized at the lung by insufficient protection of the alveoli from proteolytic damage, with lung disease presenting as early as the fourth or fifth decade of life.

Intravenous augmentation therapy with plasma-purified AAT is an approved treatment available for AATD-associated emphysema, and the Randomised Trial of Augmentation Therapy in Alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor Deficiency (RAPID trial) and its open-label extension study, RAPID-OLE, demonstrated a slowed progression of emphysema. Nevertheless, these latter clinical trials were unsuccessful in determining changes in lung function, and therefore additional research on the effectiveness and mechanisms of action are required.

### α1-Antitrypsin deficiency [^111ZZ65x]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency:

- **Definition**: AATD is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, leading to a deficiency or dysfunction of the α-1 antitrypsin protein.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency involves a deficiency in the α-1 antitrypsin protein. The imbalance of proteases and antiproteases leads to unopposed neutrophil elastase activity and subsequent tissue damage in the lungs.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency in Europe is estimated at 20 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factor for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic predisposition, as the condition is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant manner. Individuals of Northern European descent are particularly susceptible due to a higher likelihood of carrying the defective gene.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency often present with symptoms such as dyspnea, chronic cough, and respiratory infections. In some cases, the disease may also manifest as unexplained bronchiectasis. In rare cases, it can also lead to liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can vary widely among patients. The disease is generally progressive, with the potential for significant lung damage over time.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin mutations: Is one too many [^114ah8cT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The association between severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin and early-onset pulmonary emphysema has been known for several decades. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene, and the most common genetic variants causing deficiency are termed S and Z. The molecular basis of the deficiency is the abnormal folding, polymerization, and retention of the variant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The Z variant causes a change in the amino acid sequence (Glu366Lys) and is associated with plasma levels that are 10–15% of the normal M allele, whereas the S variant (Glu288Val) causes a milder deficiency with plasma levels that are 50–60% of normal.

Although the risk for lung disease in ZZ homozygotes is clearly established, the role of additional rare variants of SERPINA1 has not been adequately explored. This is an important issue, as there are more than 100 other rare variants in the SERPINA1 gene that have known or predicted deleterious effects. In addition, whether there is an increased risk for lung disease because of a single copy of the Z allele has been a source of debate in the literature for many years.

### Impact of age at ivacaftor initiation on pulmonary outcomes among people with cystic fibrosis [^115GUPRm]. Thorax (2024). Low credibility.

Although ivacaftor (IVA) has previously demonstrated clinical benefit across age groups, this study showed that starting IVA treatment at younger ages (as early as 6 years) versus older ages slowed disease progression. It achieved this by reducing pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) and preserving lung function, which was not fully restored by initiating IVA at older ages.

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline-a multinational registry analysis [^111qLfXn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Intravenous plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin (IV-AAT) has been used as therapy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) since 1987. Previous trials (RAPID and RAPID-OLE) demonstrated efficacy in preserving computed tomography of lung density but showed no effect on FEV1. This observational study evaluated 615 people with severe AATD from three countries with socialized health care (Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria), where access to standard medical care was equal but access to IV-AAT was not.

- **Objectives**: To assess the real-world longitudinal effects of IV-AAT.

- **Methods**: Pulmonary function and mortality data were utilized to perform longitudinal analyses on registry participants with severe AATD.

- **Measurements and main results**: IV-AAT confers a survival benefit in severe AATD (P < 0.001). We uncovered two distinct AATD phenotypes based on an initial respiratory diagnosis: lung index and non-lung index. Lung indexes demonstrated a more rapid FEV1 decline between the ages of 20 and 50 and subsequently entered a plateau phase of minimal decline from 50 onward. Consequently, IV-AAT had no effect on FEV1 decline, except in patients with a Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2 lung index.

- **Conclusions**: This real-world study demonstrates a survival advantage from IV-AAT. This improved survival is largely decoupled from FEV1 decline. The observation that patients with severe AATD fall into two major phenotypes has implications for clinical trial design where FEV1 is a primary endpoint. Recruits into trials are typically older lung in…

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline-a multinational registry analysis [^117J7rcJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Since the discovery of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) in 1963 and the confirmation of its key role in the development of emphysema in 1967, our understanding of the biochemical nature of the lung disease has progressed steadily. Plasma-purified intravenous AAT (IV-AAT) as augmentation therapy for severe AATD was shown to be biochemically effective as early as 1981, increasing levels of AAT in blood and in the lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF). A further study by Wewers and colleagues in 1987 showed that IV-AAT, administered once weekly at a dose of 60 mg/kg, increased AAT levels in blood and ELF above a putative protective threshold throughout the course of treatment, leading to approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1987.

However, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate significant clinical efficacy, in part because of low statistical power as a consequence of AATD being a rare genetic condition. The lack of conclusive RCT data has hampered acceptance of this therapeutic approach, and IV-AAT is not reimbursed by insurers or national health systems in many parts of the world.

Various metrics have been evaluated to assess the clinical effectiveness of IV-AAT, including decline in FEV1, lung densitometry, pulmonary exacerbations, quality of life, and survival. The overall conclusions of these papers are that severe AATD deficiency, in itself, does not predict clinical outcomes, and there is significant heterogeneity in disease progression as well as response to IV-AAT, thus making studying the effects of IV-AAT challenging.

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline-a multinational registry analysis [^1127pSb1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Patients were assessed by time-to-terminal-event (TTE) analysis specifically from the first pulmonary function test (PFT) to a terminal event, either lung transplant or death. Of the 615 patients observed over a maximum of 286 months, 96 experienced a terminal event. Among them, 37 people received a lung transplant, and 59 died without receiving a lung transplant. The cause of the terminal event was respiratory in 64 (66.7%) patients, liver-related in 3 (3.1%) patients, and other causes in 12 (12.5%) patients. The cause of death was unknown for 17 (17.7%) individuals.

We compared TTE between all lung indexes and non-lung indexes (Figure 2A) and among the three countries combined (Figure 2B). Lung indexes had a significantly lower survival probability compared with non-lung indexes (P = 0.009). Individuals in Ireland also had a significantly lower survival probability compared with those in the other two countries (P = 0.035). After stratification for lung index status, the significant difference in TTE appears to be strongly influenced by the difference in TTE between Ireland and Austria for lung indexes (P = 0.004), likely due to variable access to IV-AAT in these countries. This difference was not evident in non-lung indexes (P = 0.4).

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that can cause lung disease. People who smoke are more seriously affected and have a greater risk of dying from the disease.

- **Objective**: To review the benefits and harms of augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and lung disease.

- **Search strategy**: PubMed, the Cochrane Trials Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov (7 January 2010), along with the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis & Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register (13 March 2009).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials of augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin compared with placebo or no treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The two authors independently selected trials, extracted outcome data, and assessed the risk of bias.

- **Main results**: Two trials were included (total 140 patients) that ran for two to three years. All patients were ex- or never-smokers and had genetic variants that carried a very high risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mortality data were not reported. There was no information on harms in the first trial; in the second trial, serious adverse events were reported to have occurred in 10 patients in the active group and in 18 patients in the placebo group. The annual number of exacerbations and quality of life were similar in the two groups; none of the trials reported on the average number of lung infections or hospital admissions. Forced expiratory volume in one second deteriorated a little more in the active group than in the placebo group; the difference was -20 mL per year.

### Anti-proteases and alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy [^113vEnQb]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease that first highlighted the importance of protease balance in normal lung homeostasis. Proteases, such as neutrophil elastase, are important in many pulmonary diseases. However, the first commercially licensed anti-protease therapy was used for emphysema in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The four commercial alpha-1 protease inhibitor preparations in the United States are currently given intravenously to augment the serum and alveolar epithelial lining fluid concentrations of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Since the discovery of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in 1963, many genetic polymorphisms of the SERPINA1 gene have been discovered. Because neutrophilic inflammation is the hallmark of usual COPD, anti-protease therapy has also been explored in this disease. Further trials with different dosing schema, inhaled therapy, and in different disease states are ongoing. These studies would be facilitated by having COPD outcomes that are independent of the measurement of airflow and achievable in smaller populations over a short period of time.

### An electronic health record-based strategy to enhance detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^113pUGyj]. Respiratory Care (2024). High credibility.

Because alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is severely underrecognized and delayed diagnosis is associated with harm, strategies to enhance early detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are needed.

- **Methods**: The study intervention involved placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency within an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard. This dashboard houses prompts for providers to implement guideline-based recommendations. The recommendation applied to all patients diagnosed with COPD based on relevant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. The rate of testing for and detecting individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was assessed in 12 one-month intervals before and after implementing the dashboard.

- **Results**: After the prompt was added, testing was still performed in only a small percentage of guideline-concordant instances. However, the rate of testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency increased 3.8-fold (i.e. from 1.2% to 4.6%, P < .05). This did not result in the detection of new patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The rate of testing increased for both alpha-1 antitrypsin serum levels and genotypes in each month after the intervention, although the rate of genotype testing was 2–5-fold lower than the rate of testing for serum levels.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this preliminary study of a detection strategy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency show that placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency when indicated in an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard significantly increased testing rates.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy in individuals with the PI*MZ genotype: a pro/con debate on a working hypothesis [^111DikPh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Most of the published evidence relating to the management of individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is based on patients with the PI*ZZ or PI*Znull genotypes, who have a severe deficiency in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) with plasma levels < 11 µM (< 52 mg/dL) compared with the normal range of 19–47 µM (102–254 mg/dL). Nevertheless, there are an estimated 6–7 million people with AATD in the United States (US) alone, including those with mild or moderate deficiency genotypes. Individuals who are heterozygous for the Z allele, such as those with the PI*MZ genotype, who have AAT serum levels of 11–28 µM (62–151 mg/dL) or approximately 60% of the normal range, may be at risk of developing lung and/or liver disease if they have other predisposing risk factors. Previous studies have found that among patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the prevalence of the PI*MZ genotype ranges from 1 to 22%.

Despite the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for pathologic changes in AAT-deficient individuals, and the fact that AAT augmentation therapy is the only disease-modifying therapeutic approach for patients with AATD-associated lung disease, guidelines do not recommend the use of augmentation therapy in individuals with the PI*MZ genotype. However, there is a lack of consensus among treating physicians on how PI*MZ individuals should be monitored and treated, and whether AAT augmentation therapy could be a treatment strategy in some PI*MZ patients. Here, we summarize the evidence supporting a potential AAT-specific.

### Inflammatory cytokine response to exercise in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient COPD patients 'on' or 'off' augmentation therapy [^114ZPKMP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited genetic disorder that leads to the development of emphysema, resulting in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among other complications, such as liver dysfunction. The lack of functional α 1-antitrypsin exposes the lungs to insufficient inhibition of serine protease activity, leading to chronic uncontrolled proteolytic attack that results in early-life lung damage, with 85% loss in PiZZ individuals. The rates of decline in lung function and onset of emphysema can be highly variable in AATD individuals. This variability is due in part to phenotypic differences in α 1-antitrypsin reductions, but also to varying individual exposures to environmental risk factors, most notably cigarette smoke history.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin mutations: Is one too many [^115RdcFd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

One of the main strengths of the study was that a large number of non-Hispanic white patients were sequenced across the entire SERPINA1 coding region. Larger sample sizes for different ethnic groups need to be studied, but the identification of group-specific variants provides a good rationale for performing such studies. Another strength was that the study participants all had significant smoke exposure, thus reducing the potential for lack of penetrance of the variants. The availability of measurements of circulating alpha-1 antitrypsin was an important asset in this study, as it helped guide the interpretation of the genetic association data.

This study illustrates the difficulty in analyzing rare genetic variants: Although there may be significant associations when considered in aggregate (i.e.g.ene-based burden testing), there are often too few individuals with each variant to test individually with sufficient power. Nevertheless, rare variants are potentially important for the individual patient, and therefore additional large-scale studies such as this are warranted.

### An electronic health record-based strategy to enhance detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^116NSrHk]. Respiratory Care (2025). Low credibility.

Because alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is severely underrecognized, and delayed diagnosis is associated with harm, strategies to enhance early detection of the condition are needed. The study intervention involved placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency within an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard. This dashboard houses prompts to providers to implement guideline-based recommendations.

This recommendation applied to all patients assigned a diagnosis of COPD based on relevant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The rate of testing for and detecting individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was assessed over 12 one-month intervals before and after implementing the dashboard.

Results revealed that despite the prompt, testing was performed in only a small percentage of guideline-concordant instances. However, the rate of testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency increased 3.8-fold (from 1.2% to 4.6%, P < .05). Nonetheless, this did not result in the detection of new patients with the deficiency. The rate of testing increased both for alpha-1 antitrypsin serum levels and genotypes in each month after the intervention, although the rate of genotype testing was 2–5-fold lower than the rate of testing for serum levels.

These results from the preliminary study indicate that placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard significantly increased the testing rate.

### Treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: Does augmentation therapy work [^113YRjTa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare inherited cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that affects an estimated 250,000 individuals in Europe and North America. Although alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy for individuals with AATD has been available since the late 1980s, about 35 years, this therapy has not been uniformly adopted by many countries. Despite the overwhelming logic that replacement of a missing protein would prevent further loss of lung tissue in individuals with AATD, many regulators remain unconvinced of the clinical utility of AAT augmentation therapy in these individuals because clinical trials at the time of writing have not met regulatory designated clinical endpoints. The reason clinical trials have not met mandated clinical endpoints is complex and illustrates the challenges of proving that therapies are effective in rare diseases in general.

- **Outcome variables and trial design**: First is the fact that outcome variables such as FEV1 are imprecise and only partially reflect the clinical features of AATD lung disease, particularly progressive emphysema, in individuals with AATD over their lifetimes. Second, sample size estimates, using FEV1 rate of decline as an outcome variable, may approach 400 subjects in each arm and require more than three years to reach significance.

- **Challenges in subject identification**: Other challenges to designing studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of augmentation therapy include the lack of effective AATD screening programs to identify individuals with AATD. This often results in their identification only after they have substantial lung function impairment. Adding to these challenges is the absence of complete data.

### Cystic fibrosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: Case report and review of literature [^112Qb6cS]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Both cystic fibrosis (CF) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) are severe autosomal recessive inherited diseases affecting the lungs and the liver. CF lung disease is characterized by a significant neutrophil burden with normal levels of anti-proteases, whereas in A1ATD, the neutrophil burden is normal but the levels of antiproteases are decreased.

In the reported case, the diagnosis of A1ATD was established because the liver disease's severity could not be explained fully by CF. Risk factors for the development of cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD) include male sex, CFTR genotype, later age at diagnosis of CF, meconium ileus, severity of pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency, and persistent failure to thrive. Moreover, the SERPINA1 Z-allele has been identified as an additional risk factor for CFLD.

CFLD can present with neonatal cholestasis and, at later ages, range from asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and portal hypertension. However, the majority of patients experience focal changes of the liver parenchyma without clinical significance.

Liver disease in our case may predominantly be determined by A1ATD with CF. Intestinal failure associated liver disease (IFALD) is a potentially contributing factor due to the intestinal failure and period of parenteral nutrition. Moreover, the need for repeated broad-spectrum antibiotics may have an influence on liver disease as well.

The incidence of A1ATD is similar to that of cystic fibrosis within Caucasian populations. The associated lung disease is caused by a "loss-of-function" defect of A1AT, leading to proteolytic damage to the co…

### Advances in managing COPD related to α-antitrypsin deficiency: An under-recognized genetic disorder [^114MpT7x]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

- **Screening and diagnosis**: To address the issue of under-diagnosis, several guidelines for screening and targeted testing of AATD are available. In 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended screening all patients with COPD, as well as adults and adolescents with asthma, by quantitative testing, followed by PI typing for individuals with abnormal results. In 2015, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stated that the WHO suggests screening COPD patients from areas with a particularly high prevalence of AATD. In 2017, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) proposed particularly inclusive guidelines that recommended testing in specific groups of individuals.

Screening asymptomatic individuals for AATD is particularly useful because positive correlations exist between smoking cessation and improved physical and psychosocial outcomes, due to individuals' awareness of their predisposition to COPD. Similar findings were recently published for adults admitted to a large newborn screening program in Sweden. However, it is debatable whether this evidence will lead to widespread screening of newborns, as a diagnosis of AATD has been shown to increase stress in families. Additional caveats include the lack of specific treatment for the AATD-associated liver disease, which is the primary cause of childhood morbidity, and the need for additional conclusive evidence that newborn screening ultimately results in better outcomes in longitudinal studies.

### Treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: Does augmentation therapy work [^112yqTkh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

There are important take-home messages from this real-world study of individuals with AATD. First, the presence of respiratory symptoms in this genetically homogeneous group sets the stage for both an increase in mortality and steeper declines in lung function. Second, the loss of lung function as determined by FEV1 differs over time in the lung index group. Only during the "rapidly" declining phase is FEV1 rate of decline, GOLD stage 2, useful in identifying a treatment effect. Using FEV1 rate of decline in all individuals with AATD, regardless of their FEV1 percent predicted at the time of enrollment, will not be an adequate outcome variable, because change in FEV1 is sufficient only in those individuals with GOLD stage 2.

Studies using FEV1 change as a primary outcome would be feasible only in subgroups of lung index subjects with AATD. The challenge in using this group is that they likely represent a small proportion of enrollable subjects, generating even greater challenges for recruiting subjects for a treatment trial in this rare inherited disease. On the basis of the results of this real-world study of the effectiveness of IV AAT augmentation therapy, as well as other studies demonstrating "biochemical efficacy" and reduction in loss of lung density over time, perhaps it is time to accept that AAT augmentation is a clinically effective therapy for individuals with AATD.

### Treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: Does augmentation therapy work [^111v1yr9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Several insights emerged from the analysis of this study that warrant emphasis. Most importantly, was the identification of ascertainment differences at the time of enrollment. Study participants fell into two broad groups: those who were identified with respiratory symptoms and those identified from family studies or other means who did not have respiratory symptoms. These groups are referred to as the lung index group and the non–lung index group. The majority of subjects receiving augmentation therapy (93.4%) were in the lung index group.

Overall, there was no effect of augmentation therapy on the rate of decline in FEV1; however, in the subgroup corresponding to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2 (FEV1 between 50% and 80%), there was a significant reduction in the rate of decline in FEV1. This observation is similar but not identical to the findings of an earlier NHLBI registry in which there was a treatment effect in the group of subjects with an FEV1 between 35% and 49% predicted. Not surprisingly, this "middle" lung function group is typically associated with the steepest rate of decline in lung function (84–94 mL FEV1/yr). Loss of lung function, as measured by the rate of decline in FEV1, is sigmoidal, and individuals with an FEV1 percent predicted greater than 80% and less than 35%, at GOLD stage 3, declined slowly, whereas those with an FEV1 percent predicted of 35–79% have much steeper declines. Not surprisingly, individuals in the lung index group had a lower survival than those in the non–lung index group.

### Detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a review [^114b6hVf]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Screening studies reveal a much larger number of individuals expected to have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency than are clinically recognized, with estimates that only about 2–10% of such individuals have been diagnosed. Recognition of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may prompt specific interventions, such as smoking avoidance, testing of family members, genetic counseling, and consideration of augmentation therapy; thus, diagnosis is important and has invited much attention to efforts for identifying affected individuals.

- **Strategies to identify affected individuals**: These include both population-based screening and targeted detection. Available studies have employed both approaches, though large-scale population-based screening is challenging. Targeted-detection studies have generally produced a higher rate of detecting disease and tend to be more successful with easier sampling techniques.

- **Strategies to enhance detection in targeted studies include**: Awareness campaigns, easy testing techniques (such as evaluation of dried blood spots and home, confidential testing), and inclusive criteria for testing, which span the full spectrum of clinical manifestations of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency: New and emerging treatments for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency [^112KDs3g]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a genetic condition that increases the risk of developing lung and liver disease, as well as other associated conditions. Most treatments for affected individuals are not specifically directed at AAT deficiency but focus on the resultant disease state. The only currently available specific therapeutic agent is intravenous augmentation with plasma-derived AAT protein, which is marketed in a limited number of countries. Treatments aimed at correcting the underlying genetic abnormality, supplementing or modifying the gene product, and halting or reversing organ injury are now beginning to emerge. These innovative approaches may prove effective at modifying or eliminating diseases associated with AAT deficiency.

There was a significant survival benefit for individuals actively receiving IV-AAT compared with individuals who had never received IV-AAT in the overall study cohort (P = 0.00076).

- **Kaplan-Meier survival analysis**:
	(A) The analysis categorized by augmentation status across all three countries showed an increased survival probability conferred by augmentation therapy (P = 0.00076). Those who were previously receiving augmentation therapy but stopped receiving it were excluded from analysis.
	(B) The analysis of individuals who never received intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin, categorized by country, showed no difference in survival probability in those who never received augmentation therapy (P = 0.14).

- **Cox proportional hazard modeling**: We performed modeling to test the independent effects of each covariate of interest. Increased age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.05) and lung index status (HR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.39–6.21) were associated with lower survival probability, whereas IV-AAT was associated with higher survival probability (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45–0.83). There was no significant association with sex, smoking status, or country. We observed similar findings in sensitivity analyses adjusted for FEV1, except that lung index status was no longer significant.

### Liver disease in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency: A review [^114V8Vmk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder that predisposes the affected individual to chronic pulmonary disease, in addition to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Just over one-third of genetically susceptible adult patients with the most severe phenotype, PiZZ, develop clinically significant liver injury. The clinical presentation of liver disease is variable, and the genetic and environmental factors that predispose some individuals to liver disease while sparing others are unknown. The mechanisms of liver and lung disease are distinct and unique. This article reviews the liver disease associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, emphasizing the genetic defect, molecular pathogenesis, natural history, and promising therapies.

### Update on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: New therapies [^1131TKAP]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is characterized by the misfolding and intracellular polymerization of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The retention of mutant protein causes hepatic damage and cirrhosis, while the lack of an important circulating protease inhibitor predisposes individuals with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency to early-onset emphysema. Our work over the past 25 years has led to new paradigms for the liver and lung disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

We review the molecular pathology of the cirrhosis and emphysema associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and show how an understanding of this condition provided the paradigm for a wider group of disorders that we have termed the serpinopathies. The detailed understanding of the pathobiology of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency has identified important disease mechanisms to target. As a result, several novel parallel and complementary therapeutic approaches are in development, with some now in clinical trials. We provide an overview of these new therapies for the liver and lung disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline-a multinational registry analysis [^112TZrwu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The effect of augmentation therapy on pulmonary function decline is significant. In total, 250 individuals had ever received intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin (IV-AAT), with 213 actively receiving it. A total of 365 had never received IV-AAT during the observation period. Lung indexes accounted for 199 of the 213 (93.4%) actively receiving IV-AAT. Among those actively receiving IV-AAT, 20 were Irish, 54 were Swiss, and 139 were Austrian. The mean duration for patients receiving IV-AAT across these three countries was 12.8 (± 7.2) years.

A higher proportion of individuals actively receiving IV-AAT in Austria began treatment at GOLD stage 2 for COPD (P = 0.02), compared with those from Ireland and Switzerland. There was no significant difference observed in the proportions of individuals commencing at GOLD stage 3 across the three countries.

Of the 197 lung indexes who never received IV-AAT, 93 were Irish, 31 were Swiss, and 73 were Austrian. Baseline clinical characteristics are detailed elsewhere. Among the 31 Swiss and 73 Austrians, 22 and 32 individuals, respectively, technically met the FEV1 percent predicted inclusion criteria for IV-AAT at baseline. However, the reasons they did not commence IV-AAT remain unclear.

When comparing FEV1 decline (in milliliters) between those actively receiving and never receiving IV-AAT, GOLD stage 2 (50% ≤ FEV1 < 80%) lung indexes showed a significant reduction in FEV1 decline. This suggests a need to consider IV-AAT earlier in the disease progression if evaluating FEV1 as an outcome measure.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement therapy: Current status [^115ajV6G]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine the results of recent studies on the use of alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement therapy in the treatment of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency-related emphysema, a condition that predisposes individuals to early-onset emphysema and, in some cases, liver disease. Brief commentary on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease is also provided, alongside discussion of new therapeutic approaches currently under intense research.

Recent findings indicate that several nonrandomized observational studies and one meta-analysis have demonstrated favorable results in reducing forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) deterioration in individuals with moderate lung disease or accelerated FEV1 decline. Improved methods of monitoring disease progression, including computed tomography (CT) scanning and exacerbations, are being proposed as primary endpoints. Notably, one small randomized, placebo-controlled trial using CT scanning showed a trend toward preservation of lung density with treatment. However, the literature lacks evidence of effectiveness from large randomized trials.

In summary, there might be a possible, but as yet unproven, role for alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy in reducing emphysema progression in certain subsets of patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Further placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials are required to draw firm conclusions.

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline-a multinational registry analysis [^1146MEPW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

This study also raises questions about the efficacy of screening for AATD in the absence of access to IV-AAT. The Irish registry benefits from a national targeted detection program, with 37% of the severe AATD population in the Irish registry identified by family screening compared with 16% in Austria and 7% in Switzerland. This does not mean that targeted detection programs confer no benefit. Of the 77 Irish people picked up by family screening, 27% fit the criteria for IV-AAT commencement at diagnosis. In Austria or Switzerland, this same cohort would be offered IV-AAT with the potential for improved survival. This emphasizes that targeted detection programs need to be linked to effective interventions beyond smoking cessation.

These data also show that, despite the increased awareness of AATD, the impact of targeted detection programs, and the potential efficacy of new treatments, we are still diagnosing people with severe AATD in their mid-40s with established COPD. As this, and other studies show, COPD at diagnosis independently predicts increased mortality.

Diagnosing AATD before COPD is established, and the added potential to initiate therapy at the time of rapid lung function decline, is very attractive. That will not be achievable with the present screening programs, which target people with emphysema, COPD, poorly responsive asthma, unexplained liver disease, panniculitis, and first-degree relatives of people diagnosed with AATD. With the exception of children diagnosed shortly after birth because of jaundice, the majority of individuals with the ZZ genotype are still diagnosed too late for optimal intervention.

### The impact of delayed diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: The association between diagnostic delay and worsened clinical status [^1124G2ri]. Respiratory Care (2019). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is frequently underrecognized. Individuals with symptoms often experience long diagnostic delays. Although a delayed diagnosis is logically presumed to be associated with adverse effects, confirmatory evidence that a delay in diagnosis confers harm is sparse. The study characterized the association between a delayed diagnosis and the clinical status at the time of diagnosis.

- **Methods**: Patients with newly diagnosed severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin received questionnaires that assessed self-reported diagnostic delay, the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and COPD Assessment Test. Results of spirometry were retrieved, and the relationship between the diagnostic delay interval and FEV1% predicted, SGRQ, and COPD Assessment Test were assessed.

- **Results**: Forty subjects were recruited (31 with PI*ZZ, 9 with PI*SZ). Values for FEV1% predicted, SGRQ, and COPD Assessment Test were available for 17, 40, and 32 subjects, respectively. The relationship between the diagnostic delay interval and all outcomes was directionally consistent with an adverse impact of increasing diagnostic delay. For each additional year of diagnostic delay, the subject's FEV1% predicted decreased by 0.3% (P = 0.66), the SGRQ Total score increased by 1.6 points (P < .001), and the COPD Assessment Test score increased by 0.7 points (P = 0.004).

- **Conclusions**: The results of this analysis were consistent with a delayed diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency being associated with worse COPD-related symptoms and functional status.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy for PI*MZ heterozygotes: A cautionary note [^115ERbia]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Use of IV augmentation therapy with plasma-derived alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) has become the standard of care for the treatment of pulmonary disease associated with the severe genetic deficiency of AAT. The Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee of the Alpha-1 Foundation has become aware that physicians are prescribing this expensive blood product for the treatment of individuals with a single abnormal AAT gene, primarily the PI*MZ genotype. We are aware of no evidence that such therapy is effective in this patient population. The most important therapeutic interventions in such patients remain smoking cessation and elimination of other risk factors for lung disease. This commentary discusses the treatment of AAT deficiency and the concerns regarding treatment of PI*MZ individuals. We conclude that clinicians should avoid prescribing augmentation therapy for this heterozygote population.

### The direct medical costs of alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency [^111odxJU]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

For individuals with emphysema due to severe alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, a specific therapy known as IV augmentation therapy has been available since 1989. This therapy involves the IV infusion of pooled human plasma alpha(1)-antiprotease.

- **Methods**: To assess the direct medical costs associated with alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, the study surveyed members of the Alpha One Foundation Registry for Individuals With alpha(1)-Antitrypsin Deficiency about their annual expenditures for disease treatment. Data on demographic features, alpha(1)-antitrypsin status, and health-resource utilization were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. Respondents were asked to provide total health-care expenditures; however, costs by specific items of care (e.g. drugs, physician visits) were not available.

- **Results**: Mean annual cost estimates were higher for PI*ZZ-phenotype individuals ($30,948, n = 292) compared to non-PI*ZZ-phenotype individuals ($20,673, n = 53; p = 0.049). Among PI*ZZ-phenotype individuals, self-reported costs of healthcare services were further analyzed for the 288 individuals who reported their alpha(1)-antiprotease use status. For the 185 Alpha(1)-antiprotease users, the mean annual cost was $40,123 (median, $36,000).

- **Conclusions**: Annual healthcare expenditures for individuals with alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency are very high, regardless of whether they are currently receiving augmentation therapy. Augmentation therapy significantly adds to the costs, particularly for heavier individuals receiving weekly infusions.

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline-a multinational registry analysis [^116sZPXr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

An initial analysis found that there was a significant difference in lung function decline in those diagnosed because of respiratory reasons (lung index) compared to those diagnosed for nonrespiratory reasons (non–lung index), even though lung indexes had stopped smoking at the time of entry into this study. As a result, these two groups were separated for the analysis of lung function decline. The majority (70%) of participants were lung indexes. Figures 1A–1D demonstrate that lung indexes reach a lower FEV1 (in liters) and percent predicted, compared to their non–lung index counterparts at each given age, and decline more rapidly initially before reaching a plateau.

The absolute rate of decline in FEV1 (in milliliters) in lung indexes is greater than in non–lung indexes between the ages of 20 and 50 years old (41 mL vs. 31 ml/yr; difference, 10.7 ml/yr; 95% confidence interval, 4.5–16.8; P < 0.001), whereas the rate of decline in non–lung indexes is greater between the ages of 50 to 80 years old (47 mL vs. 36 ml/yr; difference, 10.8 ml/yr; 95% CI, 4.3–17.4; P = 0.001) (see Figure E3).

We also compared estimated yearly FEV1 decline normalized for baseline FEV1 by age group, as defined in previous clinical trials. There was a significant difference in normalized FEV1 decline between lung indexes and non–lung indexes in both age groups (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively), with lung indexes declining more rapidly (see Figure E4).

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^115F2uAd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disease affecting the lung and liver. The typical pulmonary manifestation is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur in young adulthood, and terminal respiratory insufficiency causes premature death in many patients. In the liver, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may manifest as benign neonatal hepatitis syndrome; a small percentage of adults develop liver fibrosis, progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The alpha-1 antitrypsin molecule is a serine protease inhibitor predominantly produced in the liver. Its most important physiological functions include the protection of pulmonary tissue from aggressive proteolytic enzymes and regulation of pulmonary immune processes.

Diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can be established by measuring the serum alpha-1 antitrypsin concentration or through genetic analysis. Treatment is similar to the usual treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, substitution therapy with human alpha-1 antitrypsin is an option. The targets of treatment are the prevention of the accelerated decline of pulmonary function, reduction of lung infections, and improvements in exercise capacity.

### Key current clinical issues in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^1126bLXc]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a common but under-recognized condition on which respiratory therapists can have a large impact. A key recent development is the issuance of an international evidence-based standards document regarding the diagnosis and management of individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. This report summarizes that standards document, which recommends more widespread testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency to extend the benefits of diagnosis to individuals found to have the condition.

An important aspect of the standards document is that evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy is reviewed. Though no definitive support from a randomized clinical trial is available, the weight of evidence favors the clinical efficacy of alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy, at least in individuals with moderate degrees of established airflow obstruction. On that basis, the standards document recommends intravenous augmentation therapy in specified clinical circumstances.

### Exacerbations in subjects with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency receiving augmentation therapy [^1175B8Wp]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The frequency, characteristics, and impact of acute exacerbations in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and COPD who are on intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy have not been described.

- **Methods**: 922 subjects with AATD and COPD on augmentation therapy (mean age 54.5 years) were followed with monthly telephone surveys to record exacerbation characteristics, as well as healthcare resource utilization and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Exacerbations were defined by symptom-based and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) criteria.

- **Results**: During the 1-year follow-up, 91.5% of participants experienced at least one exacerbation (mean 2.4 exacerbations per subject, median 2, and mean duration 17 days per episode, regardless of the definition used). Most exacerbations were categorized as severe by symptoms and moderate by HRU criteria. Subjects who had 3 or more exacerbations (48.6%) were younger, had higher medication use, and had higher tobacco consumption compared with subjects with fewer exacerbations. Subjects with frequent exacerbations had the worst baseline HRQoL scores, as well as more physician visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. Although most subjects received augmentation therapy on a weekly basis, other infusion schedules were more commonly observed in subjects with fewer exacerbations.

- **Conclusion**: COPD exacerbations occur frequently and are associated with significant disease burden in subjects with AATD receiving augmentation therapy.

### Identification of alpha-1 antitrypsin-deficient subjects with normal spirometry who may benefit from alpha-1 antitrypsin replacement [^113rJeV4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Fraughen and colleagues showed that alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation conferred a survival advantage by comparing the survival probability of AAT-deficient subjects from Ireland (where AAT augmentation is not given readily) with those from Austria and Switzerland (where AAT augmentation is given more readily). They also identified two groups of AAT-deficient subjects:

- **Lung index group**: Defined as AAT-deficient individuals who had undergone AAT testing for respiratory reasons or who had airflow limitation on initial spirometry, with just over 50% previously or currently receiving AAT augmentation.
- **Non–lung index group**: Those who underwent testing for other reasons and presumably had no airflow limitation on initial spirometry, with approximately 90% having never received AAT augmentation.

This important study showed a survival advantage with AAT replacement despite no observable improvement in FEV1, except for those in the lung index group with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stage 2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for whom there was a significant improvement in FEV1 with AAT augmentation.

Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic disease that is underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Early diagnosis in the asymptomatic patient helps modify lifestyle choices to reduce the risk of emphysema. In 2003, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society issued guidelines to improve standards in diagnosing alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. This review highlights key recommendations for diagnosis of alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, including the different types of diagnostic tests recommended in the guidelines. Options for patient treatment will be discussed.
