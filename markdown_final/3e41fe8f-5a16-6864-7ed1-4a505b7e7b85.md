## Question

how to decrease blood glucose in patients over 200

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to decrease blood glucose in patients with levels over 200 mg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is critically ill, non-critically ill, or outpatient. Then, I should verify the appropriate glycemic targets for each setting. Next, I will review first-line therapies, especially insulin, and when to add noninsulin agents. After that, I need to check dosing strategies, monitoring cadence, and hypoglycemia mitigation. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a practical algorithm with safety checks and transitions of care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because management differs substantially between critically ill inpatients, non-critically ill inpatients, and outpatients. In the ICU, continuous intravenous insulin is preferred and targets are more conservative to avoid hypoglycemia, whereas on the wards, scheduled subcutaneous insulin is standard, and in the outpatient setting, therapy is individualized with attention to comorbidities and hypoglycemia risk [^115FU21i] [^1157PyVF] [^112z9Yaz].

> I should confirm the treatment thresholds and targets before jumping to dosing. For critically ill adults, initiate insulin for persistent hyperglycemia at or above 180 mg/dL and target 140–180 mg/dL, avoiding lower targets due to increased hypoglycemia without outcome benefit. For non-critically ill inpatients, a reasonable target is 100–180 mg/dL if achievable without hypoglycemia. For outpatients, typical targets are fasting/preprandial 80–130 mg/dL and peak postprandial less than 180 mg/dL, individualized to age, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk [^115FU21i] [^112RwGVS] [^113ZZK4Y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "tight control". I initially thought lower targets might be better, but wait, the NICE-SUGAR trial showed increased mortality with intensive control to 81–108 mg/dL compared with 180 mg/dL or less, largely due to severe hypoglycemia, so I need to ensure we avoid overly aggressive targets in the ICU and prioritize safety and protocolized care instead [^114BtqQW].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy in the ICU. Continuous intravenous insulin infusion with validated, low-hypoglycemia protocols is recommended, with frequent glucose checks, often every 1–2 hours initially, and explicit decision-support tools to reduce errors. Transition to subcutaneous insulin should occur 1–4 hours before stopping the infusion to prevent rebound hyperglycemia [^115FU21i] [^113hk32L].

> For non-critically ill inpatients, I need to ensure we prefer scheduled basal-bolus insulin over sliding scale alone. Basal insulin provides background coverage, prandial insulin covers meals, and correction insulin treats hyperglycemia. Sliding-scale insulin alone is ineffective as monotherapy and should be avoided. If the patient has no prior diabetes, start with correctional insulin and escalate to scheduled insulin if hyperglycemia persists [^117RujRr] [^11431WzV] [^114J4x5y].

> Let me think about dosing specifics. A practical approach is to estimate total daily insulin (TDI) at about 0.4–0.5 units/kg/day, give half as basal and half as prandial divided before meals, then titrate daily to targets. For correction, a simple rule is 1 unit per 50 mg/dL above goal, but I should double-check the patient's insulin sensitivity and adjust the correction factor accordingly. For example, if TDI is 0.6–1.0 units/kg, a correction factor around 40–50 mg/dL per unit is reasonable, whereas higher TDI implies lower sensitivity and a smaller correction factor [^117SR3UG] [^116V5WDE].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence and safety thresholds. In the ICU, check glucose frequently, at least every 1–2 hours during infusion, and treat hypoglycemia immediately. On the wards, premeal and bedtime checks are standard, with additional checks if insulin is adjusted or nutrition changes. Hypoglycemia is defined as less than 70 mg/dL, and severe hypoglycemia as less than 40 mg/dL, both warranting prompt treatment and regimen review [^115FU21i] [^114qe4sd].

> For outpatients with persistent levels above 200 mg/dL, I need to check whether symptoms, catabolism, or ketosis are present. If A1C is markedly elevated or glucose is very high, initiate or intensify insulin, and consider adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist for added A1C lowering, weight loss, and reduced hypoglycemia risk. Metformin remains foundational if tolerated, and structured education improves outcomes and reduces hypoglycemia [^115C63cJ] [^115TcJLY] [^116B8pBC].

> But wait, what if the patient is on corticosteroids or has type 1 diabetes. In steroid-induced hyperglycemia, NPH insulin timed to match steroid peaks can be effective. In type 1 diabetes, never stop basal insulin in the hospital and ensure a plan for sick-day rules and ketone monitoring. In perioperative or procedural settings, maintain glucose less than 200 mg/dL when feasible and coordinate insulin strategies to avoid both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia [^115fPxRX] [^117RujRr] [^1147ZbtJ].

> I should double-check special neurologic contexts. In spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, treat moderate-to-severe hyperglycemia above 180–200 mg/dL to improve outcomes. In acute ischemic stroke, while hyperglycemia is prognostically adverse, the evidence for tight control is mixed, so careful, protocolized management is prudent rather than aggressive lowering [^115uoTyp] [^115U8jGV].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Identify context and confirm persistent hyperglycemia at or above 180 mg/dL. Choose ICU versus non-ICU pathway. Start IV insulin with validated protocol in the ICU or scheduled basal-bolus insulin on the wards. Monitor closely and titrate daily. Treat hypoglycemia promptly and adjust targets for high-risk patients. Plan transition off IV insulin before de-escalation and arrange outpatient follow-up with education and medication reconciliation [^115FU21i] [^117RujRr] [^113hk32L].

> In summary, I need to ensure the approach is evidence-based and safety-focused: treat persistent hyperglycemia at or above 180 mg/dL, target 140–180 mg/dL in the ICU and 100–180 mg/dL on the wards if safe, prefer continuous IV insulin in the ICU and scheduled basal-bolus insulin on the floors, avoid sliding scale monotherapy, monitor frequently, and individualize for comorbidities and hypoglycemia risk. This balances the harms of uncontrolled hyperglycemia with the risks of overly aggressive control [^115FU21i] [^112RwGVS] [^117RujRr].

To lower blood glucose in patients with levels > 200 mg/dL, **initiate insulin therapy** [^115C63cJ] if glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL or A1C is > 10% [^116t4cvs], using basal-bolus regimens with correction doses [^117RujRr] [^117SR3UG]. For less severe hyperglycemia, **start metformin** [^115TcJLY] if not contraindicated and titrate to 2,000 mg/day; add a GLP-1 receptor agonist [^115C63cJ] or SGLT2 inhibitor if additional lowering is needed or if weight/cardiovascular risk is present [^1154Rhy8]. Implement dietary changes (reduce refined carbs, increase fiber) [^117VRCp8], physical activity, and weight loss to improve insulin sensitivity [^1154Rhy8]. Monitor for hypoglycemia, adjust therapy based on response, and address underlying causes (e.g. steroids, infection) to sustain control [^114xGYdG] [^115fPxRX].

## Pharmacological interventions

### Insulin therapy

- **Indications**: Initiate insulin [^115C63cJ] if glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL or A1C is > 10% [^116t4cvs], or if symptomatic hyperglycemia is present [^116t4cvs].

- **Regimen**: Use basal-bolus insulin (long-acting basal plus rapid-acting prandial) with correction doses [^117RujRr] [^117SR3UG].

- **Titration**: Adjust doses every 2–3 days based on fasting and premeal glucose [^115HcGaP].

- **Monitoring**: Check glucose before meals and at bedtime; monitor for hypoglycemia [^114wiHZW].

---

### Oral antihyperglycemic agents

- **Metformin**: First-line unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min, severe hepatic disease); titrate to 2,000 mg/day [^115TcJLY].

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Add if additional lowering is needed or for weight/cardiovascular benefit [^115C63cJ] [^1154Rhy8].

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Consider for cardiovascular/renal benefit and additional A1C lowering [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

### Dietary modifications

Reduce refined carbohydrates and added sugars; **increase fiber** with whole grains, fruits, and vegetables [^117VRCp8]. Distribute carbohydrates consistently across meals to limit spikes [^notfound].

---

### Physical activity

Engage in **≥ 150 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g. brisk walking) [^notfound]. Include resistance training 2–3 times/week to improve insulin sensitivity [^notfound].

---

### Weight management

Aim for **5–10% weight loss** in overweight/obese patients to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Self-monitoring**: Use SMBG or CGM to guide therapy and detect hypoglycemia [^114wiHZW] [^117GuHVx].

- **A1C**: Recheck every 3–6 months to assess control and adjust therapy [^113FKPKm].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Treat promptly and modify regimen if recurrent [^114xGYdG].

---

## Addressing underlying causes

Identify and treat secondary causes such as **steroids, infections, or stress** [^115fPxRX]. Provide diabetes education to improve adherence and self-management [^116B8pBC].

### Tight blood glucose control: what is the evidence? [^112E971x]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

In two large, randomized studies, maintenance of normoglycemia with intensive insulin therapy largely prevented morbidity and reduced mortality of critically ill patients. Recently, questions have been raised about the efficacy and safety of this therapy. These issues are systematically addressed and discussed with the evidence available from these and other studies. The available studies show that an absolute reduction in risk of hospital death of 3% to 4% is to be expected from intensive insulin therapy in an intention-to-treat analysis. Future studies designed to confirm a statistically significant survival benefit should be adequately powered, with inclusion of ≥ 5,000 patients. When patients are treated with intensive insulin therapy for > 3 days, the absolute reduction in the risk of death increases to approximately 8%. Insulin therapy also improves morbidity, more so when continued for > 3 days. Strict blood glucose control to normoglycemia (< 110 mg/dL) is required to obtain the most clinical benefit, but this inherently increases the risk of hypoglycemia. It remains unclear whether short hypoglycemic episodes are truly harmful for these patients. In conclusion, demonstration of the clinical benefits of intensive insulin therapy depends on the quality of blood glucose control and the statistical power of the studies.

QUESTION 1: DOES IMPROVING GLYCEMIC CONTROL IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR INPATIENTS WITH HYPERGLYCEMIA?

Hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients, irrespective of its cause, is unequivocally associated with adverse outcomes (,–). Hyperglycemia occurs in patients with known or undiagnosed diabetes, or it occurs during acute illness in those with previously normal glucose tolerance (termed "stress hyperglycemia").

Intervention directed at reducing blood glucose (BG) levels has resulted in improved outcomes in some, but not all, studies (,–). Several recent clinical trials in critically ill patients have reported no reduction in mortality from intensive treatment targeting near-euglycemia versus conventional management targeting BG < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l). Of considerable concern are reports of harm, with higher rates of severe hypoglycemia and even increased mortality resulting from intensive glycemic control. This variability in results may be attributable to several factors, including differences in intravenous (IV) insulin treatment protocols and their implementation, glycemic targets, patient populations, methods for glucose monitoring, and insulin adjustment.

The following section focuses primarily on results of recent studies with an RCT design that investigated patient outcomes with protocols targeting near-normalization of BG levels. Readers are referred to a previous ACE position statement, an ACE/ADA consensus statement, and a technical review for details related to earlier studies supporting inpatient glycemic management.

Data derived from surgical and medical intensive care units

Observational studies have documented that hyperglycemia after cardiothoracic surgical procedures is associated with higher rates (approximately twofold) of wound infection. Interventions to reduce hyperglycemia in this setting with IV insulin therapy decrease infection rates and cardiac-related mortality, in comparison with historical control subjects.

The results of several RCTs conducted in critically ill patients in medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs) are summarized in Table 1 (,–). Intensive insulin therapy targeting arterial glucose levels of 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l) in a surgical ICU patient population resulted in a significant decrease in morbid ity and mortality. However, implementation of the identical protocol in 1,200 medical ICU patients by the same investigators in the same institution diminished morbidity but failed to reduce mortality. A sixfold increase in severe hypoglycemic events (BG < 40 mg/dl [2.2 mmol/l]) was observed in the intensively treated group (18.7 vs. 3.1%), and hypoglycemia was identified as an independent risk factor for mortality.

### Nonlinear metabolic effect of insulin across the blood glucose range in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^112P7NKU]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

For insulin therapy to successfully maintain blood glucose (BG) levels of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in normoglycemia, it is necessary to understand if the metabolic effect of insulin across the BG range is linear or not.

Methods

We assess the ability of insulin to lower BG in patients with T1DM in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The net metabolic effect of insulin, defined as the total effect resulting from both reduced endogenous glucose production and increased glucose uptake, was used to define the insulin effectiveness (IE), a measure that indicates the amplitude of glucose lowering that a unit of active insulin can achieve at a given BG level. The IE was assessed in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia through two separate studies. In the first study, patients were subjected to a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic and hypoglycemic glucose clamp. In the second study, another group of patients were clamped at a hyperglycemic level.

Results

The IE increased by 75% when BG dropped from 90 to 50 mg/dl at a steady rate of 1 mg/dl/min and decreased by 10% when BG was increased from 100 to 200 mg/dl.

Conclusions

The net metabolic effect of insulin is nonlinear across the BG range and is amplified in hypoglycemia and dampened in hyperglycemia. Most importantly, the BG lowering per unit of insulin is accelerated when falling into hypoglycemia. The understanding of the accelerated risk for hypoglycemia with falling glucose levels will help the design of more robust hypoglycemia prevention and detection systems.

Perioperative glucose management — outcomes and targets: Perioperative hyperglycemia, defined as blood glucose levels greater than 180–200 mg/dL, is associated with infection, increased length of stay, and postoperative mortality. Strict control may be considered in select patients because maintaining postoperative blood glucose less than 139 mg/dL has been shown to lower surgical site infection rate by 35% in women with diabetes mellitus and postoperative hyperglycemia; levels above this range should be managed with insulin and regular blood glucose monitoring. There are various protocols to achieve glycemic control, but data are too limited to recommend one specific protocol over another.

Serum glucose level before FDG administration — fasting and glucose thresholds are specified to ensure appropriate imaging conditions: the main objectives of patient preparation with at least 4 h of fasting are to ensure low blood glucose and low insulinaemia, and efforts should be made to decrease blood glucose to normal levels (typically 4–7 mmol/L), though hyperglycaemia should not represent an absolute contraindication; blood glucose level must be measured prior to administering FDG, and a calibrated and validated method must be used if plasma glucose is used to correct standardized uptake values (SUVs); on arrival, glucose should not be below 4 mmol/L (about 70 mg/dL); for clinical studies, if plasma glucose is lower than 11 mmol/L (about 200 mg/dL) the FDG PET/CT study can be performed; for research studies, the recommended upper plasma glucose levels may range between 7 and 8.3 mmol/L (126 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL), with the upper threshold specified in the protocol and patients outside the specified range often excluded.

### Is reducing variability of blood glucose the real but hidden target of intensive insulin therapy? [^114Y4kZw]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Since the first report that intensive insulin therapy reduced mortality in selected surgical critically ill patients, lowering of blood glucose levels has been recommended as a means of improving patient outcomes. In this initial Leuven trial, blood glucose control by protocol using insulin was applied to 98.7% of patients in the intensive group but to only 39.2% (P < 0.0001) of patients in the control group. If appropriately applied, such protocols should decrease both the mean blood glucose concentration and its variability (variation of blood glucose concentration). Thus, it is logically possible that the benefit of intensive insulin therapy in the first Leuven trial was due to a decrease in mean glucose levels, a decrease in their variability, or both. Several recent studies have confirmed significant associations between variability of blood glucose levels and patient outcomes. Decreasing the variability of blood glucose levels might be an important dimension of glucose management, a possible mechanism by which an intensive insulin protocol exerts its putative beneficial effects, and an important goal of glucose management in the intensive care unit. Clinicians need to be aware of this controversy when considering the application of intensive insulin therapy and interpreting future trials.

Diabetes Care in the Hospital

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) Non–critically ill patients: there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucose levels < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

### Effect of liberal glucose control on critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iDgN2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, our meta-analysis drew different conclusions compared to previous meta-analyses that have been published. Previous meta-analyses have evaluated the potential risks and benefits associated with strict blood glucose control(< 150 mg/dL) in adult patients who are critically ill. Previous analyses have established that strict blood glucose control does not significantly reduce the in-hospital mortality rate in critically ill adult patients. Yao et al. found that strict blood glucose control (80–120 mg/dL) significantly reduced all-cause mortality rate in their meta-analysis. However, these analyses did observe an increased incidence of severe hypoglycemia in critically ill adult patients subjected to strict blood glucose control. In 2001, Van den Berghe et al. conducted the first study on liberal glucose control (180–220 mg/dL). The study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial that enrolled adult patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in surgical ICUs. The participants were randomly assigned to either a strict blood glucose control group (target range of 80–110 mg/dL) or a liberal glucose control group (target range of 180–200 mg/dL). The study found that the liberal glucose control group had a reduced risk of hypoglycemia compared to the strict blood glucose control group (0.8% vs. 5.1%). The American College of Physicians recommends that the blood glucose level for ICU patients undergoing insulin therapy should be controlled within 140–200 mg/dL, and to prevent risks, patients should avoid having blood glucose levels less than 140 mg/dL. As per the guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, insulin therapy should be initiated when blood glucose levels surpass 180 mg/dL. Yamada et al. and Yatabe et al. performed network meta-analysis of four intervention measures to compare the effectiveness of insulin therapy in critically ill hyperglycemic adult patients with specific blood glucose control target ranges: tight control (80–100 mg/dL), moderate control (110–140 mg/dL), mild control (140–180 mg/dL), and extreme mild control (> 180 mg/dL). As per the study results, the liberal glucose control group demonstrated a lower likelihood of hypoglycemia when compared to the strict blood glucose control group. However, very few studies have directly compared blood glucose target ranges of > 180 mg/dL with 80–110 mg/dL or 108–180 mg/dL. Our meta-analysis mainly studied the effects of liberal glucose control (> 180 mg/dL) on critically ill patients, providing evidence for the selection of blood glucose control target ranges in critically ill patients.

### Implementation of a safe and effective insulin infusion protocol in a medical intensive care unit [^115mYNm7]. Diabetes Care (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In a recent randomized controlled trial, lowering blood glucose levels to 80–110 mg/dl improved clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. In that study, the insulin infusion protocol (IIP) used to normalize blood glucose levels provided valuable guidelines for adjusting insulin therapy. In our hands, however, ongoing expert supervision was required to effectively manage the insulin infusions. This work describes our early experience with a safe, effective, nurse-implemented IIP that provides detailed insulin dosing instructions and requires minimal physician input.

Research Design and Methods

We collected data from 52 medical intensive care unit (MICU) patients who were placed on the IIP. Blood glucose levels were the primary outcome measurement. Relevant clinical variables and insulin requirements were also recorded. MICU nurses were surveyed regarding their experience with the IIP.

Results

To date, our IIP has been employed 69 times in 52 patients admitted to an MICU. Using the IIP, the median time to reach target blood glucose levels (100–139 mg/dl) was 9 h. Once blood glucose levels fell below 140 mg/dl, 52% of 5,808 subsequent hourly blood glucose values fell within our narrow target range; 66% within a "clinically desirable" range of 80–139 mg/dl; and 93% within a "clinically acceptable" range of 80–199 mg/dl. Only 20 (0.3%) blood glucose values were < 60 mg/dl, none of which resulted in clinically significant adverse events. In general, the IIP was readily accepted by our MICU nursing staff, most of whom rated the protocol as both clinically effective and easy to use.

Conclusions

Our nurse-implemented IIP is safe and effective in improving glycemic control in critically ill patients.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^112z9Yaz]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

ANTIHYPERGLYCEMIC THERAPY

Glycemic targets

The ADA's "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" recommends lowering HbA 1c to < 7.0% in most patients to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease. This can be achieved with a mean plasma glucose of ∼8.3–8.9 mmol/L (∼150–160 mg/dL); ideally, fasting and premeal glucose should be maintained at < 7.2 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL) and the postprandial glucose at < 10 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL). More stringent HbA 1c targets (e.g. 6.0–6.5%) might be considered in selected patients (with short disease duration, long life expectancy, no significant CVD) if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, less stringent HbA 1c goals — e.g. 7.5–8.0% or even slightly higher — are appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbid conditions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self-management education, repeated counseling, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents, including insulin.

The accumulated results from the aforementioned type 2 diabetes cardiovascular trials suggest that not everyone benefits from aggressive glucose management. It follows that it is important to individualize treatment targets (,–). The elements that may guide the clinician in choosing an HbA 1c target for a specific patient are shown in Fig. 1. As mentioned earlier, the desires and values of the patient should also be considered, since the achievement of any degree of glucose control requires active participation and commitment. Indeed, any target could reflect an agreement between patient and clinician. An important related concept is that the ease with which more intensive targets are reached influences treatment decisions; logically, lower targets are attractive if they can be achieved with less complex regimens and no or minimal adverse effects. Importantly, utilizing the percentage of diabetic patients who are achieving an HbA 1c < 7.0% as a quality indicator, as promulgated by various health care organizations, is inconsistent with the emphasis on individualization of treatment goals.

Serum glucose level before FDG administration

The main objectives of patient preparation with at least 4 h of fasting are to ensure low blood glucose and low insulinaemia, as insulin is directly responsible for glucose uptake by nontumour cells. Although efforts should be made to decrease blood glucose to normal levels (typically 4–7 mmol/L) and insulinaemia to low levels, if the study is indicated in a patient with unstable ("brittle") or poorly controlled diabetes (often associated with infection), hyperglycaemia should not represent an absolute contraindication to the study, as fasting hyperglycaemia does not hamper the clinical value of FDG PET. Therefore we recommend the same advice and suggest recording the blood glucose level and any other information that could be relevant for interpretation of the examination.

Blood glucose level must be measured prior to administering FDG. A glucose meter (or glucometer) or a similar bedside device capable of performing overall blood glucose measurements can be used for this purpose, but a blood glucose test must be performed with a calibrated and validated method if plasma glucose level is to be used for correction of SUV measurements.

It is good practice to check the blood glucose of the patient on arrival at the imaging centre to ensure the level is not too low (not below 4 mmol/L, about 70 mg/dL) or too high, since this may avoid an unnecessary wait. For diabetic patients, it is suggested that blood glucose level is checked upon arrival in order to initiate, if necessary, manoeuvres to lower the blood glucose level as soon as possible. Certain patients can be asked to arrive at the imaging centre earlier than usual to allow more time to correct possible hyperglycaemic situations.

For clinical studies:
If the plasma glucose level is lower than 11 mmol/L (about 200 mg/dL), the FDG PET/CT study can be performed.
If the plasma glucose level is higher than or equal to 11 mmol/L (about 200 mg/dL), the FDG PET/CT study should be rescheduled or the patient excluded depending on the patient's circumstances and the trial being conducted.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115C63cJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — insulin thresholds and combinations specify that in adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [≥ 86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [≥ 16.7 mmol/L]); in adults with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of insulin deficiency, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin; if insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes, and insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA; and in adults initiating insulin therapy, continue glucose-lowering agents (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^115kDy8Z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes — pediatric plasma blood glucose and HbA1c goals by age group are as follows. For toddlers and preschoolers (< 6), before-meal plasma glucose is 100–180 mg/dL, bedtime/overnight is 110–200 mg/dL, and HbA1c is ≤ 8.5 (but ≥ 7.5). For school age children (6–12), before-meal plasma glucose is 90–180 mg/dL, bedtime/overnight is 100–180 mg/dL, and HbA1c is < 8. For adolescents and young adults (13–19), before-meal plasma glucose is 90–130 mg/dL, bedtime/overnight is 90–150 mg/dL, and HbA1c is < 7.5. A lower goal (< 7.0%) is reasonable if it can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia, and key concepts state that blood goals should be individualized and lower goals may be reasonable based on benefit-risk assessment; blood glucose goals should be higher than those listed in children with frequent hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness; and postprandial blood glucose values should be measured when there is a disparity between preprandial blood glucose values and HbA1c levels.

### Diabetes treatment and measures of glycemia [^1169hwd8]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Hospital insulin treatment strategies were explored by several groups. Garg et al. (abstract 71) randomized 24 nondiabetic individuals after cardiac surgery to standard treatment with or without administration of 0.15 units/kg insulin glargine daily for 3 days, finding mean glucose 126 vs. 133 mg/dl with intravenous insulin infusion for 8 vs. 15 h, respectively. Newton et al. (abstract 76) randomized 98 medical intensive care unit patients with blood glucose > 140 mg/dl to a computer-guided (Glucommander) vs. a column-based paper protocol insulin infusion algorithm. From initial glucose levels averaging 198 vs. 188 mg/dl, glucose 80–120 mg/dl was achieved in 5 vs. 8 h, respectively, with mean glucose values 103 vs. 120 mg/dl, using insulin infusion rates of 0.67 vs. 0.48 units · kg −1 · day −1. Glucose < 60 mg/dl was seen in 2.6 vs. 1.4% of tests, while levels > 200 mg/dl occurred at some point in 5 vs. 15 patients. Dukatz et al. (abstract 78) compared three preoperative insulin glargine dosing strategies in 165 insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients the evening prior to a surgical procedure: 1) taking 80% of the usual dose; 2) not using rapid-acting insulin and taking 50% if the usual self-reported fasting glucose was 150 mg/dl (otherwise 80%) or using rapid-acting insulin but omitting this on the morning of the procedure and taking 80 or 100% of the usual glargine the evening before based on usual fasting glucose more or less than 150 mg/dl, or 3) consulting their private physician. On arrival to the hospital, mean fasting glucose was 134, 132, and 128 mg/dl for those not taking rapid-acting insulin and 155, 134, and 149 mg/dl for those taking rapid-acting insulin in the three groups, with 5, 3, and 8% and 6, 4, and 9% having fasting glucose < 80 mg/dl and with 3, 0, and 6% and 14, 2, and 6% having fasting glucose > 250 mg/dl, respectively. None of the differences were statistically significant, leading the authors to suggest that simply taking 80% of the usual glargine dose appeared as effective as more complex dosing schemes.

Hormonal manipulation

Recommendations

We suggest targeting a blood glucose level at least below 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/l) for the prevention of hyperglycaemic kidney damage in the general ICU population (Grade 2B).
We suggest not using erythropoietin (Grade 2B) or steroids (Grade 2B) for prevention of acute kidney injury.

Rationale

In critical illness hyperglycaemia has been associated with adverse outcomes attributed to oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, alterations in haemostasis, immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. The anti-inflammatory effect of steroids may attenuate the inflammatory component of AKI pathogenesis. Erythropoietin (EPO), besides being a haematopoietic growth factor, also has tissue-protective properties by decreasing apoptosis and inflammation and by promoting neovascularization and tissue regeneration.

Clinical studies

A large prospective RCT in 1548 surgical ICU patients compared tight glucose control (TGC) with insulin (target blood glucose 80–110 mg/dL) to standard care (insulin when blood glucose is greater than 200 mg/dL resulting in a mean blood glucose of 150–160 mg/dL) and showed not only an improved survival rate but also a 41% reduction in AKI requiring RRT. Additionally, TGC also reduced the number of patients with peak plasma creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dL by 27%. A subsequent study in the medical ICU of the same hospital, including many patients that already had AKI on admission, did not confirm the effect on survival or need for RRT, but showed a 34% reduction in AKI, defined as a doubling of serum creatinine compared with the admission level. A combined analysis of both studies showed a more pronounced renal protection when normoglycaemia was achieved.

More recent RCTs in septic and general ICU patients (some of which had to be stopped early because of hypoglycaemia) including a large adequately powered multicentre trial in Australia and New Zealand (NICE-SUGAR) did not confirm the renoprotective effect. The latter even found a higher mortality in patients treated with TGC compared to an intermediate level. Clinicians should, however, be aware of important differences between these landmark trials, such as the glycaemic target in the control group, the nutritional strategy and the methods used to measure blood glucose levels. The most recent meta-analysis on this issue did not find a mortality benefit [RR 1.06 (0.99–1.13)] of TGC nor a renoprotective effect (evaluated by the need for RRT only) [RR 0.96 (0.83–1.11)] (ESM_2 Table 11).

### Glucose targets for preventing diabetic kidney disease and its progression [^1161Ecuc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) around the world. Blood pressure lowering and glucose control are used to reduce diabetes-associated disability including kidney failure. However there is a lack of an overall evidence summary of the optimal target range for blood glucose control to prevent kidney failure.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intensive (HbA1c < 7% or fasting glucose levels < 120 mg/dL versus standard glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7% or fasting glucose levels ≥ 120 mg/dL for preventing the onset and progression of kidney disease among adults with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 31 March 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating glucose-lowering interventions in which people (aged 14 year or older) with type 1 or 2 diabetes with and without kidney disease were randomly allocated to tight glucose control or less stringent blood glucose targets.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and risks of bias, extracted data and checked the processes for accuracy. Outcomes were mortality, cardiovascular complications, doubling of serum creatinine (SCr), ESKD and proteinuria. Confidence in the evidence was assessing using GRADE. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 29,319 people with diabetes were included and 11 studies involving 29,141 people were included in our meta-analyses. Treatment duration was 56.7 months on average (range 6 months to 10 years). Studies included people with a range of kidney function. Incomplete reporting of key methodological details resulted in uncertain risks of bias in many studies. Using GRADE assessment, we had moderate confidence in the effects of glucose lowering strategies on ESKD, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and progressive protein leakage by kidney disease and low or very low confidence in effects of treatment on death related to cardiovascular complications and doubling of serum creatinine (SCr). For the primary outcomes, tight glycaemic control may make little or no difference to doubling of SCr compared with standard control (4 studies, 26,874 participants: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.11; I² = 73%, low certainty evidence), development of ESKD (4 studies, 23,332 participants: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.12; I² = 52%; low certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (9 studies, 29,094 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.13; I² = 50%; moderate certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (6 studies, 23,673 participants: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.92; I² = 85%; low certainty evidence), or sudden death (4 studies, 5913 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.57; I² = 85%; very low certainty evidence). People who received treatment to achieve tighter glycaemic control probably experienced lower risks of non-fatal myocardial infarction (5 studies, 25,596 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99; I² = 46%, moderate certainty evidence), onset of microalbuminuria (4 studies, 19,846 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93; I² = 61%, moderate certainty evidence), and progression of microalbuminuria (5 studies, 13,266 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93; I² = 75%, moderate certainty evidence). In absolute terms, tight versus standard glucose control treatment in 1,000 adults would lead to between zero and two people avoiding non-fatal myocardial infarction, while seven adults would avoid experiencing new-onset albuminuria and two would avoid worsening albuminuria.

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that people who receive intensive glycaemic control for treatment of diabetes had comparable risks of kidney failure, death and major cardiovascular events as people who received less stringent blood glucose control, while experiencing small clinical benefits on the onset and progression of microalbuminuria and myocardial infarction. The adverse effects of glycaemic management are uncertain. Based on absolute treatment effects, the clinical impact of targeting an HbA1c < 7% or blood glucose < 6.6 mmol/L is unclear and the potential harms of this treatment approach are largely unmeasured.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^116TJNRr]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment of hyperglycemia in critically ill patients

On the basis of the available evidence, insulin infusion should be used to control hyperglycemia in the majority of critically ill patients in the ICU setting, with a starting threshold of no higher than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l). Once IV insulin therapy has been initiated, the glucose level should be maintained between 140 and 180 mg/dl (7.8 and 10.0 mmol/l). Greater benefit may be realized at the lower end of this range. Although strong evidence is lacking, somewhat lower glucose targets may be appropriate in selected patients. Targets < 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l), however, are not recommended. Use of insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, resulting in low rates of occurrence of hypoglycemia, is highly recommended.

Treatment of hyperglycemia in noncritically ill patients

With no prospective, RCT data for establishing specific guidelines in noncritically ill patients, our recommendations are based on clinical experience and judgment. For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, premeal glucose targets should generally be < 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/l) in conjunctionwith random BG values < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l), as long as these targets can be safely achieved. For avoidance of hypoglycemia, consideration should be given to reassessing the insulin regimen if BG levels decline below 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l). Modification of the regimen is necessary when BG values are < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l), unless the event is easily explained by other factors (such as a missed meal).

Occasional clinically stable patients with a prior history of successful tight glycemic control in the outpatient setting may be maintained with a glucose range below the aforementioned cut points. In contrast, higher glucose ranges may be acceptable in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities, as well as in those in patient-care settings where frequent glucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasible.

We emphasize that clinical judgment in combination with ongoing assessment of the patient's clinical status, including changes in the trajectory of glucose measures, the severity of illness, the nutritional status, or the concurrent use of medications that might affect glucose levels (for example, corticosteroids or octreotide), must be incorporated into the day-to-day decisions regarding insulin dosing.

Critically ill adults receiving neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) — blood glucose target: We suggest that clinicians target a blood glucose level of less than 180 mg/dL in patients receiving NMBAs (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Glycemic management — critically ill adults: Clinicians should initiate glycemic management protocols and procedures to treat persistent hyperglycemia, ≥ 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) in critically ill adults, and clinicians should use glycemic management protocols and procedures that demonstrate a low risk of hypoglycemia among critically ill adults and should treat hypoglycemia without delay; based on available randomized controlled trial data, we "suggest against" titrating an insulin infusion to a lower BG target INT: 4.4–7.7 mmol/L (80–139 mg/dL) as compared with a higher BG target range, CONV: 7.8–11.1 mmol/L (140–200 mg/dL) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia; observational data suggest a potential benefit of personalized glucose targets that more closely match chronic prehospital glycemic control, and we recommend high-quality interventional trials of individualized glycemic targets in critically ill adults, stratified by prior glycemic control; we "suggest" using continuous IV insulin infusion rather than intermittent subcutaneous insulin in the acute management of hyperglycemia in critically ill adults; we "suggest" frequent (≤ 1 hr, continuous or near-continuous) glucose monitoring compared with monitoring at intervals greater than hourly in the management of hyperglycemia in critically ill adults on IV insulin during periods of glycemic instability; and we "suggest" use of a protocol that includes explicit decision support tools (tools) over a protocol with no such tools in critically ill adults receiving IV insulin infusions for the management of hyperglycemia.

### Effectiveness of standardised preoperative assessment and patient instructions on admission blood glucose for patients with diabetes undergoing orthopaedic surgery at a tertiary referral hospital [^111msAa6]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background

In 2015, 30.3 million Americans (9.4% of the general population) carried a diagnosis of diabetes. The estimated cost of diabetes in the USA in 2012 was $245 billion for direct and indirect expenditures. Observational studies show that patients with diabetes who undergo surgery have greater healthcare utilisation, longer hospital stays, more infectious complications and higher perioperative mortality than patients without diabetes. Improved glycaemic control has been associated with a decrease in morbidity and mortality, particularly for cardiac surgery and critically ill patients.

Despite these observations, a clear consensus on postoperative, intraoperative and preoperative glucose targets and management of hyperglycaemia has been elusive. Treatment goals and recommendations vary significantly between professional societies and apply to varying patient populations in different care settings. The strongest evidence showing the benefit of glycaemic control in the postoperative setting is Van Den Berghe's single-centre study of mechanically ventilated patients. Recommendations for intraoperative glucose targets are also variable, extrapolated from a number of trials, most focused on cardiac surgery. The largest study is the Portland Diabetes Project, a non-randomised trial that targeted an intraoperative blood glucose of < 200 mg/dL for patients with diabetes undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 4864), which showed a reduction in mortality. Using the best evidence available, the Endocrine Society and the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia has issued consensus guidelines recommending a target of < 180 mg/dL intraoperatively. Data to support any specific preoperative blood glucose target have also been scarce. In one large (n = 61 536) observational study, Abdelmalak et al found that patients with preoperative blood glucose values of 60–100 mg/dL had a significantly lower 1-year mortality rate than those presenting with a blood glucose > 216 mg/dL. Thus, there is no singular, definitive glucose target range in the preoperative setting. Likewise, recommendations for management are variable and generally based on pharmacological principles and small studies.

### Effect of continuous glucose monitoring on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a randomized clinical trial [^112c3VcS]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to be beneficial for adults with type 2 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy, but its use in type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin has not been well studied.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of CGM in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin in primary care practices.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 15 centers in the US (enrollment from July 30, 2018, to October 30, 2019; follow-up completed July 7, 2020) and included adults with type 2 diabetes receiving their diabetes care from a primary care clinician and treated with 1 or 2 daily injections of long- or intermediate-acting basal insulin without prandial insulin, with or without noninsulin glucose-lowering medications.

Interventions

Random assignment 2:1 to CGM (n = 116) or traditional blood glucose meter (BGM) monitoring (n = 59).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at 8 months. Key secondary outcomes were CGM-measured time in target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL, time with glucose level at greater than 250 mg/dL, and mean glucose level at 8 months.

Results

Among 175 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 57 [9] years; 88 women [50%]; 92 racial/ethnic minority individuals [53%]; mean [SD] baseline HbA1c level, 9.1% [0.9%]), 165 (94%) completed the trial. Mean HbA1c level decreased from 9.1% at baseline to 8.0% at 8 months in the CGM group and from 9.0% to 8.4% in the BGM group (adjusted difference, -0.4% [95% CI, -0.8% to -0.1%]; P = 0.02). In the CGM group, compared with the BGM group, the mean percentage of CGM-measured time in the target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL was 59% vs 43% (adjusted difference, 15% [95% CI, 8% to 23%]; P < .001), the mean percentage of time at greater than 250 mg/dL was 11% vs 27% (adjusted difference, -16% [95% CI, -21% to -11%]; P < .001), and the means of the mean glucose values were 179 mg/dL vs 206 mg/dL (adjusted difference, -26 mg/dL [95% CI, -41 to -12]; P < .001). Severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 1 participant (1%) in the CGM group and in 1 (2%) in the BGM group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin, continuous glucose monitoring, as compared with blood glucose meter monitoring, resulted in significantly lower HbA1c levels at 8 months.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 195: prevention of infection after gynecologic procedures [^1147ZbtJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Perioperative glycemic control for infection prevention — Implement perioperative glycemic control and use blood glucose target levels of less than 200 mg/dL in patients with and without diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not find any randomized trials using glucose targets less than 200 mg/dL, and the two trials used to establish the 200 mg/dL target were from cardiac surgery; other guidelines use a target of 180 mg/dL. Collaboration with a diabetes management team may be beneficial, and whether stricter glycemic control improves outcomes is controversial. Implementation of an insulin infusion protocol for strict glycemic control lowered surgical site infection rates more than a previously used sliding scale insulin protocol in gynecologic oncology patients, but a Cochrane review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend strict control compared with conventional control.

### Glucose modifies the effect of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute stroke [^115U8jGV]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Hyperglycemia is a negative prognostic factor after acute ischemic stroke but is not known whether glucose is associated with the effects of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in patients with large-vessel stroke. In a pooled-data meta-analysis, we analyzed whether serum glucose is a treatment modifier of the efficacy of EVT in acute stroke. Methods- Seven randomized trials compared EVT with standard care between 2010 and 2017 (HERMES Collaboration [highly effective reperfusion using multiple endovascular devices]). One thousand seven hundred and sixty-four patients with large-vessel stroke were allocated to EVT (n = 871) or standard care (n = 893). Measurements included blood glucose on admission and functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale range, 0–6; lower scores indicating less disability) at 3 months. The primary analysis evaluated whether glucose modified the effect of EVT over standard care on functional outcome, using ordinal logistic regression to test the interaction between treatment and glucose level. Results- Median (interquartile range) serum glucose on admission was 120 (104–140) mg/dL (6.6 mmol/L [5.7–7.7] mmol/L). EVT was better than standard care in the overall pooled-data analysis adjusted common odds ratio (acOR), 2.00 (95% CI, 1.69–2.38); however, lower glucose levels were associated with greater effects of EVT over standard care. The interaction was nonlinear such that significant interactions were found in subgroups of patients split at glucose < or > 90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L; P = 0.019 for interaction; acOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.73–8.41 for patients < 90 mg/dL versus 1.83; 95% CI, 1.53–2.19 for patients > 90 mg/dL), and glucose < or > 100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L; P = 0.004 for interaction; acOR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.04–4.93 versus acOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.42–2.08) but not between subgroups above these levels of glucose. Conclusions- EVT improved stroke outcomes compared with standard treatment regardless of glucose levels, but the treatment effects were larger at lower glucose levels, with significant interaction effects persisting up to 90 to 100 mg/dL (5.0–5.5 mmol/L). Whether tight control of glucose improves the efficacy of EVT after large-vessel stroke warrants appropriate testing.

Insulin.

Insulin is the oldest of the currently available medications and, therefore, the treatment with which we have the most clinical experience. It is also the most effective at lowering glycemia. Insulin can, when used in adequate doses, decrease any level of elevated A1C to, or close to, the therapeutic goal. Unlike the other blood glucose–lowering medications, there is no maximum dose of insulin beyond which a therapeutic effect will not occur. Relatively large doses of insulin (≥ 1 unit/kg), compared with those required to treat type 1 diabetes, may be necessary to overcome the insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes and lower A1C to the target level. Although initial therapy is aimed at increasing basal insulin supply, usually with intermediate- or long-acting-insulins, patients may also require prandial therapy with short- or rapid-acting insulins (Fig. 1). The very rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogues have not been shown to lower A1C levels more effectively than the older, rapid-acting or intermediate-acting formulations. Insulin therapy has beneficial effects on triacylglycerol and HDL cholesterol levels, especially in patients with poor glycemic control, but is associated with weight gain of ∼2–4 kg, which is probably proportional to the correction of glycemia and predominantly the result of the reduction of glycosuria. Insulin therapy is also associated with hypoglycemia, albeit much less frequently than in type 1 diabetes. In clinical trials aimed at normoglycemia and achieving a mean A1C of ∼7%, severe hypoglycemic episodes (defined as requiring help from another person to treat) occurred at a rate of between one and three per 100 patient-years (,–), compared with 61 per 100 patient-years in the DCCT intensive therapy group. Insulin analogues with longer, nonpeaking profiles decrease the risk of hypoglycemia modestly compared with NPH, and analogues with very short durations of action reduce the risk of hypoglycemia compared with regular insulin.

A mixed group of patients with and without diabetes admitted to a surgical ICU were randomized to receive intensive insulin therapy (target blood glucose 80–110 mg/dl [4.4–6.1 mmol/l]) or conventional therapy. Intensive insulin therapy achieved a mean blood glucose of 103 mg/dl (5.7 mmol/l) and was associated with reduced mortality during the ICU stay and decreased overall in-hospital mortality. Hospital and ICU survival were linearly associated with ICU glucose levels, with the highest survival rates occurring in patients achieving an average blood glucose < 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l).

A subsequent study of a similar intervention in patients in a medical ICU showed that the group receiving intensive insulin therapy had reduced morbidity but no difference in mortality overall. Death rates were significantly lower in those patients who were treated for longer than 3 days; but these patients could not be identified before therapy. In another study using a similar intervention targeting a blood glucose range of 4.4–6.1 mmol in patients admitted with sepsis, no difference in mortality from the conventionally treated group was observed. There were more episodes of hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose < 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/l), and more serious adverse events in the group receiving intensive insulin therapy.

While an earlier meta-analysis concluded that insulin therapy in critically ill patients had a beneficial effect on short-term mortality in different clinical settings, a more recent meta-analysis, involving 29 studies and over 8,000 patients, failed to show any mortality benefit from intensive glucose control. Tight glucose control did reduce the relative risk of septicemia by 26%. While this latter meta-analysis investigated strategies with target blood glucose levels of 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l), studies with less stringent glucose targets were also included. Stratification by glucose target did not demonstrate any heterogeneity. The authors of this analysis as well as an accompanying editorial both recommend that glycemic targets in critically ill patients be revisited.

While results from ongoing clinical trials are still pending, it is clear that uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in critically ill patients and that achieving levels of glucose control below 140 mg/dl are reasonable, provided that protocols that minimize risk for hypoglycemia are utilized and that personnel are well educated in the direct application of these protocols.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) vs self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) — nonpregnant population: The systematic review included 10 RCTs comparing real-time CGM vs SMBG. In the nonpregnant population, CGM may reduce the proportion of patients with glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (odds ratio [OR] 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.41), likely reduces episodes of severe hypoglycemia (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.85), and likely increases the percentage of time in range (TIR) 70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) (mean difference [MD] 5.20; 95% CI, 3.10 to 7.29). Evidence suggests no difference in the incidence of episodes of glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L), seizures, time below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), or HbA1c level, with the stated certainty ratings.

QUESTION 3: WHAT TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ACHIEVING OPTIMAL GLYCEMIC TARGETS SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY IN SPECIFIC CLINICAL SITUATIONS?

In the hospital setting, insulin therapy is the preferred method for achieving glycemic control in most clinical situations. In the ICU, IV infusion is the preferred route of insulin administration. Outside of critical care units, subcutaneous administration of insulinis usedmuch more frequently. Orally administered agents have a limited role in the inpatient setting.

IV insulin infusions

In the critical care setting, continuous IV insulin infusion has been shown to be the most effective method for achieving specific glycemic targets. Because of the very short half-life of circulating insulin, IV delivery allows rapid dosing adjustments to address alterations in the status of patients.

IV insulin therapy is ideally administered by means of validated written or computerized protocols that allow for predefined adjustments in the insulin infusion rate based on glycemic fluctuations and insulin dose. An extensive review of the merits and deficiencies of published protocols is beyond the intent of this statement, and readers are referred to several available reports and reviews. Continued education of staff in conjunction with periodic ongoing review of patient data is critical for successful implementation of any insulin protocol.

Patients who receive IV insulin infusions will usually require transition to subcutaneously administered insulin when they begin eating regular meals or are transferred to lower-intensity care. Typically, a percentage (usually 75–80%) of the total daily IV infusion dose isproportionately divided into basal and prandial components (see subsequent material). Importantly, subcutaneously administered insulin must be given 1–4 h before discontinuation of IV insulin therapy in order to prevent hyperglycemia. Despite these recommendations, a safe and effective transition regimen has not been substantiated.

### Coefficient of glucose variation is independently associated with mortality in critically ill patients receiving intravenous insulin [^112x9MS2]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal management of blood glucose in the ICU remains unclear. A study of surgical ICU patients in Leuven, Belgium, demonstrated that insulin therapy aimed at achieving blood glucose between 80 and 110 mg/dL (tight glucose control) decreased subject mortality compared to conventional treatment (maintenance of blood glucose between 180 and 200 mg/dL). Subsequent studies evaluating the role of insulin therapy in the ICU either failed to confirm these results, or were terminated early due to high hypoglycemia rates. The largest prospective multicenter trial to date (Normoglycaemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation, NICE-SUGAR) reported an increase in 90-day mortality for the group with an 80 to 110 mg/dL blood glucose target when compared to a target of < 180 mg/dL. Despite continued uncertainty in glucose management, professional societies currently recommend moderate glucose control for all critically ill adult patients.

### The effect of tight glycaemic control, during and after cardiac surgery, on patient mortality and morbidity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113YCJn6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Only one study, Ingels et al, looked at long-term mortality as a consequence of tight or normal glycaemic control, and found no significant differences between the groups at two to four years following surgery. This suggests that tight compared to normal glycaemic control may have a short-term effect on reducing mortality, but this difference is not translated into a long-term survival.

Our results on the effects of tight glycaemic control on mortality are in contrast to those reported in the NICE-SUGAR trial, which found that blood glucose control below 108 mg/dL was associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality in ICU patients. The reason for the discrepancy may be due to one or more of the following reasons; 1) The NICE study only looked at glucose control in the post-operative period. The studies in this review include data from both the peri-operative and post-operative periods; 2) The NICE study included data from surgical and non-surgical patients, where this review includes data only from cardiac surgery patients, who may have a different response to tight glycaemic control compared to the general ICU patient; and 3) the definition of "tight" glycaemic control in the NICE study was 80–108 mg./dL, whereas in this review, the glycaemic ranges used varied from < 110 mg/dL, 80–120 mg/dL and 125–200 mg/dL. Interestingly, the only study that did not report ANY mortality, the Lazar study, also had the highest range of blood glucose levels in their tight control group (125–200 mg/dL). This raises the question as to the optimum level of glucose control, which has yet to be evaluated in a randomised trial, and the possibility that lower isn't necessarily better.

### Optimal hyperglycemia thresholds in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a cross sectional study of oncologists' practices [^111cVVrk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Thresholds to define hyperglycemia in cancer patients vary significantly in the literature. Storey et al. reviewed 30 studies that used a wide range of blood glucose levels to define hyperglycemia (e.g. 99 to < 126 mg/dL, greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, greater than 200 mg/dL). Other studies used quartiles in accordance with the mean glucose levels beginning at 106 mg/dL, 106.7–117.2 mg/dL, 117.3–142.6 mg/dL, and ending at 142.6 mg/dL, while others described a classification of mild, moderate and severe, beginning at 121 mg/dL. Only seven of the 30 studies used the American Diabetes Association (ADA)'s criteria for diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes. Diabetes is defined by the ADA as a fasting blood glucose equal or greater than 126 mg/dL, or a 2-h plasma glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test equal-to or greater than 200 mg/dL, or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) equal-to or greater than 6.5%, or a random plasma glucose equal-to or greater than 200 mg/dL in patients with symptoms of hyperglycemia.

Despite individual efforts to guide and educate oncologists and oncology nurses on how to manage diabetes and hyperglycemia in cancer patients, it was not until May 2022 that a multidisciplinary team working on behalf of the United Kingdom Chemotherapy Board and the Joint British Diabetes Society for Inpatient Care created guidelines for the management of hyperglycemia in cancer patients with or without prior diabetes starting anticancer or glucocorticoid therapy. The document also provides guidance on identifying cancer patients who are at risk for hyperglycemic episodes and new onset diabetes mellitus. Neither the United States (US) nor the European oncology guidelines include details for the appropriate management of hyperglycemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy. In the US, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 included specific blood glucose thresholds to classify hyperglycemia severity on a grade from 1–5. However, the currently used CTCAE version 5.0 presents a qualitative description of each severity level based on the medical and therapeutic interventions needed, without specifying any quantitative thresholds. Furthermore, few package inserts for anticancer medications that are known to cause hyperglycemia include recommendations for dose-holding or reductions according to blood glucose level. Considering this relative lack of guidance, it is unclear what target blood glucose levels clinicians in cancer centers use in clinical practice when managing patients with cancer experiencing hyperglycemia.

QUESTION 2: WHAT GLYCEMIC TARGETS CAN BE RECOMMENDED IN DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS?

The management of hyperglycemia in the hospital presents unique challenges that stem from variations in a patient's nutritional status and level of consciousness, the practical limitations of intermittent glycemic monitoring, and the ultimate importance of patient safety. Accordingly, reasonable glucose targets in the hospital setting are modestly higher than may be routinely advised for patients with diabetes in the outpatient setting.

Definition of glucose abnormalities

In this report, hyperglycemia is defined as any BG value > 140 mg/dl (> 7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this level may necessitate treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated BG concentrations may be due to stress hyperglycemia, a condition that can be established by a review of prior medical records or measurement of A1C. A1C values of > 6.5–7.0% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization.

Hypoglycemia is defined as any BG level < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many clinicians as < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l), although this value is lower than the approximate 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l], respectively) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

Hospital hyperglycemia in non–critical care — correctional insulin versus basal–bolus insulin (BBI) evidence: A systematic review identified 9 studies (6 RCTs and 3 non-RCTs) with heterogeneous protocols, including rescue thresholds above 180 to 240 mg/dL (10.0 to 13.3 mmol/L). In several studies, patients receiving correctional insulin alone had more frequent BG levels > 300 mg/dL (> 16.7 mmol/L) and > 400 mg/dL (> 22.2 mmol/L). The overall certainty of the evidence for this question is very low. Panel deliberations noted general but not unanimous agreement that premix insulin preparations (eg, 70/30, 50/50, 75/25) not be considered as BBI. Proposed research priorities include using CGM to better assess glycemic efficacy and safety of different insulin regimens and using correctional insulin as part of a scheduled insulin regimen for patients with T1D using multiple daily injections or automated insulin delivery systems.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

I. Critically ill patients

Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia, starting at a threshold of no greater than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l).
Once insulin therapy has been started, a glucose range of 140–180 mg/dl (7.8–10.0 mmol/l) is recommended for the majority of critically ill patients.
Intravenous insulin infusions are the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glycemic control in critically ill patients.
Validated insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, and with low rates of occurrence of hypoglycemia, are recommended.
With IV insulin therapy, frequent glucose monitoring is essential to minimize the occurrence of hypoglycemia and to achieve optimal glucose control.

II. Noncritically ill patients

For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, the premeal BG target should generally be < 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/l) in conjunction with random BG values < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l), provided these targets can be safely achieved.
More stringent targets may be appropriate in stable patients with previous tight glycemic control.
Less stringent targets may be appropriate in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities.
Scheduled subcutaneous administration of insulin, with basal, nutritional, and correction components, is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control.
Prolonged therapy with SSI as the sole regimen is discouraged.
Noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents are not appropriate in most hospitalized patients who require therapy for hyperglycemia.
Clinical judgment and ongoing assessment of clinical status must be incorporated into day-to-day decisions regarding treatment of hyperglycemia.

III. Safety issues

Overtreatment and undertreatment of hyperglycemia represent major safety concerns.
Education of hospital personnel is essential in engaging the support of those involved in the care of inpatients with hyperglycemia.
Caution is required in interpreting results of POC glucose meters in patients with anemia, polycythemia, hypoperfusion, or use of some medications.
Buy-in and financial support from hospital administration are required for promoting a rational systems approach to inpatient glycemic management.

IV. Cost

Appropriate inpatient management of hyperglycemia is cost-effective.

V. Discharge planning

Preparation for transition to the outpatient setting should begin at the time of hospital admission.
Discharge planning, patient education, and clear communication with outpatient providers are critical for ensuring a safe and successful transition to outpatient glycemic management.

VI. Needed research

A selected number of research questions and topics for guiding the management of inpatient hyperglycemia in various hospital settings are proposed.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) perioperative glucose and antibiotic management — continuous intravenous infusion of insulin is effective in maintaining blood glucose < 180 mg/dL in patients undergoing CABG to reduce the risk of sternal wound infection, yet a study targeting 100 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL versus 141 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL in the intensive care unit did not demonstrate reduced perioperative complications after CABG, and there is general agreement that continuation of prophylactic antibiotics for > 48 hours lacks additional benefit. Mupirocin is effective in reducing Staphylococcus aureus infection in nasal carriers, and topical vancomycin paste may have benefit. In an RCT of 400 patients, intraoperative intensive treatment (glucose levels 80–100 mg/dL) versus conventional treatment (insulin only for a glucose concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL) found no difference between groups in a composite endpoint within 30 days, and in another RCT of 381 patients without diabetes, intraoperative insulin for blood glucose concentrations exceeded 100 mg/dL had no significant effect on combined neurological outcomes or length of hospital stay, highlighting that extremely tight control of blood glucose after CABG is not associated with improved outcomes.

### Diabetes mellitus: screening and diagnosis [^111fpLCj]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diagnoses made by family physicians. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure, and vascular and heart disease. Screening patients before signs and symptoms develop leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment, but may not reduce rates of end-organ damage. Randomized trials show that screening for type 2 diabetes does not reduce mortality after 10 years, although some data suggest mortality benefits after 23 to 30 years. Lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions decrease progression to diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes in adults 40 to 70 years of age who are overweight or obese, and repeating testing every three years if results are normal. Individuals at higher risk should be considered for earlier and more frequent screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes annually in patients 45 years and older, or in patients younger than 45 years with major risk factors. The diagnosis can be made with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg per dL or greater; an A1C level of 6.5% or greater; a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater; or a 75-g two-hour oral glucose tolerance test with a plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater. Results should be confirmed with repeat testing on a subsequent day; however, a single random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater with typical signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia likely indicates diabetes. Additional testing to determine the etiology of diabetes is not routinely recommended.

### Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (Glucovance) [^113FKP27]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General Considerations

Dosage of GLUCOVANCE must be individualized
on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum
recommended daily dose of 20 mg glyburide/2000 mg metformin. GLUCOVANCE
should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual
dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely
due to glyburide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and
permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of
blood glucose for the individual patient.

With initial
treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring
should be used to determine the therapeutic response to GLUCOVANCE and to
identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1cshould
be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness
of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to
decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1cto normal or as near normal
as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c(glycosylated
hemoglobin), which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than
FPG alone.

No studies have been performed specifically
examining the safety and efficacy of switching to GLUCOVANCE therapy in patients
taking concomitant glyburide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes
in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia
or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should
be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring.

GLUCOVANCE in Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise

Recommended starting dose: 1.25
mg/250 mg once or twice daily with meals.

For
patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily
managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dose of GLUCOVANCE
is 1.25 mg/250 mg once a day with a meal. As initial therapy in patients with
baseline HbA1c > 9% or an FPG > 200 mg/dL,
a starting dose of GLUCOVANCE 1.25 mg/250 mg twice daily with the morning
and evening meals may be used. Dosage increases should be made in increments
of 1.25 mg/250 mg per day every 2 weeks
up to the minimum effective dose necessary to achieve adequate control of
blood glucose. In clinical trials of GLUCOVANCE as initial therapy, there
was no experience with total daily doses > 10 mg/2000 mg per day. GLUCOVANCE
5 mg/500 mg should not be used as initial
therapy due to an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

Systematic review evidence — structured education outcomes in diabetes reports that the SR identified 19 studies, 10 RCTs, and 9 nonrandomized comparative trials comparing structured counseling vs no structured counseling. Participation in a structured program of patient education may reduce the number of episodes of severe hypoglycemia (OR 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.47; low-certainty evidence) and HbA1c at follow-up in randomized (MD −0.35; 95% CI, −0.50 to −0.20; moderate-certainty evidence) and nonrandomized studies (MD −0.34; 95% CI, −0.40 to −0.29; very low–certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Structured educational programs may result in less percentage of time with glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (MD −2.8; 95% CI, −2.4 to −3.2; very low–certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain, and there may be no differences in the proportion of participants with glucose less than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or percentage of time spent in the 70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) range or below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (low-certainty evidence). The evidence also suggests there were no differences found in the proportion of patients having severe hypoglycemia or death (very low–certainty evidence), but it is very uncertain.

### Association between blood glucose level trajectories and 30-day mortality risk in patients with acute ischemic stroke: analysis of the MIMIC database 2001–2019 [^113VZrj5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the type 3 and type 4 trajectories had higher blood glucose levels (> 250 mg/dL) on admission, they returned to relatively low levels (< 190 mg/dL) over the following 24 h. This may suggest that patients with type 3 and type 4 trajectories are more sensitive to interventions through which blood glucose levels can be lowered as quickly as possible. However, although patients with type 2 trajectories had slightly lower admission glucose levels (> 200 mg/dL) than patients with types 3 and 4, the blood glucose level of patients with the type 2 trajectory was always around 200 mg/dL in the following 24 h, and the decrease was not significant. This may indicate that the intervention did not significantly reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 trajectory, which may also explain why patients with type 2 trajectory are associated with a higher 30-day mortality risk. However, no previous studies have reported the effect of blood glucose level trajectories after ICU admission on the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with AIS, and we were unable to compare our blood glucose level trajectory with previous studies. For the effects of long-term hyperglycemia, a 6-year prospective cohort study demonstrated a higher risk of all-cause mortality in the general population in individuals with low-increase and high-increase glycemic trajectories, even if the individuals had normal blood glucose levels at baseline. Several studies have reported the mechanisms of hyperglycemia after ischemic stroke. First, the high incidence of hyperglycemia after ischemic stroke may be related to preexisting abnormalities of glucose metabolism (e.g. insulin resistance). Second, stroke causes a global stress response with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Activation of this complex neural circuitry leads to an increase in serum glucocorticoid (including cortisol) levels and activation of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system, leading to an increase in catecholamine release, and these promote glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, proteolysis, and lipolysis, which in turn lead to excess glucose production.

### Recommendations… [^1113n6ox]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- For most persons with diabetes, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease.
- An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used to treat hypertension.
- Patients should receive a high-intensity statin if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD.
- A dosage of 75 to 162 mg per day of aspirin is an option in persons with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10%. From the AFP Editors. Additionally, less strict goals can be used for patients if the goal is hard to meet even with intensive self-management education, counseling, and treatment with medications aimed at lowering glucose levels. For most persons, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease. To lower A1C to this level, mean plasma glucose should be 150 to 160 mg per dL, fasting and premeal glucose should be less than 130 mg per dL, and postprandial glucose should be less than 180 mg per dL. Most persons with diabetes should have a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg; however, in some persons, lower goals may be suitable if they are possible to reach without problems. If a person's hypertension is treated with medications, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used, including in persons with chronic kidney disease. CHOLESTEROL Lipid levels in persons with diabetes should be measured once or more per year, and lifestyle changes should be emphasized, including reducing consumption of saturated and trans fats, losing weight, increasing consumption of dietary fiber, and being more physically active. NUTRITION All persons with diabetes should receive nutrition therapy personalized to them.

To control blood glucose levels, it is important to monitor how many carbohydrates are consumed, and it should be noted that fruits, legumes, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy products may be substituted for other sources of carbohydrates. A Mediterranean-type diet can also help with controlling blood glucose levels and CVD risk factors. Sodium intake should be limited.

### Safety and efficacy of an intensive care insulin infusion protocol targeting a blood glucose of 140 to 180 mg / dL [^113cprwP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite multiple guideline recommendations of a goal blood glucose of 140 to 180 mg/dL in critically ill patients, no insulin infusion protocols (IIPs) targeting this range have been validated and published in the literature.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of an IIP targeting a blood glucose of 140 to 180 mg/dL in critically ill patients, with the ultimate goal of validating such a protocol.

Methods

This retrospective chart review uses data of critically ill patients admitted from August 2018 to December 2018. Patient data from August 2017 to December 2017 served as a historical comparator to further assess safety outcomes. Percent of blood glucose readings within goal was the primary outcome measurement. Relevant clinical variables, insulin requirements, hypoglycemic events, and protocol adherence were also recorded.

Results

A total of 88 insulin infusions were included in analysis, 34 of which served as a historical comparator. In the IIP targeting a blood glucose 140 to 180 mg/dL, once blood glucose levels decreased below 180 mg/dL, 54% of blood glucose readings were within goal (140–180 mg/dL) and 73% of blood glucose readings were within a "clinically acceptable" range (110–180 mg/dL). The number of hypoglycemic events decreased from 70 in the historical comparator group to 4 in the current IIP (P < .0001).

Conclusion and Relevance

This IIP is both safe and effective at targeting a blood glucose of 140 to 180 mg/dL and could be used at other institutions to achieve satisfactory glycemic control.

### Insulin lispro [^117Y1VYh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs, including insulin lispro. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhance protein synthesis.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Insulin Lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis. One unit of Insulin Lispro has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin. Studies in normal volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that Insulin Lispro has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously.

The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs, such as Insulin Lispro, may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The parameters of Insulin Lispro activity (time of onset, peak time, and duration) as designated in Figure 1 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption, and consequently the onset of activity are known to be affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

aBaseline insulin concentration was maintained by infusion of 0.2 mU/min/kg human insulin.

Intravenous Administration — The glucose lowering effect of intravenously administered Insulin Lispro was tested in 21 patients with type 1 diabetes. For the study, the patients' usual doses of insulin were held and blood glucose concentrations were allowed to reach a stable range of 200 to 260 mg/dL during a one to three hours run-in phase. The run-in phase was followed by a 6-hour assessment phase. During the assessment phase, patients received intravenous Insulin Lispro at an initial infusion rate of 0.5 units/hour. The infusion rate of Insulin Lispro could be adjusted at regular timed intervals to achieve and maintain blood glucose concentrations between 100 to 160 mg/dL.

The mean blood glucose levels during the assessment phase for patients on Insulin Lispro therapy are summarized below in Table 4. All patients achieved the targeted glucose range at some point during the 6-hour assessment phase. At the endpoint, blood glucose was within the target range (100 to 160 mg/dL) for 17 of 20 patients treated with Insulin Lispro. The average time (± SE) required to attain near normoglycemia was 129 ± 14 minutes for Insulin Lispro.

Although extensive dosing instructions for insulin are beyond the scope of this statement, most patients can be taught to uptitrate their own insulin dose based on several algorithms, each essentially involving the addition of a small dose increase if hyperglycemia persists. For example, the addition of 1–2 units (or, in those already on higher doses, increments of 5–10%) to the daily dose once or twice weekly if the fasting glucose levels are above the preagreed target is a reasonable approach. As the target is neared, dosage adjustments should be more modest and occur less frequently. Downward adjustment is advisable if any hypoglycemia occurs. During self-titration, frequent contact (telephone, e-mail) with the clinician may be necessary. Practitioners themselves can, of course, also titrate basal insulin, but this would involve more intensive contact with the patient than typically available in routine clinical practice. Daily self-monitoring of blood glucose is of obvious importance during this phase. After the insulin dose is stabilized, the frequency of monitoring should be reviewed.

Consideration should be given to the addition of prandial or mealtime insulin coverage when significant postprandial glucose excursions (e.g. to > 10.0 mmol/L [> 180 mg/dL]) occur. This is suggested when the fasting glucose is at target but the HbA 1c remains above goal after 3–6 months of basal insulin titration. The same would apply if large drops in glucose occur during overnight hours or in between meals, as the basal insulin dose is increased. In this scenario, the basal insulin dose would obviously need to be simultaneously decreased as prandial insulin is initiated. Although basal insulin is titrated primarily against the fasting glucose, generally irrespective of the total dose, practitioners should be aware that the need for prandial insulin therapy will become likely the more the daily dose exceeds 0.5 U kg −1 day −1, especially as it approaches 1 U kg −1 day −1. The aim with mealtime insulin is to blunt postprandial glycemic excursions, which can be extreme in some individuals, resulting in poor control during the day. Such coverage may be provided by one of two methods.

### Tolazamide [^117U9qCr]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with tolazamide tablets or any other hypoglycemic agent. In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, ie, inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, ie, loss of adequate blood glucose response after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be of value in monitoring the patient's response to therapy.

Short-term administration of tolazamide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.

Usual Starting Dose

The usual starting dose of tolazamide tablets for the mild to moderately severe type II diabetic patient is 100–250 mg daily administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Generally, if the fasting blood glucose is less than 200 mg/dl, the starting dose is 100 mg/day as a single daily dose. If the fasting blood glucose value is greater than 200 mg/dl, the starting dose is 250 mg/day as a single dose. If the patient is malnourished, underweight, elderly, or not eating properly, the initial therapy should be 100 mg once a day. Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary regimen are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to drug therapy.

Initial drug therapy.

It is generally agreed that metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred and most cost-effective first agent (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.). It is initiated at, or soon after, diagnosis, especially in patients in whom lifestyle intervention alone has not achieved, or is unlikely to achieve, HbA 1c goals. Because of frequent gastrointestinal side effects, it should be started at a low dose with gradual titration. Patients with a high baseline HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 9.0%) have a low probability of achieving a near-normal target with monotherapy. It may therefore be justified to start directly with a combination of two noninsulin agents or with insulin itself in this circumstance. If a patient presents with significant hyperglycemic symptoms and/or has dramatically elevated plasma glucose concentrations (e.g. > 16.7–19.4 mmol/L [> 300–350 mg/dL]) or HbA 1c (e.g. ≥ 10.0–12.0%), insulin therapy should be strongly considered from the outset. Such treatment is mandatory when catabolic features are exhibited or, of course, if ketonuria is demonstrated, the latter reflecting profound insulin deficiency. Importantly, unless there is evidence of type 1 diabetes, once symptoms are relieved, glucotoxicity resolved, and the metabolic state stabilized, it may be possible to taper insulin partially or entirely, transferring to noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents, perhaps in combination.

### Intensive versus conventional glucose control in critically ill patients [^114BtqQW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal target range for blood glucose in critically ill patients remains unclear.

Methods

Within 24 hours after admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), adults who were expected to require treatment in the ICU on 3 or more consecutive days were randomly assigned to undergo either intensive glucose control, with a target blood glucose range of 81 to 108 mg per deciliter (4.5 to 6.0 mmol per liter), or conventional glucose control, with a target of 180 mg or less per deciliter (10.0 mmol or less per liter). We defined the primary end point as death from any cause within 90 days after randomization.

Results

Of the 6104 patients who underwent randomization, 3054 were assigned to undergo intensive control and 3050 to undergo conventional control; data with regard to the primary outcome at day 90 were available for 3010 and 3012 patients, respectively. The two groups had similar characteristics at baseline. A total of 829 patients (27.5%) in the intensive-control group and 751 (24.9%) in the conventional-control group died (odds ratio for intensive control, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.28; P = 0.02). The treatment effect did not differ significantly between operative (surgical) patients and nonoperative (medical) patients (odds ratio for death in the intensive-control group, 1.31 and 1.07, respectively; P = 0.10). Severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose level, ≤ 40 mg per deciliter [2.2 mmol per liter]) was reported in 206 of 3016 patients (6.8%) in the intensive-control group and 15 of 3014 (0.5%) in the conventional-control group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in the median number of days in the ICU (P = 0.84) or hospital (P = 0.86) or the median number of days of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.56) or renal-replacement therapy (P = 0.39).

Conclusions

In this large, international, randomized trial, we found that intensive glucose control increased mortality among adults in the ICU: a blood glucose target of 180 mg or less per deciliter resulted in lower mortality than did a target of 81 to 108 mg per deciliter. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00220987.)

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^116t4cvs]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 symptomatic hyperglycemia — initial insulin indications: Basal with or without prandial insulin treatment may be needed as initial therapy if the A1C is > 10% and/or glucose values are > 300 mg/dL combined with catabolic symptoms, such as weight loss. If symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, a GLP-1 RA alone is not recommended as it requires titration and may delay glucose control. The goal of initial intensive insulin therapy for symptomatic hyperglycemia is to reduce glucose levels safely and promptly. After improved glycemic control is achieved with short-term insulin therapy, especially with a new diagnosis of DM, a role for noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents could be considered.

### Type 2 diabetes: updated evidence requires… [^1155oyHe]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus seems simple: aim for close-to-normal fasting blood glucose and A1C levels. However, as discussed in the article by George et al. in this issue of AFP, normalizing blood glucose levels benefits only a small subset of patients. 1 A1C levels should be low enough to decrease symptoms but not low enough to risk hypoglycemia. For many patients, this range is 8% to 9% with a fasting blood glucose level less than 200 mg per dL. This relaxed goal will be new and perhaps perplexing to many patients. But it shouldn't be. Although clinical practice guidelines are only now catching up, 2, 3 the data refuting benefit of tight glycemic control have long been available. The U. K. Prospective Diabetes Study, published 17 years ago, found no mortality benefit and limited, if any, morbidity benefit of intensive glucose control. 4 As Dr. George's article mentions, three other studies confirmed a lack of mortality or morbidity benefit.

5–7. 8 How do we slay this dragon. First, wishful thinking must go. The goal of treating type 2 diabetes is to help patients live longer, healthier, productive lives. Unfortunately, normalizing blood glucose levels with pharmacology does not achieve this goal. Other than metformin, which has been shown to decrease mortality independent of its effect on glucose levels, all other available diabetes medications treat numbers, not patients. There is still room for clinical experience. Many patients do not "fit" the current evidence, and clinicians need to improvise and consider the best available research findings, their own experience, and their patients' needs and values. 9 Some patients, despite the evidence, will want to aggressively reduce their blood glucose levels. For others, though, we need to refocus on helping them live longer and better.

For type 2 diabetes, this means abandoning tight control of blood glucose for most patients, and instead addressing risks such as smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia that will actually make a difference. 10.

### Intensive glucose control versus conventional glucose control for type 1 diabetes mellitus [^1153wzZL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines differ regarding their recommended blood glucose targets for patients with type 1 diabetes and recent studies on patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that aiming at very low targets can increase the risk of mortality.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intensive versus conventional glycaemic targets in patients with type 1 diabetes in terms of long-term complications and determine whether very low, near normoglycaemic values are of additional benefit.

Search Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in the databases The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE. The date of the last search was December 2012 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had defined different glycaemic targets in the treatment arms, studied patients with type 1 diabetes, and had a follow-up duration of at least one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, with differences resolved by consensus. Overall study quality was evaluated by the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) system. Random-effects models were used for the main analyses and the results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 12 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including a total of 2230 patients. The patient populations varied widely across studies with one study only including children, one study only including patients after a kidney transplant, one study with newly diagnosed adult patients, and several studies where patients had retinopathy or microalbuminuria at baseline. The mean follow-up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years. The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all trials took place in Europe or North America. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies could be carried out in a blinded fashion so that the risk of performance bias, especially for subjective outcomes such as hypoglycaemia, was present in all of the studies. Fifty per cent of the studies were judged to have a high risk of bias in at least one other category. Under intensive glucose control, the risk of developing microvascular complications was reduced compared to conventional treatment for a) retinopathy: 23/371 (6.2%) versus 92/397 (23.2%); RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.42); P < 0.00001; 768 participants; 2 trials; high quality evidence; b) nephropathy: 119/732 (16.3%) versus 211/743 (28.4%); RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.68); P < 0.00001; 1475 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence; c) neuropathy: 29/586 (4.9%) versus 86/617 (13.9%); RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.53); P < 0.00001; 1203 participants; 3 trials; high quality evidence. Regarding the progression of these complications after manifestation, the effect was weaker (retinopathy) or possibly not existent (nephropathy: RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.70); P = 0.55; 179 participants with microalbuminuria; 3 trials; very low quality evidence); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy. For retinopathy, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of progression in studies with a follow-up duration of at least two years (85/366 (23.2%) versus 154/398 (38.7%); RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76); P < 0.0001; 764 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence), while we found evidence for an initial worsening of retinopathy after only one year of intensive glucose control (17/49 (34.7%) versus 7/47 (14.9%); RR 2.32 (95% CI 1.16 to 4.63); P = 0.02; 96 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence). Major macrovascular outcomes (stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely, and no firm evidence could be established regarding these outcome measures (low quality evidence). We found that intensive glucose control increased the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, however the results were heterogeneous and only the 'Diabetes Complications Clinical Trial' (DCCT) showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. A subgroup analysis according to the baseline haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of participants in the trials (low quality evidence) suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia is possibly only increased for patients who started with relatively low HbA1c values (< 9.0%). Several of the included studies also showed a greater weight gain under intensive glucose control, and the risk of ketoacidosis was only increased in studies using insulin pumps in the intensive treatment group (very low quality evidence). Overall, all-cause mortality was very low in all studies (moderate quality evidence) except in one study investigating renal allograft as treatment for end-stage diabetic nephropathy. Health-related quality of life was only reported in the DCCT trial, showing no statistically significant differences between the intervention and comparator groups (moderate quality evidence). In addition, only the DCCT published data on costs, indicating that intensive glucose therapy control was highly cost-effective considering the reduction of potential diabetes complications (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Tight blood sugar control reduces the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications. The evidence of benefit is mainly from studies in younger patients at early stages of the disease. Benefits need to be weighed against risks including severe hypoglycaemia, and patient training is an important aspect in practice. The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications have been manifested. However, further research is needed on this issue. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from RCTs on the effects of tight blood sugar control in older patient populations or patients with macrovascular disease. There is no firm evidence for specific blood glucose targets and treatment goals need to be individualised taking into account age, disease progression, macrovascular risk, as well as the patient's lifestyle and disease management capabilities.

Short-term administration of TOLINASE may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.

Usual Starting Dose

The usual starting dose of TOLINASE Tablets for
the mild to moderately severe Type II diabetic patient is 100–250 mg daily administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Generally, if the fasting blood glucose is less than 200 mg/dl, the starting dose is 100 mg/day as a single daily dose. If the fasting blood glucose value is greater than 200 mg/dl, the starting dose is 250 mg/day as a single dose. If the patient is malnourished, underweight, elderly, or not eating properly, the initial therapy should be 100 mg once a day. Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary regimen are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to drug therapy.

### Normal glucose values are associated with a lower risk of mortality in hospitalized patients [^111zDUA4]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The whole population with plasma glucose available at admission presents 69,996 cases (mean 65 years of age [range 51–75]; 42% female; 5% dead). Within this group, we analyzed a cohort of 3,338 cases (dead) versus 3,338 control subjects (alive) (mean 70 years of age [59–78] vs. 73 years of age [63–80]; 40 vs. 42% female; and mean 99 mg/dl [82–128] vs. 107 mg/dl [85–144] plasma glucose on admission). The effect of plasma glucose adjusted by administration data was nonlinear, as described in Fig. 1. Accordingly, the minimal risk of in-hospital mortality was found at plasma glucose levels of mean 89 mg/dl (range 78–101). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of deaths for plasma glucose on admission from 100 to 200 mg/dl is 1.32 (95% CI 1.22–1.43), whereas the OR for plasma glucose from 60 to 80 mg/dl is 1.06 (1.04–1.07).

Methods

Protocol Characteristics

Based on existing guidelines, the main components of our protocol are: adoption of scheduled basal-bolus insulin administration instead of SSI; regular monitoring of blood glucose; algorithm for basal and short-acting insulin dose adjustment based on blood glucose values; achievement of a premeal glucose target of less than 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) and an average BG during the day of less than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l), with the possibility of establishing a lower target range for patients who are able to achieve and maintain glycemic control without hypoglycemia; attention to therapy management in the transition from hospital to home.

In the GesTIO protocol, a set of specific treatment recommendations that can be listed on a single (double-sided) A4 paper are adhered to, including (1) a method for estimating the total daily insulin dose requirement, (2) a section on prescribing the type and scheduling the doses of basal and pre-meal insulin, (3) glycemic goals and alarm levels for risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, (4) algorithms for supplemental correction-dose insulin to be administered by nurses at pre-meal time, (5) instructions for physicians regarding how to calculate and use the insulin correctional factor in particular situations, and (6) a table relating to the standardized management of hypoglycemia (see Fig. S1 in the Electronic supplementary material, ESM).

Unlike the other basal insulins, which need to be titrated every day, IDeg was titrated every 3 days. Furthermore, due to its time flexibility, IDeg could be taken in the morning or evening according to the needs of the patient.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) management in ambulatory surgery — The task force suggests continuing CSII for procedures under 2 hours if the device can be placed outside of the surgical field and can be easily visualized and accessed, and the decision to use CSII during longer procedures depends on acuity of the procedure, anticipated volume shifts, and/or vasopressor use. For patients using CSII, the basal rate can be continued or reduced by 20% and the BG levels need to be checked hourly; if BG levels are < 100 mg/dL, the infusion is suspended and BG checked every 30 minutes until the BG level increases, and if hyperglycemia develops, correctional insulin should be provided to maintain BG levels in the target range. Safeguards should be in place to maintain patient safety and prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, including securing the infusion site and tubing away from the surgical field, insertion site inspection, isolating the pump from accidental contact, and BG monitoring, and because pumps may fail after exposure to ionizing radiation or electromagnetic fields or malfunction when exposed to electrocautery, it is necessary to protect them from exposure or remove them if it is not possible to avoid exposure. If the pump is not used during surgery in a type 1 diabetic patient, frequent BG monitoring and insulin administration is necessary to prevent DKA, the pump should be replaced before discharge, and a study found that patients undergoing surgery < 2 hours had lower postoperative BG levels (< 200 mg/dl) with no episodes of hypoglycemia in CSII-treated patients.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^114Fwz15]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although hyperglycemia is associated with adverse patient outcomes, intervention to normalize glycemia has yielded inconsistent results. Indeed, recent trials in critically ill patients have failed to showa significant improvement in mortality with intensive glycemic control or have even shown increased mortality risk. Moreover, these recent RCTs have highlighted the risk of severe hypoglycemia resulting from such efforts. These outcomes have contributed to confusion regarding specific glycemic targets and the means for achieving them in both critically ill and noncritically ill patients.

Recognizing the importance of glycemic control across the continuum of care, the AACE and the ADA joined forces to develop this updated consensus statement on inpatient glycemic management. The central goals were to identify reasonable, achievable, and safe glycemic targets and to describe the protocols, procedures, and system improvements needed to facilitate their implementation. This document is addressed to health care professionals, supporting staff, hospital administrators, and other stakeholders focused on improved management of hyperglycemia in inpatient settings. Consensus panel members extensively reviewed the most current literature and considered the following questions:
Does improving glycemic control improve clinical outcomes for inpatients with hyperglycemia?
What glycemic targets can be recommended in different patient populations?
What treatment options are available for achieving optimal glycemic targets safely and effectively in specific clinical situations?
Does inpatient management of hyperglycemia represent a safety concern?
What systems need to be in place to achieve these recommendations?
Is treatment of inpatient hyperglycemia cost-effective?
What are the optimal strategies for transition to outpatient care?
What are areas for future research?

### A simple glucose insulin regimen for perioperative blood glucose control: the vellore regimen [^116V5WDE]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

In this study, we sought a simple, easily implemented method of intraoperative control of blood glucose in diabetic patients in a large multispecialty teaching hospital. The Vellore regimen, which offers the advantages of a combined glucose insulin and variable rate infusion was evaluated. For every 1 to 50-mg/dL increase in blood glucose concentration more than 100 mg/dL, 1 U of insulin was added to the injection port of a 100-mL measured volume set containing 5% dextrose in water. Hourly monitoring of blood glucose was performed. The blood glucose control was compared with the different existing techniques followed in the hospital in 204 randomized patients: 98 in the study and 106 in the control group. The study group had a mean ± sd blood glucose value of 156 ± 36 mg/dL, and the control group's value was 189 ± 63 mg/dL (P = 0.003). The percentage of patients who were poorly controlled (outside 100 to 200-mg/dL range) decreased from 51% to 28% (no patient less than 60 mg/dL) with this regimen as compared with the control group in which it increased from 49% to 72% (10 patients less than 60 mg/dL) (P = 0.0013). We conclude that the Vellore regimen is simple, effective, and safe for intraoperative blood glucose control.

Corticosteroids cause hyperglycemia by increasing insulin resistance; and when they are used to treat illnesses in persons with diabetes, significant hyperglycemia results. Possible mechanisms of corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia include increased availability of cortisol, decreased postprandial glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis by skeletal muscles, and increase hepatic gluconeogenesis. In a study of healthy volunteers given corticosteroids, a doubling of plasma insulin concentration and a 50% reduction in insulin sensitivity were found. In hospitalized patients, 50–60% of patients without diabetes have at least one glucose level over 200 mg/dL while on corticosteroids and essentially all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes have significant hyperglycemia.

Corticosteroids used to treat hospitalized patients may result in acute hyperglycemia, suboptimal glycemic control, longer hospital stays, and increased morbidity and mortality. Use of corticosteroids in the hospital is predominantly for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as a component of chemotherapy, and after transplantation. When corticosteroids are used to treat COPD there is an increased risk of death which rises by 10% for each 18 mg/dL increase in blood glucose. For patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hyperglycemia occurred in 37% and those patients had shorter survival (29 vs. 88 months). In the setting of solid organ transplantation, hyperglycemia with glucose over 200 mg/dL is associated with an increased risk of rejection and infection.

Prevalence of diabetes among hospitalized patients is estimated to range from 12.4% to 26%. Efforts to adjust inpatient diabetes regimens to mitigate the rise in plasma glucose related to corticosteroids have been challenging. Patients receiving corticosteroids are being treated for variety of illnesses with different corticosteroid preparations in terms of dose, frequency, duration of action, and time of administration. These issues have made corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia a difficult problem to study, and the current practice of adjusting usual insulin regimens is often ineffective.

Several studies have suggested that neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin may be useful in treating corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia in the setting of diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring in patients with COPD treated with daily prednisolone showed an increase in glucose concentration throughout the day with a return to baseline glucose levels between 2000 and 0800 hours. This is a time course suited for NPH insulin which has an approximately 4-h peak and 18-h duration of action.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, non-blinded study in hospitalized diabetes patients comparing an NPH insulin-based protocol utilizing type and dose of corticosteroid, patient's oral intake status, and time of the day added to the patient's pretreatment basal-bolus insulin regimen for the management of corticosteroid-induced hyperglycemia.

Regarding medical management for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, ES 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) in adult patients with no prior history of diabetes hospitalized for a non-critical illness and experiencing hyperglycemia (defined as blood glucose > 140 mg/dL; 7.8 mmol/L) during hospitalization. Consider adding scheduled insulin therapy in patients with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone).

Summary of clinical trials reviewed for question 1

Overall, although a very tight glucose target (80–110 mg/dl [4.4–6.1 mmol/l]) was beneficial in a predominantly surgical ICU population, this target has been difficult to achieve in subsequent studies, including the recently published NICE-SUGAR study, without increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia. In addition, there has been no consistent reduction in mortality with intensive control of glycemia, and increased mortality was observed in the largest published study to date. The reasons for this inconsistency are not entirely clear. The positive results reported in the initial studies may have been attributable to differences in measurement and reporting of BG values, selection of participants, glycemic variability, or nutritional support. Nevertheless, recent attempts to achieve tight glycemic control either have not reduced or have actually increased mortality in multicenter trials and clearly led to higher rates of hypoglycemia.

Despite the inconsistencies, it would be a serious error to conclude that judicious control of glycemia in critically ill patients, and in non-ICU patients in general, is not warranted. First, on the basisof a largenumber of studies in a varietyof inpatient settings, uncontrolled hyperglycemia clearly is associated with poor outcomes. Second, although severe hypoglycemic events are observed in an unacceptably high number of patients receiving intensive insulin therapy with protocols targeting a BG of 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l), this risk can likely be minimized with relaxation of targets, improvement and standardization ofprotocols, and their careful implementation. Third, perhaps major beneficial effectson outcomes can be derived from a higher target range of glucose than 80–110 mg/dl in comparison with uncontrolled hyperglycemia.

Finally, until further information becomes available, it is prudent to continue to emphasize the importance of glycemic control in hospitalized patients with critical and noncritical illness while aiming at targets that are less stringent than 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l), a topic that is discussed in detail subsequently.

### Effects of intensive glucose lowering in type 2 diabetes [^111q4xJJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic studies have shown a relationship between glycated hemoglobin levels and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors.

Methods

In this randomized study, 10,251 patients (mean age, 62.2 years) with a median glycated hemoglobin level of 8.1% were assigned to receive intensive therapy (targeting a glycated hemoglobin level below 6.0%) or standard therapy (targeting a level from 7.0 to 7.9%). Of these patients, 38% were women, and 35% had had a previous cardiovascular event. The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The finding of higher mortality in the intensive-therapy group led to a discontinuation of intensive therapy after a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up.

Results

At 1 year, stable median glycated hemoglobin levels of 6.4% and 7.5% were achieved in the intensive-therapy group and the standard-therapy group, respectively. During follow-up, the primary outcome occurred in 352 patients in the intensive-therapy group, as compared with 371 in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78 to 1.04; P = 0.16). At the same time, 257 patients in the intensive-therapy group died, as compared with 203 patients in the standard-therapy group (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.46; P = 0.04). Hypoglycemia requiring assistance and weight gain of more than 10 kg were more frequent in the intensive-therapy group (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

As compared with standard therapy, the use of intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels for 3.5 years increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events. These findings identify a previously unrecognized harm of intensive glucose lowering in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000620.)

### Glucommander: a computer-directed intravenous insulin system shown to be safe, simple, and effective in 120, 618 h of operation [^11514YjT]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Intravenous insulin is now the recommended method of diabetes management in critically ill persons in the hospital. The published methods for administering the insulin are complex and are usually limited to intensive care units with a low patient-to-nurse ratio.

Research Design and Methods

A computer-directed algorithm for advice on the delivery of intravenous insulin that is flexible in blood glucose timing and advises insulin dosing in a graduated manner has been developed. This software program, known as the Glucommander, has been used extensively by our group. The data were analyzed for this study.

Results

The data from 5,080 intravenous insulin runs over 120,683 h show that blood glucose levels can be safely stabilized in a target range without significant hypoglycemia by nonspecialized nurses working on any unit of a general hospital. The mean glucose level reached < 150 mg/dl in 3 h. Only 0.6% of all glucose values were < 50 mg/dl. The prevalence of hypoglycemia < 40 mg/dl was 2.6% of all runs. No hypoglycemia was severe.

Conclusions

This computer-directed algorithm is a simple, safe, effective, and robust method for maintaining glycemic control. It has been extensively studied and is applicable in a wide variety of conditions. In contrast to other published intravenous insulin protocols, which have been limited to intensive care units, Glucommander can be used in all units of any hospital.

### A protocolized approach to identify and manage hyperglycemia in a pediatric critical care unit [^116535Tp]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for poor outcome in critically ill patients, and glycemic control may decrease morbidity and mortality in adults. There is limited information regarding hyperglycemia and its control in pediatric intensive care.

Objective

To determine prevalence and risk factors for hyperglycemia and evaluate our approach to glycemic control in critically ill children. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS, AND MAIN OUTCOMES: A pediatric-specific protocol to identify and manage hyperglycemia was developed and instituted as standard practice in our pediatric intensive care unit, and was applicable to patients > 6 months and > 5 kg, without end-stage liver disease or type 1 diabetes mellitus. Triggers for routine blood glucose assessment were based on supportive measures including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor/inotrope infusions, and antihypertensive infusions. Hyperglycemic patients, defined by two consecutive blood glucose readings of > 140 mg/dL (7.7 mmol/L), were treated with infused insulin to maintain blood glucose levels 80–140 mg/dL (4.4–7.7 mmol/L). We performed retrospective analysis 6 months after instituting this approach. Main outcomes were prevalence and risk factors for hyperglycemia, and effectiveness of our approach to achieve glycemic control.

Interventions

None.

Measurements/Main Results

One hundred forty-five of 477 patients had blood glucose actively assessed, and 74 developed hyperglycemia and were managed with insulin. This approach to identify patients with hyperglycemia had a positive predictive value of 51% and negative predictive value of 94%. Hyperglycemia prevalence was 20%. Mechanical ventilation, vasopressor/inotropic infusion, continuous renal replacement therapy, high illness severity scores, and longer lengths of stay were associated with hyperglycemia. The average blood glucose of patients with hyperglycemia was 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L), and on average, patients were treated with insulin for 6.3 days with 2.4 units/kg/day. Blood glucose levels were < 160 mg/dL (8.8 mmol/L) in 70% of insulin-treated days, 80–140 mg/dL (4.4–7.7 mmol/L) in 49% of insulin-treated days, and 4% of insulin-treated patients had any blood glucose measurements < 40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L).

Conclusions

Hyperglycemia is prevalent in pediatric intensive care units and may be effectively identified and managed using a protocolized approach.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^114tgvyb]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) — glucose control and outcomes show mixed findings: The largest study to date is a randomized trial which compared normothermia and hypothermia in 905 patients; there was no significant difference in the rates of hypoglycemia, whereas Zhao et al. randomized traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients to normothermia or mild hypothermia and mean glucose was lower in the hypothermia group. Blood glucose greater than 180 mg/dL was an independent predictor of poor neurologic outcome, and a prospective observational study found that glucose levels, glucose variability, and insulin requirements were higher in hypothermia maintenance phase as compared to the rewarmed normothermia phase. A retrospective chart review of 21 post-arrest TTM patients showed an association between a mean blood glucose greater than 220 mg/dl and decreased survival.

2.3 Endpoints and assessments

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% without hypoglycaemia (blood glucose ≤ 3.9 [alert] or ≤ 3.0 mmol/L [clinically important]) at 24 weeks, change from baseline in HbA1c, FBG, postprandial glucose and FPG at 24 weeks, distribution of patients with FPG or FBG ≤ 5.6 mmol/L, 5.6‐6.1 mmol/L, 6.1‐7.0 mmol/L and > 7.0 mmol/L at Week 24, final insulin dose in each arm at the end of the study, frequency and incidence of hypoglycaemia (definitions provided in Table S2) and changes in body weight. Exploratory endpoints included the proportion of patients with HbA1c < 7% according to groups re‐divided by actual 24‐week FPG levels, and the relationship between mean FBG over one to 12 weeks and HbA1c at 12 weeks and between mean FBG over 13 to 24 weeks and HbA1c at 24 weeks. Additional safety outcomes included frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) were coded using MedDRA version 18.1.

2. Glucose meters

a. There are insufficient published data to support a role for portable meters and skin-prick (finger-stick) blood samples in the diagnosis of diabetes or for population screening. C (moderate)

b. The imprecision of the results, coupled with the substantial differences among meters, precludes the use of glucose meters from the diagnosis of diabetes and limits their usefulness in screening for diabetes. A (moderate)

c. SMBG is recommended for all insulin-treated patients with diabetes. A (high)

d. In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and oral agents, SMBG may help achieve better control, particularly when therapy is initiated or changed. Data are insufficient, however, to claim an associated improvement of health outcomes. The role of SMBG in patients with stable type 2 diabetes controlled by diet alone is not known. C (high)

e. Patients should be instructed in the correct use of glucose meters, including quality control. Comparison between SMBG and concurrent laboratory glucose analysis should be performed at regular intervals to evaluate the performance of the meters in the patient's hands. B (moderate)

f. Multiple performance goals for portable glucose meters have been proposed. These targets vary widely and are highly controversial. Manufacturers should work to improve the imprecision of current meters, with an intermediate goal of limiting total error for 95% of samples to ≤ 15% at glucose concentrations ≥ 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and to < 0.8 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) at glucose concentrations < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). Lower total error would be desirable and may prove necessary in tight glucose-control protocols and for avoiding hypoglycemia in all settings. C (low)

g. Meters should measure and report plasma glucose concentrations to facilitate comparison with assays performed in accredited laboratories. GPP

h. Studies are needed to determine the analytical goals (quality specifications) for glucose meters in SMBG and in intensive care units. C (moderate)

i. Recommendations for future research: Important end points in studies of SMBG should include, at a minimum, hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes to ascertain whether improved meters enable patients to achieve better glucose control. For studies of meter use in intensive or critical care, important end points include mean blood glucose, frequency of hypoglycemia, and variation of glucose control. Ideally, outcomes (e.g. long-term complications) should also be examined. GPP

### A review of the "bolus guide, " a new insulin bolus dosing support tool based on selection of carbohydrate ranges [^114mYAKA]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

In this issue of Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Shapira and colleagues present new concepts of carbohydrate load estimation in intensive insulin therapy. By using a mathematical model, they attempt to establish how accurately carbohydrate food content should be maintained in order to keep postprandial blood glucose levels in the recommended range. Their mathematical formula, the "bolus guide" (BG), is verified by simulating prandial insulin dosing and responding to proper blood glucose levels. Different variants such as insulin sensitivity factor, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and target blood glucose were taken into this formula in establishing the calculated proper insulin dose. The new approach presented here estimates the carbohydrate content by rearranging the carbohydrate load instead of the simple point estimation that the current bolus calculators (BCs) use. Computerized estimations show that the BG directives, as compared to a BC, result in more glucose levels above 200 mg/dl and thus indicate less hypoglycemia readings.

### Computerized intensive insulin dosing can mitigate hypoglycemia and achieve tight glycemic control when glucose measurement is performed frequently and on time [^116htSuz]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

These recent results have left clinicians sitting on the horns of the dilemma; how to achieve and maintain glucose control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. One reason for this dilemma might be that intravenous (IV) insulin protocols have been designed to lower BG in order to achieve a 'normal' or 'optimal' BG target range, without consideration for their tendency to cause hypoglycemia. Indeed, the literature on manual and computerized protocols reports wide variation in performance in terms of patients reaching target and hypoglycemia rates varying from 4.6% to over 25.0%. Moreover, the variety of methods used to measure BG (and their relative accuracy), and the metrics used to define and report hypoglycemia make it challenging to ascertain the actual risk of hypoglycemia with any degree of certainty.

On one hand, paper protocols require manual calculation and documentation based on a single BG measure, without consideration of the patient's insulin sensitivity and response to previous dosing. On the other hand, computerized applications, which enable rapid, complex calculations for recommended insulin infusion rates, have demonstrated superior overall efficacy and safety in some reports, and failed to improve glycemic control or reduce hypoglycemia in others when compared with manual protocols.

We previously reported our experience with a computerized IV insulin protocol, the GlucoStabilizer™ achieving BG targets of 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L in 61.0% of patients with minimal hypoglycemia (< 2.8 mmol/L, 4.25%). Given the concerns surrounding hypoglycemia with intensive insulin therapy, we examine herein, factors contributing to hypoglycemia in the context of the overall performance metrics of the GlucoStabilizer.

Correctional Insulin Adjustment

When the elevation in preprandial blood glucose is very remarkable (> 200 to 250 mg/dl or 11.1 to13.9 mmol/L), the treating physician may need to administer an additional correctional dose of short-acting insulin in addition to the usual prandial dose. This correctional dose is given with the aim to rapidly reduce the elevated blood glucose levels, and the dose is determined based on a correction factor. The correction factor indicates the decrease in blood glucose (mg/dl) expected with 1 unit of short-acting insulin and depends upon the insulin sensitivity of the person being treated. As a rule, the higher the TDD (units/kg body weight), the lower the insulin sensitivity and correction factor. Correction factors based on TDD are shown in Table 7.

Table 7
Correction factor for the use of correctional insulin in patients with uncontrolled preprandial blood glucose

For conversion from mg/dl to mmol/L, divide the value in mg/dl by 18

a Correction factor indicates the decrease in blood glucose (mg/dl) expected with 1 unit of short-acting insulin

The practical use of a correctional dose of insulin can be better explained with an example, as follows. A 46-year-old man with T2DM for 3 years, a body weight of 72 kg and no comorbidities or diabetes-related complications is being treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen. His TDD of insulin is 45 units (0.63 unit/kg body weight), injected as 10 units of regular insulin before each meal and 15 units of insulin glargine at bedtime. His correction factor (Table 7) is 40, that is, 1 unit of regular insulin is expected to decrease the blood glucose level by 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/L). In a scenario in which his before-lunch blood glucose is 280 mg/dl (higher than the target blood glucose of 120 mg/dl [6.7 mmol/L] by 160 mg/dl [8.9 mmol/L]), he needs 160/40, that is, 4 units of correctional insulin. Thus, in addition to the 10 units of regular insulin for prandial coverage, he should receive an additional 4 units of regular insulin (total dose being 14 units of regular insulin).

### Diabetes care in the hospital: is there clinical inertia? [^111zFba3]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Effective control of hospital glucose improves outcomes, but little is known about hospital management of diabetes.

Objective

Assess hospital-based diabetes care delivery.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Academic teaching hospital.

Patients

Inpatients with a discharge diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia were selected from electronic records. A random sample (5%, n = 90) was selected for chart review.

Measurements

We determined the percentage of patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia documented in admission, daily progress, and discharge notes. We determined the proportion of cases with glucose levels documented in daily progress notes and with changes in hyperglycemia therapy recorded. The frequency of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events was also determined.

Results

A diabetes diagnosis was recorded at admission in 96% of patients with preexisting disease, but daily progress notes mentioned diabetes in only 62% of cases and 60% of discharge notes; just 20% of discharges indicated a plan for diabetes follow-up. Most patients (86%) had bedside glucose measurements ordered, but progress notes tracked values for only 53%, and only 52% had a documented assessment of glucose severity. Hypoglycemic events were rare (11% of patients had at least one bedside glucose < 70 mg/dL), but hyperglycemia was common (71% of cases had at least one bedside glucose > 200 mg/dL). Despite the frequency of hyperglycemia, only 34% of patients had their therapy changed.

Conclusions

Practitioners were often aware of diabetes at admission, but the problem was often overlooked during hospitalization. The low rate of documentation and therapeutic change suggests the need for interventions to improve provider awareness and enhance inpatient diabetes care.

Inpatient diabetes management — noncritically ill targets and insulin therapy: For most noncritically ill persons in the hospital setting, a glucose target of 140 to 180 mg/dL is recommended; a lower target range (100 to 140 mg/dL) may be reasonable when glycemic control can be achieved without hypoglycemia, whereas less stringent targets are appropriate for those with high clinical complexity, terminal illness, limited life expectancy, or high risk for hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy following approved protocols is recommended as the preferred therapy for managing hyperglycemia in the hospital, and for noncritically ill persons with T2D, an individualized approach is recommended and may include consideration of noninsulin agents alone or in combination with insulin. For hospitalized persons with satisfactory oral intake, the insulin regimen should include basal, prandial, and correction doses; for those without adequate food intake, basal, prandial, and correction doses should be used as necessary, and extensive use of "sliding-scale" insulin should only be used for those whose glucose are in the target range most of the time, and only occasionally exceed it.

### Thiazolidinedione therapy in the prevention / delay of type 2 diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance [^112jJPNG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

The second-generation thiazolidinediones (TZDs), rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, significantly decrease fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels in patients with diabetes. Recent studies suggest that early treatment with TZDs may prevent the progression from insulin resistance (IR) to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This prospective analysis examined the effect of early TZD treatment in the prevention or delay of T2DM in a multiethnic population with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and IR.

Methods

The analysis included 172 patients (aged 29–86 years) with IGT and IR (normal or borderline HbA(1c), C-peptide levels > 2 mg/ml, fasting blood sugar 100–125 mg/dl, and 2-h postprandial blood glucose levels 140–200 mg/dl). Patients in the active treatment group (n = 101) had received troglitazone for an average of 10 months before being randomly switched to rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) or pioglitazone (30 mg/day). Patients were switched when troglitazone was withdrawn from the US market because of liver toxicity concerns. Patients with IGT and IR who received no antidiabetic medication served as a control group (n = 71). HbA(1c) and C-peptide levels were measured at baseline (2 years) and study end point (3 years). Kaplan-Meier testing, using time to outcome as the main outcome variable, determined risk reduction in the TZD group relative to the control group.

Results

Mean HbA(1c) and C-peptide levels decreased for patients receiving either TZD at the 2-year assessment, and reductions were maintained at study end point. After 2 years, none of the patients receiving TZD therapy progressed to T2DM; three patients progressed to T2DM by study end point. In the control group, 11 patients became diabetic after 2 years and 19 patients became diabetic by the end of the study. The incidence (risk reduction) of diabetes after 3 years was 88.9% lower in the TZD group compared with the control group (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The TZDs, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, were effective in reducing HbA(1c) and C-peptide levels in patients with IGT/IR. Progression of IR/IGT to T2DM appears to be significantly delayed or prevented with early TZD treatment.

AACE 2023 insulin intensification — parameters and targets: Although A1C is a key measure, insulin titration requires multiple glycemic parameters including FBG, premeal or 2-hour postprandial BG, and CGM metrics including TIR, time below range, and GMI. In general, targets for fasting and premeal glucose are < 110 mg/dL, without hypoglycemia and can be individualized based on comorbidities and clinical status. The use of CGM is recommended for persons treated with insulin to optimize glycemic control while minimizing hypoglycemia.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113ZTy5L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to management of hospitalized patients, insulin therapy, ES 2022 guidelines recommend to consider administering initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) in adult patients with no prior history of diabetes hospitalized for a non-critical illness and experiencing hyperglycemia (defined as blood glucose > 140 mg/dL; 7.8 mmol/L) during hospitalization. Consider adding scheduled insulin therapy in patients with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone).

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^1145zL5x]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Organ donor management — hyperglycemia in deceased donors — emphasizes treatment and reports observed thresholds and associations. In a retrospective study of 458 deceased organ donors from a single organ procurement organization (OPO), terminal glucose concentrations prior to organ recovery were significantly higher than recommended ICU practice standards, with Seventy-two percent of the donors having terminal glucose concentrations more than 200 mg/dL and 39% having glucose concentrations more than 250 mg/dL; in that study, higher glucose levels and greater fluctuations in levels were associated with reduced recovery of pancreas grafts, and a small prospective study of 40 recipients of living donor renal transplants showed that intraoperative hyperglycemia (blood glucose, > 160 mg/dL) was associated with reduced early posttransplant renal function, while preliminary randomized trial analysis found no difference in terminal creatinine between treatment groups but noted a target glucose concentration of 180 mg/dL in the conventional arm. The impact of hyperglycemia on organ donor function is uncertain, but Hyperglycemic deceased organ donors should be treated as other critically ill patients, and it is generally accepted that uncontrolled hyperglycemia should be treated.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112RwGVS]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to set a glycemic goal of 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) in non-critically ill patients if it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11431WzV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Hyperglycemia management in adults without prior diabetes hospitalized for noncritical illness — Recommendation 10.1: We suggest initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10.0 mmol/L) in those with hyperglycemia [defined as blood glucose (BG) > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)] during hospitalization; for patients with persistent hyperglycemia [≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL (≥ 10.0 mmol/L) in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone], we suggest the addition of scheduled insulin therapy.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^1165zotW]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Hospitalized adults — intensive care unit (ICU) glycemic targets and insulin strategy — glucose targets < 110 mg/dL are no longer universally recommended, and the AACE/ADA consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control favors more relaxed glycemic targets in the ICU, as high as 140 to 180 mg/dL; insulin therapy is the preferred method of glycemic control in most hospitalized persons, and IV infusion of insulin is the preferred route of administration for persons in the ICU; preference should be given to use of regular insulin for IV administration; most persons with T2D and all persons with T1D in the ICU receiving IV insulin infusion will require transition to a subcutaneous insulin regimen.

Hypoglycemia and treatment intensity — severe hypoglycemia is identified as a potent marker of high absolute risk of cardiovascular events and mortality; therefore, health care professionals should be vigilant in preventing hypoglycemia and should not aggressively attempt to achieve near-normal A1C levels in people in whom such goals cannot be safely and reasonably achieved; severe or frequent hypoglycemia is an absolute indication for the modification of treatment plans, including setting higher glycemic goals.
