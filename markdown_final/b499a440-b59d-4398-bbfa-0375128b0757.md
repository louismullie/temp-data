## Question

Primary central nervous vasculitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about primary central nervous system vasculitis (PACNS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and classification to anchor the diagnostic framework. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and epidemiology. Next, I will review the diagnostic workup, including MRI, angiography, CSF, and biopsy, and I need to check where guidelines diverge from older assumptions. After that, I will examine the differential diagnosis, especially RCVS and secondary vasculitides. Then, I should consider treatment strategies, including induction, maintenance, and stroke management. Finally, I will synthesize prognosis, special populations, and a practical diagnostic algorithm, making sure I double-check areas of uncertainty and correct any outdated statements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't build on a shaky foundation. PACNS is an idiopathic vasculitis restricted to the brain, spinal cord, and leptomeninges without systemic involvement, and it is best understood as a heterogeneous spectrum rather than a single entity, with subtypes defined by vessel size and histopathology rather than a unified pathogenesis, which aligns with the 2012 Chapel Hill nomenclature and contemporary reviews [^111gZo4S] [^113eGzFc] [^1149wska]. Hold on, I should verify the nosology point: yes, adult and pediatric primary CNS vasculitides are classified by vessel caliber and histology, reinforcing the need to distinguish small-vessel from large/medium-vessel disease in both diagnosis and prognosis [^113eGzFc].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation and epidemiology to calibrate pretest probability. Typical features include headache, cognitive decline, focal deficits, seizures, and encephalopathy, with a median age around 45–50 years and a slight male predominance; importantly, normal brain MRI makes PACNS unlikely, so I need to keep that in mind before overcalling the diagnosis [^111gZo4S] [^116Ss7C4]. Wait, let me verify the incidence estimate: the oft-cited 2.4 per million person-years comes from a Mayo cohort and is frequently quoted, but I should note it is based on a single-center series and may not generalize, so I will treat it as an order-of-magnitude anchor rather than gospel [^111Km3Z3] [^114y96yr].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup, starting with MRI, because it shapes the rest of the pathway. MRI is highly sensitive but nonspecific, commonly showing multiterritorial infarcts, leptomeningeal enhancement, microbleeds, and occasionally tumor-like lesions; leptomeningeal enhancement is more frequent in biopsy-proven small-vessel disease, which can guide biopsy targeting and increase yield [^111FCfop] [^113wDgP9]. Hold on, I should verify the role of vessel wall imaging (VWI): ESO advises that VWI be considered only in expert centers and trial settings, and not used as the sole imaging modality to diagnose PACNS, so I should not overinterpret VWI positivity in isolation [^114BPmp8] [^112fBwQ8].

> Next, I should review angiography, and I need to be careful not to conflate sensitivity with diagnostic certainty. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has higher sensitivity than MRA/CTA for medium-sized vessel irregularities, but it is neither specific nor sensitive for small-vessel disease; a normal angiogram does not exclude PACNS, and ESO recommends proceeding to DSA when MRA/CTA is non-diagnostic in a high-suspicion scenario [^117C7pgM] [^115sLCdj] [^111p2buW]. Wait, let me double-check a common pitfall: I initially thought MRA could replace DSA routinely, but ESO explicitly advises against substituting MRA for DSA in suspected PACNS, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize DSA when suspicion remains high despite non-diagnostic MRA [^111p2buW] [^115sLCdj].

> I should confirm the role of CSF analysis, because it often supports small-vessel disease even though it is not diagnostic by itself. CSF is abnormal in roughly 80–90% of cases, typically showing pleocytosis and/or elevated protein, but normal CSF does not exclude PACNS, so I must interpret CSF in clinical context and not overweigh it [^111gZo4S] [^113t25NL]. Hold on, I should verify guideline nuance: ESO notes insufficient evidence to recommend CSF pleocytosis or hyperproteinorrachia as standalone diagnostic tools, yet still advises obtaining CSF to inform the broader differential, which I will frame as supportive rather than confirmatory [^113n7nAi] [^115yJJCg].

> Now, brain biopsy remains the gold standard, and I need to ensure I balance yield, risks, and targeting strategy. Definitive diagnosis requires tissue showing transmural inflammation of leptomeningeal or parenchymal vessels, but sensitivity is limited by sampling error; targeting leptomeningeal enhancement or contrast-enhancing lesions improves yield, and ESO recommends considering biopsy in suspected small-vessel disease with a normal angiogram or when imaging shows leptomeningeal enhancement despite non-diagnostic angiography [^112awkpU] [^112aWZEK] [^117Coatb]. Wait, let me verify a common misconception: I almost said biopsy is 100% specific; however, false positives can occur if secondary vasculitis or mimics are present, so specificity is high but not absolute, reinforcing the need to exclude secondary causes before labeling PACNS [^112awkpU] [^1149wska].

> I need to check the differential diagnosis carefully, because misclassification is common and treatment consequences are nontrivial. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a key mimic with thunderclap headache, normal CSF, convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a "string of beads" angiogram that resolves on follow-up; distinguishing RCVS from PACNS prevents unnecessary immunosuppression and guides appropriate calcium-channel blocker therapy [^1114CHfb] [^116woLAk]. But wait, what if the angiogram is abnormal and the CSF is inflammatory? That pattern is more compatible with PACNS than RCVS, yet I should still exclude secondary vasculitides, infections, malignancy, and hereditary or acquired vasculopathies before committing to a primary label [^1149wska] [^116YKQ9o].

> Let me consider treatment, and I should confirm that recommendations are largely consensus-based given the absence of RCTs. Induction typically uses high-dose glucocorticoids with or without cyclophosphamide, chosen based on severity and vessel size; ESO recommends adding an immunosuppressant in most patients, reserving steroid monotherapy for select milder cases after multidisciplinary review, and suggests cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate for induction with mycophenolate as a maintenance option to mitigate CYC toxicity [^11127FYx] [^116HsyS9]. Hold on, I should verify rituximab's role: while rituximab is a reasonable alternative in some centers, high-quality evidence is limited, so I will present it as an option informed by systemic vasculitis experience rather than definitive PACNS data [^116HsyS9] [^1138fFEF].

> I should double-check stroke management within PACNS, because acute cerebrovascular events complicate immunosuppressive decisions. ESO supports considering IV thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke in PACNS when no absolute contraindications exist and endovascular thrombectomy in eligible windows, recognizing that large-vessel occlusion may reflect vasculitic thrombosis rather than classic atherothrombosis; antiplatelet therapy can be considered in large/medium-vessel disease, though evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^111kt9Gi] [^115BbLtH] [^111mSXxJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should emphasize that these stroke recommendations are extrapolated and should be weighed against bleeding risk and disease activity in real time [^113xKCNb].

> Next, I should review prognosis and predictors of outcome to guide counseling and intensity of therapy. Large-vessel involvement, cerebral infarcts at diagnosis, and older age predict worse outcomes, whereas prominent leptomeningeal enhancement and gadolinium-enhancing lesions correlate with better response and lower mortality; maintenance immunosuppression after induction is associated with prolonged remission and better functional status in observational cohorts [^113RRJFq] [^1114odGV] [^116DRfFV]. Hold on, I should verify relapse data: relapses occur in roughly 25–30% and are more frequent with meningeal enhancement or seizures at baseline, supporting the rationale for maintenance therapy in higher-risk phenotypes [^113RRJFq] [^115nqDeo].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with children, where classification and thresholds for biopsy differ. Childhood PACNS is divided into angiography-positive large/medium-vessel disease and angiography-negative small-vessel disease; small-vessel disease often presents with seizures, cognitive decline, and inflammatory CSF, and many experts require biopsy confirmation for sv-cPACNS, though real-world biopsy rates remain variable due to access and risk considerations [^113eGzFc] [^113rnjQ6]. Let me reconsider treatment intensity in pediatrics: given higher toxicity and limited pediatric-specific efficacy data, some centers favor steroid-sparing strategies and careful escalation, but evidence remains sparse and consensus-based [^1172Wcyz] [^115iYM5J].

> But wait, what about amyloid-beta–related angiitis (ABRA), which can masquerade as PACNS? ABRA features leptomeningeal and cortical small-to-medium vessel vasculitis superimposed on cerebral amyloid angiopathy, often with seizures, cognitive decline, and microbleeds; biopsy distinguishes ABRA from idiopathic PACNS and informs immunotherapy decisions, and CD4+ T-cell–predominant infiltrates have been described in ABRA cohorts [^111g5BY7] [^114NP5if]. I should confirm that ABRA is a secondary process mechanistically, even though it presents as isolated CNS disease, which affects how we counsel patients about underlying amyloid burden and recurrence risk [^111g5BY7].

> Next, I should review emerging biomarkers and advanced diagnostics, but I need to be cautious about overpromising. Circulating endothelial cells are elevated in active PACNS and decline with treatment, suggesting potential utility for activity monitoring, yet validation is preliminary and not ready for routine care; similarly, VWI and molecular testing for infections can refine the differential but remain adjunctive rather than definitive [^117Fs7MG] [^116YKQ9o]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: until multicenter prospective studies validate these tools, they should complement, not replace, core diagnostic pathways [^113xKCNb].

> I should now synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm, and I will explicitly flag decision points where missteps occur. Start with MRI and CSF in all suspected cases; if MRI is normal, PACNS is unlikely and alternative diagnoses should be prioritized. If MRI is abnormal and suspicion remains high, proceed to DSA when MRA/CTA is non-diagnostic; if DSA is abnormal with a compatible pattern, a diagnosis of probable PACNS is reasonable after excluding secondary causes, whereas if DSA is normal but small-vessel disease is suspected, pursue targeted brain and leptomeningeal biopsy. Throughout, exclude RCVS, systemic vasculitides, infections, and malignancy using clinical, serologic, and, when indicated, molecular testing before initiating immunosuppression [^117M8JJG] [^115sLCdj] [^112aWZEK] [^116YKQ9o]. I should double-check that this aligns with ESO guidance: yes, ESO endorses DSA when noninvasive imaging is non-diagnostic and supports biopsy in angiogram-negative small-vessel presentations, reinforcing this stepwise approach [^115sLCdj] [^112aWZEK].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and internally consistent. PACNS is rare, heterogeneous, and potentially devastating if untreated, yet highly mimicked; diagnosis rests on integrating clinical, MRI, angiographic, CSF, and histopathologic data while excluding secondary causes; treatment is individualized by severity and phenotype, with most patients benefiting from induction with steroids plus an immunosuppressant and many requiring maintenance to reduce relapse; and prognosis hinges on vessel size, infarction burden, and age, with large-vessel disease portending worse outcomes and leptomeningeal enhancement suggesting better treatment responsiveness [^111gZo4S] [^11127FYx] [^113RRJFq] [^1114odGV]. Hold on, I should verify that I have not overstated any single test's authority: MRI and CSF are supportive, DSA improves medium-vessel detection, and biopsy remains the only definitive test when small-vessel disease is suspected, which accurately reflects current evidence and guidelines [^117M8JJG] [^117C7pgM] [^112awkpU].

Primary CNS vasculitis (PACNS) is a rare, idiopathic inflammatory vasculopathy confined to the brain and spinal cord, presenting with headache, cognitive decline, focal deficits, seizures, and encephalopathy [^111gZo4S]. Diagnosis is challenging: MRI and angiography are nonspecific, CSF is often abnormal but not diagnostic, and **brain biopsy is the gold standard** [^112awkpU] [^113wDgP9]. Management is **immunosuppression with corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide or rituximab**, followed by maintenance with mycophenolate or azathioprine; early treatment improves outcomes, but relapses are common and prognosis varies by vessel size and infarct burden [^11127FYx] [^113kj6bH] [^111Km3Z3].

---

## Epidemiology and demographics

- **Rarity**: PACNS is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 2.4 per million person-years [^111Km3Z3] [^116HsyS9].
- **Age and sex**: Median age at onset is ~50 years; slight male predominance [^111gZo4S] [^116HsyS9].
- **Pediatric cases**: Rare but recognized; distinct pediatric subtypes exist [^1161RZRx] [^111vDQhy].

---

## Clinical presentation

PACNS presents with **nonspecific neurological symptoms**, including:

| **Symptom** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Headache | Common |
| Cognitive decline | Common |
| Focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia, visual disturbances) | Common |
| Seizures | Common |
| Encephalopathy | Common |
| Spinal cord involvement (myelopathy) | Less common |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

Diagnosis requires exclusion of systemic vasculitis and mimics; **no single test is definitive** outside of biopsy [^111gZo4S] [^116yYZdN].

---

### Neuroimaging

- **MRI**: Highly sensitive but nonspecific; multiterritorial infarcts, white matter lesions, leptomeningeal enhancement, microbleeds, and tumor-like lesions are typical [^111FCfop] [^113wDgP9].
- **Angiography**: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is superior to MRA/CTA for medium-vessel disease; shows segmental stenoses, dilations, and occlusions [^117C7pgM] [^1114odGV].
- **Vessel wall imaging**: May show vessel wall enhancement but is not yet validated for routine diagnosis [^114BPmp8] [^112fBwQ8].

---

### Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis

CSF is abnormal in ~80–90% of cases, typically showing pleocytosis and elevated protein; however, **normal CSF does not exclude PACNS** [^111gZo4S] [^113t25NL].

---

### Brain biopsy

Brain biopsy is the **gold standard**, demonstrating transmural inflammation of small leptomeningeal/parenchymal vessels; however, sensitivity is limited by sampling error and risks include hemorrhage and neurological deficits [^112awkpU] [^113wDgP9].

---

## Histopathological findings

Histopathology is heterogeneous; **three main patterns** are recognized:

| **Pattern** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Granulomatous | Multinucleated giant cells, epithelioid cells, necrosis |
| Lymphocytic | Lymphocytic infiltrates without granulomas |
| Necrotizing | Fibrinoid necrosis, acute thrombosis |

---

## Differential diagnosis

PACNS has broad differential; **key mimics** include:

- **Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)**: Thunderclap headache, normal CSF, reversible angiographic changes [^1114CHfb] [^116woLAk].
- **Secondary CNS vasculitis**: Systemic vasculitides, infections, malignancy [^1149wska] [^116YKQ9o].
- **Noninflammatory vasculopathies**: Moyamoya, atherosclerosis, dissection [^116jAthW] [^1114CHfb].

---

## Treatment strategies

Immunosuppression is the cornerstone; **evidence is observational** [^116HsyS9]:

- **Induction**: High-dose corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) with cyclophosphamide (IV or oral) or rituximab [^116jAthW] [^113kj6bH].
- **Maintenance**: Mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or rituximab; maintenance reduces relapse and improves function [^116HsyS9] [^116DRfFV].
- **Duration**: Induction 3–6 months; maintenance 12–24 months, individualized [^113PCnLT].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis is variable: **large-vessel disease and infarcts predict worse outcomes**, whereas gadolinium-enhancing lesions portend better response; mortality is ~8–15%, and relapses occur in ~25–30% [^113RRJFq] [^1114odGV] [^116DRfFV].

---

## Complications

Complications include **recurrent ischemic strokes, intracranial hemorrhage, cognitive impairment, seizures, and spinal cord injury** [^111FCfop] [^111gZo4S].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research and future directions focus on **developing biomarkers** (e.g. circulating endothelial cells) [^117Fs7MG], advancing vessel wall imaging [^112fBwQ8], and conducting prospective trials to refine diagnostic criteria and therapies [^113xKCNb] [^116yYZdN].

---

PACNS is a rare, idiopathic CNS vasculitis with nonspecific presentations; **diagnosis hinges on excluding mimics and, when feasible, obtaining brain biopsy**. Early immunosuppression improves outcomes, but relapses are common and prognosis varies with vessel size and infarct burden.

### The diagnosis of primary central nervous system vasculitis [^116yYZdN]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of primary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis is often difficult. There are neither specific clinical features nor a classical clinical course, and no blood or imaging investigations that can confirm the diagnosis. Contrast catheter cerebral angiography is neither specific nor sensitive, yet still underpins the diagnosis in many published studies. Here we describe an approach to its diagnosis, emphasising the importance of obtaining tissue, and present for discussion a new, binary set of diagnostic criteria, dividing cases into only 'definite' primary CNS vasculitis, where tissue proof is available, and 'possible', where it is not. We hope that these criteria will be modified and improved by discussion among experts, and that these (improved) criteria may then be adopted and used as the basis for future prospective studies of the clinical features and diagnosis of this difficult and dangerous disorder, particularly for coordinated multicentre therapeutic trials.

### Primary and secondary central nervous system vasculitis [^1161RZRx]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Central nervous system vasculitis is an increasingly recognized inflammatory brain disease causing devastating neurological deficits and psychiatric manifestations in previously healthy children. Primary central nervous system vasculitis represents an isolated inflammatory attack targeting the cerebral vessels. In contrast, in children with secondary central nervous system vasculitis, an underlying condition can be identified. The spectrum of childhood primary and secondary central nervous system vasculitis is rapidly expanding, as is the differential diagnosis including nonvasculitic inflammatory brain diseases and noninflammatory vasculopathies. Early recognition, rapid diagnostic evaluation, and initiation of treatment have led to improved morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging characteristics of the distinct subtypes of primary childhood central nervous system vasculitis, reports the etiology of secondary central nervous system vasculitis, provides an overview of the differential diagnosis, and reviews the current approaches in treatment.

### Primary central nervous system vasculitis and headache: ten themes [^1173qLmL]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The primary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitides refers to clinicopathologic disorders that share the histopathology of inflammation of cerebral or spinal blood vessels. Unrecognized and therefore untreated, vasculitis of the CNS results in irreversible injury and disability making these disorders of paramount importance to clinicians.

Recent Findings

Headache is an important clue to vasculitic involvement of CNS vessels. CNS vasculitis can be primary, in which only intracranial or spinal vessels are involved in the inflammatory process, or secondary to another known disorder with overlapping systemic involvement. The suspicion of vasculitis based on the history, clinical examination, and laboratory studies warrants prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent cerebral ischemia or infarction.

Summary

Primary CNS vasculitides can be diagnosed with certainty after intensive evaluation that includes tissue confirmation whenever possible. As in its systemic counterparts, clinicians must choose from among the available immune modulating, suppressive, and targeted immunotherapies to induce and maintain remission status and prevent relapse, tempered by anticipated medication adverse effects.

### Central nervous system vasculitis in children [^111vDQhy]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current literature of primary and secondary central nervous system vasculitis in children, to evaluate the evolving classification and to suggest an approach to diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Central nervous system vasculitis in children is a newly recognized inflammatory brain disease, which may develop as a primary condition, or secondary to an underlying systemic disease. Primary angiitis of the central nervous system of childhood (cPACNS) is a reversible cause of severe neurological impairment, including acute ischemic stroke, intractable seizures and cognitive decline. Once clinically suspected, angiography is a key imaging modality. Primary angiitis of the central nervous system of childhood can be divided into large-medium vessel and small-vessel vasculitis, each presenting with distinct clinical and radiological features. Angiogram-negative, small-vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system of childhood has a broad differential diagnosis that includes both vascular and nonvascular conditions. Recognition of this disease and a thorough diagnostic evaluation is necessary to identify and possibly reverse severe neurological impairment in children.

Summary

This review summarizes the recent data on diagnosis and differential diagnosis of primary and secondary central nervous system vasculitis in children. Increasing recognition of this condition in children allows for greater understanding of the spectrum of disease presentation and differential diagnosis of this reversible cause of severe neurological impairment in children.

### Systemic vasculitis and headache [^114zdrPa]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vasculitis refers to heterogeneous clinicopathologic disorders that share the histopathology of inflammation of blood vessels. Unrecognized and therefore untreated, vasculitis of the nervous system or so called neurovasculitides, lead to pervasive injury and disability making these disorder of paramount importance to clinicians.

Recent Findings

Headache is an important clue to vasculitic involvement of central nervous system (CNS) vessels. CNS vasculitis may be primary, in which only intracranial vessels are involved in the inflammatory process, or secondary to another known disorder with overlapping systemic involvement. A suspicion of vasculitis based on the history, clinical examination, or laboratory studies warrants prompt evaluation and treatment to forestall progression and avert cerebral ischemia or infarction. There has been remarkable progress in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of primary adult and pediatric CNS vasculitides predicated on achievements in primary systemic forms.

Summary

Vasculitis can be diagnosed with certainty after intensive evaluation that includes tissue confirmation whenever possible. Clinicians must choose from among the available immune modulating, suppressive, and targeted immunotherapies to induce and maintain remission status and prevent relapse, tempered by the recognition of anticipated medication side effects.

### Primary angiitis of central nervous system – A challenging diagnosis [^1138fFEF]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare disease characterized by vasculitis of the central nervous system without any systemic involvement. This review aims to provide an insight into the existing stagnancies in the diagnostic approach and management of this disease. The clinical presentation is typically nonspecific, ranging from headaches, altered sensorium, and seizures to recurrent ischemic strokes. The definitive diagnosis can only be ascertained by histopathological studies of tissue obtained from a brain biopsy. While angiography can provide clues to diagnosis, it has often been normal, even in biopsy-proven cases. Primary angiitis of the central nervous system continues to be a diagnostic challenge as little progress has been made over the years in the diagnosis and management strategies. Considering the vast list of mimickers of primary angiitis of the central nervous system and the existence of a significant proportion of imaging-negative and biopsy-negative cases, it becomes imperative to devise universally accepted diagnostic criteria for this disease. Steroids in combination with cyclophosphamide are the agents used to achieve remission. Rituximab can be an alternative. The treatment-related toxicity of cyclophosphamide warrants larger trials for alternative drugs to be studied.

### Central nervous system vasculitis [^116woLAk]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the past decade, primary and secondary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitides have been more commonly diagnosed and recognized than previously. With the increasing awareness of these disorders, it is crucial for the treating physician to differentiate between causes of CNS vasculitis and to recognize their marked clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity. This review focuses on the major forms of primary CNS vasculitis, as well as secondary CNS vasculitis with emphasis on their clinical findings, diagnoses, and treatment.

Recent Findings

The proposal of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS) as a unifying concept for a group of disorders which are characterized by acute-onset severe recurrent headaches, with or without additional neurologic signs and symptoms, and prolonged but reversible vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries, has been a major breakthrough in this field over the past decade. Recognition of this common mimic (i.e. RCVS) has allowed optimal management of a sizable group of patients previously confused with pathologically documented CNS vasculitis.

Summary

Sound treatment decisions are based on accurate diagnosis. It is essential for the clinicians involved in the evaluation of patients with CNS vasculitis to be aware of its mimics especially RCVS. This article provides a comprehensive review of CNS vasculitis and its differential diagnosis. Furthermore, it touches upon workup and treatment of CNS vasculitis.

### Primary central nervous system vasculitis: pathology and mechanisms [^113P8k8R]. Acta Neuropathologica (2012). Low credibility.

Primary vasculitis of the central nervous system (PCNSV) is a rare and diagnostically challenging form of vasculitis limited to the brain and/or spinal cord. It is a complex and often severe disease with multifaceted clinical and pathological appearances, suggesting multiple disease subtypes and the potential existence of multiple etiologic pathways. We describe in detail the clinical, imaging, and neuropathological findings of PCNSV summarizing literature data and our observations from a cohort of 131 patients diagnosed at Mayo Clinic over a 25-year period (1983–2007). Unlike systemic vasculitis, little is known regarding PCNSV pathogenesis and the involved immunological mechanisms. Increased recognition of the disease spectrum and in-depth characterization of its histopathologic and immunological phenotype will be critical to eventually understanding the underlying derangements and mechanisms driving PCNSV. Improved understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease may also help determine whether the different histologic patterns and clinical subsets represent more than one disease and ultimately may permit development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for it.

### Adult primary central nervous system vasculitis [^111gZo4S]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Primary CNS vasculitis is an uncommon disorder of unknown cause that is restricted to brain and spinal cord. The median age of onset is 50 years. The neurological manifestations are diverse, but generally consist of headache, altered cognition, focal weakness, or stroke. Serological markers of inflammation are usually normal. Cerebrospinal fluid is abnormal in about 80–90% of patients. Diagnosis is unlikely in the presence of a normal MRI of the brain. Biopsy of CNS tissue showing vasculitis is the only definitive test; however, angiography has often been used for diagnosis even though it has only moderate sensitivity and specificity. The size of the affected vessels varies and determines outcome and response to treatment. Early recognition is important because treatment with corticosteroids with or without cytotoxic drugs can often prevent serious outcomes. The differential diagnosis includes reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes and secondary cerebral vasculitis.

### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system and its mimics: a pattern-based approach to biopsies for central nervous system vasculitis [^112awkpU]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare vasculitis that affects small parenchymal and leptomeningeal vessels in the brain and spinal cord. As brain biopsy remains the gold standard in diagnosis, the diagnostic approach to brain biopsies for vasculitis is well described. However, a significant minority of brain biopsies for central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis identify alternative diagnoses. Therefore, it is critical to be aware of the spectrum of infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases that may enter into the differential diagnosis of a biopsy for potential CNS vasculitis and recognize the pathologic patterns that characterize these diseases.

Objective —

To review the broad diagnostic considerations in evaluating a biopsy for potential CNS vasculitis, with an emphasis on a pattern-based approach and diagnostic tools used to evaluate other entities in the differential diagnosis.

Data Sources —

This review is based on the clinical experience of the authors and a review of the literature.

Conclusions —

A diagnosis of CNS vasculitis is dependent on the identification of transmural inflammation and vascular wall damage, preferentially affecting leptomeningeal and superficial cortical vessels. Where a diagnosis of vasculitis is not made, granulomatous, lymphocytic, and necrotizing patterns of inflammation present alternative differential diagnoses. The appropriate application of immunohistochemistry, special stains, and other diagnostic tools is critical in resolving these diagnoses.

### Imaging findings in primary central nervous system vasculitis [^113wDgP9]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV) is a rare primary vasculitis limited to the brain and spinal cord. It can affect any age group, but has a predilection for subjects aged 40 to 60 years without clear gender predominance. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific, including headache, non-focal neurological features and, less frequently, focal neurological signs. Brain biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard, but may be falsely negative when unaffected tissue is sampled. In addition, brain biopsy carries a small but significant risk of serious complications. Imaging procedures are a key part of the workup of PCNSV patients. They can be used to document the extent and type of lesions, to gauge response to treatment, and sometimes as surrogates for brain biopsy. Magnetic resonance is extremely sensitive but non-specific. The most common findings are multiple bilateral ischaemic lesions often involving white and grey matter. Conventional or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) typically shows segmental narrowing and dilation in multiple cerebral arteries. However, atypical findings have also been described both with magnetic resonance and angiography. This review discusses the state-of-the-art of current imaging techniques in the workup of PCNSV patients and highlights future prospects.

### Management of primary and secondary central nervous system vasculitis [^1128tmai]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article summarizes the current evidence on the management of primary and secondary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis.

Recent Findings

Two recent retrospective cohort studies have described the treatment and outcomes of patients with adult primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV). Although the majority of the patients (> 60%) responded to therapy with glucocorticoids alone or in conjunction with cyclophosphamide (CYC) and tended to improve during the follow-up period, an overall increased mortality was observed. The treatment response and the outcomes appeared primarily related to the size of the vessels involved in the inflammatory process. The involvement of small cortical/leptomeningeal vessels was associated with a more benign course, whereas the involvement of larger/proximal cerebral vessels was related to a less favorable prognosis and identified cases that should be treated more aggressively. Glucocorticoids combined with CYC are the mainstay of therapy for secondary CNS vasculitis. Observational studies have documented the efficacy of rituximab as induction therapy in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and CNS disease, while the role of antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents is more controversial. Case series have demonstrated the efficacy of anti-TNF agents in patients with neuro-Behçet's disease. Tocilizumab may also be effective in this condition.

Summary

Recognition of findings at diagnosis that predict the course or outcomes of PCNSV may serve as guide for therapy. Biological agents may provide benefit to difficult-to-treat patients with CNS involvement secondary to AAV and Behçet's disease.

### Central nervous system vasculitis in children [^112pYgpT]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

To summarize the current literature on central nervous system vasculitis in childhood because this condition remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

Recent Findings

Central nervous system vasculitis in childhood may be primary or secondary to a variety of conditions including infections, collagen vascular diseases, systemic vasculitides, and malignancies. Conditions that result in vasospasm or are associated with noninflammatory vasculopathies may mimic the features of central nervous system vasculitis. Recent studies have described the clinical spectrum of CNS vasculitis in childhood. The most common presenting features are headaches and focal neurologic deficits. The diagnosis of central nervous system vasculitis remains particularly difficult because the available investigative modalities have limited sensitivities and specificities. The most helpful diagnostic tests include cerebrospinal fluid analysis, MRI of the brain, and angiography. However, brain biopsy may be required to diagnose small vessel vasculitis.

Summary

This review summarizes recent data on primary central nervous system vasculitis and some of the secondary CNS vasculitides in children. Awareness of the presenting clinical features of CNS vasculitis should lead to consideration of the diagnosis. Awareness of the sensitivity and specificity of the various diagnostic tests should lead to the more prudent use of invasive diagnostic tests including angiography and brain biopsy.

### Vasculitis of the nervous system [^113NffDM]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is inflammation of the blood vessels, which may involve either the central nervous system (CNS), or the peripheral nervous system (PNS), or both. This involvement may be primary and restricted to the CNS, and rarely to the PNS". Primary angiitis of the CNS" is the term used to describe isolated CNS involvement by vasculitis, in which neither the clinical presentation and behaviour of the disease, nor the histopathology is uniform. This heterogeneity indicates a spectrum, depending on the type and extent of the vascular involvement seen within the CNS, covering a group of disorders, rather than a single disease. This may explain the different prognosis and response to treatments. In clinical practice vasculitis of the nervous system, secondary to a known cause or underlying disease is more commonly seen than as a primary disorder. Primary systemic vasculitides and connective-tissue disorders, Behçet's Disease, lymphoproliferative diseases and other malignancies, some infections and related conditions, drugs and substance abuse are some of the conditions known to cause vasculitis in the nervous system. There is a broad variety of pathogenetic mechanisms. Both the CNS and the PNS may be involved, either separately or together.

### Central nervous system vasculitis in children [^116uAnDP]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current literature of childhood primary and secondary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis and to evaluate the growing differential diagnosis of inflammatory and noninflammatory brain diseases.

Recent Findings

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system in children (cPACNS) is a reversible cause of severe neurological deficits and/or psychiatric symptoms. This disease is classified into subtypes based on distinct clinical and radiological features, treatment strategies, and disease trajectories. Also, the increased diagnostic yield from elective brain biopsies in children has improved our ability to diagnose angiography-negative cPACNS. Over the past few years, the differential diagnosis for cPACNS has rapidly expanded due to the characterization of novel inflammatory and noninflammatory brain diseases. Specifically, vasoconstrictive disorders and neuronal antibody-associated conditions have now been described in children and have overlapping clinical features with cPACNS.

Summary

This review summarizes the recent data on diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cPACNS. It also addresses the evolving differential diagnosis for CNS vasculitis. Our improved understanding of these disorders allows a tailored diagnostic approach leading to rapid diagnosis and initiation of therapy in these potentially reversible conditions.

### Primary central nervous system vasculitis and headache: ten themes [^1154pXQc]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Vasculitis refers to heterogeneous clinicopathologic disorders that share the histopathology of inflammation of blood vessels. Headache may be an important clue to vasculitic involvement of CNS vessels. There is general agreement on several principles in the approach to vasculitis especially primary CNS types. First, it is a potentially serious disorder with a propensity for permanent disability owing to tissue ischemic and infarction. Second, cerebral angiography is a reliable and reproducible method of diagnosis in large vessels but misses small vessel involvement, thus the absence of evidence of suspected findings does not exclude widespread small vessel involvement. Third, confirmation of arteritis should be obtained in suspected children and adults through biopsy of brain and meninges. Fourth, undiagnosed and therefore untreated, CNS vasculitides are often fatal. Fifth, clinicians must therefore choose from among the available immune modulating, suppressive, and targeted immunotherapies to induce and maintain remission status and prevent relapse, cautioned by serious and potentially lethal side effects.

### Primary central nervous system vasculitis and headache: ten themes [^114p8rwC]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

At the turn of the twentieth century, granulomatous angiitis of the brain was the prototypical form of a vasculitis restricted to the central nervous system (CNS). The disorder is recognized for its distinctive clinical and laboratory presentation, association with a diverse comorbid illnesses, and the predilection for cerebral vessels of varying caliber, from small meningeal to named cerebral and spinal vessels. A striking and often defining feature of the disorder was progressive headache. The past two decades have witnessed extraordinary progress in understanding of adult and pediatric primary CNS angiitis respectively abbreviated PACNS, cPACNS) in large retrospective, observational cohorts, and patient registries, stratifying cases based upon clinical, neuroradiologic, and histopathological features, leading to insights in management aimed at averting inevitable morbidity and mortality resulting from brain infarction. Part 1 chapter of Headache and the Vasculitides dealt with systemic vasculitides; Part 2 focuses on 10 themes relating primary CNS vasculitis to headache. There is a recent review of adult and pediatric systemic and CNS vasculitides.

### Central nervous system vasculitis: primary angiitis of the central nervous system and central nervous system manifestations of systemic vasculitis [^1149wska]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV) is a group of disorders leading to inflammatory vasculopathy within the brain, spinal cord, and leptomeninges. CNSV is divided into primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) and secondary CNSV based on the underlying etiology. PACNS is a rare inflammatory disorder with poorly understood pathophysiology and heterogeneous and highly variable clinical features. The diagnosis depends on a combination of clinical and laboratory variables, multimodal imaging, and histopathological examination as well as exclusion of mimics. Several systemic vasculitides, infectious etiologies and connective tissue disorders have been shown to cause secondary CNSV and require prompt recognition.

### Primary angiitis of the CNS: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111xiokS]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data in our systematic review and meta-analysis were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Search Strategy and Study Selection

We systematically searched articles in PubMed, looking at the period between 1988 when current diagnostic criteria for PACNS were established, and February 2020, using the following search terms: "Primary angiitis of the central nervous system" OR "Primary central nervous system vasculitis" OR "Cerebral Vasculitis". A detailed description of the search strategy and study selection is provided in the eMethods.

Data Extraction

Data were collected independently by 2 reviewers (D.S. and C.B). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus after further review of the relevant publications (D.S. and C.B.) or, if necessary, by a third reviewer (J.M.). Extracted study and patient characteristics included year of publication, sample size, study period, study location, study design, follow-up period, initial clinical presentation, qualitative changes in CSF parameters and inflammatory markers, radiographic and histologic findings, treatments, and outcomes. Different n-numbers in different parts of our analysis are due to the structure and extent of data given by the respective studies.

Statistical Analysis

We used R version 3.5.0 to perform the statistical analyses. The following packages were used: Metafor and Forestplot. We extracted and pooled proportions using fixed-effects models. To quantify the heterogeneity of the collected data, I² was calculated for each item under investigation.

### Primary central nervous system vasculitis-an update on diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment [^116jAthW]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Importance

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare condition which is often misdiagnosed. In order to avoid mistakes in the management, a step by step approach is necessary.

Observations

The most common presenting symptoms of PACNS are encephalopathy-related cognitive and affective abnormalities, headaches and multifocal symptoms associated with recurrent episodes of ischemia or hemorrhage. Seizures and spinal cord lesions may also occur. Diagnostic work up includes MRI, CSF examination, angiography and brain biopsy. Since all reported signs and findings lack specificity, the exclusion of differential diagnoses is essential before immunosuppressive therapy is started. Important differential diagnoses include reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, cerebral involvement of systemic vasculitides or rheumatic diseases, moyamoya angiopathy and infectious vasculopathies Effective treatment has been reported with glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide or rituximab; however, randomized clinical trials of PACNS treatment do not exist.

Conclusions and Relevance

PACNS is an important but rare differential diagnosis in daily neurological practice. The strict adherence to diagnostic criteria and the avoidance of inappropriate therapies in non-inflammatory vasculopathies and infectious diseases are essential.

### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system [^1122ZW2i]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) was first identified half a century ago, but it remains a rare and challenging disease. However, important advances have been made in the field of PACNS, mainly through recently published retrospective analyses of large groups of PACNS patients, and the consideration of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome as a distinct entity. Clinical manifestations of PACNS are variable and non-specific. Even though neuroimaging can be suggestive of vasculitis, only a leptomeningeal biopsy can definitively confirm vasculitis. However, a brain sample is taken in less than half the patients and cannot further help to distinguish between PACNS and secondary vasculitis of the central nervous system. Hence, physicians should be aware of all alternative diagnoses and PACNS mimickers, which are now well-known. Whereas prognosis now appears to be much better than for the first reported cases, probably attributable to the use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, mainly cyclophosphamide, the optimal therapeutic regimen, potentially based on each patient's characteristics, and its duration remain to be determined. Only multicenter studies and prospective therapeutic trials will be able to clarify these issues on therapy and eventually provide some data on PACNS physiopathogenesis, which remains a poorly explored domain.

### Adult primary central nervous system vasculitis: an update [^112MkHU9]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review was to cover the recent major advances made in the fields of clinical assessment, diagnosis and treatment of adult primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV).

Recent Findings

To prevent misdiagnosis, particularly with the reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes, new criteria on the basis of the levels of certainty of the diagnosis of PCNSV have been proposed. Advances in the neuroimaging techniques visualizing the wall of intracranial blood vessels have improved the capacity to distinguish inflammatory from noninflammatory vascular lesions. These techniques could play in the future an important role in the diagnosis of PCNSV. Studies of larger numbers of cases have revealed a more varied histopathological inflammatory picture and disclosed an association with amyloid angiopathy. It has also been recognized that PCNSV is a heterogeneous disorder encompassing clinical subsets that differ in terms of prognosis and therapy. Finally, differently from earliest reports that suggested a poor prognosis with a fatal outcome in the majority of the cases, a large recent study from Mayo Clinic has described a more favorable course with good response to therapy and a favorable outcome in 81% of cases.

Summary

Our better understanding of the PCNSV spectrum and its subsets will facilitate early recognition. This may facilitate earlier treatment and may prevent irreversible or even lethal outcomes.

### Primary central nervous system vasculitis: analysis of 101 patients [^111Km3Z3]. Annals of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the clinical findings, response to therapy, outcome, and incidence of primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV) in a large cohort from a single center.

Methods

We retrospectively studied 101 patients with PCNSV, selected by predetermined diagnostic criteria, who were seen during a 21-year period. This was a collaborative study by five departments at a large multispecialty clinic. Clinical findings and outcomes were compared among patients categorized by method of diagnosis, response to therapy, survival, and degree of disability. An annual incidence rate was calculated.

Results

Seventy patients were diagnosed by angiography and 31 by central nervous system biopsy. Three histological patterns were observed during biopsy. Although most patients responded to therapy, an increased mortality rate was observed. Relapses occurred in one fourth of patients. Mortality rate and disability at last follow-up were greater in those who presented with a focal neurological deficit, cognitive impairment, cerebral infarctions, and angiographic large-vessel involvement but were lower in those with prominent gadolinium-enhanced lesions when evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. The annual incidence rate of PCNSV was 2.4 cases per 1,000,000 person-years.

Interpretation

PCNSV is a rare disease that may result in serious neurological outcomes or death. Angiography and brain biopsy may complement each other when determining the diagnosis. Early recognition and treatment may reduce poor outcomes. PCNSV is a variable syndrome that appears to consist of several subsets of heterogeneous diseases.

### Biopsy-confirmed small vessel primary CNS vasculitis: clinical features and impact of early intensive treatment on remission [^115xxbtW]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV), also referred to as primary angiitis of the central nervous system, is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by destructive inflammation of blood vessels within the brain or spinal cord. Diagnosis requires either neuropathologic evidence of vasculitis on CNS biopsy or angiographic abnormalities consistent with vasculitis, and rigorous exclusion of alternate etiologies and secondary causes of CNS vasculitis (such as CNS infection, CNS involvement of systemic vasculitis, or malignancy). This broad diagnostic framework includes patients with predominantly large and/or medium vessel involvement detectable on conventional angiography, as well as those with involvement of small vessels that are below the resolution of angiography and thus only detectable on CNS biopsy.

Adult PCNSV cohort studies have tended to include all patients regardless of vessel-size involvement, and as a result, patients with small vessel predominant disease often comprise a minority in these cohorts. Analogous to systemic vasculitis syndromes, there are notable differences in PCNSV based on affected vessel size, including a higher likelihood of cognitive impairment, seizures, abnormalities on CSF testing, and gadolinium enhancement on MRI among patients with small vessel predominant PCNSV (sv-PCSNV).

Lumping large vessel (lv-PCNSV) and small vessel phenotypes into a single diagnostic entity may limit our understanding of these distinct ends of the clinical spectrum. For example, several experts recommend early intensive treatment (EIT) with cyclophosphamide, based on observational data across the larger umbrella of PCNSV and, in part, from inference from clinical trial data in select systemic vasculitis syndromes. However, the optimal treatment of sv-PCNSV is uncertain and clinically variable, and some have considered glucocorticoid monotherapy as a reasonable first-line treatment option based on cohort studies suggesting a less aggressive clinical course for sv-PCNSV. The decision to pursue "early intensive" treatment with more potent therapies or to begin with lower intensity agents and "escalate" only if necessary is often highly individualized, weighing the potential for better long-term outcomes against the risk of more significant side effects. However, considering the paucity of sv-PCNSV–specific data and the real-world barriers that often further limit the use of cyclophosphamide in clinical practice — clinician discomfort, lack of expertise prescribing such medication, difficulty accessing care toxicity, contraindications, and patient tolerability, among others — further information is needed to inform these treatment decisions.

### Central nervous system vasculitis in adults: an update [^112GxWNe]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV) is a challenging diagnosis due to broad clinical manifestations and variable specificity and sensitivity of laboratory and imaging diagnostic tools. Differential diagnosis includes reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), secondary vasculitis of the CNS and other noninflammatory vasculopathies. Brain biopsy is essential for definitive diagnosis and to exclude mimickers. Recent data show that data large-vessel PCNSV present worse prognosis when compared to small-vessel PCNSV. Herein we review diagnosis and management of PCNSV, secondary vasculitis of CNS and RCVS.

### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system: avoiding misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of a rare disease [^113w2Xd2]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is an extremely rare condition, defined as a vasculitis limited to the CNS with no identifiable cause. Its presentation is non-specific and includes headache, cognitive dysfunction and focal neurological signs. Laboratory studies, neuroimaging and angiography are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for diagnosis; a definitive diagnosis requires brain biopsy. As a result, PACNS is commonly misdiagnosed. Here, we review its clinical, laboratory and radiological features, and focus on avoiding common diagnostic pitfalls.

### Treatment and long-term outcomes of primary central nervous system vasculitis [^116DRfFV]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose- We aimed to analyze the long-term outcomes of patients with primary central nervous system vasculitis according to the different therapeutic strategies used to induce remission. Methods- We assessed the rate of prolonged remission (defined by the absence of relapse at ≥ 12 months after diagnosis) and the functional status at last follow-up in patients with primary central nervous system vasculitis included in the French cohort, who achieved a first remission according to the 3 main groups of treatments administered: glucocorticoids only (group 1); induction treatment with glucocorticoids and an immunosuppressant, but no maintenance (group 2); and combined treatment with glucocorticoids and an immunosuppressant for induction followed by maintenance therapy (group 3). Good functional status was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2 at the last follow-up. Results- Remission was achieved with the initial induction treatment in 106 (95%) of the 112. Prolonged remission without relapse was observed in 70 (66%) patients after 57 (12–198) months of follow-up. A good functional status at last follow-up (ie, modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2) was observed in 63 (56%) patients. Overall mortality was 8%. The initial severity and the radiological presentations were comparable in the 3 treatment groups. More prolonged remissions (P = 0.003) and a better functional status at the last follow-up (P = 0.0004) were observed in group 3. In multivariate analysis, the use of maintenance therapy was associated with prolonged remission (odds ratio, 4.32 [1.67–12.19]; P = 0.002) and better functional status (odds ratio, 8.09 [3.24–22.38]; P < 0.0001). Conclusions- This study suggests that maintenance therapy with an immunosuppressant combined with glucocorticoids lead to the best long-term clinical and functional outcomes in patients with primary central nervous system vasculitis after having achieved remission with either glucocorticoids alone or in combination with another immunosuppressant.

### Angiography-negative primary angiitis of the central nervous system in childhood [^1159QMX5]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Childhood primary angiitis of the CNS is a recently characterized, potentially reversible disease process. A favorable outcome requires early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The histological findings of childhood primary angiitis of the CNS are characterized by a lymphocytic, nongranulomatous vasculitis. This disorder can lead to neurological deficits, seizures, and strokes. Laboratory and radiographic investigation are part of the evaluation, but are often nonspecific. Conventional angiography can fail to show any abnormality, and biopsy may ultimately be required for diagnosis. Although there can be significant rates of morbidity and mortality if untreated, patients who receive appropriate therapy can experience excellent outcomes, and in many cases will demonstrate near-complete or total clinical and radiographic resolution. The case of a previously healthy 13-year-old girl with new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures is presented, with a review of the literature.

INTRODUCTION

It may be said that efforts to define a disease are attempts to understand the very concept of the disease. This has been especially evident in systemic and primary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitides. For the past 100 years, since the first description of granulomatous angiitis of the nervous system and brain (GANS, GAB) and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), they have captured the attention of generations of clinical investigators around the globe to reach a better understanding. Since my earlier review for this journal two decades ago, notable progress has been made in the relationship of vasculitis and headache. Primary CNS vasculitides are described in Part 2 of this article. There is a recent review of adult and pediatric systemic vasculitides.

### Cerebral vasculitis in adults: what are the steps in order to establish the diagnosis? Red flags and pitfalls [^114zpQ6y]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasculitis is a rare cause of juvenile stroke. It may occur as primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) or as CNS manifestation in the setting of systemic vasculitis. Clinical hints for vasculitis are headache, stroke, seizures, encephalopathy and signs of a systemic inflammatory disorder. Diagnostic work-up includes anamnesis, whole body examination, laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography and brain biopsy. Due to the rarity of the disease, exclusion of more frequent differential diagnoses is a key element of diagnostic work -up. This review summarizes the steps that lead to the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis and describes the red flags and pitfalls. Despite considering the dilemma of angiography-negative vasculitis and false-negative brain biopsy in some cases, it is important to protect patients from 'blind' immunosuppressive therapy in unrecognized non-inflammatory differential diagnosis.

### Primary CNS vasculitis: a systematic review on clinical characteristics associated with abnormal biopsy and angiography [^112citwh]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary Central Nervous System Vasculitis (PCNSV) remains a diagnostic challenge due to its variable and non-specific clinical manifestations. In part, the clinical heterogeneity of PCNSV may be a consequence of the modalities used for diagnosis; accordingly, there may be different subtypes of PCNSV based on whether the diagnosis was attained by biopsy or cerebral angiography.

Objective

To examine the frequency of symptoms, laboratory, and radiological features associated with PCNSV, and to identify distinct clinical features between biopsy and angiography defined PCNSV.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of articles published in the English language from 1991 to 2019 that met all diagnostic criteria of PCNSV.

Results

We identified 55 studies, reporting on 907 PCNSV cases. Median age was 45 (IQR 50–36), and 53% were women. Biopsy compared to angiography defined PCNSV had a higher percentage of cognitive impairment, and seizures on initial presentation, and were more likely to have a subacute or progressive onset, abnormal CSF profile, small vessel involvement on angiography, and tumor-like lesions and gadolinium enhancement on MRI. Angiography defined PCNSV were more likely to have an acute onset, focal weakness and visual impairment on initial presentation, medium vessel involvement on angiography, and infarcts on MRI. Brain biopsy was diagnostic of PCNSV in 71% of cases, and demonstrated an alternative diagnosis in 37% of cases, the most common being infection (19%) and lymphoproliferative disease (18%).

Conclusions

This study provides further evidence that there are distinct clinical features between biopsy and angiography defined PCNSV, which may aid in selecting patients for appropriate invasive tests.

### Adult primary central nervous system vasculitis treatment and course: analysis of one hundred sixty-three patients [^113RRJFq]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the treatment and outcomes of patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis.

Methods

We retrospectively studied a cohort of 163 consecutive patients with primary CNS vasculitis who were seen at the Mayo Clinic over a 29-year period. We analyzed treatments, treatment responses, and factors predictive of outcomes.

Results

A favorable response was observed in 85% of patients treated with prednisone alone and in 80% of patients treated with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Relapses were observed in 27% of patients, and 25% of patients had discontinued therapy by the time of the last followup visit. Treatment with prednisone alone was associated with more frequent relapses (odds ratio [OR] 2.90), while large vessel involvement (OR 6.14) and cerebral infarcts at the time of diagnosis (OR 3.32) were associated with a poor response to treatment. Prominent gadolinium-enhanced cerebral lesions or meninges were linked with continued treatment at the last followup encounter (OR 2.28). Higher disability scores at the last followup visit were associated with increasing age at the time of diagnosis (OR 1.44) and cerebral infarctions (OR 3.74), while lower disability scores were associated with gadolinium-enhanced cerebral lesions or meninges (OR 0.35) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (OR 0.24). Increased mortality was associated with increasing age at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39), diagnosis by angiography (HR 3.28), cerebral infarction (HR 4.44), and large vessel involvement (HR 4.98), while reduced mortality was associated with gadolinium-enhanced cerebral lesions or meninges (HR 0.20).

Conclusion

The majority of patients with primary CNS vasculitis responded to treatment. Recognition of findings at diagnosis that predict the course or outcome may aid in decision-making regarding therapy.

### Atypical presentation of fulminant primary central nervous system angiitis [^112oj4i3]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System (PACNS) is a rare cause of CNS vasculitis that should be included as part complete differential diagnosis, especially in cases with suggestive imaging findings and an absence of secondary causes for CNS vasculitis.

Case Presentation

We describe a case of a 47-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male presenting with rapid progression of encephalopathy and fevers. Extensive infectious, autoimmune, and imaging workups were unrevealing. A diagnosis of PACNS was made posthumously on histopathology.

Conclusions

PACNS is a challenging diagnosis owing to frequent discrepancies between radiologic and histopathologic findings. Tissue biopsy is key to diagnosing PACNS.

1 Introduction

Primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV) is a rare inflammatory disorder affecting CNS vessels that is responsible for high morbidity. In the absence of a CNS biopsy showing transmural inflammation of the vessel wall, diagnosis is challenging and often relies on indirect evidence of vascular involvement combined with inflammatory findings on CSF analysis or contrast imaging. In the last two decades, few cohorts with > 60 patients have been reported. Initially, patients were classified according to the methodology used for diagnosis. Patients with a positive biopsy result were compared to those with an angiogram‐based diagnosis, with a negative or no biopsy. Some differences regarding their clinical and radiological presentations were observed between these groups. Given that patients with a positive biopsy often have a negative angiogram, they are considered to present a pattern of small‐vessel (sv) PCNSV. Conversely, those with positive angiograms are considered to present large/medium‐vessel (l/mv) PCNSV. A comparison of patients with sv‐ and l/mv‐PCNSV produced relatively similar results to those of biopsy‐proven and angiogram‐diagnosed patients. Patients with biopsy‐proven or sv‐PCNSV often present with seizures, cognitive impairment, gadolinium‐enhanced parenchymal or leptomeningeal lesions, cerebral microbleeds, and elevated CSF white blood cells. Conversely, angiogram‐diagnosed or l/mv patients often present with focal deficits in relation to brain infarcts on MRI and arterial stenoses on angiograms.

Although practical, this artificial phenotypic distinction includes some important biases. First, we cannot exclude the possibility that patients with negative angiograms were more likely to be referred for a biopsy than patients with positive angiograms. Second, some patients had overlapping presentations and may have been misclassified (e.g. positive biopsy and abnormal angiogram). Finally, important data were lacking for some patients (gadolinium‐injected sequences, biopsy performance), and their results may have changed the phenotypic distinction.

Taken together, these observations require validation using an unsupervised analysis of easily accessible baseline variables. In this study, we aimed to determine whether a hierarchical cluster analysis conducted in the COVAC' registry may identify PCNSV subgroups that share similarities with those suggested and reported in cohorts that did not use clustering methods.

### Catastrophic primary central nervous system vasculitis [^112DQB1z]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV) is an uncommon condition that affects the brain and the spinal cord. It is heterogeneous in presenting characteristics and outcomes. We report a patient with a catastrophic rapidly progressive course refractory to intensive treatment with pulses of methylprednisolone and iv cyclophosphamide. The condition rapidly deteriorated and the patient died 6 weeks after presentation. Rapidly progressive PCNSV represents the worst end of the clinical spectrum of PCNSV. These patients are characterised by bilateral, multiple, large cerebral vessel lesions on angiograms and multiple bilateral cerebral infarctions.

THEME 2: PRIMARY CNS VASCULITIDES ARE SUCH EXCEPTIONALLY RARE DISORDERS THAT GLOBAL COOPERATION IS NECESSARY TO ASSEMBLE SUFFICIENT COHORTS TO DERIVE ITS ASSOCIATED EPIDEMIOLOGY

Collaborative, evidence-based, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational cohorts have been undertaken by the French Vasculitis Study Group (FVSG), French NeuroVascular Society (SFNV), and National Society of Internal Medicine (SNFMI databases, United States-Canadian Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium (VCRC), European Vasculitis Study Society (EUVAS), EULAR, The French Vasculitis Cohort of Patients with Primary Vasculitis of the Central Nervous System (COVAC), and the Diagnostic and Classification Criteria in Vasculitis Study (DCVAS) have all contributed to the epidemiology primary CNS and systemic vasculitides. Attesting to the rarity of PCNSV, DCVAS identified 42 (0.6%) cases of PCNSV among registrant pool of 6991 subjects with diverse forms of systemic and single organ vasculitis among 136 sites from 2011 to 2017 based on standard criteria endorsed by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and EULAR. There are no reliable incidence or prevalence data, which is problematic for identifying clinical subtypes. Recent international surveys collecting information on medium and large cPACNS and SV-cPACNS have been shared with international clinician networks, including the German Society for Paediatric Rheumatology, the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society, the "Network Paediatric Stroke", and members of the ACR/CARRA Registry of Paediatric Rheumatology list servers. This project has shown consensus in numerous diagnostic and therapeutic treatment approaches highlighting key areas to be utilized in the epidemiology, and development of expert standardization of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in this rare inflammatory brain disease.

THEME 1: THE CLASSIFICATION AND NOSOLOGY OF PRIMARY CNS VASCULITIDES LIKE ITS SYSTEMIC COUNTERPARTS, RESTS UPON THE CALIBER OF VESSELS INVOLVED AND THE UNDERLYING HISTOPATHOLOGY

The 2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) Nomenclature of Vasculitides has been the most widely used classification for adult vasculitides. It categorizes the clinicopathologic entities based on the involved vessels and updated the nosology of the vasculitic syndromes, using specific descriptive terminology that conveyed pathophysiologic specificity. The Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES) and the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) in collaboration with the Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) reported methodology and overall clinical, laboratory and radiographic characteristics for several childhood systemic vasculitides followed by a final validated classification also based upon vessel size, with high sensitivity and specificity. In keeping with this nosology, primary CNS vasculitides may be classified as a single organ vasculitis (SOV) along with vasculitides restricted to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and aorta (IgG4-aortitis) and related diseases.

Adult and childhood isolated CNS angiitis (IACNS), PACNS, granulomatous angiitis of the brain (GAB) and GANS; adult and cPACNS are all equivalent terms for prototypical primary vasculitic disorders restricted to the CNS.

PedVas, the Pediatric Vasculitis Initiative (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02006134) and ARCHiVe Investigators collaborating on the multicenter international pilot Registry for Childhood Vasculitis: e-entry; in association with members of the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA); the web-based network, BrainWorks: The International Childhood CNS Vasculitis Outcome Study, have been collecting clinical and biobank data of registered cPACNS, systemic and unclassified vasculitis cases for over a decade. The subtypes of cPACNS are distinguished by vessel size, angiographic and pathologic findings, and the presence or absence of long-term progression. The predilection for the caliber of involved vessels may be predicted by neuroimaging employing magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA) and conventional catheter angiography (CA), and subcategorized into angiography-positive nonprogressive (APNP) and progressive (APP)-cPACNS affecting medium and large vessels, and angiography-negative (AN) small-vessel cPACNS (SVcPACNS) due to affliction of small vessels.

### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system: description of the first fifty-two adults enrolled in the French cohort of patients with primary vasculitis of the central nervous system [^115nqDeo]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe characteristics and outcomes of a multicenter cohort of patients diagnosed as having primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS).

Methods

In 2010, we initiated a cohort study of adults diagnosed as having PACNS ≤ 15 years ago and with followup of > 6 months (unless they died earlier of biopsy-proven PACNS). Its first analysis was planned at 2 years. Multidisciplinary investigators verified that appropriate investigations were done and excluded patients with possible alternative diagnoses. We analyzed patient demographics and symptoms, laboratory, radiographic, and histologic findings, and treatments. Studied outcomes included treatment response(s), relapse, death, and disability.

Results

We included 52 patients (30 males; median age at diagnosis 43.5 years [range 18–79 years]) in whom PACNS was diagnosed between 1996 and 2012. Nineteen (61%) of 31 patients who had undergone brain biopsy had histologic vasculitis (biopsy-proven PACNS), while the other 12 patients had normal or noncontributive biopsy samples. An additional 21 patients had signs suggestive of PACNS on conventional cerebral angiography. All but 1 patient received corticosteroids, and 44 patients received cyclophosphamide (CYC). After a median followup of 35 months (range 2–148 months) postdiagnosis (1 patient with biopsy-proven PACNS died 2 months after diagnosis), 32 patients responded to treatment with improved modified Rankin scale scores, 4 patients (8%) did not respond, 14 patients (27%) had relapse of their disease at least once, and 3 patients (6%) died (1 patient after a relapse). Relapse was more common in patients with than in those without meningeal gadolinium enhancements on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (8 of 10 [80%] versus 6 of 32 [19%]; P = 0.001) and more common in patients with than in those without seizures at diagnosis (8 of 17 [47%] versus 6 of 35 [17%]; P = 0.04).

Conclusion

In this cohort of patients with PACNS, most patients received corticosteroids and CYC, and mortality was low. Patients with seizures at diagnosis or meningeal enhancements on MRI may be prone to relapse and require a different treatment strategy.

### Unilateral primary angiitis of the central nervous system: a rare and under-recognized entity [^111Y2hnz]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is an uncommon inflammatory vasculitis restricted to the brain, spinal cord, and/or the leptomeninges. While typically bilateral, a rare subset presents with strictly unilateral involvement. This variant remains underrecognized and is often misdiagnosed as glioma, demyelination, or chronic encephalitis due to overlapping clinical and imaging features. Unilateral PACNS (U-PACNS) may manifest as tumor-like solitary or multifocal lesions, infarcts, or hemorrhages. Imaging, including vessel wall imaging (VWI), perfusion and spectroscopy may demonstrate underlying abnormalities but are often non-specific. Histopathologically, most cases show small-to medium-vessel lymphocytic vasculitis, in contrast to granulomatous inflammation which is more common in bilateral disease. Diagnosis is challenging, particularly in angiography-negative presentations, and often relies on excluding systemic, infectious, and neoplastic mimics. Recognition of U-PACNS is critical, as timely immunosuppressive therapy can avoid misdiagnosis, alter disease course and prevent irreversible deficits. The authors found 49 reported cases of U-PACNS in the English literature. Herein, we present a review of this rare and underrecognized entity, outlining key imaging features, and pertinent differentials that may help with a more accurate and timely non-invasive diagnosis. ABBREVIATIONS: U-PACNS＝ Unilateral Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System; CSF = Cerebrospinal Fluid; TLM = Tumor-like Mass; UR-PACNS = Unilateral Relapsing Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System.

Consider initiating mycophenolate mofetil for maintenance therapy to reduce the toxicity of long-term cyclophosphamide.

### Advancing knowledge in CNS vasculitis [^1115AwcD]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Only a few well-described cohorts of patients with primary CNS vasculitis (PCNSV; sometimes called primary angiitis of the CNS [PACNS]) have been published with enough follow-up to be able to really assess global and neurologic outcomes. There is still no definitive clinical tool or biomarker to confirm the diagnosis of PCNSV. The commonly used 1988 diagnostic criteria from Calabrese and Malek, slightly modified in 2009 by Birnbaum and Hellmann, have not been thoroughly validated, but made sense and matched clinical practice and diagnostic reasoning. A brain and/or leptomeningeal biopsy is the only way to definitively confirm CNS vasculitis, but a plethora of more frequent mimickers and causes for secondary CNS vasculitis have still to be ruled out, especially in patients with a diagnosis based on angiographic abnormalities and/or without obvious inflammatory CNS features on CSF analysis, gadolinium-enhancing lesions, or vessel wall enhancement on MRI. A follow-up helps support the diagnosis, but possibly in the future, a minority of patients in these cohorts will be found to have a new genetic or infectious-triggered CNS condition. The list of PCNSV mimickers and secondary CNS vasculitis has been increasing steadily, with the identification of new genetically determined vasculopathies, such as deficiency in adenosine deaminase 2, and more sensitive tools, such as metagenomic next-generation sequencing, to detect rare CNS infections. Hence, in real-world practice, as in the main published cohorts of PCNSV, only 30%–50% of reported patients had a brain biopsy, and only 50%–65% of the latter had biopsy-proven CNS vasculitis. Additional information on the main subsets of PCNSV that have been described is also needed to better determine their respective outcomes and, in clinical practice, how best to treat them.

### Rapidly progressive primary central nervous system vasculitis [^115Qqzxi]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a subset of cases in a large cohort of patients with primary CNS vasculitis (PCNSV) who appear to have a rapidly progressive clinical course.

Method

In the present study, we use our updated cohort of 131 consecutive patients with PCNSV seen over the 25-year period of 1983–2007 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. The diagnosis of PCNSV was based on brain/spinal cord biopsy or cerebral angiography. The modified Rankin scale was used to identify rapidly progressive disease and included patients with Rankin scores indicating severe disability or death at diagnosis or within 6 months after the diagnosis. We compared patients with rapidly progressive disease to those without.

Results

Compared with the 120 patients without rapidly progressive vasculitis, the 11 patients with rapidly progressive vasculitis more frequently had paraparesis/quadriparesis at presentation, angiographic presence of bilateral, large-vessel vasculitis and MRI evidence of cerebral infarctions; those infarctions were more frequently multiple and bilateral, and more frequently involved both the cortex and subcortical regions on initial MRI. Granulomatous and/or necrotizing histopathological patterns of vasculitis were observed in patients with positive biopsies.

Conclusion

Rapidly progressive PCNSV appears to form a subset of PCNSV at the worst end of the clinical spectrum of this vasculitis, characterized by bilateral, multiple, large cerebral vessel lesions and multiple CNS infarctions.

Introduction

Small-Vessel Childhood Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System (sv-cPACNS) is a severe, immune-mediated inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS). It is a subtype of Childhood Primary Angiitis of the CNS (cPACNS), which is categorized based on the size of the blood vessels involved. sv-cPACNS specifically involves small blood vessels and is angiography-negative, distinguishing it from the angiography-positive large-to-medium vessel vasculitis (p-cPACNS). It commonly presents with severe headache, seizures, and/or focal neurological deficits. Early recognition leads to early initiation of targeted therapy that can reverse the devastating neurological inflammatory attack. If left untreated, the disease can lead to severe neurological damage or even death.

The diagnostic tools for suspected sv-cPACNS have significant limitations; the clinical presentation is heterogeneous, the laboratory tests lack sensitivity and specificity, and neuroimaging characteristics are often widely overlapping with other inflammatory brain disorders. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis alone or in combination have not sufficiently demonstrated positive predictive value to establish the diagnosis and cannot differentiate sv-cPACNS from other mimics. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) or Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), though well studied in p-cPACNS, it often is normal in cases of sv-cPACNS. Further, vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging that has shown to be valuable to evaluate cerebral vessels has not been vastly studied in cases of sv-cPACNS. As none of the findings are specific for sv-cPACNS, brain biopsy has remained the only definitive diagnostic test, provided it is performed early, with high-quality samples, and from targeted regions. Brain biopsy is essential not only for diagnosing sv-cPACNS but also for excluding other conditions like infections and malignancies.

### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system as a mimic of multiple sclerosis: a case report [^117DNQMQ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare inflammatory vasculopathy and it is a difficult diagnosis to make because of its kaleidoscopic presentation and its multiple mimics, including multiple sclerosis.

Case Presentation

A 21-year-old men presented a four-year history of progressive gait deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine showed hyperintense round-shaped lesions on T2 images, many with contrast enhancement, in supra/infratentorial and spinal segments. He received treatment for multiple sclerosis but presented clinical worsening, and follow-up neuroimaging showed persistent contrast enhancement lesions and a cerebellar hematoma. Brain biopsy was performed and demonstrated inflammatory infiltrations in blood vessels. The patient received 6 monthly schedules of 5 g methylprednisolone and 1 g cyclophosphamide with clinical stabilization.

Discussion

Our patient presented a primary angiitis central nervous system according to the Birnbaum and Hellmann proposed criteria. This case reinforces the importance of advancing the differential diagnosis of patients that present red flags in brain neuroimaging.

Conclusion

The presence of the micro/macrobleeds and persistent contrast enhancing lesions should raise the suspicion of vasculitis in the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system [^114ZtE3V]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is rare but often included in the differential diagnosis for unusual or unexplained neurologic symptoms owing to its array of clinical manifestations. PACNS is not a single entity, but rather an umbrella term for distinct subtypes of disease affecting different parts of the CNS, different sized vessels, and with different histologic and pathologic findings. Although brain biopsy is considered the gold standard test, it is neither highly sensitive nor specific. One must always pursue a workup for mimics of PACNS. Treatment consists of prednisone monotherapy or combination therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide.

THEME 3: FOR ALMOST A CENTURY, CASES OF PRIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM VASCULITIS WERE DEFINED AT POSTMORTEM EXAMINATION AS GRANULOMATOUS ANGIITIS

In 1922, Harbitz described two patients with a previously unrecognized cerebral vasculitis. At age 26, a woman noted worsening headaches, mental change, and ataxia, culminating two years later in stupor, spastic paraparesis, coma, and death. The other patient, a 46-year-old man, developed hallucinations and confusion progressing to gait difficulty, stupor, coma, and death in 9 months. At postmortem examination, both had granulomatous angiitis of the leptomeninges, composed of lymphocytes, multinucleate giant cells, and epithelioid cells, with vessel necrosis and extension into the brain along involved veins and arteries of varying caliber. In 1959, Cravioto and Fegin delineated the clinicopathologic syndrome of granulomatous angiitis, naming it instead for the distinctive CNS granulomatous vasculitis pathology that included multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells. For two more decades, rare affected patients were identified in life presenting with widely divergent systemic and neurological disorders including Hodgkin lymphoma, cerebral aneurysm, polymyalgia rheumatica, shingles, and brain tumor but there was no effective treatment.

### Diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of central nervous system vasculitis: an evaluation of vessel-wall MRI findings [^112fBwQ8]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis is a rare disease characterized by different etiologies, heterogeneous findings and a lack of definite diagnostic markers. Thus it poses great challenges regarding both diagnosis and treatment. Since therapy usually consists of long-term immunosuppression with potential major adverse effects, it is essential to establish a definite diagnosis and to evaluate the treatment response carefully. Along with clinical and laboratory findings, imaging is crucial in the work-up of CNS vasculitis. However, findings of both digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are unspecific regarding CNS vasculitis. While evidence of systemic vasculitis or CNS infection can help establish the diagnosis of CNS vasculitis in some cases, brain biopsy is considered mandatory to prove primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS). Yet even biopsy has a limited sensitivity with a relevant rate of false negative results, particularly when only medium- and/or large-sized vessels are affected.

Therefore, advances regarding diagnostic tests for CNS vasculitis are required. MRI with dedicated vessel wall imaging has been proposed in this respect. Vessel wall imaging uses different techniques to suppress the signal of intraluminal blood ("black blood imaging"), thus allowing evaluation of the vessel wall and possibly the detection of inflammatory changes within the vessel wall. Vessel wall contrast enhancement has been reported as a potential sign of CNS vasculitis as early as 2008. Vessel wall contrast enhancement in patients with CNS vasculitis is presumed to be caused by hyperpermeability of the endothelium and/or by neovascularization, resulting in leakage of contrast into the arterial wall either from the lumen of the main vessel or from vasa vasorum. Vessel wall imaging is now used in suspected CNS vasculitis in many neurovascular centers. However, there is still an eminent lack of original research on this subject, which is certainly due to the rarity of the disease. To date, there are only a few case reports and series evaluating vessel wall imaging in CNS vasculitis, with 29 patients being the largest reported CNS vasculitis group to our knowledge. Even less data is available concerning follow-up MRI with vessel wall imaging in CNS vasculitis patients. According to our literature research, the largest study groups in which follow-up vessel wall imaging results were specifically reported comprise only six patients. Thus the role of vessel wall imaging both regarding the diagnosis of CNS vasculitis and monitoring disease activity, particularly in response to immunosuppression, remains largely unproven.

Table 1
Angiography-negative small-vessel primary CNS vasculitis in children and adults

Finally, in comparison to adults, it is difficult to reconcile the use of cytotoxic therapy for any subtype of childhood primary CNS vasculitis given the disappointing results of systemic trials for childhood AAVs that found a rate of remission status of only 42% and visceral organ damage in 63% in its study cohort employing CYC for remission induction. Even with modifications in the treatment regimens over the past several years, systemic outcome remains relatively poor with nearly half of patients (45%) experiencing one or more clinical relapses despite significant improvements in rate of remission at the end of the induction period (80.4%), despite substantial chronic kidney disease (54.8% at 1 year) and clinically significant adverse events (in 54%) leading to treatment modifications (typically requiring dose reduction of CYC or switching to RTX). As prospective studies are needed to assess the most appropriate therapeutic modality for individual children with AAV, the same can be said for cPACNS and its subtypes.

THEME 5: BY THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, GRANULOMATOUS ANGIITIS WAS THE PROTOTYPICAL PRIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM ANGIITIS

Over the next decade, Younger et al. focused on prototypical GAB and spinal cord in 78 pathologically verified literature cases including 4 patients of their own, all defined by the presence of granulomatous giant cell and epithelioid cell infiltration in the walls of arteries of various caliber, ranging from named cerebral vessels to small arteries and veins at postmortem examination (Fig. 1). One each occurred in association with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), varicella zoster virus (VZV), neurosarcoidosis, and no associated disorder. Headache was noted at onset in all 4 patients, as well as in 57% of patients with GANS; and during the course of the disease in 78%. Moreover, the combination of headache, encephalopathy or other mental changes, increased CSF protein content with or without pleocytosis followed by hemiparesis, quadriparesis, progressing to lethargy and stupor were predictive of a poor prognosis and mandated the need for combined meningeal and brain biopsy to establish the diagnosis with certainty.

Purpose Of Review

The main purpose of this review is to present advances in diagnostics of central nervous system vasculitis (CNS-V).

Recent Findings

Progress in molecular technologies and neuroimaging have added formidably to our knowledge of CNS-V. Next-generation sequencing has the promise to enhance our ability to diagnose, interrogate, and track infectious diseases, making this test attractive and capable of avoiding brain biopsy in cases where CNS infections are suspected. Further the continuum of neuroimaging progress has advanced our ability to diagnose CNS-V. Our capability to visualize the vessel wall have added a great value in differentiating inflammatory from noninflammatory vasculopathies. New genetic variations are being exposed with exome and genome sequences which will aid future diagnosis.

Summary

We have witnessed tremendous advances in CNS-V mainly by our ability to rule out mimics. Progress in molecular technologies, neuroimaging and genetic studies will continue to enhance the field further.

### Primary central nervous system vasculitis and headache: ten themes [^116rHe4E]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

THEME 7: IMPORTANT TURNING POINTS IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF PRIMARY ADULT CNS VASCULITIDES COINCIDED WITH STROKE NEUROLOGY

The neuroradiological approach to CNS vasculitis has evolved along with the availability of highly precise methods of brain and cerebral vasculature imaging to heighten understanding of the vascular inflammatory process. The pathophysiology of cerebrovascular injury is similar to other vascular beds wherein mural changes lead to vessel stenosis or occlusion and endothelial inflammation promotes intraluminal coagulation and thrombosis. Perivascular inflammatory changes and edema also contribute to the pathologic picture. Arterial and venous components may be involved separately or together and the dural sinuses may be affected. Persistent neurologic deficits, including stroke and headache, were the commonest initial symptoms affecting 68% of 101 studied subjects with PCNSV as defined by diagnostic criteria of Calabrese and Mallek and modified by Birnbaum and Hellmann. Infarctions were the commonest type of lesion noted with MRI of the brain, which among 53% of 90 subjects so studied, were multiple in appearances in 85% and bilateral in 83%, with cortical and subcortical involvement in 63% overall, suggesting larger artery, branch-artery, and small-artery distributions. Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in 8% of subjects.

Traditional radiologic methodologies do not adequately recognize the major categories of LVV, MVV and SVV as in the systemic circulation. According to Küker, vasculitic involvement of the internal carotid (ICA), M1 and A1 segments of the middle (MCA) and anterior cerebral arteries (ACA), intracranial vertebral and basilar arteries, and P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), easily appreciated by as large vessels on noninvasive imaging employing MRA and CTA (Fig. 2 a–e), would be equivalent to medium vessels by 2012 Revised Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) Nomenclature of Vasculitides. By contrast, arterial vessels distal to the MCA bifurcation, as well as the anterior (AComm) and posterior communicating (PComm) arteries, still considered MVV by the same CHCC criteria, would not be well visualized alongside intracranial LVV by MRA or CTA, and require CA to assess luminal irregularities. Finally, the smallest muscular arteries and arterioles within the brain parenchyma as well as the capillaries and proximal venules, all considered small vessels by their lumen size, corresponding to a caliber of 200–500 μm or less, are all well beneath the resolution of invasive and noninvasive neuroimaging, and instead require tissue biopsy to diagnose vasculitic involvement.

THEME 9: SMALL-VESSEL PRIMARY CHILDHOOD AND ADULT CNS VASCULITIDES CHALLENGE EXPERTS TO REASSESS GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN REACHING A CONSENSUS IN REGARDS DIAGNOSIS, MANAGEMENT AND ETIOPATHOGENESIS

The original criteria of Calabrese and Mallek have been adapted for cPACNS acknowledging advances in, and the clinical similarity of IBrainDs and other neuroimmune CNS disorders, especially those with neuronal autoantibodies and frequent neuropsychiatric manifestations. However, except for rare cases of Hashimoto encephalopathy, there are no documented cases of histologically-proven CNS vasculitis in any adult or childhood autoimmune encephalitis.

The precision gained in diagnosing adult PACNS by requiring brain biopsy confirmation for case definition (thereby reclassifying definite cases as probable with only consistent findings on angiography and abnormal findings on MRI), was not incorporated into the largest case series of PACNS, except in selective cohorts when neuroimaging was precluded, as in isolated small-vessel vasculitis. A majority of clinicians surveyed from the German Society for Pediatric Rheumatology, the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society, Network Pediatric Stroke, and members of the ACR/CARRA Pediatric Rheumatology list server found that while criteria for the diagnosis of SVcPACNS requires histopathologic confirmation, only 46.09% of respondents indicated that they would perform a brain biopsy.

With its distinctive features of severe headache, cognitive decline, focal seizures and ischemic deficits and less unfavorable outcome with immunosuppressive therapy (targeting transmural lymphocytic cell infiltration of small leptomeningeal and brain parenchymal vessels on biopsy), prototypical cases of SVcPACNS seem more similar to adult cases of PACNS and childhood cases of GANS than APNP- or APP-cPACNS. Hunder et al. questioned the premise of Elbers and colleagues that SVcPACNS was a distinct disease citing referral bias in the selection of cases with singular clinical, angiographic and histopathological features, brain biopsy sampling errors, and the possibility that lymphocytic vasculitis of small vessels might be an earlier stage of a progressive disease process that involves other histopathology or vessels of larger caliber. The authors cite the earlier literature case of Yari and colleagues of a 12-year-old boy with progressive headaches, vomiting, perioral dysesthesia, bilateral papilledema, ataxia, focal weakness and brisk reflexes for several months accompanied by CSF pleocytosis. Brain biopsy showed angiitis of small, medium-sized, and larger vessels, however, larger vessel involvement was not advanced or widespread enough to distort the vessels seen on cerebral angiography that was interpreted as normal.

### Primary angiitis of the CNS: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114y96yr]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS) is a rare and severe form of vasculitis limited to the brain, spinal cord, and leptomeninges, resulting in inflammation of CNS vessels with subsequent cerebral ischemia and less frequently hemorrhage. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of PACNS are unknown. The main histopathologic patterns include granulomatous inflammation, lymphocytic cellular infiltrates, and acute necrotizing vasculitis. Clinical features at diagnosis are headache, altered cognition, and focal neurologic deficits (e.g. hemiparesis, ataxia, aphasia, dysarthria, and visual disturbances). The diagnostic criteria proposed by Calabrese and Mallek in 1988 require the presence of an acquired, otherwise unexplained neurologic or psychiatric deficit, the presence of either classic angiographic or histopathologic features of angiitis within the CNS, and excluded evidence of systemic vasculitis or any disorder that could cause or mimic the angiographic or pathologic features of the disease. The diagnosis of PACNS can be either biopsy or angiogram confirmed. Newer diagnostic criteria emphasize the inclusion of CSF for establishing the diagnosis of PACNS. However, virtually, all recent cohort studies on PACNS refer to the well-established criteria by Calabrese and Mallek.

PACNS is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of 2.4/1,000,000 person-years in North America. The diverse disease manifestations and multiple differential diagnoses including reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), secondary cerebral vasculitis, and infections complicate its diagnosis. No prospective randomized studies on PACNS exist; therefore, therapeutic strategies have been derived from the treatment of systemic vasculitides and from cohort studies.

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of patients with PACNS separated in biopsy- and angiogram-confirmed cases. In addition, relapse rates, mortality, neurologic outcome, and the association of treatment with outcome are reported.

### Primary central nervous system vasculitis: comparison of patients with and without cerebral amyloid angiopathy [^114NP5if]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients with primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) from a large cohort of consecutive patients with PCNSV treated at a single institution.

Methods

We identified 101 consecutive patients with PCNSV admitted between January 1983 and December 2003. PCNSV diagnoses were based on findings from a central nervous system (CNS) biopsy (n = 31) and conventional angiography (n = 70). CNS tissue specimens from 49 cases were examined histologically, and 49 were stained for amyloid deposits. Those with vascular amyloid deposits (CAA) were compared with those without histological evidence of amyloid deposition.

Results

Eight cases (26%) with CNS biopsy specimens positive for PCNSV also showed findings of CAA. Compared with patients with PCNSV only, these patients were older at diagnosis, predominantly male, had a more acute onset, a higher frequency of cognitive dysfunction and showed prominent gadolinium-enhanced leptomeningeal lesions with MRI. Histologically, all had a granulomatous vascular inflammatory pattern. Six patients responded promptly to therapy. Outcomes at last follow-up were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

PCNSV with CAA appears to form a clinical subset of PCNSV. The vasculitis influences the clinical findings to a greater degree than the presence of amyloid deposits in the vessels.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) [^113xKCNb]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guideline on Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System (PACNS), developed according to ESO standard operating procedures (SOP) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, was elaborated to assist clinicians in the diagnostic and treatment pathway of patients with PACNS in their decision making. A working group involving vascular neurologists, neuroradiologists, rheumatologists, a neuropathologist and a methodologist identified 17 relevant clinical questions; these were addressed according to the patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes (PICO) framework and systematic literature reviews were performed. Notably, each PICO was addressed with respect to large vessel (LV)-PACNS and small vessel (SV)-PACNS. Data to answer many questions were scarce or lacking and the quality of evidence was very low overall, so, for some PICOs, the recommendations reflect the ongoing uncertainty. When the absence of sufficient evidence precluded recommendations, Expert Consensus Statements were formulated. In some cases, this applied to interventions in the diagnosis and treatment of PACNS which are embedded widely in clinical practice, for example patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) abnormalities. CSF analysis for hyperproteinorrachia and pleocytosis does not have evidence supporting their use as diagnostic tools. The working group recommended that caution is employed in the interpretation of non-invasive vascular imaging due to lack of validation and the different sensitivities in comparison with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and histopathological analyses. Moreover, there is not a neuroimaging pattern specific for PACNS and neurovascular issues are largely underreported in PACNS patients. The group's recommendations on induction and maintenance of treatment and for primary or secondary prevention of vascular events also reflect uncertainty due to lack of evidence. Being uncertain the role and practical usefulness of current diagnostic criteria and being not comparable the main treatment strategies, it is suggested to have a multidisciplinary team approach in an expert center during both work up and management of patients with suspected PACNS. Highlighting the limitations of the currently accepted diagnostic criteria, we hope to facilitate the design of multicenter, prospective clinical studies and trials. A standardization of neuroimaging techniques and reporting to improve the level of evidence underpinning interventions employed in the diagnosis and management of PACNS. We anticipate that this guideline, the first comprehensive European guideline on PACNS management using GRADE methodology, will assist clinicians to choose the most effective management strategy for PACNS.

### Hydrocephalus: a rare complication of primary central nervous system vasculitis [^115eb5oG]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Hydrocephalus is a known complication of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis secondary to infectious diseases. We present an unusual case of primary CNS vasculitis (PCNSV) complicated by communicating hydrocephalus. A patient in their 50s with a few months' history of headache, psychomotor slowing and frequent falls presented with an acute left temporo-parieto-occipital infarction. Angiography revealed multiple arterial irregularities in the anterior circulation bilaterally, CSF was inflammatory and the remaining study was negative, fulfilling criteria for possible PCNSV. One month after successful treatment with corticosteroid, there was worsening of gait, urinary incontinence and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The investigation was remarkable only for active hydrocephalus. An external ventricular shunt was placed, followed by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and cyclophosphamide was started with subsequent recovery. Our discussion is that communicating hydrocephalus in PCNSV, due to impaired CSF flow, should be considered on subacute/chronic worsening of patients with PCNSV.

### Differentiating primary angiitis of the central nervous system from paraneoplastic neurological syndrome [^113AFqZw]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare, inflammatory condition affecting small- and medium-sized vessels in the brain and spinal cord. Its diagnosis presents challenges due to nonspecific symptoms that mimic various neurological and psychiatric disorders. This case underscores the diagnostic complexity of PACNS and its treatment difficulties. Although a brain biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis, its invasiveness, potential to exacerbate neurological deficits, risk of bleeding and potential damage to surrounding brain tissue make it impractical for all patients. In this case, standard glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive therapies failed to halt disease progression, demonstrating PACNS's typically poor prognosis. This case highlights the urgent need for improved diagnostic strategies and novel treatments to achieve better clinical outcomes.

THEME 6: RETROSPECTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORTS STRATIFIED BY CLINICAL, NEURORADIOGRAPHIC, AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL FEATURES FACILITATED CLINICOPATHOLOGIC SUBTYPES FOR INSIGHTS INTO TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT

Between 1983 and 2011, Salvarani et al. enrolled 163 patients of whom 97 (59.5%) presented with progressive headache and 88 (54%) with cognitive dysfunction. Overall, two-thirds (64%) met inclusion criteria for probable CNS vasculitis based upon cerebral angiography manifesting areas of smooth-wall segmental narrowing or dilatation, and occlusions affecting multiple cerebral arteries without proximal vessel changes of atherosclerosis or other causes. The remaining one-third (36%) met the definite diagnosis based on a CNS tissue biopsy showing transmural vascular inflammation involving leptomeningeal or parenchymal vessels. The latter histopathology was granulomatous in 60%, lymphocytic in 22%, and necrotizing alone in 17%, and were consistent with subsets of the disease rather than different stages of the same process. Overall, there was a favorable response with sustained remission in 72%, and an overall favorable response to therapy in 85% of cases with parenteral and oral CS alone or in association with CYC or other immunosuppressants [including azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or biological therapies employing rituximab (RTX) and etanercept]. Overall mortality was 15% often within the first year, especially in those with severe disease and disability. An overall unfavorable outcome was also noted in those with large named vessel involvement and cerebral infarcts at the time of diagnosis, a poor response to treatment, and more frequent relapses.

### A differential diagnosis of central nervous system demyelination: beyond multiple sclerosis [^111X8RNg]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Although multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), it lacks any definitive diagnostic test. Instead, diagnosis of MS primarily depends upon clinical criteria, supported by abnormalities characteristic of MS on para-clinical investigations including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, in the absence of an alternative explanation for underlying neurologic symptoms. While many of the potential disorders that may mimic MS in routine clinical practice are either extremely rare, or associated with specific and characteristic distinguishing diagnostic features, some inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the CNS may be particularly challenging to distinguish from MS, especially during initial presentation. In particular, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica, and idiopathic transverse myelitis may closely resemble MS, impeding prompt and accurate diagnosis. In this review, we describe the clinical features, diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of these other CNS demyelinating disorders. In addition, we review relevant features of other CNS inflammatory disorders that may mimic MS, including Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's disease, and primary CNS vasculitis.

### Usual and unusual manifestations of systemic and central nervous system vasculitis [^111aTPyp]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The idiopathic vasculitides are a group of inflammatory and immune-mediated conditions associated with inflammation of blood vessels. They affect multiple organ and body systems, and vary in their clinical manifestations, severity, prognosis, and pathology. They frequently present a diagnostic challenge for clinicians because of their complexity, overlapping features, and similar findings to other noninflammatory, genetic, or infectious conditions. This article summarizes some of the common pediatric vasculitides, emphasizing both the characteristic and unusual clinical manifestations of these diseases.

### Sequential MR angiography in childhood primary angiitis of the CNS [^116JajUQ]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis is rare in childhood. Diagnosis is sometimes difficult, and imaging methods range from MRI to MRA to conventional angiography. In doubtful cases a brain biopsy is necessary for diagnostic purposes. We describe a 6-year old child affected with primary angiitis of the CNS who was treated successfully with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil and who was followed with MRI and MRA, which guided treatment decisions throughout the disease course. Sequential images are shown.

### Primary angiitis of the central nervous system: magnetic resonance imaging spectrum of parenchymal, meningeal, and vascular lesions at baseline [^111FCfop]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system remains challenging. To report an overview and pictorial review of brain magnetic resonance imaging findings in adult primary angiitis of the central nervous system and to determine the distribution of parenchymal, meningeal, and vascular lesions in a large multicentric cohort.

Methods

Adult patients from the French COVAC cohort (Cohort of Patients With Primary Vasculitis of the Central Nervous System), with biopsy or angiographically proven primary angiitis of the central nervous system and brain magnetic resonance imaging available at the time of diagnosis were included. A systematic imaging review was performed blinded to clinical data.

Results

Sixty patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 45 years (± 12.9). Patients initially presented focal deficit(s) (83%), headaches (53%), cognitive disorder (40%), and seizures (38.3%). The most common magnetic resonance imaging finding observed in 42% of patients was multiterritorial, bilateral, distal acute stroke lesions after small to medium artery distribution, with a predominant carotid circulation distribution. Hemorrhagic infarctions and parenchymal hemorrhages were also frequently found in the cohort (55%). Acute convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage was found in 26% of patients and 42% demonstrated pre-eminent leptomeningeal enhancement, which is found to be significantly more prevalent in biopsy-proven patients (60% versus 28%; P = 0.04). Seven patients had tumor-like presentations. Seventy-seven percent of magnetic resonance angiographic studies were abnormal, revealing proximal/distal stenoses in 57% and 61% of patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Adult primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a heterogenous disease, with multiterritorial, distal, and bilateral acute stroke being the most common pattern of parenchymal lesions found on magnetic resonance imaging. Our findings suggest a higher than previously thought prevalence of hemorrhagic transformation and other hemorrhagic manifestations.

### Circulating endothelial cells as potential diagnostic biomarkers in primary central nervous system vasculitis [^117Fs7MG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Histological evidence is considered the only proof of primary central nervous system vasculitis (PCNSV). However, brain biopsy is often omitted or delayed because of the invasiveness and possible complications of the procedure. Circulating endothelial cells (CEC) were shown to be elevated in patients with active antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. We hypothesise that CEC are also elevated in patients with active PCNSV and may contribute to the diagnosis.

Methods

CEC were assessed in 18 patients, 3 of whom had biopsy-proven PCNSV and 15 clinical, cerebrospinal fluid and imaging data, highly suggestive of PCNSV. In 3 of these 15 patients CEC assessment was performed after initiation of successful immunosuppressive therapy. CEC numbers of all patients were compared to those of 16 healthy volunteers and 123 subjects with cerebrovascular risk factors and/or ischaemic stroke, who had been studied in our group before. CEC were assessed by immunomagnetic isolation from peripheral blood.

Results

In patients with proven and suspected active PCNSV, CEC were extremely elevated (> 400 cells/ml in most of the patients) and significantly higher than in healthy and disease controls (p ≤ 0.01 for each group). CEC significantly decreased with immunosuppressive treatment.

Conclusions

For the first time it is shown that CEC are significantly elevated in patients with active PCNSV in contrast to other pathologies associated with brain infarction and correlate with disease activity. Sensitivity and specificity of the method for diagnosing PCNSV and the use of the method for treatment monitoring should be addressed in future prospective studies with a larger patient group.

### Tumor-like presentation of primary angiitis of the central nervous system [^111crTvT]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging features of patients with tumor-like presentation of primary angiitis of the central nervous system.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 10 patients enrolled in the French primary angiitis of the central nervous system cohort, who initially presented tumor-like brain lesions and compared them with other patients within the cohort.

Results

The 10 patients with tumor-like presentation in the cohort were younger and had more seizures at diagnosis than the other 75 patients (median of 37 [30–48] years versus 46 [18–79] years; P = 0.008; 9 [90%] with seizures versus 22 [29%], P < 0.001; respectively). All 10 patients had a biopsy (stereotactic procedure in 7 and open-wedge surgery in 3). Histological findings suggestive of vasculitis were observed in 9 patients in whom conventional cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance angiography were negative. In the remaining patient, vascular imaging demonstrated diffuse bilateral large- and medium-sized vessel involvement (biopsy did not reveal vasculitis). All patients with tumor-like presentation received glucocorticoids, combined with cyclophosphamide in 9 cases. With a median follow-up of 27 (12–130) months, 5 (50%) patients relapsed, but achieved remission again after treatment intensification.

Conclusions

Patients with tumor-like presentation of primary angiitis of the central nervous system represent a subgroup characterized with mainly small-sized vessel disease that requires histological confirmation because vascular imaging is often normal. Although relapses are not uncommon, global outcomes are good under treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide.

### Diagnosis and management of adult primary angiitis of the central nervous system: an international survey on current practices [^113PCnLT]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare disease, for which no validated guidelines exist. We report the findings of a survey on the clinical practice of physicians who manage adults with PACNS.

Methods

An online survey was distributed through neurology, internal medicine, and rheumatology societies in Canada and Europe. Participants who were directly involved as treating physicians for at least two adult patients with PACNS were eligible for the survey.

Results

Ninety-six physicians completed the survey. Most participants were neurologists (n = 38, 40%), internists (n = 34, 35%) or rheumatologists (n = 22, 23%). Participants obtained a CNS biopsy in a median of 25% (IQR: 5–50%) of suspected PACNS cases. When determining the degree to which eight scenarios justified a CNS biopsy, participants achieved fair inter-rater agreement (Gwet's AC₂ 0.30, 95% CI 0.23–0.41). For induction therapy, 81 (84%) participants reported using glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide in > 50% of patients. After obtaining remission, 85 (89%) participants systematically introduced or maintained immunosuppressive therapy. Glucocorticoids were prescribed for a median of 12 months. Maintenance therapy with another immunosuppressant was continued for a median of 24 months. In patients who achieved remission, we explored how eight scenarios with different imaging and CSF results supported an increase in treatment. Inter-rater agreement was substantial if the patient was symptomatic (0.66, 95% CI 0.58–0.80) and moderate (0.50, 95% CI 0.45–0.60) if asymptomatic.

Conclusion

This survey illustrates current real-world management of PACNS and emphasizes several areas for which physicians still lack study-based evidence and/or clinical practice guidelines.

### Imaging spectrum of CNS vasculitis [^113q6g2z]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebral vasculitis is characterized by inflammation of the walls of blood vessels and may affect vessels of any size. The pathogenesis of vasculitis remains poorly understood. Vasculitis may affect large vessels (Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis), medium-sized vessels (Kawasaki disease, polyarteritis nodosa), small vessels (immunoglobulin A vasculitis, microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis), or variable-sized vessels (Behçet disease, Cogan syndrome). Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (CNS) is an idiopathic disorder with no evidence of generalized inflammation that may simulate reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes. Vasculitis may be secondary to systemic disease, infection, malignancy, drug use, or radiation therapy. Imaging findings vary from small ischemic changes to frank infarction, hemorrhage, and white matter edema and may show contrast material enhancement. The cerebral arteries may demonstrate a beaded appearance with variable degrees of stenosis, occlusion, and contrast enhancement of the vessel wall. Correlation of imaging findings with clinical presentation and laboratory test results helps establish the diagnosis of CNS vasculitis.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116HsyS9]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Primary CNS angiitis — epidemiology and medical therapy: Primary CNS angiitis or vasculitis is a rare cause of stroke (2.4 cases per 1 million patient-years) that affects predominantly younger populations (mean age at presentation, 45 years) and is slightly more prevalent in men; in confirmed cases, administration of high-dose steroids is supported by observational data, and in most cases slow tapering of steroids followed by addition of a steroid-sparing agent seems preferred over long-term steroid monotherapy due to higher relapse and poorer outcomes with monotherapy; commonly used maintenance steroid-sparing agents include cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, or rituximab, and there are no robust efficacy data between these agents, so we recommend an interdisciplinary follow-up and agent choice based on agent profile and comorbidities.

### Biopsy-proven case of childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system presenting with bilateral panuveitis and anisocoria [^112wc9AM]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system (cPACNS) is a rare and poorly understood immune-mediated vasculitis that preferentially affects blood vessels of the central nervous system (CNS). It must be distinguished from other disorders to initiate prompt treatment and improve the patient's prognosis. The presentation of cPACNS is highly variable, making a clinical diagnosis challenging. However, MRI may be helpful in showing typical findings including perivascular space inflammation and enhancement. Identification of these imaging features allows the radiologist to specifically suggest this rare diagnosis. The purpose of this manuscript is to present a biopsy-confirmed case of cPACNS in a 9-year-old girl who presented uniquely with panuveitis and anisocoria, and emphasize the MRI features that should prompt the radiologist to suggest this rare diagnosis.

### Challenging the diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system: a single-center retrospective study [^1114CHfb]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

(1) To describe a series of adults assessed for suspected primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) and their final diagnosis; (2) to describe and compare presenting features of PACNS and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS); and (3) to evaluate the specificity of the presenting features of RCVS.

Methods

Patients evaluated at our institution between 2000 and 2008 for a possible CNS vasculitis and investigated by conventional angiography and/or brain biopsy were retrospectively analyzed. The inclusion criteria were a clinicoradiological presentation and cerebral angiography and/or brain biopsy raising the hypothesis of isolated cerebral vasculitis; and absence of identifiable etiology at the time of conventional angiogram and/or brain biopsy.

Results

Among 58 cases evaluated, 37 met the inclusion criteria and 33 were included in the study. Thirteen patients had RCVS. Thunderclap headaches, the absence of a focal neurological deficit, a convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage and/or normal brain parenchyma on magnetic resonance imaging, and "string of beads" appearance on conventional angiography had high diagnostic value. Six patients had other noninflammatory vascular disorders (intracranial atherosclerosis, cryptogenic embolism, and genetic vasculopathy). Six patients had infection or malignancy. Eight patients were diagnosed with PACNS; their clinical presentation and disease course were heterogeneous. Brain biopsy was performed in 3 cases (positive in 1).

Conclusion

RCVS is an important differential diagnosis of CNS vasculitis. Its particular presentation should allow rapid identification in order to avoid pointless investigations and treatment. The frequent lack of histological proof and heterogeneous presentation of PACNS illustrated the nosological uncertainties of this label.

(a–e) Primary angiitis of the central nervous system. (a) Noncontrast CT (top) demonstrates multifocal regions of low attenuation. Those in the right frontal subcortical white matter and left basal ganglia (black arrows) are sharply defined, without mass effect and likely reflect old infarctions. Both the cortex and underlying white matter of the right occipital lobe are involved as is the right splenium of the corpus callosum (white arrows). In these locations, the margins are more ill-defined and there is subtle mass effect characterized by sulcal and ventricular effacement, suggesting acute ischemia in the right posterior cerebral artery territory. MRI FLAIR imaging (middle) demonstrates central low and peripheral high signal intensity within the frontal and periventricular white matter lesions (black arrows) consistent with chronic encephalomalacia from old infarctions. The FLAIR hyperintense signal within the right occipital lobe is more confluent and extends to the posterior temporal lobe and splenium, involving both cortex and white matter (white arrows) and better delineates the extent of the acute infarct. DWI (bottom) demonstrates restricted diffusion consistent with acute ischemia. (b) T1-weighted imaging pre and postgadolinium demonstrates extensive leptomeningeal enhancement along the cortical surface of the posterior temporal and occipital lobes. (c) CTA demonstrates multifocal vascular narrowing within several branches of the MCA (white arrows) with intervening regions of normal appearing vasculature. At the bottom of the image, vascular narrowing within the posterior cerebral artery (not marked) is present. (d and e) CA reveals completely normal extra-cranial vasculature. The anterior cerebral (black arrowheads), middle cerebral (black arrows) and posterior cerebral artery (black outlined arrows) demonstrate mild to severe short segment stenoses.

### Central nervous system vasculitis | NEJM resident 360… [^116Ss7C4]. resident360.nejm.org (2024). Medium credibility.

A: Primary CNS vasculitis, also known as primary angiitis of the CNS, is a rare form of vasculitis that is limited to the brain and spinal cord and causes a variety of neurologic syndromes. Because of its rarity and the similarity of some of these syndromes to more common disorders, primary CNS vasculitis is often misidentified. Primary CNS vasculitis may occur in children, although this is uncommon. Q: What does MRI typically show in patients with primary CNS vasculitis. A: The most frequently observed findings on imaging are multiple cerebral infarctions, lesions with parenchymal or leptomeningeal enhancement, and intracranial hemorrhage. Normal findings on MRI make CNS vasculitis unlikely. A: The nonspecific nature of clinical features of primary CNS vasculitis makes it difficult to differentiate it from conditions with overlapping features.

The most common manifestation at the initial presentation has been a sudden onset of focal neurologic deficits, which is suggestive of an ischemic event such as a stroke or transient ischemic attack that includes aphasia, ataxia, and visual-field defects. Other common features are headaches, progressive cognitive decline, and acute or subacute encephalopathy, which is often characterized by an acute confusional state that may progress to drowsiness and coma. Headaches are usually severe and persistent and may be generalized or localized; they are rarely a thunderclap headache, which is a sudden, severe headache that peaks in less than a minute and is more typical of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage, and, less commonly, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur. Spinal cord involvement with myelopathy, including transverse myelopathy, and systemic manifestations such as fever and weight loss have been reported but are infrequent.

A: Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of primary CNS vasculitis from randomized, controlled clinical trials are lacking. Oral prednisone at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, often preceded by intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy, has been a typical initial treatment for inducing remission, a strategy that is based on anecdotal evidence. Depending on the criteria used, the percentage of patients with long-term remission has ranged from 21. 5 to 66%. Good neurologic functional status with a low level of disability has been observed in 46 to 73% of patients.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published February 22, 2023 Brain biopsy is needed for the definitive diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system. Read the NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Clinical Pearls Q: What is primary angiitis of the central nervous system. A: PACNS is a rare vasculitis that is restricted to the small and medium arteries and veins of the brain, spinal cord, and leptomeninges. PACNS is most likely to occur in patients 40 to 60 years of age. It occurs twice as frequently in men as in women. Q: What imaging findings are associated with PACNS. A: Multifocal punctate infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging are typical of PACNS. Other potential MRI findings include diffuse bihemispheric white-matter hyperintensities, leptomeningeal enhancement, and mass lesions that mimic tumors. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals an elevated protein level and lymphocytic pleocytosis.

Cerebral angiography, when positive, reveals multifocal nonconcentric arterial irregularities, usually in the distal branches. However, the sensitivity of cerebral angiography for the diagnosis of PACNS is only 10 to 20% because PACNS predominantly affects small-caliber arteries, which cannot be visualized. A: The clinical course of PACNS is typically progressive. Treatment strategies include induction therapy with glucocorticoids and intravenous cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with immunomodulatory agents such as oral cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and methotrexate.

In rare cases, a paraneoplastic vasculitis that is similar to PACNS can result from one of the following processes: an immunologic reaction against vascular endothelium, endothelial injury due to the release of proinflammatory cytokines by tumor cells, or hypersensitivity to deposits of tumor protein or circulating immune complexes that contain tumor antigens on the vessel wall.

### CD4 + T cells predominate in cerebrospinal fluid and leptomeningeal and parenchymal infiltrates in cerebral amyloid β-related angiitis… [^111g5BY7]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background In amyloid β –related angiitis of the central nervous system, cerebral amyloid angiopathy occurs in association with primary vasculitis of small- and medium-sized leptomeningeal and cortical arteries. It has been suggested that ABRA is triggered by vascular deposition of Aβ followed by an Aβ-directed immune response. Patients present with altered mental status, headaches, seizures, and persistent2 or even only transient3 multifocal neurologic deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging findings are variable and include diffuse white matter lesions, mass lesions, focal edema, hemorrhages, infarction, and atrophy. 1, 2 Histopathologic analysis reveals leptomeningeal and parenchymal amyloid angiopathy and chronic inflammation within the leptomeninges and within and around the walls of amyloid-laden vessels. Thickening and splitting of the vessel walls, fibrinoid necrosis, acute thrombosis and subsequent recanalization, and microbleeding are frequent.

The perivascular and intramural inflammatory infiltrates are known to consist mainly of CD68+ macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. 1, 2 CD3+ T lymphocytes are also present, but only at low numbers of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
4. Biopsy specimens of the leptomeninges and superficial cerebral cortex showed pronounced perivascular and intramural inflammatory infiltration of the leptomeningeal and cortical arteries. Vessels showed thickening and splitting of their walls, fibrinoid necrosis, acute thrombosis and subsequent recanalization, and microbleeding, as revealed by the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages. The patient received intravenous high-dose dexamethasone pulse therapy, 3 × 4-mg/d, for 3 days, immediately followed by methylprednisolone, 1 g/d, for 5 days.

Afterwards, an oral maintenance dose of prednisolone, 80 mg/d, was administered for 6 weeks, followed by a tapering phase of 60, 40, 20, 10, and 5 mg/d for 2 weeks each. In parallel, immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide was administered at recurrent intravenous pulses of 750 mg/m² of body surface area every 6 weeks for a total of 6 months.
