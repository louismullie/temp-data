## Question

A supermarket had just reopened after a two- week closing for renovations. On the morning of the reopening, a woman was shopping when she suddenly fell and suffered a broken leg. Thereafter, the woman sued the supermarket for personal injuries. In her suit, the woman claimed that she tripped over a paint bucket that had been lying in one of the aisles. At trial, the woman called another customer to testify that while he was shopping he heard a thud, turned around and saw the woman fall on the floor. He also testified that he saw an empty paint bucket lying a few feet from the woman's leg. On cross- examination, the customer got into an argumentative exchange with the supermarket's attorney. When asked his opinion of what caused the woman's fall, the customer testified, "She fell because she tripped on the bucket. " He admitted on cross-examination, however, that he didn't actually see the woman trip on the bucket. The supermarket's attorney then asked the customer the following question:"If you didn't see the woman trip on the bucket, how do you know that she fell because of it?" The customer answered, "Because my girlfriend who was shopping with me told me later that she saw the woman trip over the bucket. "The supermarket's attorney moves to strike the customer's last answer. If the trial judge overrules the defendant's motion and permits the customer's answer to stand, it will most likely be because

Answer Choices:
A. the customer's answer was invited by the supermarket's attorney's question.
B. the customer's answer was based on firsthand knowledge.
C. the customer's answer was a statement of recent perception.
D. the customer's answer was a present sense impression.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why a judge would likely allow a witness's answer that he "knows" the plaintiff tripped on a paint bucket because his girlfriend told him so, even though he did not personally see the trip. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the testimony is objectionable as hearsay. Then, I should verify whether any exception applies, such as present sense impression or excited utterance. Next, I will consider whether the answer was "invited" by the cross-examiner's question. Finally, I will weigh the other options and conclude which rationale best fits the facts and evidentiary rules.

> Let me first confirm the evidentiary issue. The customer's statement that the plaintiff tripped on the bucket is based on what someone else told him, not on what he personally observed, so this is classic hearsay and ordinarily inadmissible unless an exception applies or the testimony was invited by the examining attorney.

> Wait, let me verify whether any hearsay exception fits. Present sense impression requires a statement made at or immediately after the event, describing it, and here the girlfriend's observation was relayed later, so that exception does not apply. Statement of recent perception is not a recognized hearsay exception in the Federal Rules framework, so that option is a distractor. Excited utterance could theoretically apply if the girlfriend's statement was made under the stress of excitement from the event, but the witness is not testifying to her demeanor or timing, so we cannot establish that basis here. Thus, none of the standard hearsay exceptions are established by the record in a way that would save the testimony on that ground alone.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider whether the answer was invited. The supermarket's attorney asked, "If you didn't see the woman trip on the bucket, how do you know that she fell because of it?" That question directly solicited the witness to explain the basis of his knowledge, and the witness simply answered by revealing that basis — namely, what his girlfriend told him. Under the doctrine of invited error or invited response, a party cannot complain about an answer that the party's own question elicited, so the judge may properly overrule the objection on that basis even if the substance is hearsay.

> I need to check the other options to ensure I'm not missing a better fit. Option B claims firsthand knowledge, but the witness explicitly admitted he did not see the trip, so that is incorrect. Option C refers to a statement of recent perception, which, as noted, is not a valid exception in this context. Option D invokes present sense impression, which fails on timing and lack of evidence that the declarant's statement was made contemporaneously with the event. Therefore, the only defensible rationale among the choices is that the answer was invited by the cross-examiner's question.

> But wait, what if the judge is simply exercising discretion to avoid misleading the jury by striking only part of the answer? Even then, the most straightforward, legally supportable reason to let the answer stand is that the defense opened the door by asking how the witness "knows", and the witness explained his basis, however unreliable that basis may be for substantive proof. The jury can weigh credibility, but the objection fails because the testimony was invited.

> Final answer: A. The customer's answer was invited by the supermarket's attorney's question.

---

The judge will most likely overrule the motion to strike because the customer's answer was **invited by the supermarket's attorney's question**. The attorney's "how do you know" question opened the door to the witness explaining the basis of his belief, even if that basis is hearsay. While the testimony about what the girlfriend saw is hearsay and normally inadmissible, the defense cannot complain about an answer it elicited. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the witness lacked firsthand knowledge, and the statement does not meet the narrow exceptions for present sense impression or statement of recent perception.

## Analysis of the customer's testimony

### Direct observation and hearsay

- **Direct observation**: The customer testified that he heard a thud, turned around, and saw the woman on the floor with a paint bucket nearby, but he did not see her trip on the bucket.
- **Hearsay**: The customer's statement that the woman tripped on the bucket is based on what his girlfriend told him, not on his own observation, making it hearsay.

---

### Legal implications of hearsay

Hearsay is **generally inadmissible** unless it falls within a recognized exception. The exceptions include present sense impression, excited utterance, and statements for medical diagnosis, among others. In this case, the customer's statement about the cause of the fall is hearsay and does not clearly fit any of these exceptions.

---

### The concept of "invited error"

The doctrine of **invited error** applies when a party elicits inadmissible evidence through its own questioning. If the opposing party's question invites the inadmissible testimony, the party cannot later object to it. Here, the supermarket's attorney asked, "If you didn't see the woman trip on the bucket, how do you know that she fell because of it?" This question directly invited the customer to explain the basis of his knowledge, leading him to state that his girlfriend told him she saw the trip.

---

### Application to the case

The judge will likely find that the **supermarket's attorney invited the error** by asking how the customer knew the cause of the fall. The customer was compelled to explain the basis of his belief, which necessarily revealed the hearsay. Under the invited-error doctrine, the defense cannot object to testimony it elicited, even if the testimony is otherwise inadmissible.

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Explanation** | **Correctness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. The customer's answer was invited by the supermarket's attorney's question. | The attorney's question directly invited the customer to explain the basis of his knowledge, leading to the hearsay statement. | Correct |
| B. The customer's answer was based on firsthand knowledge. | The customer explicitly stated he did not see the woman trip on the bucket, so his knowledge was not firsthand. | Incorrect |
| C. The customer's answer was a statement of recent perception. | A statement of recent perception requires the witness to have perceived the event recently, which the customer did not. | Incorrect |
| D. The customer's answer was a present sense impression. | A present sense impression requires the statement to be made at or immediately after the event, which did not occur here. | Incorrect |

---

## Conclusion

The judge will most likely overrule the motion to strike because the **customer's answer was invited by the supermarket's attorney's question**. The attorney's questioning opened the door to the hearsay testimony, and the defense cannot object to evidence it elicited. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the customer lacked firsthand knowledge, and the statement does not meet the narrow exceptions for present sense impression or statement of recent perception.

Vitamin D supplementation — evidence-to-decision considerations: Based on best estimates, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely small and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial; the panel concluded that the costs of empiric vitamin D supplementation were negligible because vitamin D is inexpensive, and judged empiric supplementation would be feasible and acceptable to stakeholders; they did not find evidence that the effect of vitamin D is restricted to those with baseline 25(OH)D levels below a threshold and concluded that conditioning supplementation/treatment on 25(OH)D screening may create barriers, with the addition of a 25(OH)D testing requirement increasing costs and possibly decreasing acceptability for some.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Standardizing vitamin D assays: the way forward [^ebe81861]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

For a number of years it has been widely assumed that measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is the best approach to assessing an individual's vitamin D status. However, it has also been recognized that there is substantial within-assay variation in 25(OH)D measurement and even greater between-assay variability. Such assay variation clearly confounds attempts to define what constitutes the diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Importantly, assay variability makes pooling of 25(OH)D results from different studies in systematic reviews for the specific purpose of determining dose-response and/or clinical cut points at best problematic. Therefore, to develop and implement evidence-based clinical guidelines, it is essential that 25(OH)D measurement be standardized in both clinical and research laboratories. In this Perspective we outline a way forward toward achieving this goal-the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP).

GRADE strength of recommendation classifications — For 1 — Strong recommendation for or against, criteria are that desirable consequences CLEARLY OUTWEIGH the undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa); most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not; most individuals should follow the recommended course of action and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences; and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator. For 2 — Conditional recommendation for or against, criteria are that desirable consequences PROBABLY OUTWEIGH undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa); the majority of individuals would want the suggested course of action but many would not and decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values and preferences; clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for each individual and must help each individual arrive at a management decision consistent with the individual's values and preferences; and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders with performance measures assessing whether decision-making is appropriate.

Question 2: Which of the following is a risk factor for development of this condition in this patient?
A. Age over 70
B. Prior history of radiation therapy
C. Prior history of melanoma
D. Prior history of nonmelanoma skin cancer
E. All of the above

Answer:
A. Age over 70 – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
B. Prior history of radiation therapy – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
C. Prior history of melanoma – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
D. Prior history of nonmelanoma skin cancer – Incorrect. This is not the best answer given other choices available.
E. All of the above – Correct. All of the above listed answer choices are risk factors for BP. Based on a recent propensity score-matched case-control study, age greater than 70 years at the time of receiving first immune checkpoint inhibitor cycle, history of melanoma, and history of nonmelanoma skin cancers are all associated with increased risk of developing BP among a cohort of patients treated with ICIs. Radiotherapy is also an independent risk factor for BP. While the underlying pathophysiology is unknown, it has been hypothesized that radiotherapy causes tissue damage, leading to increased antigen exposure and increased autoantibody production. In addition to the risk factor of ICI usage, BP onset in this patient is likely associated with radiotherapy exposure given localized distribution of disease in previously irradiated areas on bilateral cheeks.

Evidence quality meanings are: A (High) — "We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect". B (Moderate) — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different". C (Low) — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect". D (Very low) — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth".

### Expert opinion is necessary: Delphi panel methodology facilitates a scientific approach to consensus [^33dcc2a8]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Our current trend and focus on evidence-based medicine is biased in favor of randomized controlled trials, which are ranked highest in the hierarchy of evidence while devaluing expert opinion, which is ranked lowest in the hierarchy. However, randomized controlled trials have weaknesses as well as strengths, and no research method is flawless. Moreover, stringent application of scientific research techniques, such as the Delphi Panel methodology, allows survey of experts in a high quality and scientific manner. Level V evidence (expert opinion) remains a necessary component in the armamentarium used to determine the answer to a clinical question.

Key points This outbreak is over. Even when there are no ongoing Listeria outbreaks, women who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system should avoid deli meat or reheat it to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot to kill any germs.

Public health actions This outbreak is over. CDC always advises women who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system, to avoid eating deli meats or to heat them before consuming. In July 2024, Boar's Head issued a recall of all deli products made at their Jarratt, VA facility, which included prepackaged deli products and ready-to-eat liverwurst products, due to being contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. These products are past shelf-life.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. People are reporting eating a variety of meats sliced at deli counters. Of the 47 people able to be interviewed, 44 reported eating deli meats. Forty-two of the 44 reported eating meats sliced at a deli. Of the 44 people who answered if they ate liverwurst, 26 reported deli-sliced liverwurst before getting sick, and 19 reported Boar's Head brand. These deli meats were sliced at a variety of supermarket and grocery store delis. Public health actions CDC will continue to monitor for additional illnesses due to the possibility of cross-contamination in delis and how long it can take for symptoms to start. CDC advises people to not eat recalled deli meat products.

### Allergy and immunology practice parameters and guidelines: the new normal [^1a4bf8e2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Revised classification (Table 2) — recommendation rating scale with clinical implications specifies: Strong recommendation means the benefits clearly exceed the harms and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B); clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C); clinicians also should generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Weak option means that the quality of evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or that well-done studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach vs another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making with patient preference having a substantial influencing role. No recommendation means there is a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms; clinicians should feel little constraint in decision making and be alert to new published evidence; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Strength categories in this revised schema also include LB (Laboratory based) and NR (Not rated).

Key to quality of evidence — Grades A–D define study design rigor for this guideline as follows: Grade A includes data derived from well-designed, randomized clinical trials (RCTs); systematic reviews; meta-analyses; or diagnostic studies of relevant populations with a validated reference standard, and Grade A diagnostic studies do not have a narrow population or use a poor reference standard and are not case control studies of diseases or conditions. Grade B includes randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with weaker designs; cohort studies (retrospective or prospective); or diagnostic studies, and Grade B diagnostic studies have only one of the following: a narrow population, the sample does not reflect the population to whom the test would apply, uses a poor reference standard, the comparison between the test and reference standard is not blinded, or are case control studies. Grade C includes studies of strong design but with substantial uncertainty about conclusions or serious doubts about generalizations, bias, research design, or sample size; includes nonrandomized trials; case control studies (retrospective or prospective); or diagnostic studies, and Grade C diagnostic studies have at least 2 or more of the following: a narrow population, a non-representative sample, a poor reference standard, lack of blinding between test and reference standard, or are case control studies. Grade D consists of cross sectional studies; case reports/series; reviews; position papers; expert opinion; or reasoning from principal.

### The R.O. A.D. to precision medicine [^d2b89f15]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, hyperparameter tuning of OPTs, which is the only level in which the user is involved, did not result in drastically different OPTs. In fact, regardless of the differences in the structure (e.g. different variables or different variable cut offs), the OPTs are robust in that their sensitivity and specificity converge. This may mean that some patient characteristics used by the OPTs are surrogates of the outcome of interest and not causally related. However, this does not decrease their practical value as the essence of precision medicine is to find the best match between the available treatments and patient subgroups and not the discovery of causal relationships. Importantly, not only did the sensitivity and specificity of the various OPTs converge, but their combined values exceeded those of current recommendations, which relied on a blend of expert opinion and statistical analysis. Furthermore, the use of sensitivity and specificity is a novel addition as the use of these metrics was previously restricted to validating diagnostic tests only.

### Vitamin D supplementation and major cardiovascular events: D-health randomised controlled trial [^07040a2b]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study D-Health was published by Bridie Thompson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Acute ischemic stroke. In the D-Health study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in older adults? In the D-Health study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D-Health study, the population was: 21302 patients (9777 female, 11525 male). The inclusion criteria were adult participants aged 60–84 years. The key exclusion criteria were self-reported hypercalcemia; hyperparathyroidism; kidney stones; osteomalacia; sarcoidosis; receipt of > 500 IU/day supplemental vitamin D; or unable to give consent because of language or cognitive impairment. In the D-Health study, the interventions were: n = 10658 vitamin D (oral dose of 60,000 IU/month for 5 years) n = 10644 placebo (matching oral placebo for 5 years). In the D-Health study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in major cardiovascular event (6% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01). In the D-Health study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in myocardial infarction (1.8% vs. 2.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) No significant difference in coronary revascularization (3.9% vs. 4.3%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01) No significant difference in stroke (1.6% vs. 1.6%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.8 to 1.23). In the D-Health study, the conclusion was: in adult participants aged 60–84 years, vitamin D was not superior to placebo with respect to major cardiovascular event.

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^4457a683]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial, but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging; however, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians. 13 international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This Review summarises key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### Prompt engineering in consistency and reliability with the evidence-based guideline for LLMs [^40560046]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, ROT promoting is not necessarily the best prompt for other LLMs. For instance, for five versions of GPT-3.5, except for P-COT prompting being the best prompt for GPT-3.5-Web, the best prompt for other versions was IO prompting. For Bard, the best prompt was 0-COT. This indicated that we could try different prompting strategies to obtain the best responses.

The ROT prompting asked LLM to return to previous thoughts and examine if they were appropriate, which may improve the robustness of the answer. Furthermore, the ROT-based design can minimize the occurrence of egregiously incorrect answers from the gpt-4-Web. For instance, regarding a 'strong' level suggestion, "Lateral wedge insoles are not recommended for patients with knee osteoarthritis". ROT prompting provided four 'strong' answers and one 'moderate' answer in five responses. Initially, in this 'moderate' response (Supplementary Note 1), two "experts" provided "limited" answers, and one "expert" answered "moderate". After "discussion", all "experts" agreed on a 'moderate' recommendation. The final reason was that even though there was high-quality evidence to support the advice, there might still be slight potential benefits for some individuals. Notably, the reasons given by the two experts for "limiting" seem to be more in line with the statement "Lateral wedge insoles are recommended for patients with knee osteoarthritis". This implies that these two "experts" did not fully understand the medical advice correctly, as "Expert C" mentioned in step five: "Observes that the results are somewhat mixed, but there's a general agreement that the benefits, if any, from lateral wedge insoles are limited". However, after the "discussion", the final revised recommendation and reason were deemed acceptable. Referring to the application of TOT in the 24-point game, the prompt designed in the style of TOT as well as the ROT prompting in this study could offer more possibilities at every step of the task, and LLM could be asked to return to previous thoughts, aiming to induce LLM to generate more accurate answers.

### Our best judgment… [^74d71e29]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

This however was a text message from my brother, hospitalized more than 100 miles away in our hometown. It was early evening. I was walking through the aisles of a supermarket, not an ideal scenario for a thoughtful and deliberate response. Les was being transferred to the intensive care unit shortly after being admitted with what we had just learned was COVID-19. It was the hospital where I'd previously practiced for more than 3 decades, helped to establish a hospice and palliative medicine program, and chaired the ethics committee for 20 years. Visualizing his room, the halls, the elevator, and the ICU room into which he was being transferred was easy. Realizing what it meant for a sibling 12 years my senior, with many medical risk factors, made answering his question much more difficult. I texted back: "Would consider a trial period of a week or so, but it's your call. Love you whatever you choose.

" Even with all my training, experience, and focus on end-of-life decisions, I felt helpless and uncertain. For years, my brother had made clear to loved ones that he would not want to be on life support and fed artificially for any prolonged period. He had witnessed protracted deaths in friends and family and wanted none of it. Les was not the most cautious individual as the pandemic roared ahead in early 2021. A devout Catholic, he attended mass and received communion twice a week with his best friend throughout the pandemic. But breakfast inside a cramped restaurant also twice a week afterward seemed to be tempting fate. Nonetheless, Les was garrulous to the extreme and a friend to all he met. Social isolation was unthinkable. "If I die, I die. I've had a great life. " As a palliative care physician I kind of got the point that he was not willing to trade the quality of a "great life" for more time on this earth.

So I knew his wishes as did his wife who was his first designated surrogate with me appropriately second. And I knew he had had some pulmonary issues but none of the particulars. Even with that knowledge and my years of clinical experience, 100 miles away I felt helpless to confidently advise him. Sleep was not restful that night with plans to make coverage arrangements in the morning and return to my hometown. At 6 am, the intensivist called with an update. Having worked with him for years I knew to trust what he told me: "It's looking pretty bad. He will probably not last the day". When I asked about a trial of mechanical ventilation, he expressed a high degree of certainty of Les eventually needing a tracheotomy and gastrostomy based on his review of the imaging, laboratory studies, and physical examination. The intensivist's certainty was enough.

My sister-in-law was deferring in part to me, and I could defer to my brother based on his prior expressed wishes and the intensivist's clarity in communicating: "I would not do this based on what I've seen, Skip. I think we should keep him comfortable. " Two hours later, on my drive home, a call reinforcing this decision came from the infectious diseases consultant from outside of his ICU room. Les died within 24 hours of admission. In retrospect it appears that he had contracted COVID-19 at least a week prior and came through the emergency department doors just as the inflammatory response engaged his damaged lungs and probably too late for the steroids that were administered to help. But our family's grief was greatly attenuated by the excellent care he received:

- Within 18 hours of admission both the critical care team and infectious disease consultant told our family what to expect.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^34b4b601]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Palliative care screening and the "surprise question" — screening for further palliative care needs begins on admission and continues during the first 72 hours. The "surprise question" is one of the best prognostic tools for the seriously ill hospitalized patient, and the answer to this question, "Would you be surprised if this patient were dead in 12 months?" is a helpful part of the screening process; if the answer is NO, this should trigger palliative care pathways and lead to discussion about advance care planning. Screening will identify a group of patients who are primarily young or otherwise healthy with non-life-threatening injuries as "screen negative", requiring pain and symptom management and identification of a health care proxy, while the remaining patients with a positive screen will benefit from early palliative care focused on Goals of Care Conversations and appropriate decision-making. Category 1 positive screens have uncertainty regarding long-term functional recovery or survival due to severe traumatic injuries, age, frailty, comorbidities, or a combination of these factors; the answer to the "surprise question" is a "maybe" or "no", and these patients need advance care planning discussions, clarification of resuscitation preferences, and early Goals of Care Conversations to establish priorities and preferences for ongoing trauma care with a focus on potential complications such as organ failure.

### T3 translational science in gastroenterology: getting to best outcomes [^4c1a4688]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Achieving the best possible outcomes requires the reliable implementation of best practices for every patient. Specifically, optimizing outcomes requires a spectrum of research spanning basic science, drug development, clinical efficacy and effectiveness, health services, quality improvement, and implementation research. However, our rapid increase in understanding the mechanisms of health and disease and their treatment has far outpaced our ability to reliably provide that care, resulting in poor reliability and enormous variation in care. T3 translational research studies attempt to answer questions surrounding reliable implementation of interventions, decreasing variations in care, and spreading effective therapies. To answer these questions, T3 research may use traditional research methodology such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, various other approaches such as quasiexperimental designs (eg, time-series analysis) are often used. Although uncommon, T3 research has shown promise in not only improving process measures such as correct dosing of medications, but also outcome measures such as improved remission rates in patients with IBD. A more complete integration of T3 translational research into the more traditional research continuum is necessary if we are to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients.

### Harm is all you need? Best interests and disputes about parental decision-making [^b30788d6]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

A growing number of bioethics papers endorse the harm threshold when judging whether to override parental decisions. Among other claims, these papers argue that the harm threshold is easily understood by lay and professional audiences and correctly conforms to societal expectations of parents in regard to their children. English law contains a harm threshold which mediates the use of the best interests test in cases where a child may be removed from her parents. Using Diekema's seminal paper as an example, this paper explores the proposed workings of the harm threshold. I use examples from the practical use of the harm threshold in English law to argue that the harm threshold is an inadequate answer to the indeterminacy of the best interests test. I detail two criticisms: First, the harm standard has evaluative overtones and judges are loath to employ it where parental behaviour is misguided but they wish to treat parents sympathetically. Thus, by focusing only on 'substandard' parenting, harm is problematic where the parental attempts to benefit their child are misguided or wrong, such as in disputes about withdrawal of medical treatment. Second, when harm is used in genuine dilemmas, court judgments offer different answers to similar cases. This level of indeterminacy suggests that, in practice, the operation of the harm threshold would be indistinguishable from best interests. Since indeterminacy appears to be the greatest problem in elucidating what is best, bioethicists should concentrate on discovering the values that inform best interests.

### Nephrology quiz and questionnaire: electrolytes [^6b8e39a4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Presentation of the Nephrology Quiz and Questionnaire has become an annual tradition at the meetings of the American Society of Nephrology. It is a very popular session judged by consistently large attendance. Members of the audience test their knowledge and judgment on a series of case-oriented questions prepared and discussed by experts. They can also compare their answers in real time using audience response devices with the answers of program directors of nephrology training programs in the United States through an Internet-based questionnaire. Topics presented here include fluid and electrolyte disorders, transplantation, and ESRD and dialysis. Cases representing each of these categories along with single best-answer questions were prepared by a panel of experts (the authors). The correct and incorrect answers then were briefly discussed after the audience responses and the results of the questionnaire were displayed. This article tries to recapitulate the session and reproduce its educational value for a larger audience-the readers of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Have fun.

### Editorial commentary: at present, chatGPT cannot Be relied upon to answer patient questions and requires physician expertise to interpret answers for patients [^e06fdf39]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

ChatGPT is designed to provide accurate and reliable information to the best of its abilities based on the data input and knowledge available. Thus, ChatGPT is being studied as a patient information tool. This artificial intelligence (AI) tool has been shown to frequently provide technically correct information but with limitations. ChatGPT provides different answers to similar questions based on the prompts, and patients may not have expertise in prompting ChatGPT to elicit a best answer. (Prompting large language models has been shown to be a skill that can improve.) Of greater concern, ChatGPT fails to provide sources or references for its answers. At present, ChatGPT cannot be relied upon to address patient questions; in the future, ChatGPT will improve. Today, AI requires physician expertise to interpret AI answers for patients.

### How to write a systematic review [^1cf4343c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the combination of the best available research evidence with clinical experience and patient needs. The concept of EBM as a part of clinical decision making has become increasingly popular over the last decade. In the hierarchy of studies meta-analysis and systematic reviews occupy the highest levels. A systematic review of a clinical question can be performed by following a relatively standard form. These techniques as described here can be performed without formal training. Systematic reviews conducted in this fashion can be used as a higher form of current concepts or as review articles and replace the traditional expert opinion narrative review.

### Curriculum development: a how to primer [^55349fb6]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Step 1. Needs assessment/statement

The needs assessment helps us answer 'Why'? In the case of curriculum development, the answer may be quite broad and should point to the distinction between the current teaching strategy surrounding a learning need and what should be changed about it. At the start, it is wise to consider whose needs are the priority. This may start with a learner's needs (either attitudinal and knowledge-based needs, readiness to learn or timing), but likely extends to the patients and communities for whom the learner will be caring. When justifying time or funding, an articulation of how this curriculum might meet regulatory or board requirements can be useful.

The mechanics of a needs assessment includes readily available information and the collection of new information. The acquisition of new information can be structured (survey or medical knowledge assessment), semi-structured (series of discussions or a call to action based on sentinel event), research/data driven (data on learners' performance or clinical quality data) or based on regulatory requirements.

A very basic example (see table 1), experienced by one of the authors was the identification of a gap in knowledge leading to the development of a newly structured educational activity.

Once the needs assessment is finalised, and the needs have been articulated, a rationale statement should be agreed on. This rationale statement is 1–3 lines that articulates the fundamental findings from the needs assessment to guide the development of the curriculum. The rationale statement can then be used to keep the curriculum on task. It is intended to be modified only if there is a serious oversight in the development. In this way, the needs assessment and rationale statement can truly render a solid foundation for the curriculum in development.

Step 2. Determining and prioritising content

This is the first step in beginning to articulate what is going to be included, a general description of the content, along with a prioritisation of that content. In the example of the communication skills curriculum referenced above, the content was determined both by working backwards from the milestone goals and also from reviewing what experts in the field have identified. In some cases, there will not be expert knowledge or milestones to work from, and in these cases, original research might be needed, such as surveys of experts in the field, or analysis of conversation around a difficult topic needing to be addressed. An example of this last strategy can be seen in a recent publication on addressing the topic of racism in medical education (see table 1).

### Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. BET 2: do wrist splints need to have a thumb extension when immobilising suspected scaphoid fractures? [^9308f312]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether wrist splints require a thumb extension when immobilising suspected scaphoid fractures. 63 papers were found using the reported searches, of which 2 presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. It is concluded that while there is no direct evidence to answer the clinical question, the research available strongly suggests that it is reasonable to continue using standard wrist splints to immobilise patients with suspected scaphoid fractures.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2015). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography in congenital heart disease — use principles and pre-scan decision questions emphasize that the cardiac CT scan is usually ordered to answer a specific clinical question to help with the medical or interventional management of the patient, and each cardiac CT exam must be tailored to the patient to minimize risk and maximize diagnostic yield; performing cardiac CT for CHD requires an in depth knowledge of the patient history, prior intervention(s), common hemodynamic sequelae, and the clinical question(s) to be answered by the study, and the imaging physician needs to be actively involved in directing patient preparation and image acquisition for each cardiac CT performed for CHD; several questions should be asked prior to selection of CT as the imaging test of choice in CHD: does the study indication justify the risks of CT (radiation and contrast exposure, anesthesia and/or medication for heart rate control when needed), does cardiac CT have the ability to best answer the clinical questions at the least risk to the patient when compared to alternate diagnostic modalities locally available, and will the results provide the information necessary to impact clinical management of the patient.

Clinicians and researchers seek answers to clinical research questions, primarily by accessing the results of clinical research studies. This paper moves the focus of research enquiry from getting answers to developing good clinical research questions. Using worked examples, the steps involved in refining questions drawn from various sources to create 'answerable' clinical research questions using the 'PICO' principle are described. Issues to consider in prioritising clinical research questions are also identified. Theoretical and practical considerations involved in choosing the right study design for a clinical research question are then discussed using the worked examples. These include:

### When to randomize patients in a randomized controlled trial? [^8489e5e4]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

The timing of randomization should be considered carefully in the context of each trial because it has implications for the particular research question answered. In most instances, randomization should be delayed until as close as practically possible to the moment of intervention. In some cases, early randomization may offer certain advantages, but trialists should balance these, including any administrative complexity or inconvenience, against the risk of avoidable protocol violations and avoidable drop out.

### Training surgeons to do evidence-based surgery: a collaborative approach [^ac538b33]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Three of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education general competencies contain specific wording indicating that trainees must learn how to locate, appraise, and integrate the best information from the literature into their patient care practices. What is less clear is how to best translate evidence-based concepts into the workday of the resident, fellow, or attending surgeon. In this article we describe our use of the assignment-based training program we developed to ensure that our trainees can actually do what is required to practice evidence-based operations.

Study Design

Our collaborative program draws on the expertise of an attending surgeon, a medical librarian, and a research coordinator. The curriculum is designed so that all residents in our program develop and refine their evidence-based surgery skills in a context relating to their clinical practice. They are given a practice-related clinical question and are asked to demonstrate their competence in finding the best available evidence to answer it. This involves restating the question as a well-formulated clinical question, doing a focused literature search, critically appraising the results to find the best evidence, and integrating the information into practice, if appropriate. Search assignments are evaluated using a structured form and additional training is designed based on the results. Another question is then assigned to assess improvement.

Results

Residents' performance on a first assignment showed specific weaknesses in use of textwords and limiters. Performance was strongly related to a resident's ability to obtain the best evidence in answer to a clinical question (p = 0.011). Substantial improvement was shown on a second assignment after additional training.

Conclusions

Our hands-on, performance-based program allows us to document trainees' progress in developing skills that will allow them to efficiently locate the best evidence available to inform their patient care decisions.

### An approach to recurrent aneurysms following endovascular coiling [^12478f29]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding the most appropriate management of aneurysm recurrences following coiling consists only of uncontrolled case series and the resulting expert opinions, which range from not following coiled patients at all to performing invasive angiography at regular intervals.

Methods

We discuss several current attitudes toward how to manage post-coiling recurrences and outline an approach to finding concrete, practical answers to common clinical questions.

Results

Although some maxims and general statements can be reluctantly offered, in the absence of evidence the best approach is to emphasize proper methods in order to one day find reliable answers. These can only come from randomized clinical trials. The multitude of research questions is an added difficulty. A program of necessary trials is proposed and centers are encouraged to work in a collaborative fashion in order to offer best possible care as well as progress.

Conclusion

Common clinical questions, including how to follow coiled aneurysm patients, if and when to re-treat, and with which treatment modality, are best addressed with the sound scientific methodology of clinical trials.

### The LEADING guideline: reporting standards for expert panel, best-estimate diagnosis, and longitudinal expert all data (LEAD) methods [^08f9a5f2]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Delphi survey results

The criteria for including a reporting standard was that the median of Delphi expert responses was at least 6 = Agree on the question about its inclusion. In Round 1, the mean ratings for the item inclusion scale ranged from 5.37 to 6.67 (M = 6.06; SD = 0.31; Table S2) with a median agreement ranging from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree. No new standards were suggested. The feedback resulted in the removal of one reporting standard and the clarification and reformulation of 20 standards. The standard on Transparency and replicability was rated as relevant but removed because it is achieved by reporting the other reporting standards. Standard 4.2 Validity and Standard needed a major clarification about the meaning of validity as well as standard. Minor clarifications and reformations, such as grammar or word changes, were made for 19 standards (see open material). The mean ratings in Round 2 ranged from 5.47 to 6.70 (M = 6.20; SD = 0.37; Table S3), with open feedback resulting in minor clarifications and reformulations of nine standards.

2.3. Refining the guideline through expert consensus

The authors finalized the guidelines in an expert consensus meeting. The meeting was held online with nine working and steering group members. The content and structure of the consensus meeting were prepared by the working group, and the meeting was led by the last author (O.K.). Participants had access to the guidelines, inclusion rationales (i.e. elaboration and explanation), and the drafted paper before the meeting, where they also had the option to provide comments and feedback in writing. The meeting included reviewing the Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 findings and discussing the paper draft, including the individual reporting standards and groups. We decided not to carry out another Delphi round since i) the median agreement for each reporting standard in both Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 ranged from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree, ii) no new standards were suggested, and iii) only minor changes were needed after Round 2, which taken together suggest consensus.

### Can online networks provide quality answers to questions about occupational safety and health? [^a7454c5a]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether experts can provide high-quality answers to occupational safety and health (OSH) questions in online Question & Answer (Q&A) networks.

Methods

The authors evaluated the quality of answers provided by qualified experts in two Dutch online networks: ArboAntwoord and the Helpdesk of the Netherlands Center for Occupational Diseases. A random sample of 594 answers was independently evaluated by two raters using nine answer quality criteria. An additional criterion, the agreement of answers with the best available evidence, was explored by peer review of a sample of 42 answers. Reviewers performed an evidence search in Medline.

Results

The median answer quality score of ArboAntwoord (N = 295) and the Netherlands Center for Occupational Diseases Helpdesk (N = 299) was 8 of 9 (IQR 2). The inter-rater reliability of the first nine quality criteria was high (κ 0.82–0.90, p < 0.05). A question answered by two or more experts had a greater probability of a high-quality score than questions answered by one expert (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.7 to 9.0). Answers most often scored insufficient on the use of evidence to underpin the answer (36% and 38% for the networks, respectively) and on conciseness (35% and 31%, respectively). Peer review demonstrated that 43%-72% of the answers in both online networks were in complete agreement with the best available evidence.

Conclusions

OSH experts are able to provide quality answers in online OSH Q&A networks. Our answer quality appraisal instrument was feasible and provided information on how to improve answer quality.

### Everyday norms have become more permissive over time and vary across cultures [^8b622f31]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedure

The data was collected anonymously online using Qualtrics, with exception for (part of) the data from Mauritius and Benin where the same questions were asked face-to-face by an interviewer who recorded the responses in Qualtrics. To take the survey, participants needed to give their informed consent, make a commitment to give their best answers (see below), and report an age of 18 or above.

To pass the attention check, participants needed to respond correctly to the following survey item: "Many things may affect our judgment of whether a behavior is appropriate or not. We are testing whether or not people read questions. To show us you've read this far, please answer both 'very interested' and 'extremely interested'. (There were five checkboxes labeled from 'not at all interested' to 'extremely interested'. As an additional attention check, we used the commitment pledge, which read "We care about the quality of our survey data. To get the most accurate measures of your opinions, it is important that you thoughtfully provide your best answers to each question in this survey. Do you commit to thoughtfully provide your best answers to the questions in this survey?" Respondents who selected the response option "I will not provide my best answers" did not get to proceed with the survey. Those who selected "I will provide my best answers" (96.2%) or "I can't promise either way" (3.8%) were allowed to participate, but those who selected the latter option were not counted as having passed the attention check (see next section).

Samples used in the analysis

The analysis is performed on three samples: Preregistered, All Data, and Attention Check. The Preregistered sample (N = 17,288) includes data collected until February 28, except for a few societies that did not include certain questions. The All Data sample (N = 25,422) also includes these societies and data collected after February 28. The Attention Check sample (N = 15,599) excludes participants who did not pass the attention check. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, the attention check pass rate varies dramatically between societies. Given this large variance, presenting the results for the attention-checked sample demonstrates that our findings are not driven by societies with lower data quality.

Analysis

All analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1.

CAYSTON (aztreonam for inhalation solution) for oral inhalation use

Be sure that you read, understand and follow the Patient Instructions for Use below for the right way to take CAYSTON. If you have any questions, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

You will need the following supplies (Figure 1):

1 amber colored CAYSTON vial covered by a metal seal with a blue cap
1 ampule of saline (diluent)
Altera Nebulizer System

Check to make sure that your Altera Nebulizer System works properly before starting your treatment with CAYSTON. See the manufacturer's instructions for use that comes with your Altera Nebulizer System. This should have complete information about how to put together (assemble), prepare, use, and care for your Altera Nebulizer System.

Preparing your CAYSTON for Inhalation

Step 1. Mix (reconstitute) CAYSTON with the saline only when ready to take a dose. Take 1 amber vial of CAYSTON and 1 ampule of saline from the carton. Separate the saline ampules by gently pulling apart.
Step 2. Look at the ampule of saline. If it looks cloudy do not use it. Throw away this ampule and get another ampule of saline.
Step 3. Gently tap the vial so that the powder settles to the bottom of the vial. This helps you get the proper dose of medicine. Follow Step A to Step D in Figure 2 below to open the vial:

### Falls in the elderly population [^5e92d673]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Falls among elderly persons remain a difficult problem with few easy solutions. Falls are symptomatic of underlying clinical deficits, and a multidisciplinary approach is essential in identifying the risk factors and appropriate treatments for these patients. Patients with chronic medical conditions, such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and amputations, possess additional unique risk factors that must be addressed. Interventions include treatment of potentially reversible medical conditions such as B12 and vitamin D deficiencies and home modifications, balance and exercise training programs, medication modification, hip protectors, and monitoring devices. Physicians, patients, family members, and caretakers should be reminded that minimizing falls risk requires persistence, patience, and dedication. Progress may not be noted overnight, but adherence to recommendations correcting intrinsic and extrinsic factors can help to minimize falls and their potentially devastating complications.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^424b934e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Appendix B — recommendation rating scale defines the levels and their clinician implications as follows: A strong recommendation means benefits clearly exceed harms and evidence quality is excellent; Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A moderate recommendation means benefits exceed harms but evidence is not as strong; Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation indicates suspect evidence or little clear advantage among options; Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation reflects a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; Clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit vs harm; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Survey research [^c44856f5]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surveys provide evidence on practice, attitudes, and knowledge. However, conducting good survey research is harder than it looks. The authors aim to provide guidance to both researchers and readers in conducting and interpreting survey research. Like all research, surveys should have clear research question(s) using the smallest possible number of high-quality, essential, survey questions (items) that will interest the target population. Both researchers and readers should put themselves in the position of the respondents. The survey questions should provide reproducible results (reliable), measure what they are supposed to measure (valid), and take less than 10 min to answer. Good survey research reports provide results with valid and reliable answers to the research question with an adequate response rate (at least 40%) and adequate precision (margin of error ideally 5% or less). Possible biases among those who did not respond (nonresponders) must be carefully analyzed and discussed. Quantitative results can be combined with qualitative results in mixed-methods research to provide greater insight.

### Recommendations following a modified UK-Delphi consensus study on best practice for referral and management of severe asthma [^ed0ec004]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Following a modified Delphi process, phase 2 of this process was to select a subset of the statements to gather the opinions of severe asthma patients, these were selected by the expert steering group and validated as being appropriate for patient consideration by a representative of Asthma UK (a patient group). Asthma UK engaged with anonymous severe asthma patients, in receipt of biological therapy, who were randomly sampled from the Asthma UK Volunteer mailing list to provide insight into the patient experience.

For both phases respondents were offered a four-point Likert scale to rate their agreement with each statement, ranging across 'strongly disagree', 'tend to disagree', 'tend to agree' and 'strongly agree'. Completed questionnaires were collated and the individual scores for each statement analysed in order to produce an arithmetic agreement score for each. The online surveys were administered using Microsoft Forms (Microsoft, Redmond, USA).

The PRECISION UK National Working Group predefined agreement for consensus at 75%, a widely accepted threshold. This was considered a stopping criteria. Consensus was defined as 'high' at ≥ 75% and 'very high' at ≥ 90%. The final number of responses included in this analysis was 117 (see figure 1).

Figure 1
Respondents by role (n = 117).

Patient and public involvement

A patient group (Asthma UK) was involved from the first step and helped define/validate the research questions (Delphi Consensus statements) and outcome measures (defining threshold for consensus to be deemed as achieved).

Those statements validated as being suitable to be understood and answerable by patients were agreed with the patient group (Asthma UK) and sent via an online link (via Microsoft Forms) to patients known to Asthma UK who were willing to participate in research (no personal information was made available to any steering group member, facilitator or member of the funding organisation (AstraZeneca).

As a part of the modified Delphi methodology, the statements (research question(s)) were informed by patient priorities, experience and preferences known to be suitable by Asthma UK.

### Patient understanding of liver cirrhosis and improvement using multimedia education [^4b190c25]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 1
An image from the screencast in which the presenter (WF) draws a schematic illustration to explain the development of oesophageal varices in liver cirrhosis.

We designed a questionnaire with which to assess patient knowledge of the complications and management of liver cirrhosis at baseline, and then again after viewing the screencast. An initial draft was assessed for face validity by two members of a patient support group and three patient liaison staff members. Improvements to clarity and structure were made in response to feedback. Content validity was established through consultation with two consultant hepatologists with expertise in cirrhosis management.

The final version (see online supplementary file 1) consisted of six single-best-answer questions, one multiple-choice question and one short-written-answer question. The single-best-answer questions had a two-part structure. The first asked whether the participant knew the reason for a particular complication or management strategy, to which they could answer yes or no. If they answered yes, the second part offered them three reasons to choose from, along with a fourth 'other' option that could be written in a box provided. This structure was intended to best represent participants' understanding by discouraging guessing if they did not know the answer and by providing space for them to give a different response if they felt that none of the options given was suitable. The questions assessed participants' knowledge of the reasons for having ultrasound scans, endoscopies and bone mineral density scans; their knowledge of the causes of oesophageal varices and hepatic encephalopathy; their understanding of the reasons for taking laxatives; their awareness of muscle wasting, coagulopathy and liver cancer as being complications of cirrhosis (multiple-choice question) and their knowledge of the functions of the liver (short-written-answer question).

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^e9b2c396]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Strangulation questions — Ask 'Has your partner ever used their body or any other object to forcibly strangle/choke you?' If yes, ask 'Did you experience any of the following during/after strangulation/choking?' and assess for 'Difficulty swallowing, neck tenderness, voice changes, loss of bladder or bowel, loss of memory, loss of consciences, patient denies listed symptoms'. Provide the counseling statement, 'Your answer regarding strangulation is concerning. People who are strangled are 700 percent more likely to die as a result of violence'.
