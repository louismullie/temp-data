## Question

Meropenem in liver failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether meropenem requires dose adjustment in hepatic impairment and how to dose meropenem safely and effectively in patients with liver failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of meropenem and whether hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion meaningfully alters exposure. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about hepatic impairment. Next, I will review clinical evidence and guidelines for dosing in cirrhosis and acute liver failure. After that, I need to consider special situations like hypoalbuminemia, augmented renal clearance, and renal replacement therapy that can complicate dosing. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and monitoring needs, including any caveats about drug interactions and safety signals.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic basics, because if meropenem is hepatically cleared, liver disease could matter; if not, it likely won't. Meropenem is a hydrophilic beta-lactam with very low protein binding around 2%, distributes into extracellular fluid, and is eliminated predominantly unchanged via renal excretion, including glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, with minimal hepatic metabolism, which means hepatic impairment should not directly reduce clearance or necessitate dose reduction [^115wEWcF] [^113KSpDE] [^111BCiSm].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before drawing conclusions. The FDA labeling explicitly states that a pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment showed no effects of liver disease on meropenem pharmacokinetics, and no dose adjustment is required for hepatic impairment, which aligns with the expectation given its renal elimination profile [^111BCiSm] [^117HMxGb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical practice in cirrhosis; I should check guideline direction. The EASL guidance for decompensated cirrhosis advises choosing antibiotics based on infection type, severity, and local resistance patterns, and it supports carbapenems when ESBL risk is high, without recommending hepatic dose adjustment for meropenem, which is consistent with the PK data and labeling [^111uapik] [^113v19YT]. Similarly, ICU guidance for acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure recommends adjusting only drugs with hepatic metabolism based on residual hepatic function, which again does not apply to meropenem's renal clearance, reinforcing standard dosing in liver failure unless renal function dictates otherwise [^1155yknk].

> I need to ensure I'm not overlooking hypoalbuminemia, which is common in cirrhosis and could theoretically increase the free fraction of highly protein-bound drugs; but wait, meropenem is only about 2% protein bound, so hypoalbuminemia should not meaningfully increase free drug or mandate dose reduction, and in fact may even facilitate tissue penetration without compromising exposure, which supports using standard dosing in hypoalbuminemic cirrhotic patients [^113KSpDE].

> Next, I should review critically ill and septic patients with liver disease, because altered volume of distribution and renal function can still change meropenem exposure. Standard adult dosing is 1 g IV every 8 hours for most infections, with IDSA recommending 2 g IV every 8 hours as 3-hour extended infusions for severe infections or resistant pathogens; these recommendations assume normal renal function and do not require hepatic adjustment, though they do require renal function–based adjustments if CrCl is 50 mL/min or less [^115xE9sZ] [^111BCiSm]. But wait, what if there is augmented renal clearance or large fluid shifts? In those scenarios, extended or continuous infusions improve pharmacodynamic target attainment, and tools like the MeroRisk calculator can help estimate risk of underexposure based on creatinine clearance and MIC, guiding whether to extend infusions or increase dose frequency rather than changing total daily dose for hepatic reasons [^1163YZ4o] [^113Gh86D].

> I should double-check renal replacement therapy scenarios, since many liver failure patients develop AKI. Dosing during CRRT, SLED, or IHD is highly variable and modality dependent; extended or continuous infusions generally improve target attainment, and recent multicenter data provide nomograms to individualize dosing by RRT intensity, urine output, and desired exposure targets, again emphasizing renal and extracorporeal factors rather than hepatic impairment per se [^112N69gZ] [^116hGddx] [^111beHK6].

> Let me consider safety and monitoring, because liver failure patients are complex. Meropenem is generally well tolerated, but I need to watch for neurotoxicity such as seizures, especially with high doses, renal dysfunction, or CNS disease, and I should monitor liver enzymes periodically during therapy even though meropenem does not require hepatic dose adjustment; rare idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has been reported, so new jaundice or transaminase rises warrant evaluation and potential discontinuation [^111CM54x] [^117ViUvr]. I should also confirm drug–drug interactions, particularly with valproic acid, where meropenem can markedly reduce valproate levels and precipitate breakthrough seizures, necessitating close monitoring or alternative anticonvulsant strategies in patients with liver disease who may already be at seizure risk [^111CM54x].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line and make sure there are no exceptions. No dose adjustment of meropenem is required for hepatic impairment alone; use standard renal function–based dosing, consider 2 g every 8 hours as a 3-hour extended infusion for severe infections or resistant pathogens, and adapt for renal dysfunction, augmented renal clearance, or RRT as indicated, with vigilance for neurotoxicity and drug interactions rather than hepatic metabolism concerns [^117HMxGb] [^115xE9sZ] [^113Gh86D].

---

Meropenem **does not require dose adjustment** in hepatic impairment because it is not hepatically metabolized and hepatic dysfunction does not meaningfully alter its pharmacokinetics [^111BCiSm] [^117HMxGb]. Standard dosing is appropriate across Child-Pugh classes A–C, but **renal function must guide dosing** because meropenem is renally cleared [^115wEWcF]. In critically ill patients with hypoalbuminemia or augmented renal clearance, consider extended or continuous infusions to optimize pharmacodynamic targets [^115xE9sZ] [^113Gh86D]. Monitor for neurotoxicity (seizures, encephalopathy), especially with renal impairment or CNS disease, and adjust therapy if neurotoxicity occurs [^111CM54x].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of meropenem in hepatic impairment

- **Metabolism**: Meropenem is not hepatically metabolized; minimal metabolism occurs, and hepatic impairment does not significantly alter its clearance [^111BCiSm] [^112cbiUW].

- **Elimination**: Meropenem is primarily eliminated unchanged via renal excretion (glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion) [^115wEWcF].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Pharmacokinetic studies show no significant effect of hepatic impairment on meropenem exposure, supporting no dose adjustment in liver failure [^111BCiSm] [^112cbiUW].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing in hepatic impairment

Clinical studies demonstrate **no significant differences** in meropenem pharmacokinetics between patients with hepatic impairment and healthy controls, supporting standard dosing in hepatic impairment [^111BCiSm] [^112cbiUW]. Regulatory guidance: The FDA explicitly states that **no dose adjustment is required** for meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment [^111BCiSm] [^112cbiUW].

---

## Recommended dosing regimens in hepatic impairment

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dosing regimen** |
|-|-|
| Standard dosing | 1 g IV every 8 hours (30-minute infusion) [^115xE9sZ] |
| Severe infections or resistant pathogens | 2 g IV every 8 hours (3-hour extended infusion) [^115xE9sZ] |
| Renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min) | Dose adjustment required based on renal function [^111BCiSm] |

## Special considerations in critically ill patients with hepatic impairment

- **Hypoalbuminemia**: Low albumin increases the unbound fraction of meropenem, potentially altering pharmacokinetics; consider extended or continuous infusions to optimize exposure [^114pTWay] [^113Gh86D].

- **Augmented renal clearance**: Common in critical illness, increasing underexposure risk; extended or continuous infusions improve pharmacodynamic target attainment [^1138596j] [^117YVW9m].

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: Consider TDM to guide dosing in critically ill patients with fluctuating renal function or severe infections [^113Gh86D] [^1148ZSq2].

---

## Safety profile and monitoring

- **Neurotoxicity**: Seizures and encephalopathy can occur, especially with renal impairment or CNS disease; monitor closely and adjust therapy if neurotoxicity develops [^111CM54x].

- **Hematologic effects**: Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia have been reported; monitor CBC regularly [^111CM54x].

- **Hepatic enzyme elevations**: Transient liver enzyme elevations may occur; monitor LFTs during prolonged therapy [^116PtSix].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

Clinical efficacy is **comparable** in patients with hepatic impairment versus those with normal hepatic function, with similar clinical and microbiological response rates. Mortality and recurrence rates likewise do not differ significantly between patients with hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function.

---

## Comparison with other carbapenems

Imipenem and ertapenem also **do not require dose adjustment** in hepatic impairment, but meropenem's lower seizure risk and broader spectrum make it preferred in many settings [^1146ioxy].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **No dose adjustment**: Meropenem does not require dose adjustment in hepatic impairment [^117HMxGb].

- **Standard dosing**: Use standard dosing based on infection severity and patient-specific factors [^115xE9sZ].

- **Renal function**: Adjust dosing based on renal function, not hepatic impairment [^111BCiSm].

- **Critical illness**: Consider extended or continuous infusions and TDM in critically ill patients with fluctuating renal function or severe infections [^113Gh86D] [^1148ZSq2].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for neurotoxicity, hematologic effects, and hepatic enzyme elevations [^111CM54x].

Meropenem **does not require dose adjustment** in hepatic impairment; standard dosing is appropriate, with renal function guiding adjustments and extended infusions considered in critical illness.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

Pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem in patients with renal impairment have shown that the plasma clearance of meropenem correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustments are necessary in subjects with renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 mL/min or less) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use In Specific Populations (8.6)].

Meropenem is hemodialyzable. However, there is no information on the usefulness of hemodialysis to treat overdosage [see Overdosage (10)].

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem.

Geriatric Patients

A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance.

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of meropenem for injection IV, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Table 6: Meropenem Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age*

Drug Interactions

Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38% [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Mechanism of Action

The bactericidal activity of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem readily penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-bindingprotein (PBP) targets. Meropenem binds to PBPs 2, 3 and 4 of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and PBPs 1, 2 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations (defined as a 3 log10reduction in cell counts within 12 hours to 24 hours) are typically 1 to 2 times the bacteriostatic concentrations of meropenem, with the exception of Listeria monocytogenes, against which lethal activity is not observed.

Meropenem does not have in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE).

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of meropenem [^115wEWcF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of antibiotics are important in determining effective dosing regimens. Although minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data reflect microbial susceptibility to an antibiotic, they do not provide dosing information. The integration of pharmacokinetic and microbiological data, however, can be used to design rational dosing strategies. Meropenem is a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic that penetrates most body fluids and tissues rapidly after intravenous administration. Meropenem undergoes primarily renal elimination; therefore, dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. Meropenem is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and bacterial meningitis. Meropenem has time-dependent bactericidal activity; thus, the percentage of time that free-drug concentrations are higher than the MIC (%T > MIC) best characterizes the drug's pharmacodynamic profile (bactericidal target of approximately 40%T > MIC). Pharmacodynamic modeling can identify regimens with the greatest probability of attaining this target, and probabilities can be compared with clinical and microbiological responses in patients.

The findings from this study suggest that an even more sophisticated method of optimization may be necessary in selected patients - patient-tailored antibiotic therapy - which is the adaptation of antibiotic therapy to the need of the individual patient in order to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity through therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adaptation. Unfortunately, TDM of β-lactam antibiotics is currently challenging with long turnaround times, expensive equipment, logistical problems related to the instability of the antibiotics in the samples and the need for well-trained personnel. Efforts to overcome these limitations, and clinical studies to assess utility in the clinical setting are urgently needed.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 1,835 patients in Phase 2b/3 trials treated with Ertapenem for injection, approximately 26 percent were 65 and over, while approximately 12 percent were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment

Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or less [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of ertapenem in patients with hepatic impairment have not been established. Of the total number of patients in clinical trials, 37 patients receiving ertapenem 1 g daily and 36 patients receiving comparator drugs were considered to have Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C liver impairment. The incidence of adverse experiences in patients with hepatic impairment was similar between the ertapenem group and the comparator groups.

### Liver abscesses: pathogenesis, treatment, and ongoing challenges [^114pTWay]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Tissue penetration

To effectively eliminate the bacterial infection, antibiotics must achieve a sufficiently high concentration and exhibit antimicrobial activity within the abscess. For an antibiotic to penetrate the abscess, it must first enter the bloodstream and cross the capillary endothelium, which separates the plasma from the surrounding tissue. The antibiotic then needs to diffuse through the interstitial fluid, pass through the abscess wall, and exert its antibacterial effect.

Capillary pores allow substances with a molecular weight of up to 1 kDa to pass through. Antibiotics fall below this range, but plasma proteins like albumin, which bind to antibiotics, are too large to pass through these pores. Albumin, synthesized primarily in the liver, is the most abundant protein in plasma, accounting for approximately 50%–60% of the total plasma protein content. Albumin-bound antibiotics have increased circulation time in the blood because the binding prevents their transport across capillary pores and into tissues. (Fig. 1). Fluoroquinolones (20%–40%) have relatively low protein binding compared to ceftriaxone which exhibits up to 95% protein binding. Carbapenems display a broad range of protein binding, with ertapenem up to 94% protein-bound in contrast to meropenem which is only 2% protein-bound.

Critically ill patients, including those with KLAs, can experience hypoalbuminemia, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of albumin in the blood. Hypoalbuminemia can occur due to liver dysfunction or diabetes. Reduced albumin levels in the plasma can increase the proportion of unbound antibiotics and, in theory, could enhance the tissue penetration of certain antibiotics. However, increased unbound antibiotic could also accelerate the elimination of the drug from the body, potentially diminishing their effectiveness. Several studies have suggested that antibiotic dosing, particularly for β-lactam antibiotics such as cephalosporins and carbapenems, may be suboptimal in critically ill patients due to hypoalbuminemia, leading to treatment failure or delayed therapeutic response. Modulating antibiotic dosing based on the unbound antibiotic fraction in patients with varying degrees of hypoalbuminemia may offer valuable insights and help optimize treatment, potentially improving outcomes in patients with KLAs.

### Meropenem-vaborbactam (Vabomere) [^1169CS9f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

Following a single dose of VABOMERE, pharmacokinetic studies with meropenem and vaborbactam in subjects with renal impairment have shown that meropenem AUC0-infratios to subjects with normal renal function are 1.28, 2.07, and 4.63 for subjects with mild (eGFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate (eGFR of 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2), and severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment, respectively; vaborbactam AUC0-infratios to subjects with normal renal function are 1.18, 2.31, and 7.8 for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively [see Dosing and Administration (2.2)]. Hemodialysis removed 38% of the meropenem dose and 53% of the vaborbactam dose. Vaborbactam exposure was high in subjects with ESRD (eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2). Vaborbactam exposure was higher when VABOMERE was administered after hemodialysis (AUC0-infratio to subjects with normal renal function of 37.5) than when VABOMERE was administered before hemodialysis (AUC0-infratio to subjects with normal renal function of 10.2) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosing and Administration (2.2)].

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

A pharmacokinetic study conducted with an intravenous formulation of meropenem in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem.

Vaborbactam does not undergo hepatic metabolism. Therefore, the systemic clearance of meropenem and vaborbactam is not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment.

Geriatric Patients

In elderly patients with renal impairment, plasma clearances of meropenem and vaborbactam were reduced, correlating with age-associated reduction in renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Male and Female Patients

Meropenem and vaborbactam Cmaxand AUC were similar between males and females using a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

Racial or Ethnic Groups

No significant difference in mean meropenem or vaborbactam clearance was observed across race groups using a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

### Role of renal function in risk assessment of target non-attainment after standard dosing of meropenem in critically ill patients: a prospective observational study [^117LRNYj]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Meropenem dosing and sampling

During the study period, patients were treated with 1000 mg (n patients = 47) or 2000 mg (n patients = 1) of meropenem administered as 30-minute infusions approximately every 8 h (median 8 h, 95% CI 6.94–9.19 h). A total of 1376 blood samples (median per patient 31) were taken during 349 dosing intervals (median per patient 8, range per patient 4–8). Of the measurements, 23.5% (n = 324) were C min samples, which were collected 7.92 h (median) after infusion start (95% CI 6.85–9.08 h). Very few serum concentrations (0.36% of data) revealed an implausible increase in the terminal part of the concentration-time profiles and were therefore excluded from the data analyses (red data points in Fig. 1).

### Clinical and microbiological efficacy of continuous versus intermittent application of meropenem in critically ill patients: a randomized open-label controlled trial [^111c7SQ5]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Secondary outcome measures were meropenem-related length of mechanical ventilation, meropenem-related length of ICU and hospital stay (LOS), ICU and in-hospital mortality, duration of meropenem treatment, the total dose of meropenem and the safety of both dosing regimens. Meropenem-related length of mechanical ventilation was defined as the number of days of mechanical ventilation from the start of meropenem administration. Meropenem-related length of stay was defined as the number of days from the beginning of meropenem therapy to the day of discharge from ICU or from the hospital. Safety of meropenem therapy was evaluated by clinical symptoms (diarrhea, rash, vomiting and seizures) during the meropenem therapy and by assessment of laboratory parameters and their changes during meropenem therapy (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, thrombocytes).

Other data, such as age, weight, gender, APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores at the start of meropenem therapy, diagnostic group, type and etiology of infection treated by meropenem, MICs of identified pathogens, length of ICU stay prior to meropenem administration, occurrence and length of previous antimicrobial therapy, number of antibiotics given before the start of meropenem, the rate of empiric and culture-based meropenem therapy and the rate of community and nosocomial infection were recorded. C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin were examined at the start and at the end of meropenem therapy.

### Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics issues relevant for the clinical use of β-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients [^117MA6ii]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Beta-lactam PK issues in the critically ill

Discovered antibiotics are evaluated in vitro and tested in animals, initially for toxicity and subsequently for efficacy. The antibiotic dose and frequency are based on these in vitro or animal in vivo PK/PD studies. These dosing regimens are then tested on healthy human volunteers for tolerability, with clinical efficacy studies undertaken in non-critically ill patients. After the launch of the drug onto the general market, the same dosing regimen is used in critically ill patients; however, this is likely to lead to suboptimal outcomes in the ICU, especially with more resistant bacterial strains and in the immunocompromised population.

Beta-lactams are hydrophilic drugs and so their volume of distribution (Vd) is low and similar to that of extracellular water. Variations in the extracellular fluid content and/or in renal or liver function may be considered the most relevant and frequent pathophysiological mechanisms possibly affecting drug disposition in critically ill patients. Other factors may contribute to altered antibiotic concentrations: an interesting case-report by Taccone et al. related the case of an obese septic patient with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia treated with meropenem. The PD target (t > 4 × MIC > 40% of the dosing interval) was only achievable by dosing 3 g q6h at 3 h extended infusion and was associated with clinical improvement.

Compared with healthy volunteers and non-critically ill patients, in critically ill patients capillary leakage and edema, fluid therapy, pleural effusion, ascites, indwelling post-surgical drainage, and hypoalbuminemia may increase Vd and cause antibiotic dilution in plasma and extracellular fluids. Some pathophysiological factors may also enhance (trauma, burns, the hyperdynamic condition of the early phase of sepsis, the use of hemodynamically active drugs) or reduce (renal failure, muscular wastage, bedridden patients) renal clearance and consequently may alter plasma and extracellular antibiotic concentrations (with implications on time over MIC), induce high intra- and inter-patient variability, and promote the risk of antibiotic underdosing. Extracorporeal support techniques also contribute to antibiotic concentration variability.

### Update on the efficacy and tolerability of meropenem in the treatment of serious bacterial infections [^111hEinB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Meropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and pediatric bacterial meningitis (in patients ≥ 3 months of age). In clinical trials, it also has shown efficacy as initial empirical therapy for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. Unlike other beta-lactam antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems have shown activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and AmpC chromosomal beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Compared with imipenem, meropenem is more active against gram-negative pathogens and somewhat less active against gram-positive pathogens, and it does not require coadministration of a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor. In most comparative trials, clinical and bacteriological response rates with imipenem and meropenem were similar. Compared with clindamycin/tobramycin, meropenem is associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and a shorter duration of therapy among patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Meropenem is well tolerated by children and adults and has an acceptable safety profile. Alternative meropenem dosing strategies for the optimization of outcomes are under investigation.

### Substantial impairment of voriconazole clearance by high-dose meropenem in a patient with renal failure [^116zh3mo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A critically ill patient with multiple postoperative infections repeatedly required profound voriconazole dose reductions whenever high-dose meropenem was added. Subsequent in vitro assessment confirmed inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP3A4 by meropenem, suggesting that during meropenem treatment, narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolized by these CYPs require close monitoring.

Surgical Infection Society revised IAI guidelines — antimicrobial dosing in adult patients: Use standard dosages for lower-risk patients who are not severely obese and who do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment (Grade 1-B). Consider use of higher dosages in selected higher-risk patients (Grade 2-B). Use adjusted dosages based on outcome data, pharmacokinetic parameters, and therapeutic drug monitoring, where applicable, in patients with significant renal impairment (Grade 2-B), and use adjusted dosages of selected, hepatically eliminated or metabolized agents in substantial hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). Consider use of adjusted dosages based on outcome data and pharmacokinetic parameters in obese patients (Grade 2-B). Do not use prolonged or continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotic agents routinely in all patients, but consider these approaches as options in critically ill patients and those at risk for infection with resistant gram-negative pathogens (Grade 2-B).

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in patients with hepatic impairment has shown no effects of liver disease on the pharmacokinetics of meropenem.

Geriatric Patients

A pharmacokinetic study with meropenem for injection in elderly patients with renal impairment showed a reduction in plasma clearance of meropenem that correlates with age-associated reduction in creatinine clearance.

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older are similar to those in adults. The elimination half-life for meropenem was approximately 1.5 hours in pediatric patients of age 3 months to 2 years.

The pharmacokinetics of meropenem in patients less than 3 months of age receiving combination antibacterial drug therapy are given below.

Table 4: Meropenem Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Patients Less Than 3 Months of Age

Drug Interactions

Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem. Following administration of probenecid with meropenem, the mean systemic exposure increased 56% and the mean elimination half-life increased 38%. Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended.

Key messages

- Antibiotic concentrations vary greatly in intensive care patients with normal kidney function.

- The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment is dependent on kidney function.

- Patients with augmented renal clearance have a high probability of target non-attainment, even with the use of an extended infusion strategy.

### Role of renal function in risk assessment of target non-attainment after standard dosing of meropenem in critically ill patients: a prospective observational study [^113KSpDE]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe infections remain a major issue in the intensive care unit (ICU) because of their high prevalence and high mortality rates among critically ill patients. Hence, rational antibiotic therapy is especially important in this vulnerable population. Apart from an appropriate activity spectrum and early initiation of antibiotic therapy, a dosing regimen leading to adequate therapeutic antibiotic concentrations and exposure is crucial. Adequate antibiotic exposure not only has been found to improve clinical success but also has been suggested to reduce resistance development. At the same time, pathophysiological changes in critically ill patients, including organ dysfunction or altered fluid balance, might substantially influence antibiotic concentrations and increase the risk of inadequate antibiotic exposure. As a second challenge, infections in these patients are often caused by pathogens with lower susceptibility (i.e. higher minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) than in other clinical settings.

Meropenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem β-lactam antibiotic frequently used to treat severe bacterial infections in critically ill patients, such as those with severe pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, or sepsis. For these indications, the approved standard dosing regimens for adults (intact renal function [RF]) include 500 mg or 1000 mg administered as short-term infusions every 8 h; for other indications, doses up to 2000 mg are recommended. Meropenem is a hydrophilic molecule with very low plasma protein binding of approximately 2%. It is excreted primarily via the kidney, predominantly by glomerular filtration but also by active tubular secretion. Meropenem has been shown to be readily dialysable and effectively removed by haemodialysis. As a β-lactam antibiotic, meropenem shows time-dependent activity; that is, its antibacterial activity is linked to the percentage of time that meropenem concentrations exceed the MIC value of a pathogen (%T > MIC). The attainment of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index %T > MIC has been associated with clinical success in patients treated with meropenem. For example, Ariano et al. demonstrated that the probability of clinical response was 80% when %T > MIC was 76–100 in febrile neutropenic patients with bacteraemia but only 36% when %T > MIC was between 0 and 50.

Methods

Study design, settings, and patients

This was a single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized, comparative PK clinical trial that was conducted at a tertiary surgical intensive care unit (ICU) at the Parc de Salut Mar in Barcelona, Spain, between January 2017 and February 2019. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Comitè Etic d'Investigació Clínica del Parc de Salut Mar; approval no. 2016/7125) and the Spanish Medicines and Health Product Agency (AEMPS; registration no. 16–0774). Furthermore, the trial was registered in the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT-no. 2016–002796–10). Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their legal representatives.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: age ≥ 18 years, diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia and risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens [Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative Bacilli], and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula). The exclusion criteria were allergy to β-lactams, previous use of carbapenems within 15 days, GFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2, severely impaired liver function [cirrhosis grade C by Child-Pugh classification], obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 30), pregnancy, life expectancy < 3 days, and colonization [respiratory secretions or surveillance cultures (oropharyngeal and rectal swabs)] with pathogens known to be resistant to meropenem.

The diagnosis of pneumonia was based on standard clinical and laboratory criteria and defined as a new or progressive radiological pulmonary infiltrate plus two or more of the following characteristics: temperature > 38 °C or < 35 °C, leucocyte count > 11,000 or < 4000 cells/mm 3, or purulent respiratory secretions.

### Clinical and microbiological efficacy of continuous versus intermittent application of meropenem in critically ill patients: a randomized open-label controlled trial [^116XoJMQ]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe infections in critically ill patients and increasing antibiotic resistance are major healthcare problems affecting morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. Antibacterial drug discovery and development have slowed considerably in recent years. The number of new antibacterial medicines entering the clinic has been declining and, in view of this fact, new compounds for multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacilli will unlikely be available for more than 10 years. The problems associated with escalating resistance and decreased development of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action has required more research into existing antibiotics. The effort to maximize antibiotic activity has led in recent years to the interest for optimal dosing based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of antibiotics.

Because of broad spectrum activity against Gram-negative and -positive organisms and low toxicity, meropenem remains a suitable choice for treatment of severe infections in critically ill patients. It is currently established that meropenem, like other β-lactam antibiotics, displays time-dependent bactericidal activity and the percentage of the dosing interval that free drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration of pathogen (%fT > MIC) is the most important parameter for predicting their antibacterial efficacy. As a minimum standard for carbapenems the T > MIC should be maintained at 40%. However, patients with serious bacterial infections with T > MIC of 100% displayed significantly greater clinical cure (82% vs. 33%; P = 0.002) and bacteriological eradication (97% vs. 44%; P < 0.001) than patients with T > MIC of < 100%, thus maintaining antibiotic concentrations above the MIC for 100% of the dosing interval should be considered. The maximum killing effect of β-lactams is reached at four to five times the MIC with higher concentration not contributing further to increasing the antimicrobial effect. It can be presumed that intermittent infusion recommended by pharmaceutical companies results in high peak concentration and low through concentration and can cause reduced efficacy. Furthermore, pathophysiological changes that occur in seriously ill patients with sepsis often affect volume of distribution, drug clearance and altered pharmacokinetic parameters making these recommendations potentially inappropriate. The use of continuous administration of β-lactams was studied in some trials, but strong evidence of clinical efficacy of this alternative is lacking.

The goal of this study was to compare the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of continuous infusion of meropenem versus traditional bolus administration in critically ill patients with severe infection, and to evaluate the safety of both dosing regimens.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Optimization of meropenem dosage in the critically ill population based on renal function [^117YVW9m]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop a meropenem population pharmacokinetic model in critically ill patients with particular focus on optimizing dosing regimens based on renal function.

Methods

Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with creatinine clearance (CrCl) and adjusted body weight to predict parameter estimates. Initial modeling was performed on 21 patients (55 samples). Validation was conducted with 12 samples from 5 randomly selected patients excluded from the original model. A 5,000-patient Monte Carlo simulation was used to ascertain optimal dosing regimens for three CrCl ranges.

Results

Mean ± SD age, APACHE, and CrCl were 59.2 ± 16.8 years, 13.6 ± 7, and 78.3 ± 33.7 mL/min. Meropenem doses ranged from 0.5 g every 8 h (q8h)-2 g q8h as 0.5–3 h infusions. Median estimates for volume of the central compartment, K₁₂ and K₂₁ were 0.24 L/kg, 0.49 h⁻¹, and 0.65 h⁻¹, respectively. K₁₀ was described by the equation: K₁₀ = 0.3922 + 0.0025 × CrCl. Model bias and precision were -1.9 and 8.1 mg/L. R², bias, and precision for the validation were 93%, 1.1, and 2.6 mg/L. At minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) up to 8 mg/L, the probability of achieving 40% fT > MIC was 96, 90, and 61% for 3 h infusions of 2 g q8h, 1 g q8h, and 1 g q12h in patients with CrCl ≥ 50, 30–49, and 10–29, respectively. Target attainment was 75, 65, and 44% for these same dosing regimens as 0.5 h infusions.

Conclusions

This pharmacokinetic model is capable of accurately estimating meropenem concentrations in critically ill patients over a range of CrCl values. Compared with 0.5 h infusions, regimens employing prolonged infusions improved target attainment across all CrCl ranges.

2.5 Patients on Hemodialysis

When adult patients on hemodialysis are given the recommended daily dose of 500 mg of ertapenem for injection within 6 hours prior to hemodialysis, a supplementary dose of 150 mg is recommended following the hemodialysis session. If ertapenem for injection is given at least 6 hours prior to hemodialysis, no supplementary dose is needed. There are no data in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration. There are no data in pediatric patients on hemodialysis.

When only the serum creatinine is available, the following formulamay be used to estimate creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Males: [(weight in kg × (140 − age in years))/(72 × serum creatinine (mg/100 mL))]

Females: (0.85) × (value calculated for males)

### The combined effects of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and renal replacement therapy on meropenem pharmacokinetics: a matched cohort study [^116xAUxX]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

There is emerging data to suggest that the commonly used dose of meropenem (1 g 8-hourly) may be sufficient to treat an unselected population of septic critically ill patients not receiving ECMO or RRT. In this setting, the risk of under dosing with 1 g 8-hourly dosing in critically ill patients on ECMO and with preserved renal function appears small and augmented renal clearance has not yet been described in this population. However, patients on peripheral VA ECMO in whom oxygenated blood is being returned into iliac artery or distal aorta may experience very high non-pulsatile renal blood flows and whether this result in heightened CL in patients with preserved renal function needs further evaluation.

The current study has limitations. Characterizing altered PK in patients receiving RRT while on ECMO can be complex. Variability in the techniques used for RRT and ECMO is a significant limitation in the generalisability of our results. Future studies should further investigate the effects of type and intensity of RRT chosen on meropenem PK during ECMO. Despite the ECMO population being small and heterogeneous, our model could accurately predict drug concentrations in ECMO patients and controls and discriminated well for RRT. This study does not address the pharmacodynamic aspects of meropenem therapy and no meaningful clinical outcome measures can be generated from the small sample. The non-ECMO patients selected were considered to be optimal controls for patients on ECMO who exhibited systemic inflammatory syndrome with or without clear evidence of infection. Systemic inflammation is known to significantly affect volume of distribution of the hydrophilic and renally excreted drugs such as meropenem. Hepatic and renal function, however, were not matched as a clear separation between controls and ECMO patients who had preserved renal function and ECMO patients who were dialysis dependent, desirable in the context of this study, which sought to highlight the influence of inflammation and illness, ECMO and RRT.

### Comparing outcomes of meropenem administration strategies based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles: a qualitative systematic review [^114d1Efd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review evidence comparing traditional and alternative dosing strategies for meropenem, based on clinical and pharmacoeconomic outcomes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1950-September 2009), EMBASE (1980-September 2009), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2009) were searched, using the terms meropenem, carbapenems, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics. Reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles discussing administration of meropenem to adults with normal renal function and comparing at least 2 regimens, 1 of which included the manufacturer-recommended regimen of 0.5 g or 1 g every 8 hours infused over 30 minutes, with clinical, pharmacodynamic, or pharmacoeconomic endpoints, were included. The pharmacodynamic endpoint of interest was percent time that the unbound drug concentration exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration for a bacterial pathogen.

Data Synthesis

Sixteen studies were reviewed, which included 13 pharmacokinetic and dynamic assessments using Monte Carlo simulations, 5 clinical evaluations, and 3 pharmacoeconomic appraisals. Data on clinical and economic outcomes are largely nonrandomized retrospective analyses and case reports. Meropenem via intermittent prolonged infusion potentially increases the likelihood of achieving pharmacodynamic targets. However, a strong link with improved clinical outcomes is lacking. Smaller doses with shorter intervals appear to provide pharmacodynamic target attainment rates and clinical outcomes similar to those with traditional dosing, with potential pharmacoeconomic benefits. Meropenem via continuous infusion appears to increase the likelihood of achieving pharmacodynamic targets, compared with intermittent infusions. The sparsity of clinical evidence supporting this practice limits its broad application to practice. No studies have formally examined adverse effects with alternative dosing regimens.

Conclusions

Meropenem alternative dosing strategies provide similar pharmacodynamic target attainment rates compared with traditional dosing strategies. Small doses with shorter interval dosing provide additional pharmacoeconomic benefits and similar clinical outcomes. Alternative dosing strategies for meropenem were largely studied in healthy subjects; individuals with pharmacokinetic parameters that differ significantly may be ideal subjects for empiric dose modification.

Systemic and Local Adverse Reactions

Pediatric Patients with Serious Bacterial Infections (excluding Bacterial Meningitis):

Meropenem for injection was studied in 515 pediatric patients (3 months of age and older to below 13 years of age) with serious bacterial infections (excluding meningitis, see next section) at dosages of 10 to 20 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows:

Pediatric Patients with Bacterial Meningitis:

Meropenem for injection was studied in 321 pediatric patients (3 months of age and older to below 17 years of age) with meningitis at a dosage of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours. The types of systemic and local adverse events seen in these patients are similar to the adults, with the most common adverse events reported as possibly, probably, or definitely related to meropenem for injection and their rates of occurrence as follows:

In the meningitis studies, the rates of seizure activity during therapy were comparable between patients with no CNS abnormalities who received meropenem and those who received comparator agents (either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone). In the meropenem for injection treated group, 12/15 patients with seizures had late onset seizures (defined as occurring on day 3 or later) versus 7/20 in the comparator arm. The meropenem group had a statistically higher number of patients with transient elevation of liver enzymes.

### Does dose reduction of renally cleared antibiotics in patients with impaired renal function lead to adequate drug exposure? A systematic review [^116qDd6t]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is inconsistency between many guidelines in the recommended dose reduction of renally cleared antibiotics in patients with impaired renal function.

Objectives

This systematic review summarizes the available evidence on the adequacy of the recommended dose reduction in terms of achieving sufficient antibiotic drug exposure or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment after treatment with these reduced doses.

Data Sources

We systematically searched Ovid Medline and Embase from inception (respectively 1946 and 1947) through July 2019.

Study Eligibility Criteria

All studies reporting antibiotic drug exposure and/or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment after dose reduction of antibiotics in patients with impaired renal function.

Participants

Adult patients with or without infections.

Interventions

Administration of reduced doses of antibiotics (orally, intravenously or intramuscularly).

Methods

The reduced dose was considered adequate when the most relevant parameters of drug exposure or PK/PD target attainment in patients with impaired renal function were within a range of 80% to 125% of that patients with adequate renal function receiving a regular dose (reference) or when PK/PD target attainment was attained in at least 90% of the patients with impaired renal function, regardless of the lack of a reference group.

Results

Twenty-seven of the 4202 identified studies were included. The quality of 15 of 27 studies was fair, and most studies were of β-lactams (12/27). Best evidence was available for meropenem: four studies were included, of which two studies were of good quality. Drug exposure for meropenem is 158% to 286% higher in patients with impaired renal function receiving reduced doses compared to patients with adequate renal function receiving regular doses. For all other antibiotics, a maximum of one good-quality study could be identified.

Conclusions

No good-quality evidence on the recommended dose reduction of renally cleared antibiotics in patients with impaired renal function is present, with the exception of meropenem.

Discussion

We present the results of the largest prospective multi-centre study of meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam PK in critically ill patients with AKI receiving the most prescribed RRT modalities in the ICU. Our main findings are that meropenem, piperacillin, and tazobactam PK are highly variable and dependent on RRT intensity, urine output, and, in the case of SLED, duration of therapy, with the same factors determining dosing requirements for optimised concentrations. In most clinical scenarios, extended/continuous infusions provided a better attainment of optimal antibiotic trough/average steady-state unbound concentrations (100% fT > MIC) compared to the equivalent doses administered as a short 30-min infusion; continuous infusion appeared particularly advantageous when higher concentrations are required (4 × MIC for P. aeruginosa or for empirical treatment), especially for those patients with clinical characteristics associated with higher drug CL. Our dosing nomograms provide dosing recommendations that maximise the attainment of effective meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam concentrations (either standard or higher target as required) and also minimise the risk of toxic concentrations.

Optimising beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients receiving RRT is a major challenge in daily practise. The diversity in RRT modalities, techniques, and settings may have a major effect on the PK of water-soluble drugs like beta-lactams, leading to different antibiotic requirements depending on each infection, patient, and RRT treatment. However, existing dosing recommendations are still generic and not robust. Multiple well-designed PK studies have tried to address this clinical question for meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam, but patient heterogeneity and small sample sizes in single-centre settings have provided insufficient data to generate optimised dosing recommendations. In this context, the large sample size of our multi-centre study has identified RRT intensity and duration and urine output as the primary factors influencing drug CL, allowing our dosing nomogram to be highly accurate across a wide range of scenarios.

### Efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole versus meropenem in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection: results from a randomized, controlled, double-blind, phase 3 program [^1154aoVt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients with clinical cure across patient and disease baseline subgroups was generally consistent between the 2 treatment arms, except in patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, in whom there was a response trend in favor of meropenem. As with other drugs eliminated largely by renal excretion, renal function affects the pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime, avibactam, and meropenem. To account for this, dose adjustments for these drugs were made for all patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, with the aim of achieving drug plasma levels associated with target attainment while minimizing the risk of overexposure due to impaired renal clearance. Post hoc review of serum creatinine levels indicated rapid improvement of renal function in some patients after enrollment. Dose adjustments were made; however, some patients were potentially underdosed early in the study. Because the protocol-specified reduction in total daily dose in renal impairment for ceftazidime-avibactam (−66%) was greater than for meropenem (−33%), this increased the risk of underdosing in patients receiving ceftazidime-avibactam. These results should be interpreted with caution because patients with renal impairment at baseline represented only a small subgroup (8% of the MITT population); however, similar results have also been noted with ceftolozane-tazobactam, another β-lactamase/β-lactam combination.

Results: During the study period, 189 patients had severe sepsis (62%) or septic shock (38%). We evaluated 263 antibiotic prescriptions. Most (62%) patients received appropriate antibiotic doses. However, 39 (21%) patients were under-dosed, 30 (16%) were over-dosed, and 3 (2%) had combination of over-dosing and under-dosing. Septic patients with chronic cardiovascular disease (p = 0.035) and chronic renal failure (p = 0.021) were more likely to have antibiotic dosing errors. However, respiratory failure, liver failure, immunodeficiency state and diabetes mellitus were not clearly associated with dposing errors. Vancomycin was associated with the highest dosing error rate (43%). The other antibiotics (pipercillin/tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, colistin and gentamicin) were dosed appropriately in > 70% of prescriptions. The multivariate analysis showed that the estimated glomerular filtration rate was the only variable associated with dosing error (odds ratio, 0.98 per 1 ml/min increment; 95% confidence interval, 0.97–0.99).

Conclusions: Antibiotic dosing errors, which include under- and over-dosing, were common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Vancomycin had the highest rate of inappropriate dosing. Lower glomerular filtration rate was a significant predictor of dosing error and should be routinely considered for antibiotic dosing.

### Meropenem and piperacillin / tazobactam optimised dosing regimens for critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy [^112bg21W]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Across 22 ICU from 12 countries, 300 patients treated with meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam were enrolled. From these patients, 179 patients were enrolled in the SMARRT study and 121 belonged to similar PK studies. Most of the patients were male, with a mean age of 61.1 years, had respiratory or intra-abdominal infections, and were intubated (79.3%) and receiving vasopressors (70%) on the days of the study. Overall, the most prescribed RRT modality was CVVHDF (48.3%). The median antibiotic daily dose was 3 g for meropenem and 12/1.5 g for piperacillin/tazobactam; in 67% of the cases, these drugs were prescribed as short infusions (< 1 h) and in 33% as extended/continuous infusions. Trough concentrations were below the clinical breakpoints for meropenem and piperacillin (2 and 16 mg/L, respectively) in 1.3% of the cases for meropenem and in 4% of the cases for piperacillin. Conversely, 18.5% of the patients receiving meropenem had concentrations above 20 mg/L (10 × clinical breakpoint) and 1.5% above 45 mg/L (specified toxicity threshold). For piperacillin, 11% of the patients had concentrations > 160 mg/L (10 × clinical breakpoint and specified toxicity breakpoint).

### Therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose optimisation of piperacillin and meropenem: a randomised controlled trial [^1148ZSq2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antibiotics (AB) in critically ill patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) could overcome this variability and increase PK target attainment. The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of a dose-adaption strategy based on daily TDM on target attainment.

Methods

This was a prospective, partially blinded, and randomised controlled trial in patients with normal kidney function treated with meropenem (MEM) or piperacillin/tazobactam (PTZ). The intervention group underwent daily TDM, with dose adjustment when necessary. The predefined PK/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target was 100% fT > 4MIC [percentage of time during a dosing interval that the free (f) drug concentration exceeded 4 times the MIC]. The control group received conventional treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients that reached 100% fT > 4MIC and 100% fT > MIC at 72 h.

Results

Forty-one patients (median age 56 years) were included in the study. Pneumonia was the primary infectious diagnosis. At baseline, 100% fT > 4MIC was achieved in 21% of the PTZ patients and in none of the MEM patients; 100% fT > MIC was achieved in 71% of the PTZ patients and 46% of the MEM patients. Of the patients in the intervention group, 76% needed dose adaptation, and five required an additional increase. At 72 h, target attainment rates for 100% fT > 4MIC and 100% fT > MIC were higher in the intervention group: 58 vs. 16%, p = 0.007 and 95 vs. 68%, p = 0.045, respectively.

Conclusions

Among critically ill patients with normal kidney function, a strategy of dose adaptation based on daily TDM led to an increase in PK/PD target attainment compared to conventional dosing.

### Pharmacokinetics of meropenem in septic patients on sustained low-efficiency dialysis: a population pharmacokinetic study [^114TGvnk]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Setting

This was a prospective, observational population PK study. Patients were recruited between July 2013 and November 2014 in the Department of Intensive Care Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany. Ethics approval was obtained from the local ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained either from the patient or their appointed legal guardian. The study was registered at clincialtrials.gov (NCT02287493).

Study population

Patients aged > 18 years treated with meropenem and receiving SLED during daytime were eligible for study inclusion.

Dosing, administration and data collection

Dosing was at the discretion of the treating physician with various doses of 0.5 g, 1 g or 2 g of meropenem (Dr. Friedrich Eberth Arzneimittel GmbH, Germany) administered intravenously over 30 minutes 8-hourly.

Demographic data and clinical variables such as residual diuresis, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, modified sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on the first day of sampling, simplified acute physiology (SAPS II) score on ICU admission, as well as laboratory variables, such as liver enzymes, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), were collected. Patient outcome data including ICU length of stay as well as ICU mortality were documented.

Sustained low-efficiency dialysis

SLED was performed with the Genius® batch system (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) using a Fresenius FX 60 filter (surface area 1.4 m 2, Fresenius Medical Care). Blood/dialysate and ultrafiltration flow rates as well as the duration of SLED were recorded.

### Meropenem and piperacillin / tazobactam optimised dosing regimens for critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy [^111beHK6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this research are its multi-centre design and the rich PK sampling that has led to the development and validation of robust population PK models for each drug. Furthermore, dosing recommendations consider standard versus high concentration targets for efficacy as well as toxicity and are based on clinical variables that are easily identifiable at the bedside. Finally, our recommendations align with the current treatment guidelines for septic patients, particularly the Surviving Sepsis Campaign initiative which endorses the use of extended/continuous beta-lactam infusions over short infusions. They are also consistent with the results of the BLING III randomised clinical trial (n = 7000 septic patients) and the associated systematic review and meta-analysis that showed better survival and clinical cure rates with extended/continuous beta-lactam infusions, even though only a small proportion of patients received RRT during the study. The study limitations include the fact that the population PK models were developed with data from critically ill patients receiving continuous RRT or SLED, for which dosing recommendations should be extrapolated with caution to patients undergoing other RRT modalities or settings, including those concurrently receiving extracorporeal therapies such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Further, there were limited numbers of patients who were morbidly obese or cachectic critically ill patients, and caution is also advised in these scenarios. Further, our results are based on plasma concentrations, that may not represent infection site PK, especially in the context of haemodynamic instability in patients with septic shock. However, current evidence on organ and tissue distribution suggests that maintaining high trough/average steady-state concentrations in plasma enhances distribution to organs and peripheral tissues, for which dosing strategies that optimise plasma exposure may also improve antibiotic distribution at the infection site. Finally, due to the observational nature of our data, the clinical effect of these optimised dosing recommendations is uncertain and should be evaluated in a randomised clinical trial.

In conclusion, this study provides optimised dosing regimens for meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam in critically ill patients receiving diverse RRT prescriptions. Daily dosing is dependent on the target concentration and the main PK determinants in this population, namely RRT intensity, 24-h urine output, and RRT duration in the case of SLED. As described in the dosing nomogram, extended/continuous infusions facilitate the achievement of optimised antibiotic concentrations in most clinical scenarios, resulting in lower daily doses and a reduced risk of exposure-related toxicity.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of SBP, antibiotic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that healthcare-associated and nosocomial spontaneous bacterial infections are more likely to harbor resistance to antibiotics. Administer piperacillin/tazobactam in areas with a low prevalence of multidrug resistance and carbapenem in areas with a high prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Combine carbapenem with glycopeptides or daptomycin or linezolid in areas with a high prevalence of Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) — empiric antimicrobial therapy and resistance considerations emphasize early, targeted treatment and resistance-aware selection. Delayed administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with increased mortality. Systematic reviews report multidrug-resistant pathogens in nosocomial SBP at 30–66% and higher third-generation cephalosporin resistance in nosocomial versus community settings, with nosocomial SBP having higher resistance risk (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14–2.44; p = 0.008). For healthcare-associated SBP, carbapenem-based empirical therapy showed lower mortality and treatment failure than third-generation cephalosporin regimens (6% vs 25%; p = 0.01, 18% vs 51%; p = 0.001) and better cost effectiveness. Accordingly, "we recommend limiting the use of third-generation cephalosporins in the initial empirical treatment to low-risk community-acquired SBP patients in the setting of low prevalence of drug resistance", and "Active agents against ESBL-producing pathogen (Carbapenems) should be considered for the empirical treatment of healthcare-associated SBP". In high-risk critically ill or nosocomial cases, a "tailored approach… covering resistant pathogens (ESBL, MRSA, ± VRE) would be best suited", with de-escalation after cultures since "antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the narrowest spectrum based on organism sensitivities".

### Ertapenem sodium [^111uKSCJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of ertapenem in patients with hepatic impairment have not been established. However, ertapenem does not appear to undergo hepatic metabolism based on in vitro studies and approximately 10% of an administered dose is recovered in the feces [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Gender

The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of ertapenem was evaluated in healthy male (n = 8) and healthy female (n = 8) subjects. The differences observed could be attributed to body size when body weight was taken into consideration. No dose adjustment is recommended based on gender.

Geriatric Patients

The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of ertapenem was evaluated in healthy male (n = 7) and healthy female (n = 7) subjects ≥ 65 years of age. The total and unbound AUC increased 37% and 67%, respectively, in elderly adults relative to young adults. These changes were attributed to age-related changes in creatinine clearance. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients with normal (for their age) renal function.

Pediatric Patients

Plasma concentrations of ertapenem are comparable in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age and adults following a 1 g once daily I.V. dose.

### Ertapenem-induced encephalopathy in a patient with liver abscess and acute kidney injury [^111T5vTj]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Case presentation

A man in his late 70s, retired and independent, generally fit and well with a history of normal cognitive function baseline. He presented in our A&E with a cough, shortness of breath, and a new oxygen requirement. A review of the system did not reveal any headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and dysuria. Initial investigation in table 1 showed raised inflammatory markers and acute kidney injury. His chest radiograph showed right basal consolidation. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia in the A&E. The patient initially had acute renal failure with an eGFR (Estimated glomerular filtration rate) of 32 mL/min/1.73 m 2. He had a penicillin allergy; hence, he was started with teicoplanin 1 g with a loading dose every 12 hours for 3 doses then one time a day (penicillin allergy) and clarithromycin 500 mg two times a day as per hospital policy (see table 2). On day 3, the patient had deteriorated and developed into septic shock. A CT abdomen and pelvis revealed liver abscess within segments 7 and 8 (see figure 1). The antibiotics were escalated to meropenem 1 g three times a day with an eGFR of 38 mL/min/1.73 m 2 while waiting for the rest of the investigation to exclude the cause of the liver abscess (see table 3) The dose of meropenem was further adjusted to renal dose to 1 g two times a day as eGFR still not improving at 39 mL/min/1.73 m 2. His 2D echo revealed an ejection fraction between 50% and 55%, the aortic valve is tri-leaflet and there is mild focal calcification. A blood culture was sent but no growth. He was seen by endocrine for hyperthyroidism (see table 1) and was started on carbimazole 10 mg one time a day. On day 15, the patient was clinically improving and acute kidney injury improved with an eGFR of 58 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Meropenem was subsequently switched to ertapenem 1 g one time a day as per microbiologist advice in preparation for outpatient antibiotic treatment (OPAT) to complete a total of 6 weeks duration (table 3). On the seventeenth hospital day, the patient started to experience night-time delirium, decrease orientation, insomnia, loss of appetite, jerking, as well as a hallucination. He has been placed on hospital non-pharmacological delirium precautions with the goal of maintaining his sleep-wake cycle. He was started on midodrine 2.5 mg three times a day for postural hypotension. Our mental health and liaison services (MHLS) input was noted, and the patient was placed on a delirium pathway. The patient received his first dose of haloperidol and lorazepam 12 days after ertapenem was started (see table 3).

### Role of renal function in risk assessment of target non-attainment after standard dosing of meropenem in critically ill patients: a prospective observational study [^1163YZ4o]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe bacterial infections remain a major challenge in intensive care units because of their high prevalence and mortality. Adequate antibiotic exposure has been associated with clinical success in critically ill patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the target attainment of standard meropenem dosing in a heterogeneous critically ill population, to quantify the impact of the full renal function spectrum on meropenem exposure and target attainment, and ultimately to translate the findings into a tool for practical application.

Methods

A prospective observational single-centre study was performed with critically ill patients with severe infections receiving standard dosing of meropenem. Serial blood samples were drawn over 4 study days to determine meropenem serum concentrations. Renal function was assessed by creatinine clearance according to the Cockcroft and Gault equation (CLCR CG). Variability in meropenem serum concentrations was quantified at the middle and end of each monitored dosing interval. The attainment of two pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets (100%T > MIC, 50%T > 4×MIC) was evaluated for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 2 mg/L and 8 mg/L and standard meropenem dosing (1000 mg, 30-minute infusion, every 8 h). Furthermore, we assessed the impact of CLCR CG on meropenem concentrations and target attainment and developed a tool for risk assessment of target non-attainment.

Results

Large inter- and intra-patient variability in meropenem concentrations was observed in the critically ill population (n = 48). Attainment of the target 100%T > MIC was merely 48.4% and 20.6%, given MIC values of 2 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively, and similar for the target 50%T > 4×MIC. A hyperbolic relationship between CLCR CG (25–255 ml/minute) and meropenem serum concentrations at the end of the dosing interval (C 8h) was derived. For infections with pathogens of MIC 2 mg/L, mild renal impairment up to augmented renal function was identified as a risk factor for target non-attainment (for MIC 8 mg/L, additionally, moderate renal impairment).

Conclusions

The investigated standard meropenem dosing regimen appeared to result in insufficient meropenem exposure in a considerable fraction of critically ill patients. An easy- and free-to-use tool (the MeroRisk Calculator) for assessing the risk of target non-attainment for a given renal function and MIC value was developed.

### A model-based approach to assess unstable creatinine clearance in critically ill patients [^113Gx6Lq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Creatinine clearance is an important tool to describe the renal elimination of drugs in pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations and clinical practice. In critically ill patients, unstable kidney function invalidates the steady-state assumption underlying equations, such as Cockcroft-Gault. Although measured creatinine clearance (mCrCL) is often used in nonsteady-state situations, it assumes that observed data are error-free, neglecting frequently occurring errors in urine collection. In contrast, compartmental nonlinear mixed effects models of creatinine allow to describe dynamic changes in kidney function while explicitly accounting for a residual error associated with observations. Based on 530 serum and 373 urine creatinine observations from 138 critically ill patients, a one-compartment creatinine model with zero-order creatinine generation rate (CGR) and first-order CrCL was evaluated. An autoregressive approach for interoccasion variability provided a distinct model improvement compared to a classical approach (Δ Akaike information criterion (AIC) -49.0). Fat-free mass, plasma urea concentration, age, and liver transplantation were significantly related to CrCL, whereas weight and sex were linked to CGR. The model-based CrCL estimates were superior to standard approaches to estimate CrCL (or glomerular filtration rate) including Cockcroft-Gault, mCrCL, four-variable modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD), six-variable MDRD, and chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration as a covariate to describe cefepime and meropenem PKs in terms of objective function value. In conclusion, a dynamic model of creatinine kinetics provides the means to estimate actual CrCL despite dynamic changes in kidney function, and it can easily be incorporated into population PK evaluations.

### The combined effects of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and renal replacement therapy on meropenem pharmacokinetics: a matched cohort study [^11121Wdc]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study provides preliminary evidence that standard meropenem dosing (1 g IV 8-hourly) as an intermittent bolus infusion in ECMO patients is likely to result in drug concentrations sufficient to treat highly susceptible Gram-negative pathogens. Conventional-dose meropenem should achieve a time over minimal inhibitory concentration (T > MIC) of 100%, assuming a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 mg/L (the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). However, when treating less susceptible P. aeruginosa (MIC 90 8 mg/L) and Acinetobacter species (MIC 90 16 mg/L) higher meropenem doses would have to be considered especially in patients with elevated CrCL. Given that, patients on ECMO have decreased CL in most cases, standard dosing is likely to achieve target plasma concentrations in most patients. This is important considering the potential clinical and bacteriological benefits of maintaining 100% T > MIC in critically ill patients.

This study uses meropenem plasma concentration data from four different patient populations to perform robust dosing simulations and to provide preliminary insights into the incremental effects of critical illness, ECMO and RRT on meropenem PK. The plasma concentrations observed in ECMO patients reflect a balance between the independent alterations in Vd and CL that occur in the presence of critical illness, organ failures and ECMO. Interestingly in this study, routinely targeted meropenem plasma concentrations (> 2 mg/L) were maintained with standard dosing, both in ECMO patients on RRT and those with preserved renal function. However, plasma meropenem concentrations were significantly higher in the RRT group when compared to patients with preserved renal function. This is important as standard dose adjustments for renal impairment (for example IV 500 mg 8-hourly or 1 g 12-hourly) in these patients receiving RRT may potentially result in under dosing. Equally, use of higher than standard doses may precipitate the risk of toxicity. Therapeutic drug monitoring where available may further improve the safety and efficacy of meropenem dosing during ECMO.

### Clinical and microbiological efficacy of continuous versus intermittent application of meropenem in critically ill patients: a randomized open-label controlled trial [^113j78KL]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

In multivariate logistic analysis, the number of antibiotics given before the start of meropenem (OR = 0.478; 95% CI = 0.323 to 0,706; P = 0.0002) and the age (OR = 0.947; 95% CI = 0.917 to 0.973; P = 0.0001) were negatively associated with clinical success of meropenem therapy. Continuous administration of meropenem was independently related to the microbiological success (OR = 2.977; 95% CI = 1.050 to 8.443; P = 0.040). Predictors of microbiological failure were the abdominal infection (OR = 0.249; 95% CI = 0.092 to 0,674; P = 0.006) and the number of antibiotics given before the start of meropenem (OR = 0.581; 95% CI = 0.383 to 0.881; P = 0.011). The performance of the final multivariate logistic models for clinical and microbiological outcome was good (Lemeshow-Hosmer goodness-of fit test for clinical and microbiological outcome with P = 0.63 and P = 0.53, respectively), and discriminated reasonably well between success and failure of meropenem therapy. The area under the ROC curve for clinical and microbiological outcome was 0.80, and 0.78, correctly predicting clinical and microbiological outcome (82.97% and 85.3%, respectively).

Possible meropenem-related clinical adverse events were rare and the rate in both groups did not differ (Additional file 4, Table S4). In laboratory parameters related to the safety of meropenem, we observed no difference between groups, although there was considerable increase in concentration of ALP at EOT in both groups against the baseline. The platelet count rose in the Bolus group significantly (Additional file 5, Table S5).

### Meropenem and piperacillin / tazobactam prescribing in critically ill patients: does augmented renal clearance affect pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic target attainment when extended infusions are used? [^1138596j]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infection is a well-recognized but persisting problem in critical care medicine. Sepsis alone is the leading cause of mortality in non-cardiac intensive care units (ICUs), with up to 30% of patients dying within 1 month of diagnosis. Adequate antibiotic therapy is one of the mainstays in treatment, with the emphasis on timely administration and appropriateness of the spectrum. Optimizing antibiotic exposure is highly important as well, however, this is proving to be a greater challenge with recent data showing that antibiotic concentrations in critically ill patients are highly variable, unpredictable and commonly sub-optimal.

Antibiotic dosing regimens are usually determined in healthy adults with normal physiology or non-critically ill hospitalized patients. Both the volume of distribution and clearance are the key determinants of the pharmacokinetics of a drug. Unfortunately, pathophysiological changes in critically ill patients have a profound effect on both.

One of these pathophysiological changes is the development of augmented renal clearance (ARC). This is a phenomenon in which renal elimination of circulating molecules - including antibiotics - is enhanced. This, in turn, may lead to sub-therapeutic concentrations of time-dependent antibiotics such as β-lactam antibiotics, potentially causing therapeutic failure and selection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Critically ill patients are at risk for ARC, because of their pathophysiological disturbances, as well as the clinical interventions administered. The incidence of ARC in critically ill patients is high and varies between 30% and 85% depending on the studied population and the definition of ARC.

One study has demonstrated the relationship between renal clearance and low antibiotic concentrations, but the relationship between renal clearance and β-lactam pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics has not been evaluated in a large cohort of patients. However, various pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation studies have suggested that using extended infusions will prevent low antibiotic exposure. However, this has never been tested in a large cohort of relevant patients with ARC. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of renal clearance on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment when the antibiotic was administered as an extended infusion. Both the minimum target (50% f T > MIC), as well as the target of 100% f T > MIC which is considered to have higher bactericidal activity were calculated. Notably this study enrolled patients without renal dysfunction, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) assessed by the MDRD equation of < 80 mL/min.

RESULTS

Patient Demographics

There were 180 enrollments: 96 participants received cefepime, 50 received meropenem, and 34 received piperacillin-tazobactam. Of these, 133 were unique participants (Supplementary Table 1); 34 were enrolled on more than 1 occasion, as allowed per protocol. The majority of participants were White and non-Hispanic (> 90%; Supplementary Table 2). As expected, there was a substantial age difference among participants, as children < 17 years of age represented only 6% of meropenem cases and 15% of piperacillin-tazobactam ones (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). There were small differences in median height, total body weight, and LBW; however, body surface area and BMI did not differ among antibiotic groups (Supplementary Table 3). Nearly all participants had at least 1 copy of the DF508 mutation: 95% in the cefepime group, 96% in the meropenem group, and 97% in the piperacillin-tazobactam group. Participants receiving meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam had more CF-related complications, such as CF-related diabetes, hepatic disease, pancreatic insufficiency, and ≥ 10 pulmonary exacerbations in the previous 2 years (Supplementary Table 4). As expected, the most common bacteria identified on sputum culture were Staphylococcus aureus and P aeruginosa. Many of these isolates exhibited resistance to the drugs of interest, highlighting the need for maximizing antibiotic exposure in this population (Supplementary Table 5).

### Impact of cumulative fluid balance on the pharmacokinetics of extended infusion meropenem in critically ill patients with sepsis [^115bqmSV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This prospective study was conducted at the Department of Surgery, of University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Králové, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.

Ethics statement

The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964), including later amendments. The experimental protocol and informed consent were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. The patients or their legal guardians signed informed consent before participating in the study.

Patients and treatments

Critically ill patients admitted to the surgical ICU of the University Hospital in Hradec Králové were enrolled between 2013 and 2018. All patients suffered from a severe infection, were > 18 years of age and were not hypersensitive to meropenem. Subjects were excluded from the study if they showed evidence of chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, acute renal failure, were under renal replacement therapy, or if their stay in ICU was short (< 24 h).

Eligible patients received 1 g (n = 3) or 2 g (n = 22) meropenem in a 3-h i.v. infusion every 8 h. Early goal-directed fluid therapy with i.v. balanced crystalloids was initiated and continued if the patients remained fluid responsive. Daily fluid balance (DFB) was calculated as the difference between fluid intake and output. The cumulative fluid balance (CFB) was obtained as a sum of the DFBs. The cutoff value of 10 for the percent ratio of day one DFB to the body weight at the admission time to the ICU was used as a threshold for categorization of patients into the groups with fluid overload (FO) or without (NoFO).

Noradrenaline was administered to those patients who remained hypotensive (MAP < 65 mm Hg) despite the initial fluid resuscitation. Low-dose furosemide was used to prevent long-term fluid overload. Its dose was titrated up in patients with signs of oliguria. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were used to evaluate morbidity and to predict the outcome of septic patients.

### Clinical review: balancing the therapeutic, safety, and economic issues underlying effective antipseudomonal carbapenem use [^113BuK1j]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Antipseudomonal carbapenems have played a useful role in our antimicrobial armamentarium for 20 years. However, a review of their use during that period creates concern that their clinical effectiveness is critically dependent on attainment of an appropriate dosing range. Unfortunately, adequate carbapenem dosing is missed for many reasons, including benefit/risk misconceptions, a narrow therapeutic window for imipenem and meropenem (due to an increased rate of seizures at higher doses), increasingly resistant pathogens requiring higher doses than are typically given, and cost containment issues that may limit their use. To improve the use of carbapenems, several initiatives should be considered: increase awareness about appropriate treatment with carbapenems across hospital departments; determine optimal dosing regimens for settings where multidrug resistant organisms are more likely encountered; use of, or combination with, an alternative antimicrobial agent having more favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, or adverse event profile; and administer a newer carbapenem with lower propensity for resistance development (for example, reduced expression of efflux pumps or greater stability against carbapenemases).

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infection — carbapenem preference and extrapolation: In those with clinical isolates available for retesting, 30-day mortality occurred in 9% vs 4% in the piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem arms, respectively, and although the 95% confidence interval ranged from −1% to 11%, the panel still suggests carbapenem therapy as the preferred treatment of ESBL-producing bloodstream infections. Comparable clinical trial data are not available for ESBL-E infections from other body sites, but the panel suggests extrapolating evidence for ESBL-E bloodstream infections to other common sites of infection, and suggests extending the findings to imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem, with the latter limited to patients with normal serum albumin and patients who are not critically ill.

Randomization and Masking

Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 according to a central randomization schedule, using a block size of 4, to receive either ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg of ceftazidime and 500 mg of avibactam as a 2-hour intravenous infusion every 8 hours), followed by metronidazole (500 mg as a 60-minute intravenous infusion every 8 hours); or meropenem (1000 mg as a 30-minute intravenous infusion every 8 hours). A double-dummy design was used, with patients receiving matching placebo as appropriate. All study treatments were administered for 5–14 days.

Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline (estimated Cockcroft-Gault–calculated creatinine clearance [CrCl], > 30 to ≤ 50 mL/min) received a reduced dose of ceftazidime-avibactam (1000 mg of ceftazidime and 250 mg of avibactam in a 2-hour intravenous infusion every 12 hours), or meropenem 1000 mg, 30-minute infusion every 12 hours was given. No adjustment for renal impairment was necessary for metronidazole.

After ≥ 5 full days of intravenous study therapy, treatment could be discontinued if patients showed clinical improvement. If Enterococcus species or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was suspected or isolated, open-label vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin could be added to either regimen, according to the investigator's discretion. Antifungal therapy was not permitted. Study protocols were designed to minimize potential for prior use of other antibiotics that may confound assessment of the treatment effect (see). Patients receiving systemic antibacterial therapy during the 72-hour period before study entry were enrolled only if they had a new infection (with ≤ 24 hours of therapy and ≤ 1 dose administered postoperatively ≤ 6 hours after the procedure), or were considered to have failed previous treatment (with ≥ 72 hours of therapy of inadequate therapy and requirement for operative intervention). Studies were stratified by baseline disease severity, based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (≤ 10 or > 10 to ≤ 30), and by region (North America and Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the rest of the world).

### Meropenem and piperacillin / tazobactam prescribing in critically ill patients: does augmented renal clearance affect pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic target attainment when extended infusions are used? [^112f3EE6]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Correct antibiotic dosing remains a challenge for the clinician. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of augmented renal clearance on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment in critically ill patients receiving meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, administered as an extended infusion.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational, pharmacokinetic study executed at the medical and surgical intensive care unit at a large academic medical center. Elegible patients were adult patients without renal dysfunction receiving meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam as an extended infusion. Serial blood samples were collected to describe the antibiotic pharmacokinetics. Urine samples were taken from a 24-hour collection to measure creatinine clearance. Relevant data were drawn from the electronic patient file and the intensive care information system.

Results

We obtained data from 61 patients and observed extensive pharmacokinetic variability. Forty-eight percent of the patients did not achieve the desired pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target (100% fT > MIC), of which almost 80% had a measured creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that high creatinine clearance was an independent predictor of not achieving the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target. Seven out of nineteen patients (37%) displaying a creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min did not achieve the minimum pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target of 50% fT > MIC.

Conclusions

In this large patient cohort, we observed significant variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment in critically ill patients. A large proportion of the patients without renal dysfunction, most of whom displayed a creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min, did not achieve the desired pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target, even with the use of alternative administration methods. Consequently, these patients may be at risk for treatment failure without dose up-titration.

### Pharmacokinetics of meropenem in septic patients on sustained low-efficiency dialysis: a population pharmacokinetic study [^111Z7ygR]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, we observed a relevant PK variability for meropenem in patients on SLED, which was significantly influenced by the degree of residual diuresis. As a result the given dosing recommendations for meropenem in patients on SLED to achieve adequate PD targets greatly vary. Patients with high residual diuresis, proven or suspected pathogens strains at and below the resistance breakpoint as well as aggressive PD targets require the maximum approved dosages. Further studies are required to validate our findings.

Given the high variability of meropenem PK under RRT and bacterial susceptibility, therapeutic drug monitoring may help to further optimise individual meropenem dosing in clinical practice.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous meropenem and tobramycin versus ceftazidime and tobramycin in cystic fibrosis [^1129YG28]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by chronic bacterial broncho-pulmonary infection. Although intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic therapy is regarded as standard treatment in CF, only few randomised trials comparing different antibiotic compounds exist.

Methods

We report on a prospective multicenter interventional trial of i.v. meropenem (120 mg/kg/day) or i.v. ceftazidime (200–400 mg/kg/day), each administered together with i.v. tobramycin (9–12 mg/kg/day). Outcome measures were changes in lung function, microbiological sputum burden and blood inflammatory marker. Liver and renal function values were measured to assess safety.

Results

One hundred eighteen patients (59/59) were included into the study with the following indications: first infection of P. aeruginosa (n = 6), acute pulmonary exacerbation (n = 34) and suppression therapy of chronic P. aeruginosa colonization (n = 78). Both treatments improved lung function measures, bacterial sputum burden and CRP levels with no differences between treatment groups observed. A significant higher elevation for alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.0001) was observed for patients in the meropenem/tobramycin group.

Conclusions

i.v. antibiotic therapy in CF patients with meropenem/tobramycin is as effective as with ceftazidime/tobramycin regarding lung function, microbiological sputum burden and systemic inflammatory status. Hepato-biliary function should be monitored carefully during i.v. treatment, possibly important in CF patients with pre-existing liver disease.

### Meropenem and piperacillin / tazobactam optimised dosing regimens for critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy [^112N69gZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our simulations consistently show that meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam dosing requirements are strongly dependent on RRT intensity, urine output, and, in the case of SLED, RRT duration. For all the scenarios, extended/continuous infusions (after a full initial loading dose if therapy with meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam is being initiated) are more likely to achieve effective unbound concentrations for empirically treating Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa compared to equivalents dose given as a short 30-min infusion. This is especially important for patients with higher CL, i.e. those receiving RRT with higher intensities, longer SLED sessions, and/or with urine outputs ≥ 100–500 mL/24 h. Where higher unbound concentrations are targeted (4 × MIC), continuous infusion provides the highest likelihood of effective and safe dosing. Conversely, for treating bacteria with lower MICs, short 30-min infusions had similar target attainment to extended/continuous infusions.

Tables 2 and 3 provide the dosing nomograms for meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam for standard and high targets stratified by modality, intensity, and urine output. The recommended doses are the ones that optimise effective concentrations and minimise the risk of toxic concentrations. Figure 1 schematises the dosing decision-making algorithm.

### Pharmacokinetic properties and stability of continuous-infusion meropenem in adults with cystic fibrosis [^115kUGH7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Meropenem is commonly used to treat lung infections in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although continuous infusion is the ideal method to maximize the pharmacodynamic properties of this betalactam antibiotic, meropenem is stable for only approximately 4 to 6 hours at room temperature, and its pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, when administered by continuous infusion to patients with CF, are largely unknown.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine the PK properties and stability of meropenem when administered to adults with CF by a continuous ambulatory drug-delivery infusion pump stored in a cold pouch between 2 freezer packs.

Methods

This open-label, multidose, randomized, crossover PK study was conducted at the Clinical Research Center at Hartford Hospital (Hartford, Connecticut). Adults aged ≥ 18 years with CF were eligible. Study participants were randomized to receive meropenem 125 mg/h or 250 mg/h (equivalent to 3 g and 6 g, respectively, over 24 hours) by continuous IV infusion for 12 hours. Serum samples were collected throughout the infusion and then for 6 hours after infusion to determine the PK properties (volume of distribution [V(d)], elimination rate constant, total body clearance [CL], terminal half-life [t 1/2], and steady-state concentration [C(ss)]). Serum meropenem concentrations were assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography, and PK profiles were determined using compartmental analysis. Meropenem stability was ascertained by sampling the drug directly from the infusion pump at prespecified time points. Meropenem tolerability was assessed throughout the study by questioning subjects on how they felt. In addition, laboratory values of serum chemistries and liver enzymes were compared with baseline values.

Results

Seven adult volunteers with CF (4 women, 3 men; mean [SD] age, 27 [10] years [range, 19–46 years]) participated in the study. Mean (SD) C(ss) values were 8.31 (0.68) mg/L and 18.50 (3.31) mg/L for the 125-mg/h and 250-mg/h infusion rates, respectively. V(d), CL, and t 1/2 were dose independent and similar between the 2 infusion rates. Meropenem stability was maintained over 12 and 24 hours. Meropenem by continuous infusion was well tolerated. One patient complained of a headache during the study.

Conclusions

In this study of adults with CF, meropenem infusion rates of 125 mg/h and 250 mg/h provided serum drug concentrations greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration for pathogens considered meropenem susceptible (≤ 4 microg/mL) and intermediately resistant (8 microg/mL), respectively.

### New developments in carbapenems [^111JqwqA]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative pathogens in hospitals is a growing threat to patients and is driving the increased use of carbapenems. Carbapenems are potent members of the beta-lactam family of antibiotics, with a history of safety and efficacy for serious infections that exceeds 20 years. Original and review articles were identified from a Medline search (1979–2008). Reference citations from identified publications, abstracts from the Interscience Conferences on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and package inserts were also used. Carbapenems are effective in treating severe infections at diverse sites, with relatively low resistance rates and a favourable safety profile. Carbapenems are the beta-lactams of choice for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Optimized dosing of carbapenems should limit the emergence of resistance and prolong the utility of these agents. The newly approved doripenem should prove to be a valuable addition to the currently available carbapenems: imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem.

### Population pharmacokinetic analysis of meropenem after intravenous infusion in Korean patients with acute infections [^114noDNr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to investigate the population pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of meropenem in Korean patients with acute infections.

Methods

The study included 37 patients with a creatinine clearance ≤ 50 or > 50 mL/min who received a 500- or 1000-mg dose of meropenem, respectively, infused intravenously over 1 hour every 8 hours. Blood samples were collected before and at 1, 1.5, and 5 hours after the start of the fourth infusion. The population PK analysis was conducted by using nonlinear mixed effect modeling software (NONMEM). Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to identify optimal dosing regimens.

Findings

Thirty-seven subjects completed the study. Meropenem PK variables were well described by using a one-compartment model. The typical values (relative SE) for weight-normalized clearance (CL) and V d were 0.266 L/h/kg (12.29%) and 0.489 L/kg (11.01%), respectively. Meropenem CL was significantly influenced by the serum creatinine level, which explained 11% of the interindividual CK variability. The proposed equation to estimate meropenem CL in Korean patients was as follows: CL (L/h) = 0.266 × weight × [serum creatinine/0.74] -1.017. The simulation results indicate that the current meropenem dosing regimen may be suboptimal in patients infected with normal or augmented renal function.

Implications

Prolonged infusions of meropenem over at least 2 hours should be considered, especially in patients with augmented renal function and those infected with pathogens for which the minimum inhibitory meropenem concentration is > 1 μg/mL. Our results suggest an individualized meropenem dosing regimen for patients with abnormal renal function and those infected with pathogens with decreased in vitro susceptibility.

5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

As with other antibiotics, prolonged use of Ertapenem for injection may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Prescribing Ertapenem for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

5.7 Laboratory Tests

While Ertapenem for injection possesses toxicity similar to the beta-lactam group of antibiotics, periodic assessment of organ system function, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic, is advisable during prolonged therapy.

### Assessing clinician utilization of next-generation antibiotics against resistant Gram-Negative infections in U.S. hospitals: a retrospective cohort study [^113pWbDM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The U.S. antibiotic market failure has threatened future innovation and supply. Understanding when and why clinicians underutilize recently approved gram-negative antibiotics might help prioritize the patient in future antibiotic development and potential market entry rewards.

Objective

To determine use patterns of recently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved gram-negative antibiotics (ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, plazomicin, eravacycline, imipenem-relebactam-cilastatin, and cefiderocol) and identify factors associated with their preferential use (over traditional generic agents) in patients with gram-negative infections due to pathogens displaying difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR; that is, resistance to all first-line antibiotics).

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

619 U.S. hospitals.

Participants

Adult inpatients.

Measurements

Quarterly percentage change in antibiotic use was calculated using weighted linear regression. Machine learning selected candidate variables, and mixed models identified factors associated with new (vs. traditional) antibiotic use in DTR infections.

Results

Between quarter 1 of 2016 and quarter 2 of 2021, ceftolozane-tazobactam (approved 2014) and ceftazidime-avibactam (2015) predominated new antibiotic usage whereas subsequently approved gram-negative antibiotics saw relatively sluggish uptake. Among gram-negative infection hospitalizations, 0.7% (2551 [2631 episodes] of 362142) displayed DTR pathogens. Patients were treated exclusively using traditional agents in 1091 of 2631 DTR episodes (41.5%), including "reserve" antibiotics such as polymyxins, aminoglycosides, and tigecycline in 865 of 1091 episodes (79.3%). Patients with bacteremia and chronic diseases had greater adjusted probabilities and those with do-not-resuscitate status, acute liver failure, and Acinetobacter baumannii complex and other nonpseudomonal nonfermenter pathogens had lower adjusted probabilities of receiving newer (vs. traditional) antibiotics for DTR infections, respectively. Availability of susceptibility testing for new antibiotics increased probability of usage.

Limitation

Residual confounding.

Conclusion

Despite FDA approval of 7 next-generation gram-negative antibiotics between 2014 and 2019, clinicians still frequently treat resistant gram-negative infections with older, generic antibiotics with suboptimal safety-efficacy profiles. Future antibiotics with innovative mechanisms targeting untapped pathogen niches, widely available susceptibility testing, and evidence demonstrating improved outcomes in resistant infections might enhance utilization.

Breakpoints for Different Infusion Durations Based on Monte Carlo Simulations

EI of cefepime achieved higher PTAs than standard infusion across all age groups (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2, Supplementary Figure 3). The epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) for cefepime and P aeruginosa is 8 mg/L; up to this MIC, isolates are considered part of the wild type distribution. The EI regimen reached the 65% f T > MIC target for all age groups and 2× the ECOFF (16 mg/L). The standard infusion regimen met the 65% f T > MIC target only for participants aged ≥ 12 years at 1× the ECOFF (Table 1). Only the EI regimen was predicted to achieve the 100% f T > MIC target for the ECOFF and only for adults.

### Impact of cumulative fluid balance on the pharmacokinetics of extended infusion meropenem in critically ill patients with sepsis [^116Fkaaz]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Meropenem dosing for septic critically patients is difficult due to pathophysiological changes associated with sepsis as well as supportive symptomatic therapies. A prospective single-center study assessed whether fluid retention alters meropenem pharmacokinetics and the achievement of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets for efficacy.

Methods

Twenty-five septic ICU patients (19 m, 6f) aged 32–86 years with the mean APACHE II score of 20.2 (range 11–33), suffering mainly from perioperative intra-abdominal or respiratory infections and septic shock (n = 18), were investigated over three days after the start of extended 3-h i.v. infusions of meropenem q8h. Urinary creatinine clearance (CL cr) and cumulative fluid balance (CFB) were measured daily. Plasma meropenem was measured, and Bayesian estimates of PK parameters were calculated.

Results

Eleven patients (9 with peritonitis) were classified as fluid overload (FO) based on a positive day 1 CFB of more than 10% body weight. Compared to NoFO patients (n = 14, 11 with pneumonia), the FO patients had a lower meropenem clearance (CL me 8.5 ± 3.2 vs 11.5 ± 3.5 L/h), higher volume of distribution (V 1 14.9 ± 3.5 vs 13.5 ± 4.1 L) and longer half-life (t 1/2 1.4 ± 0.63 vs 0.92 ± 0.54 h) (p < 0.05). Over three days, the CFB of the FO patients decreased (11.7 ± 3.3 vs 6.7 ± 4.3 L, p < 0.05) and the PK parameters reached the values comparable with NoFO patients (CL me 12.4 ± 3.8 vs 11.5 ± 2.0 L/h, V 1 13.7 ± 2.0 vs 14.0 ± 5.1 L, t 1/2 0.81 ± 0.23 vs 0.87 ± 0.40 h). The CL cr and Cockroft-Gault CL cr were stable in time and comparable. The correlation with CL me was weak to moderate (CL cr, day 3 CGCL cr) or absent (day 1 and 2 CGCL cr). Dosing with 2 g meropenem q8h ensured adequate concentrations to treat infections with sensitive pathogens (MIC 2 mg/L). The proportion of pre-dose concentrations exceeding the MIC 8 mg/L and the fraction time with a target-exceeding concentration were higher in the FO group (day 1–3 f C min > MIC: 67 vs 27%, p < 0.001; day 1%f T > MIC: 79 ± 17 vs 58 ± 17, p < 0.05).

Conclusions

These findings emphasize the importance of TDM and a cautious approach to augmented maintenance dosing of meropenem to patients with FO infected with less susceptible pathogens, if guided by population covariate relationships between CL me and creatinine clearance.

### Tissue distribution of imipenem in critically ill patients [^1145fhiz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Methods

Imipenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used mainly for serious infections in critically ill patients. Because the infection originates mostly from a certain tissue, we assessed tissue concentrations of imipenem using microdialysis in patients in intensive care with serious infections compared with healthy volunteers. Most patients were > 60 years old and had renal failure; most patients also had impaired liver, heart, or lung function.

Results

Muscle and subcutaneous tissue concentrations in patients (maximum of 2.3 ± 1.5 microg/mL for both muscle and subcutaneous tissue) were significantly lower than those in healthy subjects (maximum of 12.8 ± 1.6 and 10.7 ± 1.0 microg/mL for muscle and subcutaneous tissue). The tissue distribution rate constants for muscle and subcutaneous tissue were also significantly lower in patients (1.95 ± 0.6 and 1.1 ± 0.2 h(-l), respectively) than in healthy subjects (5.2 ± 1.0 and 6.6 ± 1.7 h(-1), respectively), meaning that tissue distribution in patients was reduced and retarded. Values for area under the plasma concentration-time curve did not significantly differ between patients and healthy subjects (37.4 ± 5.9 microg. h/mL and 46.0 ± 4.4 microg. h/mL, respectively,) although the elimination of imipenem in patients was prolonged (clearance, 6.3 ± 0.8 L/h and 13.2 ± 1.4 L/h in patients and healthy subjects, respectively).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that the amount and velocity of imipenem tissue distribution in seriously ill patients is reduced compared with those values in healthy volunteers. Dose adjustments that are exclusively based on plasma concentration data may therefore be misleading and may result in potential underdosing.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of other infections (antibiotic therapy), EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to decide on the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy based on several factors, including environment (nosocomial versus healthcare-associated or community-acquired), local resistance profiles, severity, and type of infection.

### The combined effects of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and renal replacement therapy on meropenem pharmacokinetics: a matched cohort study [^115v8tSD]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Five (two VV, three VA) out of eleven ECMO patients received RRT. The other six patients (four VV, two VA) had no significant impairment in renal and hepatic functions, based on routine biochemical parameters. The indications for ECMO included pneumonia, septic shock (n = 7); cardiogenic shock (n = 2); sickle-cell crisis (n = 1); primary graft dysfunction post lung transplant (n = 1). The median sequential organ failure assessment scores were not significantly different between the controls and ECMO patients (7 vs. 13, respectively, P = 0.14). The demographic and clinical data are summarised in Table 1. Median time to PK sampling in ECMO patients was 2 days (1 to 7).

Meropenem concentrations and PK parameters in controls and ECMO patients

The median observed peak concentrations (C max) and trough meropenem concentrations (C min) in controls were 65.4 (58.7 to 74.4) mg/L and 4.2 (0.0 to 5.7) mg/L respectively. The ECMO group achieved a median C max of 55.3 (37.8 to 60.4) mg/L and a C min of 7.2 (4.0 to 17.2) mg/L; 10 out of 11 ECMO patients maintained a C min > 2 mg/L between doses. ECMO patients had a numerically higher, but non-statistically significant volume of distribution (0.45 ± 0.17 vs. 0.41 ± 0.13 L/kg, P = 0.21) and lower clearance compared to controls (7.9 ± 5.9 vs. 11.7 ± 6.5 L/h, P = 0.18). In ECMO patients, while trough meropenem concentrations of > 2 mg/L were achieved in all patients, a more aggressive strategy of > 8 mg/L targeting less susceptible microorganisms was maintained only in eight out of eleven patients, with five of them being on RRT.

### Meropenem-induced liver injury and β-lactam cross-reactivity [^117ViUvr]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 63-year-old man admitted to hospital for the management of a frontal lobe abscess developed elevated liver enzymes within 48hours of receiving meropenem. Liver enzymes reached a maximum at 5 days postadministration of meropenem, with alanine aminotransferase 1160 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 787 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 297 U/L and gamma-glutamyltransferase 252 U/L. Meropenem was ceased and liver function normalised. Meropenem was administered for a second time later in the patient's admission and again the patient developed rapidly increasing liver enzymes, with a mixed hepatocellular/cholestatic pattern. Other possible causes of liver injury were excluded following extensive investigations, and the patient's liver enzymes continued to normalise following meropenem discontinuation. The patient was asymptomatic during the admission and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. This case demonstrates that meropenem can cause severe liver injury and that early recognition of drug-induced liver injury is important.

### Pharmacokinetics of meropenem in septic patients on sustained low-efficiency dialysis: a population pharmacokinetic study [^115yQ7Fj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Not surprisingly, being on or off SLED had most impact on attaining target meropenem exposures in our model. The model fit further significantly increased by including the native clearance (CL N) linked to the residual diuresis. This is plausible since residual diuresis leads to additional meropenem elimination. This relationship has previously been shown by Ulldemolins et al.

Due to the design of the PK model, CL without SLED (CL NS) is composed of CL N (1.5 L/h) and CL D (2.6 L/h) and is higher than Christenssen et al. reported within patients with end stage renal disease (CL = 1.2 L/h). This may be related to the fact, that SLED in our clinical setting was sometimes used to maintain fluid balance rather than for solute clearance. Additionally, carrying over effects of previous CRRT sessions as well as non-steady state conditions in intervals without SLED could have influenced these CL. The central volume of distribution (V c) in our patients of 8.1 L (± 7.1) was in accordance with the data of Roberts et al. who found a V c of 7.9 L in septic patients.

Laboratory values were within normal limits except for liver function test values which were moderately elevated. The following day, the patient was initiated on a 10-day course of prednisone 40 mg daily and a 1-week course of oral. ciprofloxacin. Seven days later, the patient reported that his symptoms had improved and there was no evidence of skin or joint manifestations of the reaction; however, his liver transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels had further increased but then decreased 2 weeks later. The patient subsequently reported mild persisting arthralgias of the hips. shoulders and hands.

Approximately 5 weeks later, the arthralgias had resolved and liver profile improved. Serological tests for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus and diagnostic tests for immune complexes were negative. An in vitro lymphocyte cytotoxicity assay was performed which indicated the patient's cells were markedly more sensitive to meropenem.
