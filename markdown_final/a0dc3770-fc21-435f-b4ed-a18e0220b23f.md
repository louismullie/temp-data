## Question

How do you treat inner ear vertigo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat inner ear vertigo, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the underlying cause of vertigo because treatment is diagnosis-specific. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and bedside maneuvers that distinguish BPPV, Ménière's disease, and vestibular neuritis. Next, I will examine condition-specific treatments for BPPV, Ménière's disease, and vestibular neuritis, including when to escalate care. After that, I need to check the role of vestibular rehabilitation and when it helps versus when it is not indicated. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, safety counseling, and red flags that warrant urgent re-evaluation or imaging, and close with a concise synthesis of the treatment algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation, because "inner ear vertigo" is not a single entity and treatment hinges on identifying BPPV, Ménière's disease, or vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis. BPPV presents with brief, positional vertigo without hearing loss and is diagnosed with Dix-Hallpike or supine roll testing; Ménière's disease features recurrent vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours with fluctuating low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis causes prolonged severe vertigo with nausea and may follow a viral prodrome, with labyrinthitis adding hearing symptoms. I should double-check that these distinctions are consistent with guideline definitions and clinical reviews, which they are [^117AP6bq] [^117MFVht] [^112b1x5y].

> Wait, let me verify the bedside diagnostic maneuvers and their interpretation. For posterior canal BPPV, a positive Dix-Hallpike produces torsional upbeating nystagmus with latency and fatigability; for lateral canal BPPV, the supine roll test elicits horizontal nystagmus that reverses direction with head turns. I need to ensure I'm not conflating these patterns with central nystagmus, so I should confirm that the absence of vertical or purely torsional nystagmus without positional latency supports a peripheral process. These maneuver-based distinctions are supported by the AAO-HNSF BPPV guideline and NEJM clinical practice summaries [^117AP6bq] [^113emS71].

> Now, for BPPV, I will examine canalith repositioning procedures as first-line therapy. The Epley maneuver is strongly recommended for posterior canal BPPV and achieves high rates of symptom resolution and conversion of Dix-Hallpike to negative, with comparable outcomes to Semont and superiority to Brandt-Daroff exercises in the short term. Hold on, I should verify recurrence and the need for repetition; recurrence is common, and multiple sessions are often required, with success approaching 90–98% after additional maneuvers. I should also confirm that post-maneuver postural restrictions are not advised, which the guideline explicitly recommends against [^11659idJ] [^115RApgE] [^116DKWtt] [^117AP6bq].

> Let me consider Ménière's disease next, and I need to ensure I separate acute attack management from long-term vertigo control. For acute attacks, a limited course of vestibular suppressants such as meclizine or benzodiazepines is reasonable, but prolonged use can impair central compensation. For long-term control, I should confirm that guidelines prioritize conservative measures first, including salt restriction and diuretics, while acknowledging that high-quality evidence for oral agents is limited. If attacks persist, intratympanic options include corticosteroids, which may modestly reduce vertigo days, and gentamicin, which is more effective for vertigo control but carries a risk of hearing loss; positive pressure therapy is not recommended. I should double-check that these recommendations align with AAO-HNSF and Cochrane assessments, which they do [^115fdryn] [^1139pRce] [^114RW8dQ] [^1157GmiE] [^112Z6HJd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought intratympanic steroids had robust randomized evidence for vertigo control; hold on, I should verify that. The Cochrane review suggests little to no difference in global vertigo improvement versus placebo, with only a small reduction in days with vertigo and very low certainty, so I should correct that overstatement and frame steroids as a possibly helpful, low-risk option rather than a proven therapy. Conversely, gentamicin shows signal for vertigo reduction but with very low-certainty evidence and known ototoxic risk, so shared decision-making is essential, especially in patients with usable hearing [^114RW8dQ] [^1157GmiE].

> For vestibular neuritis, I need to ensure I emphasize supportive care and timely vestibular rehabilitation. Acutely, vestibular suppressants can be used short term for comfort, but they should be tapered quickly to allow central compensation. I should confirm that guidelines recommend offering vestibular rehabilitation once the acute phase abates, which improves symptoms and function in unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction. But wait, what if steroids are considered? Emergency care guidance suggests shared decision-making for short-course corticosteroids within 72 hours, given mixed and low-certainty evidence, so I should not overstate steroid benefit [^112DYqV4] [^113W4sRq] [^113gwVdV].

> Next, I should review the role of vestibular rehabilitation across conditions and make sure I don't overgeneralize. VR is beneficial for unilateral and bilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction and can be adjunctive after BPPV maneuvers to consolidate functional recovery, but it is not effective for acute Ménière's attacks and should not be prescribed for acute vertigo in active Ménière's disease. I need to check dosing guidance: for unilateral hypofunction, gaze stabilization and balance exercises around 20 minutes daily for 4–6 weeks are reasonable, with supervised therapy often optimizing outcomes. These points are supported by APTA guidelines and Cochrane reviews [^112DYqV4] [^111qjy1c] [^1116Yd9h] [^113W4sRq].

> I will now examine follow-up and safety counseling, and I should confirm timelines. For BPPV, reassessment within about a month is advised to document resolution or persistence; persistent symptoms warrant reevaluation for unresolved BPPV, alternative canal involvement, or alternative diagnoses. For Ménière's disease, clinicians should track vertigo, hearing, tinnitus, and quality of life to guide therapy adjustments. I need to ensure I include fall risk mitigation and activity guidance, as balance may remain off for days to weeks after BPPV treatment and patients should resume safe activities to promote compensation [^117AP6bq] [^117WUTJS] [^11254mj8].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags and when to escalate or image. Failure of repeated canalith repositioning, atypical nystagmus, focal neurologic deficits, severe headache, or risk factors for posterior circulation disease should prompt reconsideration of central causes and possible neuroimaging. In Ménière's disease refractory to conservative and intratympanic therapy, surgical options such as endolymphatic sac surgery, vestibular nerve section, or labyrinthectomy may be considered, with labyrinthectomy reserved for nonusable hearing, and the evidence base for surgery is limited and low certainty, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making [^117AP6bq] [^1163zPzi].

> Let me synthesize the treatment algorithm succinctly, and I should double-check that each branch aligns with the evidence. If BPPV is diagnosed, perform canalith repositioning maneuvers tailored to the affected canal, avoid post-maneuver restrictions, and arrange follow-up with vestibular rehabilitation if imbalance persists. If Ménière's disease is diagnosed, manage acute attacks with short-course vestibular suppressants, implement salt restriction and consider diuretics, and escalate to intratympanic steroids or gentamicin for persistent vertigo, reserving surgery for refractory cases with informed consent about hearing risks. If vestibular neuritis is diagnosed, provide supportive care, taper suppressants promptly, and initiate vestibular rehabilitation to facilitate compensation. Throughout, prioritize safety, monitor for red flags, and adjust the plan based on response and patient preferences [^117AP6bq] [^112Z6HJd] [^1139pRce] [^112DYqV4].

Inner ear vertigo is best managed with **maneuver-based therapy** for BPPV (Epley, Semont, or Lempert) [^11659idJ] [^115RApgE], which resolves symptoms in most patients and is first-line care [^115RApgE] [^11659idJ]. For Ménière's disease, use a **stepwise approach**: start with salt restriction and diuretics [^115jZbmT]; if attacks persist, offer intratympanic steroids [^112Z6HJd]; and for refractory cases, consider intratympanic gentamicin [^1161Uoks] or surgery, balancing vertigo control against hearing risk [^1163zPzi]. Vestibular rehabilitation improves balance and reduces dizziness in chronic or persistent cases [^112DYqV4] [^113W4sRq]. Avoid routine vestibular suppressants long term, as they delay compensation and increase fall risk [^117AP6bq] [^116zotJz]. Recurrence is common, so educate patients and arrange follow-up to monitor for relapse or alternative diagnoses [^11254mj8] [^115AcP52].

## Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)

### Pathophysiology

BPPV results from **dislodged otoconia** from the utricle entering the semicircular canals, causing abnormal endolymph movement and vertigo with head-position changes [^113emS71] [^116AUKxx].

---

### Diagnostic maneuvers

- **Dix-Hallpike maneuver**: for posterior canal BPPV; torsional upbeating nystagmus confirms diagnosis [^117AP6bq].
- **Supine roll test**: for horizontal canal BPPV; horizontal nystagmus confirms diagnosis [^114YZfTT].
- **Head roll test**: for anterior canal BPPV; vertical nystagmus confirms diagnosis.

---

### Treatment maneuvers

| **Maneuver** | **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Epley | Posterior canal BPPV | - Sequential head movements to move otoconia from posterior canal to utricle [^1145r82w] |
| Semont | Posterior canal BPPV | - Rapid side-to-side movements to reposition otoconia [^notfound] |
| Lempert (barbecue roll) | Horizontal canal BPPV | - 270° head rotations to move otoconia from horizontal canal [^notfound] |
| Deep head hanging | Anterior canal BPPV | - Head hanging to move otoconia from anterior canal [^notfound] |

---

### Effectiveness and recurrence

Effectiveness is high, with **success rates of 80–90%** after one to three maneuvers [^notfound]; recurrence is common (15–50%), and repeat maneuvers remain effective [^11254mj8].

---

## Ménière's disease

### Pathophysiology

Ménière's disease involves **endolymphatic hydrops** from excess endolymph, causing episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness [^115ujoKF] [^113h3aGE].

---

### Conservative management

- **Salt restriction**: ≤ 2 g/day sodium to reduce endolymphatic pressure [^notfound].
- **Diuretics**: hydrochlorothiazide or acetazolamide to reduce fluid retention [^115kT9Vs].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: caffeine, alcohol, and stress reduction [^notfound].

---

### Medical management

- **Intratympanic corticosteroids**: dexamethasone injections for active disease; modest vertigo reduction with low hearing risk [^114RW8dQ] [^112Z6HJd].
- **Intratympanic gentamicin**: for refractory cases; high vertigo control but significant hearing loss risk [^1161Uoks] [^111a3qkY].
- **Vestibular suppressants**: short-term use (meclizine, benzodiazepines) for acute attacks only [^115fdryn].

---

### Surgical management

Surgical options include **endolymphatic sac decompression** for persistent vertigo with usable hearing [^115ujoKF], **vestibular nerve section** for refractory cases with preserved hearing, and **labyrinthectomy** for non-usable hearing with definitive vertigo control [^1163zPzi].

---

## Vestibular neuritis

### Pathophysiology

Vestibular neuritis reflects **inflammation of the vestibular nerve**, often viral, causing severe vertigo, nausea, and imbalance without hearing loss [^112b1x5y].

---

### Acute management

During the acute phase, **vestibular suppressants** such as meclizine, dimenhydrinate, or benzodiazepines provide short-term symptom relief [^115fdryn], and **corticosteroids** may be considered early to reduce inflammation and hasten recovery [^113gwVdV].

---

### Rehabilitation

Vestibular rehabilitation with gaze stabilization and balance exercises accelerates compensation and reduces **long-term disability** [^113FrYtp] [^113W4sRq].

---

## Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT)

VRT uses exercises to promote central compensation and improve balance and gait; it is indicated for chronic dizziness, persistent symptoms, or recurrent vertigo. Benefits include **reduced dizziness, improved balance, and enhanced quality of life** [^115HvuHH] [^113W4sRq].

---

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

Preventive measures include **salt restriction** to reduce Ménière's attacks, **hydration** to support vestibular function, **stress management** to lessen triggers, and **fall prevention** with balance training and home safety modifications [^114T3Wn1] [^113FrYtp].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include reassessment within 1 month to confirm resolution or detect recurrence, with **patient education** on recurrence risk and when to seek care [^117AP6bq]. Long-term monitoring tracks vertigo frequency, hearing, and quality of life to guide ongoing management [^117WUTJS].

---

Inner ear vertigo treatment is diagnosis-specific: use **repositioning maneuvers** for BPPV [^11659idJ], a stepwise medical-to-surgical approach for Ménière's [^115jZbmT], and vestibular rehabilitation for chronic or persistent symptoms [^112DYqV4]. Avoid long-term suppressants, and ensure follow-up to manage recurrence and complications [^117AP6bq].

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117AP6bq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^112oWygY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid (endolymph) volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many and typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

### Meniere's disease [^115ujoKF]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Meniere's disease (MD) is a disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo attacks, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness. The aetiology of MD is multifactorial. A characteristic sign of MD is endolymphatic hydrops (EH), a disorder in which excessive endolymph accumulates in the inner ear and causes damage to the ganglion cells. In most patients, the clinical symptoms of MD present after considerable accumulation of endolymph has occurred. However, some patients develop symptoms in the early stages of EH. The reason for the variability in the symptomatology is unknown and the relationship between EH and the clinical symptoms of MD requires further study. The diagnosis of MD is based on clinical symptoms but can be complemented with functional inner ear tests, including audiometry, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential testing, caloric testing, electrocochleography or head impulse tests. MRI has been optimized to directly visualize EH in the cochlea, vestibule and semicircular canals, and its use is shifting from the research setting to the clinic. The management of MD is mainly aimed at the relief of acute attacks of vertigo and the prevention of recurrent attacks. Therapeutic options are based on empirical evidence and include the management of risk factors and a conservative approach as the first line of treatment. When medical treatment is unable to suppress vertigo attacks, intratympanic gentamicin therapy or endolymphatic sac decompression surgery is usually considered. This Primer covers the pathophysiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, management, quality of life and prevention of MD.

### Menière's disease [^114Rw3Q4]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Menière's disease causes recurrent vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and fullness or pressure in the ear, which mainly affects adults aged 40–60 years. Menière's disease is at first progressive but fluctuating, and episodes can occur in clusters. Vertigo usually resolves but hearing deteriorates, and symptoms other than hearing loss and tinnitus usually improve regardless of treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute attacks of Menière's disease; and of interventions to prevent attacks and delay disease progression of Menière's disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 17 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, betahistine, cinnarizine, dietary modification, diuretics, phenothiazines, psychological support, trimetazidine, vestibular rehabilitation.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^115jZbmT]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Management of Ménière's disease — treatment goals and selection emphasize that the goals of MD treatment are to prevent or at least reduce the severity and frequency of vertigo attacks and to relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness and improve overall quality of life; notably, some vertigo control (up to 60%) has been documented in the placebo groups of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Some of the traditional treatment approaches for MD include dietary/lifestyle and/or trigger management approaches, medical, surgical, complementary/alternative, allergy, immunomodulatory, vestibular, and aural therapy, and oral or intratympanic (IT) medications — all with variable results. For those MD patients with persistent and disabling attacks after several months of conservative therapy, other more invasive or involved treatments can be considered, and treatment choice is guided by hearing status: in those patients with usable hearing, nonablative procedures have been advocated, whereas in those patients with no meaningful/useful hearing, surgical or chemical inner ear ablative treatments are implemented.

### Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease [^1157GmiE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Aminoglycosides are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition. The aim of this treatment is to partially or completely destroy the balance function of the affected ear. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic aminoglycosides versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic aminoglycosides with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months, or with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs with a total of 137 participants. All studies compared the use of gentamicin to either placebo or no treatment. Due to the very small numbers of participants in these trials, and concerns over the conduct and reporting of some studies, we considered all the evidence in this review to be very low-certainty. Improvement in vertigo This outcome was assessed by only two studies, and they used different time periods for reporting. Improvement in vertigo was reported by more participants who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (16/16 participants who received gentamicin, compared to 0/16 participants with no intervention; risk ratio (RR) 33.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.15 to 507; 1 study; 32 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and at > 12 months follow-up (12/12 participants receiving gentamicin, compared to 6/10 participants receiving placebo; RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.69; 1 study; 22 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, we were unable to conduct any meta-analysis for this outcome, the certainty of the evidence was very low and we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from the results. Change in vertigo Again, two studies assessed this outcome, but used different methods of measuring vertigo and assessed the outcome at different time points. We were therefore unable to carry out any meta-analysis or draw any meaningful conclusions from the results. Global scores of vertigo were lower for those who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (mean difference (MD) -1 point, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.32; 1 study; 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence; four-point scale; minimally clinically important difference presumed to be one point) and at > 12 months (MD -1.8 points, 95% CI -2.49 to -1.11; 1 study; 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Vertigo frequency was also lower at > 12 months for those who received gentamicin (0 attacks per year in participants receiving gentamicin compared to 11 attacks per year for those receiving placebo; 1 study; 22 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events None of the included studies provided information on the total number of participants who experienced a serious adverse event. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or because they were not assessed or reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for the use of intratympanic gentamicin in the treatment of Ménière's disease is very uncertain. This is primarily due to the fact that there are few published RCTs in this area, and all the studies we identified enrolled a very small number of participants. As the studies assessed different outcomes, using different methods, and reported at different time points, we were not able to pool the results to obtain more reliable estimates of the efficacy of this treatment. More people may report an improvement in vertigo following gentamicin treatment, and scores of vertigo symptoms may also improve. However, the limitations of the evidence mean that we cannot be sure of these effects. Although there is the potential for intratympanic gentamicin to cause harm (for example, hearing loss) we did not find any information about the risks of treatment in this review. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analysis of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

Aminoglycosides are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition. The aim of this treatment is to partially or completely destroy the balance function of the affected ear. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic aminoglycosides versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic aminoglycosides with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow‐up of less than three months, or with a cross‐over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified).

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events.

Main results

We included five RCTs with a total of 137 participants. All studies compared the use of gentamicin to either placebo or no treatment. Due to the very small numbers of participants in these trials, and concerns over the conduct and reporting of some studies, we considered all the evidence in this review to be very low‐certainty.

Improvement in vertigo

This outcome was assessed by only two studies, and they used different time periods for reporting. Improvement in vertigo was reported by more participants who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (16/16 participants who received gentamicin, compared to 0/16 participants with no intervention; risk ratio (RR) 33.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.15 to 507; 1 study; 32 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and at > 12 months follow‐up (12/12 participants receiving gentamicin, compared to 6/10 participants receiving placebo; RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.69; 1 study; 22 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). However, we were unable to conduct any meta‐analysis for this outcome, the certainty of the evidence was very low and we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from the results.

Change in vertigo

Again, two studies assessed this outcome, but used different methods of measuring vertigo and assessed the outcome at different time points. We were therefore unable to carry out any meta‐analysis or draw any meaningful conclusions from the results. Global scores of vertigo were lower for those who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (mean difference (MD) ‐1 point, 95% CI ‐1.68 to ‐0.32; 1 study; 26 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; four‐point scale; minimally clinically important difference presumed to be one point) and at > 12 months (MD ‐1.8 points, 95% CI ‐2.49 to ‐1.11; 1 study; 26 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Vertigo frequency was also lower at > 12 months for those who received gentamicin (0 attacks per year in participants receiving gentamicin compared to 11 attacks per year for those receiving placebo; 1 study; 22 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Serious adverse events

None of the included studies provided information on the total number of participants who experienced a serious adverse event. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or because they were not assessed or reported.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for the use of intratympanic gentamicin in the treatment of Ménière's disease is very uncertain. This is primarily due to the fact that there are few published RCTs in this area, and all the studies we identified enrolled a very small number of participants. As the studies assessed different outcomes, using different methods, and reported at different time points, we were not able to pool the results to obtain more reliable estimates of the efficacy of this treatment. More people may report an improvement in vertigo following gentamicin treatment, and scores of vertigo symptoms may also improve. However, the limitations of the evidence mean that we cannot be sure of these effects. Although there is the potential for intratympanic gentamicin to cause harm (for example, hearing loss) we did not find any information about the risks of treatment in this review.

Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta‐analysis of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^117WUTJS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Statement 16. Patient outcomes — Clinicians should document resolution, improvement, or worsening of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss and any change in quality of life in patients with Ménière's disease after treatment. Recommendation based on the controlled arms of RCTs, outcomes from RCTs, cohort studies, and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity is that tracking outcomes of therapy provides an opportunity for modification of management to optimize outcomes. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C; level of confidence in evidence is Medium due to Grade C evidence. Benefits are opportunity to adjust for more effective therapy, possibility of more accurate diagnosis, opportunity for hearing rehabilitation, and patient engagement; risks, harms, and costs are cost and time of visits. Benefit-harm assessment is preponderance of benefit over harms; policy level is Recommendation. Intentional vagueness is that the word symptoms can refer to vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, or pressure depending on what is of most concern to the patient; the role of patient preferences is Medium, as some patients with subjectively adequate disease control may choose not to follow up.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^11254mj8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient counseling and follow-up — expected course, activity guidance, recurrence risk, and actions for persistent symptoms are outlined as follows: Mild sensitivity to movement and unsteadiness can persist, and these mild symptoms can take a few days to a few weeks to resolve; follow up if dizziness or instability do not improve in a few days to a couple of weeks. Balance may be "off", so take precautions to avoid falls, return to normal activities that you can do safely, and note that exposure to motion and movement will help to speed healing. BPPV can sometimes return, with risk shifting from low risk (few experiences in your lifetime) to higher risk from factors such as trauma, other inner ear or medical conditions, or aging; medical research has not found any way to stop recurrence, but it can be treated with a high rate of success. If symptoms persist after initial treatments, it is not uncommon to need more than 1 repositioning session, BPPV can sometimes be in more than 1 canal and/or side requiring multiple treatments, seek a health professional who specializes in BPPV, and recognize that leftover dizziness may require more time (few days to couple of weeks); follow-up is important and further testing may confirm the diagnosis and/or guide future treatment options.

Guideline purpose — Ménière's disease (MD) clinical practice guideline focuses on improving diagnosis and treatment for adults, stating, "The primary purpose of this CPG is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD". The intended population is specified as " ≥ 18 years old with suspected diagnosis of definite or probable MD", and "The CPG focuses only on MD". It further notes scope to clarify vestibular terminology: "This CPG is also designed to clarify the term "vertigo". As clinical context, the document reports bilateral involvement can occur, noting MD "may affect both ears in 10% to 25% of cases over time".

### Chemical perfusion of the inner ear [^111a3qkY]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

In general, chemical perfusion therapy of inner ear disease is safe, inexpensive, and easy to perform. High inner ear medication concentrations can be achieved while minimizing systemic side effects. Most delivery methods are minimally invasive and can be performed in the office. The treatment is usually well accepted by patients. Vertigo control rates for Meniere's disease have been excellent — rivaling other prominent surgical treatments — allowing intratympanic therapy to become the most prominent first-line treatment for Meniere's disease. Side effects of ototoxicity occurring in approximately 30% of patients remain as one of the primary hurdles to overcome. Most patients who experience hearing loss, however, do not complain of the loss and are simply happy to be free of their vertigo attacks. The use of oral steroids to rescue and preserve hearing during gentamicin perfusion remain promising, and complete recovery and even hearing improvement have been observed [30]. Steroid perfusion of the inner ear also is variably effective for the treatment of SSHL, and is particularly indicated when oral steroids fail or are contraindicated due to other health reasons. Many inner ear perfusion methods and philosophies of treatment exist. Each technique has its associated advantages and disadvantages, and the individual surgeon must decide which technique to use in concordance with the patient's disease and expectations. In the future, new medications likely will be developed to treat certain types of inner ear disease, including SSHL, tinnitus, and various forms of vertigo. These medications can be administered by direct chemical perfusion of the inner ear.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^114RW8dQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition (through the tympanic membrane). The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months, or with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects (including tympanic membrane perforation). We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies with a total of 952 participants. All studies used the corticosteroid dexamethasone, with doses ranging from approximately 2 mg to 12 mg. Improvement in vertigo Intratympanic corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the number of people who report an improvement in their vertigo at 6 to ≤ 12 months follow-up (intratympanic corticosteroids 96.8%, placebo 96.6%, risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.10; 2 studies; 60 participants; low-certainty evidence) or at more than 12 months follow-up (intratympanic corticosteroids 100%, placebo 96.3%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.23; 2 studies; 58 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, we note the large improvement in the placebo group for these trials, which causes challenges in interpreting these results. Change in vertigo Assessed with a global score One study (44 participants) assessed the change in vertigo at 3 to < 6 months using a global score, which considered the frequency, duration and severity of vertigo. This is a single, small study and the certainty of the evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Assessed by frequency of vertigo Three studies (304 participants) assessed the change in frequency of vertigo episodes at 3 to < 6 months. Intratympanic corticosteroids may slightly reduce the frequency of vertigo episodes. The proportion of days affected by vertigo was 0.05 lower (absolute difference -5%) in those receiving intratympanic corticosteroids (95% CI -0.07 to -0.02; 3 studies; 472 participants; low-certainty evidence). This is equivalent to a difference of approximately 1.5 days fewer per month affected by vertigo in the corticosteroid group (with the control group having vertigo on approximately 2.5 to 3.5 days per month at the end of follow-up, and those receiving corticosteroids having vertigo on approximately 1 to 2 days per month). However, this result should be interpreted with caution - we are aware of unpublished data at this time point in which corticosteroids failed to show a benefit over placebo. One study also assessed the change in frequency of vertigo at 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months follow-up. However, this is a single, small study and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Therefore, we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Serious adverse events Four studies reported this outcome. There may be little or no effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events with intratympanic corticosteroids, but the evidence is very uncertain (intratympanic corticosteroids 3.0%, placebo 4.4%; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.85; 4 studies; 500 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for intratympanic corticosteroids in the treatment of Ménière's disease is uncertain. There are relatively few published RCTs, which all consider the same type of corticosteroid (dexamethasone). We also have concerns about publication bias in this area, with the identification of two large RCTs that remain unpublished. The evidence comparing intratympanic corticosteroids to placebo or no treatment is therefore all low- or very low-certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area, and enable meta-analysis of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits. Finally, we would also highlight the responsibility that trialists have to ensure results are available, regardless of the outcome of their study.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^116zDEpY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. It is often treated with medication, but different interventions are sometimes used. Positive pressure therapy is a treatment that creates small pressure pulses, generated by a pump that is attached to tubing placed in the ear canal. It is typically used for a few minutes, several times per day. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of positive pressure therapy versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

MAIN RESULTS: We included three studies with a total of 238 participants, all of which compared positive pressure using the Meniett device to sham treatment. The duration of follow-up was a maximum of four months. Improvement in vertigo A single study assessed whether participants had an improvement in the frequency of their vertigo whilst using positive pressure therapy, therefore we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the results. Change in vertigo Only one study reported on the change in vertigo symptoms using a global score (at 3 to < 6 months), so we are again unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. All three studies reported on the change in the frequency of vertigo. The summary effect showed that people receiving positive pressure therapy had, on average, 0.84 fewer days per month affected by vertigo (95% confidence interval from 2.12 days fewer to 0.45 days more; 3 studies; 202 participants). However, the evidence on the change in vertigo frequency was of very low certainty, therefore there is great uncertainty in this estimate. Serious adverse events None of the included studies provided information on the number of people who experienced serious adverse events. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or whether they were not assessed and reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease is very uncertain.

### Autoimmune inner ear disorders [^115Dtzq8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

There is considerable evidence to suggest that hearing and vestibular function can be influenced by autoimmune processes. A number of systemic autoimmune disorders include hearing loss and vertigo as part of their constellation of symptoms. Although classic evidence for a specific autoimmune etiology mediated by immune response directed solely at the inner ear is elusive, it appears that autoimmune damage can also exist as an entity confined to the labyrinth. Antigenic targets of autoimmunity within the labyrinth seem to be diverse. Partly because of this, the condition is difficult to diagnose. However, autoimmune disorders of the inner ear are of special interest since they are among the few forms of hearing loss that are amenable to medical treatment. Recent progress in understanding the etiology, diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune damage to the inner ear is reviewed.

### Migrainous vertigo, tinnitus, and ear symptoms and alternatives [^111b9qN2]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Migraine headaches frequently coexist with vestibular symptoms such as vertigo, motion sickness, and gait instability. Migraine-related vasospasm can also damage the inner ear, which results in symptoms such as sudden sensorineural hearing loss and resultant tinnitus. The pathophysiology of these symptoms is not yet fully understood, and despite their prevalence, there is no universally approved management. This review summarizes the data on complementary and integrative medicine in treating patients with migrainous ear disorders.

### Efficacy of intratympanic OTO-104 for the treatment of Ménière's disease: the outcome of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^114hBgh1]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Ménière's disease is a chronic idiopathic condition of the inner ear predominantly characterized by spontaneous episodes of vertigo; other symptoms include fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. The lifetime prevalence of Ménière's disease in the United States has been reported to be 190 per 100,000 people, with an annual incidence of 15.3 per 100,000 people. In addition to the physical symptoms of Ménière's disease, affected individuals endure a material impairment of their quality of life. The economic impact of this condition can be overwhelming for patients and their families; a broader societal impact of Ménière's disease has recently been established.

The underlying etiology of Ménière's disease is unknown, and there is no current cure. Evidence-based treatment options are limited and are directed at either relieving acute symptoms or ablating the function of the inner ear via the use of ototoxic medications and/or by surgical destruction. Repeated intratympanic injections of aqueous corticosteroid formulations have been associated with clinical improvement in patients with Ménière's disease. A number of mechanisms to support the physiological role of corticosteroids in Ménière's disease have been proposed. For example, corticosteroids are known to modify the regulation of inner ear epithelial ion transport by activating the outflow of sodium via epithelial sodium channels and sodium/potassium ATPases. Sodium movement from the labyrinth fluid to the epithelial compartment is hypothesized to result in a reduction in endolymph fluid volume and could translate to a reduction in Ménière's symptoms, such as vertigo. The administration of corticosteroids directly into the middle ear allows maximal drug exposure at the interface with the inner ear while minimizing the potential for systemic adverse effects.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^111Eb3zt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. First-line treatments often involve dietary or lifestyle changes, medication or local (intratympanic) treatments. However, surgery may also be considered for people with persistent or severe symptoms. The efficacy of different surgical interventions at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of surgical interventions versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease comparing ventilation tubes, endolymphatic sac surgery, semi-circular canal plugging/obliteration, vestibular nerve section or labyrinthectomy with either placebo (sham surgery) or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months, or with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease-specific health-related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included two studies with a total of 178 participants. One evaluated ventilation tubes compared to no treatment, the other evaluated endolymphatic sac decompression compared to sham surgery. Ventilation tubes We included a single RCT of 148 participants with definite Ménière's disease. It was conducted in a single centre in Japan from 2010 to 2013. Participants either received ventilation tubes with standard medical treatment, or standard medical treatment alone, and were followed up for two years. Some data were reported on the number of participants in whom vertigo resolved, and the effect of the intervention on hearing. Our other primary and secondary outcomes were not reported in this study. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Endolymphatic sac decompression We also included one RCT of 30 participants that compared endolymphatic sac decompression with sham surgery. This was a single-centre study conducted in Denmark during the 1980s. Follow-up was predominantly conducted at one year, but additional follow-up continued for up to nine years in some participants. Some data were reported on hearing and vertigo (both improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo), but our other outcomes of interest were not reported. Again, this is a single, very small study and we rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes. We are therefore unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are unable to draw clear conclusions about the efficacy of these surgical interventions for Ménière's disease. We identified evidence for only two of our five proposed comparisons, and we assessed all the evidence as low- or very low-certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Many of the outcomes that we planned to assess were not reported by the studies, such as the impact on quality of life, and adverse effects of the interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Ménière's disease [^115QJLiw]. Practical Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Ménière's disease affects about 1% of the population. Typically it presents as episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness. The history and physical examination are critical in making the diagnosis. Laboratory tests are useful in tailoring and following up patients. Treatment options are limited and usually targeted towards reducing endolymphatic hydrops to stabilise the hearing loss and reduce the vertiginous episodes.

Abstract

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. First‐line treatments often involve dietary or lifestyle changes, medication or local (intratympanic) treatments. However, surgery may also be considered for people with persistent or severe symptoms. The efficacy of different surgical interventions at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of surgical interventions versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease comparing ventilation tubes, endolymphatic sac surgery, semi‐circular canal plugging/obliteration, vestibular nerve section or labyrinthectomy with either placebo (sham surgery) or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow‐up of less than three months, or with a cross‐over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified).

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included two studies with a total of 178 participants. One evaluated ventilation tubes compared to no treatment, the other evaluated endolymphatic sac decompression compared to sham surgery.

Ventilation tubes

We included a single RCT of 148 participants with definite Ménière's disease. It was conducted in a single centre in Japan from 2010 to 2013. Participants either received ventilation tubes with standard medical treatment, or standard medical treatment alone, and were followed up for two years. Some data were reported on the number of participants in whom vertigo resolved, and the effect of the intervention on hearing. Our other primary and secondary outcomes were not reported in this study. This is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Endolymphatic sac decompression

We also included one RCT of 30 participants that compared endolymphatic sac decompression with sham surgery. This was a single‐centre study conducted in Denmark during the 1980s. Follow‐up was predominantly conducted at one year, but additional follow‐up continued for up to nine years in some participants. Some data were reported on hearing and vertigo (both improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo), but our other outcomes of interest were not reported. Again, this is a single, very small study and we rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes. We are therefore unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Authors' conclusions

We are unable to draw clear conclusions about the efficacy of these surgical interventions for Ménière's disease. We identified evidence for only two of our five proposed comparisons, and we assessed all the evidence as low‐ or very low‐certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Many of the outcomes that we planned to assess were not reported by the studies, such as the impact on quality of life, and adverse effects of the interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta‐analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^113Fi6BJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

As the underlying cause of Ménière's disease is poorly understood, so too are the ways in which the interventions may work.

Some non‐destructive surgical treatments aim to address assumed endolymphatic hydrops, by reducing pressure in the endolymph on the presumption that this will alleviate some of the symptoms of the disease. This is hypothesised to be achieved by creating more space for the endolymph fluid by removing a small amount of bone (decompression), and/or placing a small tube (shunt) to allow the endolymph to drain. A more recent approach has been to occlude/block the endolymphatic duct (Saliba 2015), with a similar aim of reducing endolymph by reducing flow from the endolymphatic sac to the inner ear.

Some authors have suggested that the middle ear may play a role in Ménière's disease, and consequently have tried inserting ventilation tubes (Tumarkin 1961). However, this has not been widely adopted in the management of Ménière's disease, as the mechanism of action is uncertain.

Plugging one or more of the semi‐circular canals has also been suggested as a treatment for Ménière's disease (Charpiot 2010). This is on the presumption that stimulation of the semi‐circular canals is responsible for most of the vertigo symptoms during an attack.

Destructive surgery aims to completely remove unilateral vestibular input. This can be achieved by irreversibly damaging or drilling out the labyrinth (which sacrifices any remaining hearing) or, more selectively, dividing the vestibular nerve. The latter approach aims to preserve the cochlear nerve and hearing, but is associated with greater surgical risk. It is expected that ‐ with no persisting vestibular function ‐ acute vertigo from Ménière's attacks will cease permanently. Whilst patients may suffer a more chronic vertigo/imbalance from reduced unilateral vestibular function, it is usual for this to improve through central compensation.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^1139pRce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used in the management of this condition, including betahistine, diuretics, antiviral medications and corticosteroids. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which these treatments may work. The efficacy of these different interventions at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic pharmacological interventions versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search Methods

The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable Ménière's disease comparing betahistine, diuretics, antihistamines, antivirals or systemic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow-up of less than three months, or with a cross-over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome - improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events.

We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 studies with a total of 848 participants. The studies evaluated the following interventions: betahistine, diuretics, antivirals and corticosteroids. We did not identify any evidence on antihistamines. Betahistine Seven RCTs (548 participants) addressed this comparison. However, we were unable to conduct any meta-analyses for our primary outcomes as not all outcomes were considered by every study, and studies that did report the same outcome used different time points for follow-up, or assessed the outcome using different methods. Therefore, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Some data were available for each of our primary outcomes, but the evidence was low- or very low-certainty throughout. One study reported on the outcome 'improvement in vertigo' at 6 to ≤ 12 months, and another study reported this outcome at > 12 months. Four studies reported on the change in vertigo, but again all used different methods of assessment (vertigo frequency, or a global score of vertigo severity) or different time points. A single study reported on serious adverse events. Diuretics Two RCTs addressed this comparison. One considered the use of isosorbide (220 participants), and the other used a combination of amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide (80 participants). Again, we were unable to conduct any meta-analyses for our primary outcomes, as only one study reported on the outcome 'improvement in vertigo' (at 6 to ≤ 12 months), one study reported on change in vertigo (at 3 to < 6 months) and neither study assessed serious adverse events. Therefore, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. The evidence was all very low-certainty. Other pharmacological interventions We also identified one study that assessed antivirals (24 participants), and one study that assessed corticosteroids (16 participants). The evidence for these interventions was all very low-certainty. Again, serious adverse events were not considered by either study.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease is very uncertain. There are few RCTs that compare these interventions to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta-analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Meniere's disease might be an autoimmune condition? [^112pLiB6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review our current knowledge of the pathogenesis of Meniere's disease, including viral infection and immune system-mediated mechanisms, and to discuss the pathogenesis as it relates to pharmacotherapy.

Systematic Review Methodology

Relevant publications on the aetiopathogenesis, molecular biology, genetics and histopathology of Meniere's disease from 1861 to 2011 were analysed.

Results and Conclusions

Meniere's disease is characterised by intermittent episodes of vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural pressure. The aetiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. Proposed theories of causation include viral infections and immune system-mediated mechanisms. The immune response in Meniere's disease is focused on inner ear antigens. Approximately one-third of Meniere's disease cases seem to be of an autoimmune origin although the immunological mechanisms involved are not clear. The diagnosis of autoimmune inner ear disease is based either on clinical criteria or on a positive response to steroids. The antiviral approach has virtually eliminated the use of various surgical methods used in the past. Steroid responsiveness is high, and with prompt treatment, inner ear damage may be reversible. The administration of etanercept improves or stabilises symptoms in treated patients. Treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome can be directed toward preventing thromboembolic events by using antithrombotic medications. Only warfarin has been shown to be effective. Gene therapy can be used to transfer genetic material into inner ear cells using viral vectors and to protect, rescue, and even regenerate hair cells of the inner ear.

Ménière's disease — labyrinthectomy recommendation and decision-making — clinicians may offer surgical labyrinthectomy only to a small subset of patients with persistent, symptomatic unilateral MD refractory to conservative treatments with nonusable hearing in the affected ear, and shared decision making between the provider and patient is necessary for this recommendation. The panel's benefit–harm assessment states preponderance of benefit over harm, with value judgments that labyrinthectomy represents a standard for control of active vertigo in MD and a policy level of recommendation, while noting differences of opinion that a minority of panel members felt that offer was too strong a term but that a discussion about this intervention should be undertaken.

### Vestibular migraine or meniere's disease: a diagnostic dilemma [^112P1KSh]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Meniere's disease (MD) represents one of the vertigo disorders characterized by triad symptoms (recurrent vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus or ear fullness). The diagnosis of MD relies on the accurate and detailed taking of medical history, and the differentiation between MD and vestibular migraine (VM) is of critical importance from the perspective of the treatment efficacy. VM is a highly prevalent vertigo condition and its typical symptoms (headache, vestibular symptoms, cochlear symptoms) mimic those of MD. Furthermore, the misdiagnosis in MD and VM could lead to VM patients mistakenly receiving the traumatic treatment protocol designed for MD, and sustaining unnecessary damage to the inner ear. Fortunately, thanks to the advances in examination technologies, the barriers to their differentiation are being gradually removed. These advances enhance the diagnostic accuracy of vertigo diseases, especially VM and MD. This review focused on the differentiation of VM and MD, with an attempt to synthesize existing data on the relevant battery of differentiation diagnosis (covering core symptoms, auxiliary tests [audiometry, vestibular tests, endolymphatic hydrops tests]) and longitudinal follow-up. Since the two illnesses are overlapped in all aspects, no single test is sufficiently specific on its own, however, patterns containing all or at least some features boost specificity.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^112wutbW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

This review was conducted as part of a suite considering different interventions for Ménière's disease. A number of issues were identified as affecting the completeness and applicability of the evidence in all the reviews in this suite. These have been described in the companion review on systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease (Webster 2021a) and are replicated here, as they relate to this review:

There is a paucity of evidence about all of these interventions, despite some of them being in common use for Ménière's disease. All the evidence we found was of very low or low certainty, showing that we are unsure of the effects of the interventions, and future research may change the effect estimates a great deal.
We were unable to carry out many meta‐analyses. There were often differences in the actual outcomes assessed in the study, therefore we were unable to pool the data to achieve a more precise estimate of any effect. Study authors also often used different ways of measuring the same outcome, which prevented data from being combined. For example, vertigo was assessed with either a global score, or a frequency score, which could not be combined.
Certain outcomes were only assessed by some included studies. Some studies did not assess the impact of the disease on quality of life or tinnitus at all. Potential adverse effects of the interventions were also poorly reported or simply not assessed. The use of a positive pressure device requires the insertion of a ventilation tube. When used in people with chronic middle ear disease, this procedure has the potential to cause adverse effects (such as infection, ear discharge or persistent tympanic membrane perforation). It is unclear whether the same risks apply for people with Ménière's disease, but these should be assessed and reported.
We noted that unvalidated rating scales were commonly used in the studies included, particularly when looking at the global impact of treatments for vertigo. When such scales are used, it is difficult to know if they are accurately assessing the outcome, and also what size of change on this scale represents a meaningful difference in the outcome (the minimally important difference).
Finally, studies often failed to report clearly what treatments participants received before joining the trial, what maintenance treatment they continued on during the trial, and whether they received any additional treatments over the course of the trial. The impact of these additional treatments may be considerable, particularly for those studies with longer‐term follow‐up. Without knowing the background details of study participants (for example, the duration of their Ménière's disease, or what treatments they have tried in the past) it is difficult to identify the groups of people who may benefit from these treatments.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^1148YKX6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

A variety of different interventions have been proposed to treat people with Ménière's disease. These include dietary or lifestyle changes, oral treatments, treatments administered by injection into the ear (intratympanic) and surgical treatments. This review focuses on the use of intratympanic corticosteroids to treat the symptoms of Ménière's disease.

Corticosteroids can be administered into the middle ear through the tympanic membrane. They are often administered via injection, but can also be delivered as drops through a ventilation tube (with or without a wick). Treatment regimens vary from a one‐off injection to a short course (two to three injections), and may need to be repeated if symptoms recur. Different types of corticosteroids may be used, including methylprednisolone, dexamethasone or hydrocortisone.

At present, there is no agreement on which is the ideal treatment for people with Ménière's disease – consequently there is no 'gold standard' treatment with which to compare these medications.

How the intervention might work

As the underlying cause of Ménière's disease is poorly understood, so too are the ways in which the interventions may work.

The specific action of steroids in the inner ear is unclear, but may include an influence on water homeostasis, ion channels and blood flow to the inner ear (reviewed in Farhood 2016). The rationale for intratympanic delivery is that it enables steroids to reach the target organ at a high dose (Parnes 1999), whilst avoiding complications from systemic administration. The drug is thought to be absorbed into the inner ear, where glucocorticoid receptors have been shown to be present (Rarey 1996).

Potential side effects of the intervention include pain due to the procedure, a persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane, or the development of tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss following the injection.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^1116Yd9h]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Ménière's disease — acute vertigo and vestibular rehabilitation (VR): Clinicians should not recommend vestibular rehabilitation/physical therapy for management of acute vertigo attacks in patients with Ménière's disease, with a recommendation against based on RCTs that evaluated acute vertigo but were not specific to MD and a preponderance of benefit over harms. The action profile notes level of confidence in evidence as Medium; benefits include avoidance of noneffective therapy, preserving coverage for physical therapy at a later stage of disease, and avoidance of potential exacerbation of symptoms; risks include delay of treatment in patients with an underlying vestibular hypofunction. The benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harms and the policy level is recommendation against. Supporting context describes active MD attacks as vertigo attacks lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours with fluctuating low- to midfrequency SNHL, aural fullness, and tinnitus, and states that for the fluctuating nature of vestibular dysfunction manifested in acute MD attacks, the role of VR is undefined.

### Epley maneuver, performed by family doctors or emergency physicians, for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in adults [^1145r82w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

The repositioning of otoconia from the posterior semicircular canal to the utricular macula, a critical element of the Epley maneuver, generally takes around five minutes. This procedure involves four sequential movements, starting with sitting, then lying down, turning, and finally returning to a seated position. These deliberate actions help move the otoconia, ensuring they become inert once they reach the utricular macula.

We will include studies of the Epley maneuver carried out at least once, in person and individually, by family doctors or emergency physicians, in the primary care setting (consultations and emergencies) and hospital emergency departments. The technique is feasible in all contexts; it does not depend on any specific equipment and only involves the use of a stretcher or a bed.

We will include all comparators (e.g. no treatment, placebo, or other active treatment). A common sham (placebo) maneuver consists of lying down with the head turned to the affected side for five minutes (Froehling 2000). Eligible comparators for 'other active treatment' may include vestibular rehabilitation and various repositioning maneuvers, such as the Semont maneuver or the Brandt‐Daroff exercises, designed to reposition otoliths in the inner ear to alleviate symptoms. Additionally, vestibular suppressant drugs, such as betahistine or diazepam, although they do not directly address the underlying cause of BPPV, will be considered as active comparators.

If important co‐interventions are not balanced across intervention and comparator groups, we will consider the potential risk of introduced bias. We will perform additional sensitivity analyses to determine if unbalanced co‐interventions affect the outcomes, or we will apply regression models adjusted for the co‐intervention. We will use transparent and cautious reporting, acknowledging the limitations in the interpretations.

We will not impose additional restrictions on interventions and comparators with respect to delivery, duration, or intensity.

Comparisons sought include:

EM versus placebo (sham maneuver);
EM versus untreated control;
EM versus other active treatment.

### Vestibular assessment: a practical approach [^1141ejLA]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### Silverstein microWick [^112d3xkT]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Using the MicroWick to deliver otic medication to the inner ear fluids isa new, unique, effective, safe, efficient, and inexpensive method to treat inner ear disease. This self-treatment method using otic medication represents a major breakthrough in the treatment of inner ear disease. It allows the otologist to treat inner ear disease much as the ophthalmologist treats eye disease using eye drops. In the future, new drugs and medications will likely be developed that will relieve vertigo attacks, improve certain types of sensorineural hearing loss, and reduce tinnitus. The MicroWick will be available for patients to self-administer these medications to the inner ear through the round window membrane.

### Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease [^114XCK7D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

This review was conducted as part of a suite considering different interventions for Ménière's disease. A number of issues were identified as affecting the completeness and applicability of the evidence in all the reviews in this suite. These have been described in the companion review on systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease (Webster 2021b) and are replicated here, as they relate to this review:

There is a paucity of evidence about all of these interventions, despite some of them being in common use for Ménière's disease. All the evidence we found was of very low or low certainty, showing that we are unsure of the effects of the interventions, and future research may change the effect estimates a great deal.
We were unable to carry out many meta‐analyses. Although we identified five studies for inclusion, there were often differences in the actual outcomes assessed in the study, or the time points for follow‐up. Therefore, we were unable to pool the data to achieve a more precise estimate of any effect. Finally, study authors often used different ways of measuring the same outcome, which prevented data from being combined. For example, vertigo was assessed with either a global score, or a frequency score, which could not be combined, or hearing was assessed using a continuous scale or as an improvement above a certain threshold.
Certain outcomes were only assessed by some included studies. Many studies did not assess the impact of the disease on quality of life or tinnitus at all. Potential adverse effects of the interventions were also often poorly reported or simply not assessed.
We noted that unvalidated rating scales were commonly used in the studies included, particularly when looking at the global impact of treatments for vertigo. When such scales are used, it is difficult to know if they are accurately assessing the outcome, and also what size of change on this scale represents a meaningful difference in the outcome (the minimally important difference).
Finally, studies often failed to report clearly what treatments participants received before joining the trial, what maintenance treatment they continued on during the trial, and whether they received any additional treatments over the course of the trial. The impact of these additional treatments may be considerable, particularly for those studies with longer‐term follow‐up. Without knowing the background details of study participants (for example, the duration of their Ménière's disease, or what treatments they have tried in the past) it is difficult to identify the groups of people who may benefit from these treatments.

### Early vestibular physical therapy rehabilitation for meniere's disease [^115HvuHH]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Meniere disease includes symptoms of fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and subjective ear fullness accompanied by episodic vertigo. Along with these symptoms, patients with chronic Meniere often develop symptoms of disequilibrium and unsteadiness that extend beyond the episodic attacks and contribute to the total disability and reduced quality of life attributed to the disease. Vestibular rehabilitation physical therapy has been used only after vestibular ablation has stabilized the vestibular loss, and for patients stably managed on medical therapy who exhibit no fluctuation in symptoms. This article reviews the data substantiating current applications of vestibular therapy, including improvements in subjective and objective balance outcome measures, and explores the possible extension of vestibular rehabilitation to treatment of patients exhibiting continued fluctuating vestibular loss.

### Vestibular rehabilitation [^113PwxBe]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the research from 2011 through 2012 on treatment efficacy in two common vestibular disorders - vestibular hypofunction and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).

Recent Findings

Significant numbers of randomized controlled trials now support the use of specific exercises for the treatment of patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction. We do not know if some treatment approaches are more effective than others. There is preliminary evidence that head movement may be the component critical to recovered function and decreased symptoms. Some patient characteristics and initial assessment results appear to predict treatment outcome but the evidence is incomplete. Treatment of posterior canal BPPV canalithiasis is well established. New evidence supports certain treatments for horizontal canal BPPV.

Summary

Treatments for unilateral vestibular hypofunction and for posterior canal BPPV are effective; however, there are many as yet unanswered questions such as why some patients with vestibular hypofunction do not improve with a course of vestibular exercises. We also do not know what would be the best treatment for anterior canal BPPV or for multiple-canal involvement BPPV.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^113Xv2qL]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Ménière's Disease

Prosper Ménière first described a series of patients with episodes of vertigo and hearing loss in 1861. Prior to this it was assumed vertigo attacks originated in the brain in a mechanism akin to strokes or seizures, however included in this series of patients was the autopsy of a young girl with vertigo and hearing loss with an inner ear hemorrhage, the first account that convincingly demonstrated that vertigo could originate in the inner ear. Classically, it has been theorized that Ménière's disease (MD) results from so-called endolymphatic hydrops, or and excessive buildup of endolymphatic fluid in the inner ear. More recently, this theory has been called into question since not all patients with endolymphatic hydrops (on temporal bone histopathology) have MD, although all patients with MD appear to have endolymphatic hydrops.

The diagnostic criteria for MD were most recently updated in 2015 and are separated into definite MD and probable MD. Definite MD is characterized by at least two episodes of vertigo lasting between 20 ​min and 12 ​h, an audiogram demonstrating low to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear, fluctuating aural symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness in the affected ear, and the symptoms should not be better accounted for by another disorder. Probable MD allows for attacks to last up to 24 ​h instead of 12 and excludes the audiogram criteria. Vestibular testing – including vestibular-evoked myogenic potential testing, electrocochleography, head impulse testing, and especially calorics may demonstrate vestibular dysfunction ipsilateral to the hearing loss, although abnormal results do not contribute to the diagnostic criteria of MD.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^116AUKxx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) definitions and mechanisms — BPPV is defined as "A disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo", with canal-specific subtypes and proposed particle-based mechanisms. Posterior canal BPPV is described as "A form of BPPV in which dislodged inner ear particles in the posterior semicircular canal abnormally influence the balance system producing the vertigo, most commonly diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike test", while lateral canal BPPV is "A form of BPPV in which dislodged inner ear particles in the lateral semicircular canal abnormally influence the balance system producing the vertigo, most commonly diagnosed by the supine roll test". Proposed mechanisms include canalithiasis, "a theory for the pathogenesis of BPPV that proposes that there are free-floating particles (otoconia) that have moved from the utricle and collect near the cupula of the affected canal, causing forces in the canal leading to abnormal stimulation of the vestibular apparatus", and cupulolithiasis, "a theory for the pathogenesis of BPPV that proposes that otoconial debris attached to the cupula of the affected semicircular canal cause abnormal stimulation of the vestibular apparatus". Management maneuvers are termed canalith repositioning procedures (CRPs), described as "A group of procedures in which the patient moves through specific body positions designed to relocate dislodged particles within the inner ear for the purpose of relieving symptoms of BPPV", which "have also been termed canalith repositioning maneuvers or canalith repositioning techniques".

### Clinical practice. benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^113emS71]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on benign paroxysmal positional vertigo:

- **Definition**: BPPV is a common disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo and nystagmus.
- **Pathophysiology**: BPPV has an unknown origin but is thought to result from degeneration of the macula. Secondary causes include otoconial dislodgement due to otologic and nonotologic surgery, head trauma, or any means by which mechanical force reaches the inner ear, inner ear disorders (vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
- **Disease course**: The aberrant semicircular canal signaling (canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis) results in BPPV, which causes clinical manifestations of dizziness that lasts < 20 seconds accompanied by a lingering, nonspecific imbalance and characteristic nystagmus with Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Spontaneous resolution occurs in 25% of patients by 1 month and up to 50% at 3 months.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BPPV is not associated with an increase in mortality.

Introduction

Few vestibular disorders require surgery to relief complaints. Patients suffering from vestibular pathologies are often, depending on the pathology, offered conservative treatment, such as repositioning maneuvers, rehabilitation therapy or medication. For many vestibular disorders no cure is available yet. However, in certain patients disabling complaints are not sufficiently improved by conservative therapy and the underlying pathophysiology might demand surgical treatment. Symptomatic superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) is one of these vestibular disorders that can cause a serious reduction in quality of life. The symptoms are caused by an absence of bone covering the superior semicircular canal. Patients suffering from disabling vestibular and/or auditory symptoms may benefit from superior semicircular canal surgery, to eliminate the so-called 'third mobile window', as this may lead to a change in pressure transmission in the inner ear. Plugging of this canal seems to be the most favorable surgical technique. Surgical plugging of a semicircular canal can also be used to treat certain intractable cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This disorder is characterized by recurrent attacks of positional vertigo or dizziness, provoked by lying down or turning over in supine position. It is believed to be caused by dislodged otoconia that end up in a semicircular canal resulting in stimulation of the canal upon postural changes. The posterior semicircular canal is most frequently affected. Most cases can be treated successfully with repositioning maneuvers, but patients with disabling and intractable BPPV may benefit from surgical plugging of the affected semicircular canal to alleviate symptoms.

The abovementioned surgeries seem to be helpful to relieve vestibular symptoms, but also involve opening of the inner ear. Consequently, there is a risk of inducing sensorineural hearing loss and/or loss of vestibular function. Previous studies have reported cases of transient hearing loss, persistent (high-frequency) sensorineural hearing loss, a decrease in vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain of all ipsilateral semicircular canals, or an increase in semicircular canal paresis, up to caloric areflexia. Unfortunately, structured data on the occurrence of these side effects is lacking, especially regarding objective vestibular function. Furthermore, since many studies use a single moment of postoperative evaluation and the follow-up interval differs between studies, assessment of the evolution of inner ear function over time is impeded.

### Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease [^114pdtoH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

For continuous data: the mean values, standard deviation and number of patients for each treatment group at the different time points for outcome measurement. Where change‐from‐baseline data were not available, we extracted the values for endpoint data instead. If values for the individual treatment groups were not reported, where possible we extracted summary statistics (e.g. mean difference) from the studies.
For binary data: we extracted information on the number of participants experiencing an event, and the number of participants assessed at that time point. If values for the individual treatment groups were not reported, where possible we extracted summary statistics (e.g. risk ratio) from the studies.
For ordinal scale data: if the data appeared to be normally distributed, or if the analysis performed by the investigators indicated that parametric tests are appropriate, then we treated the outcome measure as continuous data. Alternatively, if data were available, we converted these to binary data for analysis ‐ for example, for analysis of improvement in vertigo, when rated using the AAO‐HNS 1995 control of vertigo scale.
For time‐to‐event data: we did not identify any time‐to‐event data for the outcomes specified in the review.

If necessary, we converted data found in the studies to a format appropriate for meta‐analysis, according to the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2021).

We pre‐specified time points of interest for the outcomes in this review. Where studies reported data at multiple time points, we took the longest available follow‐up point within each of the specific time frames. For example, if a study reported an outcome at 12 weeks and 20 weeks of follow‐up then the 20‐week data was included for the time point 3 to 6 months (12 to 24 weeks).

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two authors (KG, KW) undertook assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies independently, with the following taken into consideration, as guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Handbook 2011):

sequence generation;
allocation concealment;
blinding;
incomplete outcome data;
selective outcome reporting; and
other sources of bias.

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (Handbook 2011), which involves describing each of these domains as reported in the study and then assigning a judgement about the adequacy of each entry: 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' risk of bias.

### Dexamethasone inner ear perfusion by intratympanic injection in unilateral Ménière's disease: a two-year prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial [^1152WXro]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of dexamethasone inner ear perfusion by intratympanic injection in hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, and vertigo in the treatment of unilateral Ménière's disease and compare it with the control group.

Study Design and Setting

A prospective, randomized, double-blind study with 2-year follow-up comparing changes secondary to dexamethasone inner ear perfusion versus placebo consisting of saline solution.

Patients

Twenty-two patients having definite Ménière's disease as outlined by the 1995 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium. All the patients were older than 18 years of age and were not receiving any other form of treatment with steroids for their Ménière's disease.

Method

Five consecutive daily intratympanic injections of dexamethasone or placebo to the involved ear.

Results

In the dexamethasone group at 2-year follow-up, complete control of vertigo (class A) was achieved in 9 of 11 patients (82%) and substantial control of vertigo (class B) in the remaining 2 patients (18%.) In the control group only 7 of 11 patients (64%) finished the 2-year follow-up because in the other 4 patients (36%) we had to give another treatment for the continuing vertigo and thus they were classified as failure (class F.) From the 7 patients who have finished the follow-up of 2 years in the control group, 4 patients (57%) achieved class A, 2 patients (29%) achieved class C, and 1 patient (14%) class F.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone (4 mg/mL) inner ear perfusion in a group of patients with unilateral Ménière's disease (Shea's stage III) showed 82% of complete control of vertigo over placebo (57%). There was also a subjective improvement in tinnitus (48%), hearing loss (35%), and aural fullness (48%) in the dexamethasone group compared with 20%, 10%, and 20% respectively in the control group.

### Hearing and vertigo outcomes after congenital labyrinthine cholesteatoma resection [^117XwXBm]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2014). Low credibility.

Congenital labyrinthine cholesteatoma can cause varying degrees of hearing loss and vertigo. Hearing preservation is not always possible when treatment involves total labyrinthectomy. Since 1969, there have been several case reports and case series documenting hearing preservation following surgical treatment of congenital labyrinthine cholesteatoma. However, none of the case reports or case series documents the patients' vestibular complaints after surgery. Herein, we report a case series of four patients who were treated with the goal of hearing preservation and resolution of vertigo after partial or complete removal of the bony labyrinth for congenital inner ear cholesteatoma. We will also discuss possible explanations for the mechanisms of preservation of hearing and vestibular function with a review of the current literature.

### Surgical interventions for Ménière's disease [^116ZLPLU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We included the following interventions:

Ventilation tubes
Endolymphatic sac decompression and/or shunt or blockage/obliteration
Semi‐circular canal plugging/obliteration
Vestibular nerve section
Labyrinthectomy

The main comparisons were as follows:

Ventilation tubes versus placebo/no treatment
Endolymphatic sac decompression and/or shunt or blockage/obliteration versus placebo/no treatment
Semi‐circular canal plugging/obliteration versus placebo/no treatment
Vestibular nerve section versus placebo/no treatment
Labyrinthectomy versus placebo/no treatment

Concurrent treatments

There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. We planned to pool studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment, but this was not necessary.

Types of outcome measures

We assessed outcomes at the following time points:

3 to < 6 months;
6 to ≤ 12 months;
> 12 months.

The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow‐up.

We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to Ménière's disease and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify the outcomes that should be prioritised. The review author team used the results of this survey to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review.

We analysed the following outcomes in the review, but did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^111ajC5u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

We included the following interventions:

intratympanic corticosteroids: including methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone or other glucocorticoids.

The main comparison is:

intratympanic corticosteroids versus placebo/no treatment.

We pooled all interventions, regardless of the type and concentration of steroid used, frequency and method of (intratympanic) delivery.

Concurrent treatments

There were no limits on the type of concurrent treatments used, providing these were used equally in each arm of the study. We pooled studies that included concurrent treatments with those where participants did not receive concurrent treatment. We planned to conduct subgroup analysis to determine whether the effect estimates may be different in those receiving additional treatment. However, due to the small number of studies included in the review this was not possible (see Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity).

Types of outcome measures

We assessed all outcomes at the following time points:

3 to < 6 months;
6 to ≤ 12 months;
> 12 months.

The exception was for adverse event data, when we used the longest time period of follow‐up.

We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to Ménière's disease and vertigo, but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. We therefore conducted a survey of individuals with experience of (or an interest in) balance disorders to help identify the outcomes that should be prioritised. This online survey was conducted with the support of the Ménière's Society and the Migraine Trust, and included 324 participants, who provided information regarding priority outcomes. The review author team used the results of this survey to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review.

We analysed the following outcomes in the review, but did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies.

### Treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in acute traumatic brain injury: a prospective, randomised clinical trial assessing safety, feasibility, and efficacy [^1165tamF]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Due to a paucity of data relating to trauma settings, treatment of post-traumatic BPPV is based on guidelines developed specifically for idiopathic BPPV. Post-traumatic BPPV differs from idiopathic BPPV in that it is linked to (1) vestibular agnosia (an attenuated vertigo sensation),(2) frequent recurrence and multi-canal involvementand (3) co-occurrence with other vestibular diagnoses. Previous animal model research has suggested post-traumatic BPPV is linked to acute disruption of the inner ear ultrastructure, which persists up to 3 months following injury, thus potentially rendering a single manoeuvre delivered acutely ineffective. Further, studies conducted in idiopathic BPPV have noted links between inflammatory markers and the presence and recurrence of BPPV. Although there is little data regarding inflammatory markers in post-traumatic BPPV, there is literature on persisting pathological inflammation post-TBI. It is thus possible that a post-TBI inflammatory state may affect responses to BPPV treatment.

Thus, given the lack of evidence regarding the assessment and treatment of post-traumatic BPPV, we aimed to determine the safety, practicability and efficacy of managing this common condition, as well as the feasibility of conducting a future effectiveness trial.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^114kjarU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient information — definition, triggers, symptoms, and epidemiology are described: BPPV is "the most common inner ear problem and cause of vertigo", and "certain head positions or movements can trigger a spell". Common symptoms are "distinct triggered spells of vertigo or spinning sensations" with nausea, disorientation, and instability, and "these symptoms will be intense for seconds to minutes". In seniors, it can present as "an isolated sense of instability brought on by position change", and BPPV "does not affect your hearing or cause you to faint", with "the natural course of BPPV" being to "become less severe over time". BPPV is very common and "is more common in older people", with most cases occurring "for no reason" though associations include trauma, migraine, other inner ear problems, diabetes, osteoporosis, and prolonged bed rest. Mechanistically, BPPV occurs when inner ear calcium carbonate crystals become "unglued" and "float around and/or get stuck on sensors", and symptom intensity relates to how long the crystal/sensor takes "to settle after you move or change your head or body position".

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^115kT9Vs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

As the underlying cause of Ménière's disease is poorly understood, so too are the ways in which the interventions may work.

Several classes of histamine receptor are found within the inner ear. Betahistine is a histamine H₃ antagonist, and a weak H₁ agonist (Arrang 1985). Betahistine is thought to increase the blood flow in the inner ear ‐ this may impact upon endolymphatic fluid pressure. It may also have a direct effect on the vestibular nerve to reduce nerve cell firing and the frequency of vertigo attacks (Botta 1998; Chávez 2005). Other antihistamines may also be used, such as cinnarizine or dimenhydrinate.

Diuretics are used with the intention that they will reduce the volume of endolymph and the pressure in the endolymphatic system, by altering the electrolyte balance and promoting water loss through the kidneys. The mechanism of action varies depending on the class of drug (reviewed in Odlind 1984) and includes:

inhibition of renal carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubules, resulting in increased bicarbonate and sodium excretion (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors);
inhibition of chloride transport in the ascending loop (loop diuretics);
inhibition of sodium and calcium resorption in the distal tubules (thiazides); and
alteration of electrolyte transport in the distal tubules and collecting ducts (potassium sparing diuretics).

As noted above, it has been suggested that some cases of Ménière's disease may be caused by a viral infection. Consequently, there has been interest in the use of antiviral medication, such as aciclovir, to try and treat any underlying viral trigger.

The possibility of an allergic or autoimmune cause for the condition, together with presumed inflammation of the audiovestibular structures in the inner ear (Frejo 2017) has also led to trials of systemic steroids as a treatment for the disease, as these drugs are widely used for their anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.

### What is menière's disease? A contemporary re-evaluation of endolymphatic hydrops [^114Pe41z]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Recently, the Classification Committee of the Bárány Society formulated diagnostic criteria for MD jointly with several national and international organizations. The classification includes two categories: definite MD and probable MD. The diagnosis of definite MD is based on clinical criteria and requires the observation of an episodic vertigo syndrome associated with low- to medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing, tinnitus and/or fullness) in the affected ear. Duration of vertigo episodes is limited to a period between 20 min and 12 h. Probable MD is a broader concept defined by episodic vestibular symptoms (vertigo or dizziness) associated with fluctuating aural symptoms occurring in a period from 20 min to 24 h. These definitions unfortunately do not help the clinician in defining MD. One interesting difference is that the proposed definition does not include endolymphatic hydrops that was the original finding in the disease.

Recent novel imaging methods have made it possible to visualize EH with gadolinium contrasted 3T MRI. The AAO-HNS (1995) criteria include EH as landmark to define certain MD. Recently, Nakashima et al. suggested that the inner ear of all patients with suspected MD should be imaged and the classification as definite MD should include MRI evidence of EH. The authors propose that also monosymptomatic ears with EH could be treated as MD in the same way as in the 1972 AAO-HNS classification, which recognized vestibular MD and cochlear MD as one disease entity among the umbrella of MD. Supporting this idea, Pyykkö et al. reported that in about 20% of the patients with MD it can take more than 5 years and in 10% even more than 10 years before cochlear and vestibular symptoms will coincide.

To conclude, we propose that diagnosis of MD should be based on the presence of EH in addition to symptoms and that also monosymptomatic patients with EH be regarded as 'certain' MD cases. MRI investigations should be made more frequently in assessing MD than hitherto.

### A case series shows independent vestibular labyrinthine function after major surgical trauma to the human cochlea [^111KRFhm]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The perception of balance and spatial orientation is achieved and maintained by a complex set of sensorimotor control systems including input from the vestibular receptors in the inner ear. Diseases or trauma with disturbances of vestibular function result in dizziness and vertigo and exhibit a substantial impact on daily life in humans, especially for bilateral vestibular hypofunction. The receptors for both the sense of hearing and balance — the cochlear and vestibular sensory systems — are housed together in the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear and share the same fluids with a tightly regulated homeostasis. The fluid bathing the receptors of both systems, endolymph, is crucial for normal receptor function and the major generation of this fluid takes place in the stria vascularis of the cochlea.

Surgical approaches to each of these systems have adhered to a principle, that damage to the membranous labyrinth of either system will cause almost certain permanent loss of the receptor function of both systems. Although the overall clinical effect of minimally invasive surgical approaches to the cochlea (like a cochleostomy during cochlear implantation, CI) on the vestibular function is considered to be non-significant, CI may lead to vestibular dysfunction and dizziness in some patients –. Therefore, any inner ear surgery generally aims on 'atraumatic' surgical techniques. That principle, however, has been called into question because there have been anecdotal reports in individual patients of at least partial preservation of cochlear function after major surgical damage to the vestibular division and vice versa –.

Here we report for the first time (to the best of our knowledge) in a large case series, that after major trauma to the cochlea — cochlear removal to treat intracochlear schwannoma, removing the membranous labyrinth of the cochlea — the vestibular receptors continue to function normally, as shown by specific, objective tests of peripheral vestibular function before and after surgery.

These results demonstrate that under particular conditions, the cochlear and vestibular sensory systems can function independently, which has important implications for inner ear surgical procedures, and the development of neural interfaces of sensory prostheses for the auditory system and gene and cell-based inner ear therapies.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dizziness and vertigo, more specifically with respect to oculomotor assessment, SAEM 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain routine three-component head impulse-nystagmus-test of skew examination by clinicians trained in its use to distinguish between central (stroke) and peripheral (inner ear, usually vestibular neuritis) diagnoses in adult patients with acute vestibular syndrome with nystagmus presenting to the emergency department.

### Vestibular rehabilitation for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction [^1142huZ2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2007. Unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction (UPVD) can occur as a result of disease, trauma or postoperatively. The dysfunction is characterised by complaints of dizziness, visual or gaze disturbances and balance impairment. Current management includes medication, physical manoeuvres and exercise regimes, the latter known collectively as vestibular rehabilitation (VR).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation in the adult, community-dwelling population of people with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The most recent search was 1 July 2010, following a previous search in March 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of adults living in the community, diagnosed with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. We sought comparisons of VR versus control (placebo etc.), other treatment (non-VR, e.g. pharmacological) or another form of VR. We considered the outcome measures of frequency and severity of dizziness or visual disturbance; changes in balance impairment, function or quality of life; and measure/s of physiological status with known functional correlation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trials for risk of bias.

Main Results

We included 27 trials, involving 1668 participants, in the review. Trials addressed the effectiveness of VR against control/sham interventions, medical interventions or other forms of VR. Individual and pooled data showed a statistically significant effect in favour of VR over control or no intervention. The exception to this was when movement-based VR was compared to physical manoeuvres for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), where the latter was shown to be superior in cure rate in the short term. There were no reported adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate to strong evidence that VR is a safe, effective management for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, based on a number of high quality randomised controlled trials. There is moderate evidence that VR provides a resolution of symptoms and improvement in functioning in the medium term. However, there is evidence that for the specific diagnostic group of BPPV, physical (repositioning) manoeuvres are more effective in the short term than exercise-based vestibular rehabilitation; although a combination of the two is effective for longer-term functional recovery. There is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of VR.

### The epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^115RApgE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2002 and previously updated in 2004 and 2007. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterised by short-lived episodes of vertigo in association with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology clinics. Current treatment approaches include rehabilitative exercises and physical manoeuvres, including the Epley manoeuvre.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of the Epley manoeuvre for posterior canal BPPV.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 January 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of the Epley manoeuvre versus placebo, no treatment or other active treatment for adults diagnosed with posterior canal BPPV (including a positive Dix-Hallpike test). The primary outcome of interest was complete resolution of vertigo symptoms. Secondary outcomes were conversion of a 'positive' Dix-Hallpike test to a 'negative' Dix-Hallpike test and adverse effects of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 11 trials in the review with a total of 745 patients. Five studies compared the efficacy of the Epley manoeuvre against a sham manoeuvre, three against other particle repositioning manoeuvres (Semont, Brandt-Daroff and Gans) and three against a control (no treatment, medication only, postural restriction). Patients were treated in hospital otolaryngology departments in eight studies and family practices in two studies. All patients were adults aged 18 to 90 years old, with a sex ratio of 1:1.5 male to female. There was a low risk of overall bias in the studies included. All studies were randomised with six applying sealed envelope or external allocation techniques. Eight of the trials blinded the assessors to the participants' treatment group and data on all outcomes for all participants were reported in eight of the 11 studies. Complete resolution of vertigo Complete resolution of vertigo occurred significantly more often in the Epley treatment group when compared to a sham manoeuvre or control (odds ratio (OR) 4.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62 to 7.44; five studies, 273 participants); the proportion of patients resolving increased from 21% to 56%. None of the trials comparing Epley versus other particle repositioning manoeuvres reported vertigo resolution as an outcome. Conversion of Dix-Hallpike positional test result from positive to negative Conversion from a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test significantly favoured the Epley treatment group when compared to a sham manoeuvre or control (OR 9.62, 95% CI 6.0 to 15.42; eight studies, 507 participants). There was no difference when comparing the Epley with the Semont manoeuvre (two studies, 117 participants) or the Epley with the Gans manoeuvre (one study, 58 participants). In one study a single Epley treatment was more effective than a week of three times daily Brandt-Daroff exercises (OR 12.38, 95% CI 4.32 to 35.47; 81 participants). Adverse effects Adverse effects were infrequently reported. There were no serious adverse effects of treatment. Rates of nausea during the repositioning manoeuvre varied from 16.7% to 32%. Some patients were unable to tolerate the manoeuvres because of cervical spine problems.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that the Epley manoeuvre is a safe, effective treatment for posterior canal BPPV, based on the results of 11, mostly small, randomised controlled trials with relatively short follow-up. There is a high recurrence rate of BPPV after treatment (36%). Outcomes for Epley manoeuvre treatment are comparable to treatment with Semont and Gans manoeuvres, but superior to Brandt-Daroff exercises.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of adults living in the community, diagnosed with symptomatic unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction. We sought comparisons of vestibular rehabilitation versus control (e.g. placebo), other treatment (non-vestibular rehabilitation, e.g. pharmacological) or another form of vestibular rehabilitation. Our primary outcome measure was change in the specified symptomatology (for example, proportion with dizziness resolved, frequency or severity of dizziness). Secondary outcomes were measures of function, quality of life and/or measure(s) of physiological status, where reproducibility has been confirmed and shown to be relevant or related to health status (for example, posturography), and adverse effects

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 39 studies involving 2441 participants with unilateral peripheral vestibular disorders in the review. Trials addressed the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation against control/sham interventions, medical interventions or other forms of vestibular rehabilitation. Non-blinding of outcome assessors and selective reporting were threats that may have biased the results in 25% of studies, but otherwise there was a low risk of selection or attrition bias. Individual and pooled analyses of the primary outcome, frequency of dizziness, showed a statistically significant effect in favour of vestibular rehabilitation over control or no intervention (odds ratio (OR) 2.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85 to 3.86; four studies, 565 participants). Secondary outcomes measures related to levels of activity or participation measured, for example, with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, which also showed a strong trend towards significant differences between the groups (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.83, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.64). The exception to this was when movement-based vestibular rehabilitation was compared to physical manoeuvres for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), where the latter was shown to be superior in cure rate in the short term (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49). There were no reported adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate to strong evidence that vestibular rehabilitation is a safe, effective management for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, based on a number of high-quality randomised controlled trials. There is moderate evidence that vestibular rehabilitation resolves symptoms and improves functioning in the medium term. However, there is evidence that for the specific diagnostic group of BPPV, physical (repositioning) manoeuvres are more effective in the short term than exercise-based vestibular rehabilitation; although a combination of the two is effective for longer-term functional recovery. There is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of vestibular rehabilitation.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^11739NmF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Vertigo/dizziness at the time of intratympanic injection

Four studies reported a rate of vertigo/dizziness of between 1.5% (1/67) and 21% (4/19) for those who received an intratympanic injection (Ermutlu 2017; Huang 2021; Tong 2021; Tsounis 2018). We have included in this analysis all participants who received an intratympanic injection in these studies. For two studies, this included participants in another treatment arm. In Huang 2021, participants in the control arm also received intratympanic injection at a later point in the trial. In Tsounis 2018, data were reported for participants who received intratympanic corticosteroids alone, and combined therapy with intratympanic corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids. We concluded that the evidence is very uncertain regarding the risk of vertigo/dizziness at the time of intratympanic corticosteroid treatment as primary therapy (301 participants; 4 studies; very low‐certainty evidence).

Ear pain, timing not reported

Two studies contributed data to a meta‐analysis (Al‐Shehri 2015; Rauch 2011). The risk ratio was 15.68 (95% CI 6.22 to 39.49), favouring systemic corticosteroid. In each study, the number of participants with ear pain/earache was presented separately from the numbers with ear pain at intratympanic injection. It was assumed, therefore, that those participants with pain at injection were not included among those with ear pain/earache. We concluded that intratympanic corticosteroid injection probably increases the risk of ear pain as compared to systemic corticosteroid when used as primary treatment (289 participants; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Ear pain at the time of injection

Three studies reported a rate of ear pain from 4.8% (5/104) to 27.1% (35/129) (Al‐Shehri 2015; Huang 2021; Rauch 2011). In Al‐Shehri 2015 and Rauch 2011, the number of participants with ear pain/earache was presented separately from the numbers with ear pain at intratympanic injection. It was assumed, therefore, that those participants with pain at injection were not included among those with ear pain/earache. The evidence suggests that there is a risk of ear pain at the time of intratympanic injection of corticosteroid as primary treatment (393 participants; 3 studies; low‐certainty evidence).

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^115ABtEt]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Ménière's disease

Ménière's disease is characterized by recurrent spontaneous attacks of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Its incidence varies between 7.5 per 100,000 and 160 per 100,000 persons (for review, see). Endolymphatic hydrops is assumed to be the pathological basis of Ménière's disease and is thought to arise due to either excessive production or inadequate absorption of endolymph. The increased endolymphatic pressure causes periodic rupturing of, or leakage from, the membrane separating the endolymphatic from the perilymphatic space (by the opening of nonselective, stretch-activated ion channels). Therefore, aims of treatment include reducing the production and increasing the absorption of endolymph. The clinical aims of treatment are to stop vertigo attacks, reduce or abolish tinnitus, and preserve or even reverse hearing loss. Most treatment studies have focused on reducing the attacks of vertigo, which are the severest symptom of Ménière's disease.

### Treatment of vertigo [^114T3Wn1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Vertigo is the illusion of motion, usually rotational motion. As patients age, vertigo becomes an increasingly common presenting complaint. The most common causes of this condition are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, migraine, and anxiety disorders. Less common causes include vertebrobasilar ischemia and retrocochlear tumors. The distinction between peripheral and central vertigo usually can be made clinically and guides management decisions. Most patients with vertigo do not require extensive diagnostic testing and can be treated in the primary care setting. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo usually improves with a canalith repositioning procedure. Acute vestibular neuronitis or labyrinthitis improves with initial stabilizing measures and a vestibular suppressant medication, followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Meniere's disease often responds to the combination of a low-salt diet and diuretics. Vertiginous migraine headaches generally improve with dietary changes, a tricyclic antidepressant, and a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker. Vertigo associated with anxiety usually responds to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

### Current and emerging medical therapies for dizziness [^115jLcuo]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Medical therapies for dizziness are aimed at vertigo reduction, secondary symptom management, or the root cause of the pathologic process. Acute peripheral vertigo pharmacotherapies include antihistamines, calcium channel blockers, and benzodiazepines. Prophylactic pharmacotherapies vary between causes. For Meniere disease, betahistine and diuretics remain initial first-line oral options, whereas intratympanic steroids and intratympanic gentamicin are reserved for uncontrolled symptoms. For cerebellar dizziness and oculomotor disorders, 4-aminopyridine may provide benefit. For vestibular migraine, persistent postural perceptual dizziness and mal de débarquement, treatment options overlap and include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and calcium channel blockers.

### Diphenhydramine, sodium bicarbonate, or combination for acute peripheral vertigo: a randomized clinical trial [^115hmbKE]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Vertigo is a spinning sensation often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. In Taiwan, approximately 3.1% of adults are affected by vertigo, with approximately 37% experiencing recurrence within 1 year. The sensation of disequilibrium, along with severe nausea and vomiting, often compels patients with vertigo to seek emergency department (ED) assistance.

In the ED, the primary task in the management of acute vertigo is differentiating life-threatening central vertigo. Intravenous injection therapy is often used to quickly alleviate peripheral vertigo symptoms. A recent meta-analysis reported that antihistamines, compared with benzodiazepines, significantly improved vertigo symptoms while demonstrating comparable effectiveness with other treatment regimens. However, approximately 15% to 26% of patients experience fatigue after intravenous administration of antihistamines. This fatigue may prolong the observation period in the ED. In addition, there is an increased fall risk after treatment with antihistamines, particularly among older individuals. Therefore, several studies aimed to investigate more suitable treatment approaches for patients with acute vertigo.,

Sodium bicarbonate has traditionally been used to treat acute hyperkalemia, acidosis, and blood and urine alkalinization. There have been reports of sodium bicarbonate use in the treatment of dizziness and vertigo in Taiwan and Japan. Possible mechanisms include increased inner ear perfusion and medial vestibular nucleus neural inhibition. Unlike antihistamines and benzodiazepines, sodium bicarbonate does not cause drowsiness, fatigue, or other severe adverse effects. However, to date, no standardized comparison report has evaluated the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in the treatment of peripheral vertigo.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate alone and in combination with an antihistamine compared with an antihistamine alone as treatment for acute peripheral vertigo in patients visiting the ED. We considered that these 2 treatments have different mechanisms of action; therefore, we hypothesized that the 3 treatment approaches would exhibit different efficacies.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^114Q6RYC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) for acute vertigo in Ménière's disease (MD) is described as previously discouraged and currently supported by limited evidence, noting that a prior guideline "recommended stopping VR for patients with acute vertigo and fluctuating vestibular function from active MD based on level 5 evidence". A Cochrane review "found no studies specifically addressing the use of VR in the treatment of acute vertigo; however, the review found no evidence of harm for any patient receiving VR for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction". An evidence assessment "reported that VR is optional in the management of acute vertiginous attacks of MD patients", yet "no RCTs regarding benefits or harms for VR in this setting" were found, and a later review "found no evidence of reduction of frequency or severity of acute vertigo attacks from the literature but also identified no harms from VR". The optional stance was linked to "nonblinded research from an RCT that utilized virtual reality VR and reported lower subjective dizziness symptoms on the DHI among active MD patients receiving therapy". Overall, "there is a lack of evidence to support the use of VR to mitigate the severity or frequency of acute vertigo episodes in patients with MD", and any potential subjective improvement "must be weighed against the potential harms of the costs incurred and time invested in VR".

### Inner ear changes with intracochlear gentamicin administration in Guinea pigs [^1135Kw6x]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Transtympanic administration of gentamicin is reported to be a useful treatment for vertigo in such conditions as Meniere's disease, and determining appropriate clinical dosage of gentamicin is difficult. The authors examined the relation between gentamicin dosages and inner ear function in guinea pigs.

Study Design

This study is a basic science project designed to examine cochlear and vestibular function in animal models.

Methods

Various concentrations of gentamicin solution were infused into the right inner ear of guinea pigs by osmotic pumps. Caloric nystagmus as a marker of vestibular function and the change in auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold as a marker of cochlear function were observed.

Results

After 14 days of treatment, high gentamicin concentrations of 40 mg/mL caused canal paralysis and a rapid shift in ABR threshold. Animals exposed to low gentamicin concentrations of 4 mg/mL showed no obvious change in either vestibular or cochlear function. Animals exposed to moderate gentamicin concentrations of 12 mg/mL showed a moderate shift in ABR threshold and caloric malfunction. Histopathological examination revealed that after 14 days of treatment with 40 mg/mL gentamicin, severe cytoplasmic damage occurred in both vestibular and cochlear end organs. In animals treated with 12 mg/mL gentamicin, hair cells remained in the cochlear third turn and ampulla of the lateral semicircular canal.

Conclusion

The authors established an animal model that showed the moderate damage of inner ear with moderate-dose gentamicin. The study results indicated that the appropriate administration of gentamicin could establish a stable effect on the inner ear. It may be important to select the protocol that delivers a stable dosage of gentamicin to treat patients with Meniere's disease safely and effectively.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^116DKWtt]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — Persistent symptoms after initial therapy and reevaluation — Patients with persistent symptoms of vertigo, dizziness, or unsteadiness after initial therapy for BPPV are classified as treatment failures, which require reevaluation because (1) persistent BPPV may be present and responsive to additional maneuvers, (2) coexisting vestibular conditions may be present that can be identified and treated, and (3) serious central nervous system (CNS) disorders may simulate BPPV and need to be identified; reevaluation is advisable and should include history and determining if vertigo is positional, the Dix-Hallpike test should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis, and if still positive, repeat canalith repositioning maneuvers can then be performed as a preferred treatment; failure rates of VR or a single-session CRP range from 8% to 50%, successful treatment with additional maneuvers reaches 90% to 98%, and for refractory failures surgical plugging or singular neurectomy has a > 96% success rate although data quality precludes definitive recommendations.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^112b1x5y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Otologic disorders causing vertigo — clinical features distinguishing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) from other entities are outlined. BPPV is characterized by acute, discrete episodes of brief positional vertigo without associated hearing loss. Ménière's disease involves discrete episodic attacks with sustained vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, aural fullness, and tinnitus; the vertigo typically lasts longer (usually on the order of hours), is not triggered by any obligate head position changes, and diagnosis requires an associated contemporaneous decline in sensorineural hearing, with protracted nausea and vomiting more common. Acute peripheral vestibular dysfunction (vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis) presents with sudden, unanticipated, severe vertigo with a subjective sensation of rotational (room spinning) motion; if the auditory portion of the inner ear is affected, hearing loss and tinnitus may occur (consistent with labyrinthitis), and these syndromes are commonly preceded by a viral prodrome. The time course differentiates these from BPPV: in vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis the vertigo is of gradual onset, developing over several hours, followed by a sustained level of vertigo lasting days to weeks; vertigo is present at rest but may be exacerbated by positional changes. Superior canal dehiscence (SCD) causes attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia brought on by loud sounds, Valsalva maneuvers, or pressure changes of the external auditory canals and differs from BPPV in that vertigo is induced by pressure changes and not position changes. A perilymph fistula can produce episodes of vertigo and nystagmus triggered by pressure, can occur after surgery involving the middle ear or mastoid region or spontaneously, and may be accompanied by a fluctuating hearing loss. Posttraumatic vertigo can present with vertigo, disequilibrium, tinnitus, and headache.

Skull fracture and, in particular, temporal bone fracture, were significantly associated with the presence of BPPV, replicating findings from a previous single-centre study in TBI. The rate of bilateral BPPV in the present study is somewhat higher in comparison to previous subacute studies, a factor, alongside skull fracture, which was also linked to BPPV recurrence. The overall recurrence rate of BPPV in the present study is not dissimilar to previous research. However, recurrences noted in our data occurred during a much shorter follow-up period. Therefore, the optimal timing of treatment for patients at risk of recurrence remains unclear. Until this is established, we propose that the best clinical practice would be to closely monitor patients with bilateral or more complex BPPV and consider the provision of earlier follow-up. The mechanisms of BPPV recurrence are intriguing. An animal model of TBI showed persistent otoconial shedding over 12 weeks post-injury, while histopathological evidence noted degeneration of the utricle and semi-circular canals. If there are ongoing processes inimical for recovery of inner ear structure and function via inner ear hair cell regeneration or degeneration, then a single, acute repositioning treatment for patients with post-TBI BPPV may well be insufficient. We speculate the link noted between bilateral BPPV and/or skull fracture and recurrence is mediated by the amount of force sustained to the head at the time of injury. Higher forces may worsen inner ear ultrastructural damage and/or brain injury and, thus, lead to more protracted or less complete recovery.

The guideline, Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, was updated by the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery and categorized as Affirmation of Value by American Academy of Family Physicians. See the full recommendation for further details, including specifics about the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and a treatment algorithm. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America.

To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

14 It results from loose stones, called canaliths, that get stuck in the semicircular canals. In up to 70% of cases in older patients, there is no apparent traumatic, ischemic, infectious, or inflammatory cause; however, young adults present with head trauma as the leading risk factor. 19 The most effective treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is repositioning procedures, 19, 20 such as the Epley maneuver. Repositioning maneuvers are more effective when certain canals are affected. Epley maneuvers are effective for posterior canal canaliths; however, other maneuvers are more effective at repositioning stones in the horizontal canal. 14 The success rate for the Epley maneuver is nearly 100%. 19 Some patients, especially those with trauma-related benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, require more repetitions of the repositioning maneuvers.

21 If there is no improvement with repeated maneuvers, or the patient develops atypical nystagmus or nausea, a different cause should be considered.
14. In addition to repositioning, evidence supports vestibular rehabilitation as safe and effective. It includes activities to help patients coordinate their balance, vision, and muscle movements to decrease the impact of dizziness and imbalance. The best long-term outcomes involve a combination of vestibular rehabilitation and repositioning maneuvers. 22 Patients refractory to these treatments may need to be evaluated by otolaryngology or neurology. Pharmacologic treatments, including antihistamines and benzodiazepines, are generally not indicated because they interfere with the patient's ability to centrally compensate, which increases the risk of falls. 11 One meta-analysis of seven studies found that replacing vitamin D in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vitamin D deficiency lowered recurrence.

The mainstay of treatment for vestibular neuritis is reassurance, explaining the expected disease course and resolution, symptomatic treatment, and vestibular rehabilitation. 9, 11 Vestibular rehabilitation is time-consuming to perform in the office, but using an interprofessional approach with physical therapy may allow others to do the teaching. 27 Antiemetic medications can be used for symptomatic treatment, but it is important to note that they often block central compensation. Antihistamines, antiemetics, and benzodiazepines treat vertigo associated with nausea caused by vestibular neuritis.
