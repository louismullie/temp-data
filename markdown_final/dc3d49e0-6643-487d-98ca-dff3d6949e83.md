## Question

Finger pain and swelling after fall

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage finger pain and swelling after a fall, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate red flags and the initial history and exam priorities. Then, I should verify the imaging strategy and how it changes management. Next, I will consider injury-specific diagnoses and their treatments, followed by edema control and rehabilitation. After that, I need to check for complications and when to refer. Finally, I will review special populations and summarize a practical algorithm, ensuring each step is supported by evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the red flags and immediate priorities because missing compartment syndrome, open fractures, or high-energy perilunate injuries would be consequential; I should ask about mechanism, exact location, deformity, neurovascular symptoms, and systemic features, and I must examine for malalignment, open wounds, capillary refill, two-point discrimination, and Kanavel signs for flexor tenosynovitis, while remembering that severe pain out of proportion with passive stretch and tense compartments mandate urgent surgical consultation even before pressure measurements if the clinical picture is compelling [^113eapTE] [^114ETYWW] [^114Lybyn].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging approach before jumping to conclusions; for any suspected fracture or dislocation, three-view radiographs are standard, and I should obtain AP, lateral, and oblique views of the specific finger or hand region, escalating to CT for suspected carpal fractures like the hamate or capitate that are often occult on plain films, and using ultrasound or MRI when soft-tissue injuries such as pulley tears or jersey finger are suspected or when radiographs are nondiagnostic but clinical suspicion remains high [^116tLvG1] [^111nPUB7] [^116CziPa] [^114jw5HX].

> I will now examine distal phalanx injuries; subungual hematoma after a crush mechanism presents with throbbing pain and discoloration, and if painful or enlarging, nail trephination relieves pressure, while I should also check for associated nail bed lacerations and obtain radiographs to exclude distal phalanx fracture, noting that recent evidence suggests no clear cosmetic advantage to routine nail bed repair over observation in many cases, though I need to ensure no complex or open injuries are present before choosing observation [^1117wo72] [^112B8L3J] [^113WTfKz].

> Hold on, I should verify mallet finger specifics; loss of active DIP extension with a tender dorsal DIP and possible extensor lag indicates terminal extensor disruption, and I need to splint the DIP in neutral or slight hyperextension for 6–8 weeks continuously, then 2 additional weeks at night, keeping the PIP free, and I must obtain radiographs to distinguish tendinous from bony mallet and refer for surgical options if the avulsion involves more than one-third of the articular surface or there is volar subluxation [^111ryLCb] [^113qcmBo] [^117K5F5q].

> Let me consider jersey finger carefully; inability to actively flex the DIP with a palpable volar mass suggests FDP avulsion, often the ring finger, and I should splint the finger and arrange urgent hand surgery referral because delayed treatment risks tendon retraction and compromised outcomes, using imaging to localize the retracted stump and plan repair [^111KkECT] [^114kzyN7].

> Next, I should review DIP and PIP dislocations; visible deformity with swelling and limited motion is typical, and closed reduction with a digital block followed by splinting in the correct position is standard, with volar DIP dislocations splinted in full extension and dorsal DIP dislocations in 15–30 degrees of flexion for 2–3 weeks, while PIP dislocations often need buddy taping and early motion once stable, and I should obtain post-reduction radiographs to confirm alignment and screen for associated avulsion fractures [^112EGFQF] [^112v8j7p] [^116tLvG1].

> I need to ensure I do not miss volar plate and collateral ligament injuries; a hyperextension mechanism with tenderness and instability suggests volar plate or collateral damage, and buddy taping with early protected motion is appropriate for stable injuries, whereas marked instability or large avulsion fragments warrant referral for possible surgical stabilization [^116tLvG1].

> Let me think about edema control because persistent swelling drives stiffness and dysfunction; elevation above heart level, ice, and compression with low-stretch bandaging or a custom compression glove are foundational, and adding manual edema mobilization and structured exercises accelerates recovery, with evidence showing custom compression gloves reduce hand and finger swelling and improve pain and function after distal radius fracture and can be extrapolated to finger trauma care pathways [^1132qqYm] [^113EcHVo].

> But wait, what if swelling is asymmetric, tense, and pain is severe with passive stretch; I should double-check for compartment syndrome of the hand or forearm, measure compartment pressures when feasible, and proceed to emergent fasciotomy if elevated, recognizing that thenar and forearm compartments can be involved even without direct forearm trauma in some high-energy or crush mechanisms [^116SBHGw] [^111m7AKt] [^114Lybyn].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence and rehabilitation milestones; for stable injuries, reassess at 48–72 hours for swelling and splint fit, then weekly for 2–3 weeks to monitor alignment and initiate early protected motion, emphasizing tendon gliding and composite flexion-extension once pain allows, and counseling that swelling can persist for weeks to months after PIP sprains, which is common and prognostically meaningful [^1113j1Wm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic or atypical swelling; if pain and swelling persist beyond 3–6 months or the presentation is atypical, I should reconsider infection including indolent osteomyelitis, inflammatory arthropathies, neoplasm such as acrometastasis, and complex regional pain syndrome, and I must correlate with labs, targeted imaging, and a careful exam for distal generalization and autonomic changes before labeling CRPS [^113egoQm] [^1143fwTQ] [^1178E4oy].

> Let me verify special populations; in children, growth plate injuries and plastic deformation are more common, so I should have a lower threshold for imaging and referral, and in older adults with low-energy trauma, I should consider osteoporosis risk and fragility fractures, while in patients with sickle cell disease, dactylitis from vaso-occlusion can mimic infection and requires supportive care and disease-specific management [^113NdLas] [^112ejnJ6] [^112rJx2B].

> I should double-check that my summary algorithm is coherent: screen for red flags and neurovascular status, obtain three-view radiographs for suspected fractures or dislocations, treat specific injuries with evidence-based splinting and timely referral, control edema with elevation, ice, and compression plus early motion, monitor closely for compartment syndrome and stiffness, and escalate evaluation for persistent or atypical symptoms to avoid missed infections, malignancies, or CRPS [^116tLvG1] [^1132qqYm] [^1178E4oy].

Finger pain and swelling after a fall most often reflects a **sprain, fracture, or tendon injury** [^116tLvG1] [^114k1GQq]. Immediate care includes **rest, ice, elevation, and buddy taping** [^114k1GQq]. Obtain **three-view radiographs** [^116tLvG1] if deformity, severe pain, or limited motion is present to exclude fracture or dislocation [^112v8j7p]. If red flags appear — severe pain with pallor, numbness, or uncontrolled swelling — **evaluate urgently for compartment syndrome** [^116SBHGw] or infection [^113eapTE]. Most injuries heal with **conservative care**, but persistent swelling, instability, or functional loss after 2–3 weeks warrants hand specialist referral [^116tLvG1].

---

## Common causes of finger pain and swelling after a fall

- **Sprains and ligament injuries**: The proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is particularly vulnerable to ligamentous injury, often resulting in prolonged swelling, stiffness, and dysfunction [^1113j1Wm].

- **Fractures**: Distal phalanx, middle phalanx, and proximal phalanx fractures are common after falls, particularly in the elderly or those with osteoporosis [^notfound].

- **Tendon injuries**: Mallet finger (extensor tendon rupture) [^111ryLCb] and jersey finger (flexor digitorum profundus avulsion) [^111KkECT] are classic post-fall injuries presenting with pain, swelling, and loss of active motion.

- **Dislocations**: Dorsal dislocation of the PIP or DIP joint is common, often requiring reduction and immobilization [^115XQPw5].

- **Soft tissue injuries**: Contusions, lacerations, and nail bed injuries frequently occur, particularly at the fingertip [^113m7y9u].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

### History

History should document the **mechanism of injury** (direction of force, point of impact, hand position), the **time course** of pain and swelling, and any prior finger injuries or relevant medical conditions (e.g. osteoporosis, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis). Also assess functional impact, including loss of motion, weakness, and difficulty with daily activities [^1113j1Wm].

---

### Physical examination

- **Inspection**: Look for deformity, ecchymosis, lacerations, nail bed injury, and asymmetry [^116tLvG1].

- **Palpation**: Identify focal tenderness, crepitus, or instability [^112H54jF].

- **Range of motion**: Assess active and passive motion at the DIP, PIP, and MCP joints [^112VQQrh].

- **Neurovascular assessment**: Evaluate capillary refill, pulse, and sensation [^1178E4oy].

- **Special tests**: Elson test for central slip injury, Kanavel signs for flexor tenosynovitis [^1117whbe].

---

### Imaging

Obtain **plain radiographs** (AP, lateral, oblique) for suspected fracture, dislocation, or mallet finger [^116tLvG1]. Use **ultrasound** for suspected tendon or ligament injury, particularly pulley injuries [^116CziPa]. Reserve **MRI** for complex soft tissue injuries or when diagnosis remains unclear after initial evaluation [^116CziPa].

---

## Management strategies

### Initial management (RICE protocol)

Initial management emphasizes **rest** — avoid activities that exacerbate pain or swelling — and **ice** applied for 15–20 minutes every 1–2 hours during the first 48 hours. Elevate the hand above heart level to reduce edema, and apply compression with buddy taping or a soft splint for support [^114k1GQq].

---

### Specific injuries and their management

| **Injury type** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Sprain | - Buddy taping <br/> - Early motion <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Hand therapy if stiffness persists [^notfound] |
| Fracture | - Immobilization (splint/cast) <br/> - Reduction if displaced <br/> - Surgery for unstable or intra-articular fractures [^116tLvG1] |
| Mallet finger | - Continuous DIP splinting in slight hyperextension for 6–8 weeks <br/> - Surgery for large avulsion fragments or failure of conservative treatment [^111ryLCb] |
| Jersey finger | - Immediate referral to hand surgeon <br/> - Surgical repair within 7–10 days [^114kzyN7] |
| Dislocation | - Closed reduction <br/> - Immobilization <br/> - Surgery for irreducible or unstable dislocations [^116tLvG1] |
| Soft tissue injury | - Wound care <br/> - Antibiotics if contaminated <br/> - Tetanus prophylaxis <br/> - Surgical repair for large lacerations [^114xs6ae] |

---

### Rehabilitation and physical therapy

Rehabilitation should begin with **early, gentle range-of-motion exercises** to prevent stiffness once acute pain subsides. Progressive strengthening targets intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles, and edema-control strategies include manual lymphatic drainage, compression gloves, and elevation [^1132qqYm] [^113EcHVo]. Functional training focuses on activities of daily living and gradual return to pre-injury function [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

- **Stiffness and loss of motion**: Particularly common after PIP joint injuries [^1113j1Wm].

- **Chronic pain**: May develop due to ongoing inflammation or nerve injury [^1113j1Wm].

- **Deformity**: Mallet finger can progress to swan neck deformity if untreated [^111ryLCb].

- **Instability**: Persistent ligamentous laxity leading to chronic instability [^112vHEG4].

- **Infection**: Risk with open injuries or inadequate wound care [^1117whbe].

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: Rare but serious complication characterized by severe pain, swelling, and autonomic changes [^1178E4oy].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Unstable or intra-articular fractures**: Require surgical intervention [^notfound].

- **Tendon injuries**: Mallet finger with large avulsion fragments, jersey finger, or suspected flexor/extensor tendon ruptures [^114PQSkx] [^114kzyN7].

- **Irreducible dislocations**: Require surgical reduction and stabilization [^notfound].

- **Persistent swelling or stiffness**: Beyond 2–3 weeks despite conservative treatment [^notfound].

- **Suspected compartment syndrome**: Severe pain, pallor, paresthesia, or pulselessness [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

Mild sprains or contusions typically heal within **2–4 weeks** with full return to function. Stable fractures generally heal in **4–6 weeks**, whereas unstable or intra-articular fractures may require longer and sometimes surgery. Tendon injuries such as mallet finger require 6–8 weeks of immobilization, with full recovery taking 3–6 months, while jersey finger needs surgical repair and 3–6 months of rehabilitation. Dislocations usually recover in 2–4 weeks after reduction and immobilization, though persistent stiffness is common [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures and precautions

Preventive measures include **protective equipment** — gloves and finger splints during high-risk activities — and **education** on proper fall techniques and hand positioning. Address modifiable risk factors such as osteoporosis and balance deficits to reduce fall risk [^notfound].

---

Finger pain and swelling after a fall are most often due to sprains, fractures, or tendon injuries. Most cases resolve with **conservative care**, but persistent symptoms or red flags require specialist evaluation to prevent complications and ensure optimal recovery [^11326HkW].

### Volumetry of hand and forearm: a 3D volumetric approach [^116HEgpH]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Swelling and edema of the hand and forearm are frequent symptoms with a broad variety of different causes in orthopedic and trauma surgery. Overload of tissue fluid and its deranged circulation lead to an increased circumference of this region. Common reasons for this pathophysiologic imbalance are injuries of these regions, such as distal radius fractures; fractures of the carpus, metacarpus, or fingers; and infections of different origins. -

These pathologies often require a surgical treatment. Definitive therapy is almost always recommended after at least significant reduction of swelling as soft tissue complications due to swelling and edema are generally named causal for serious complications within surgical treatment of these injuries.

Therefore, the extent of soft tissue swelling and its objective evaluation are indispensable for the determination of the optimal time point for definitive surgery. Moreover, inclusion of swelling conditions can be crucial in the process and progress of postsurgical evaluation and for hand therapy. An objective and early detection and evaluation of swelling could help with indications for potential revision surgeries, the initiation of necessary actions, and thereby avoid protracted courses and further complications, such as the complex region pain syndrome.

Currently, there is no consensus on the best measuring method. The ideal method for circumferential measurements should be objective, noninvasive, fast, and inexpensive. Certain methods have been described for detecting and measuring the circumference and volume of several areas of the human body, including bioelectrical impedance and subjective tape measurements. To date, circumference tape measurements and water displacement are commonly the criterion standard method for the diagnosis and evaluation of swelling and edema in the clinical routine.

However, the abovementioned methods for detecting circumferences and volumes of different body regions, including tape measurement and water displacement, are mostly imprecise and have underlying subjective bias.

In the last decade, technological developments of 3-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques have led to the development of special 3D scanners that evolved to be precise, objective, and noninvasive. Such devices could serve as objective and accurate tools for volume assessments.

### Case report: acute forearm compartment syndrome due to sudden, forceful supination of the hand [^116SBHGw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome is a limb-threatening condition if not recognized and treated promptly. Appropriate management includes early fasciotomy, which often results in better functional outcomes. Although there are many causes of compartment syndrome, the common findings are significant pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. Diagnosis is usually based on physical findings in the setting of a compelling history. Before surgical intervention, the diagnosis is usually confirmed by measuring elevated compartment pressures. The patient described in this case report developed acute compartment syndrome of the forearm after his hand became trapped in machinery that applied sudden supination to the hand, and avulsed the distal portion of the left index finger. There was no direct trauma to the forearm. In this case, acute compartment syndrome was likely due to a combination of contained hemorrhage into the muscle sheath, closed muscle strain causing edema, and possibly axial traction applied to the tendons of the index finger. Acute compartment syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient complaining of severe pain in an extremity, even in the absence of commonly recognized mechanisms of injury.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^116Z3pH9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

In some cases, it was reported that other symptoms (such as pain) were present before swelling occurred. For example, the quotation below suggests that the individual was experiencing problems before their swelling appeared.

"I think I probably would have tolerated it for a while… I was trying to figure out what was going on because I had been seeing my physiotherapist on a regular basis and, I finally noticed myself one night that my legs seemed swollen, which kind of said to me, you know: 'Is there a blood pressure thing going on here, or what's going on here?'".

However, this was not always the case. In some instances, it was suggested that swelling occurred first and that joint pain occurred later.

"My fingers all of a sudden started to swell. Then gradually these became very painful. I thought it was because of the heat. It was summer time, and you know how your feet swell sometimes and that was my thought".

Theme 2: pain and tenderness

Where the onset of RA symptoms was slow, descriptors such as "diffuse", "gradual", or "episodic" were used to describe symptoms. In these circumstances, pain was often described as "mild", "vague", and "non-disabling", making it very difficult for people to understand its cause (with some attributing their symptoms to exertion or minor trauma). The vagueness of symptoms was emphasized, with symptoms being described as "everyday aches and pains" or "twinges". These early symptoms were described as a nuisance, but usually became more severe and were then associated with functional impairment.

"It was harrowing. When I got up in the morning my feet were so painful I couldn't stand on them. I would slide out of bed and with my elbow and rump get into the bathroom. I learned to turn the faucets with my elbows".

### The case of a painful blue thumb [^114TezeX]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Raynaud syndrome — Incorrect. Raynaud syndrome is the abnormal vasoconstriction of digital arteries and arterioles because of cold temperatures, emotional stress, or systemic disease. Although it may cause pain, it usually lasts for 15 to 20 minutes and is characterized by multiple discolorations (eg, white, blue, red).
B. Polyarteritis nodosa — Incorrect. Several vasculitides (eg, Takayasu arteritis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis) may result in digital purpura. However, these vasculitides are often associated with other systemic findings and do not follow a benign cyclical pattern.
C. Arterial embolism — Incorrect. Although an arterial embolus causes acute pain and discoloration, patients typically have subsequent tissue necrosis, rather than spontaneous resolution, without intervention.
D. Achenbach syndrome — Correct. This is a case of Achenbach syndrome, a rare, self-limiting condition of unknown etiology that predominantly affects middle-aged women. The syndrome is characterized by recurrent paroxysmal hematoma in the fingers, often in the left hand. Clinically, patients present with a sudden burning pain and cyanosis in 1 or more digits (usually the index or middle finger, and less commonly the thumb) that may be associated with swelling, pruritus, coldness, and restricted digit movement, followed by spontaneous resolution without treatment. In the absence of concerning history or alarm symptoms and signs (eg, fever, hypertension, nonpalpable pulses, cutaneous necrosis or ulceration), the diagnosis is established clinically and does not require further testing or procedures.
E. Traumatic hematoma — Incorrect. The patient denied history of repeated trauma or conditions that increase vascular fragility such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

### Thorn-induced osteomyelitis of the metacarpal of the index finger in a paediatric patient [^113egoQm]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We report a case of a girl in mid childhood, who presented with a 2-month history of painless swelling on the dorsum of her right hand, with an unclear history of fall while playing, around 4months prior to presentation to us. The child remained asymptomatic during the interim period. Radiographs and ultrasonography were suggestive of osteomyelitis of the index finger metacarpal of the right hand. However, routine blood tests and inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal. She was provisionally diagnosed as a case of chronic osteomyelitis of the index finger metacarpal of the right hand. Surgical exploration showed the presence of an intramedullary foreign body (thorn), along with associated changes in the bone, periosteum and tendon sheath. Removal of the thorn and administration of appropriate antibiotics resulted in complete recovery. This case report highlights the importance of carefully evaluating subtle or non-specific patient histories. It also emphasises the need to consider thorn-induced osteomyelitis as a differential diagnosis, particularly in paediatric patients belonging to rural areas presenting with osteomyelitis of the hand or foot, even in the absence of a clear history of trauma or abnormal blood parameters.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: flexor tenosynovitis [^113eapTE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) is a deep space infection of an upper extremity digit which carries a high rate of morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of FTS, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

FTS typically occurs after direct penetrating trauma to the volar aspect of an upper extremity digit. Development of a deep space infection that quickly propagates through the flexor tendon sheath of a digit can result in serious structural damage to the hand and place the patient at risk for significant morbidity such as finger amputation or even result in death. Signs of FTS include symmetrical swelling of the affected finger, the affected finger being held in a flexed position, pain on any attempt of passive finger extension, and tenderness along the course of flexor tendon sheath, known as the Kanavel signs. Systemic symptoms such as fevers and chills may occur. Recognition of these signs and symptoms is paramount in diagnosis of FTS, as laboratory and imaging assessment is not typically diagnostic. ED management involves intravenous antibiotics and emergent surgical specialist consultation.

Conclusion

An understanding of the presentation and risk factors for development of FTS can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease in an expedited fashion.

### The case of a painful blue thumb [^113SKuDP]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Brief history

A 65-year-old woman presented for evaluation of a tender, purple discoloration of her left thumb and index finger that had recurred monthly for 3 years (Fig 1). Her symptoms started as an intense burning sensation followed by mild swelling and purple discoloration that spontaneously resolve after 3 to 7 days. She had no systemic symptoms or triggers such as trauma, cold temperatures, or medications. She received metoprolol for supraventricular tachycardia and had Raynaud syndrome, which presented differently. Physical examination revealed a purpuric patch on the palmar aspect of the left thumb, extending onto the dorsal distal aspect of the phalanx. A punch biopsy was performed.

### Acute blue finger syndrome: a rare benign cause of acute digit discolouration [^111eBnDH]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute blue finger syndrome is a rare benign condition that mimics digital ischaemia. We discuss the case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with a 6hour history of blue discolouration of the middle finger of the right hand, associated with pain and swelling. There was no history of trauma and this was the first time that the patient had experienced these symptoms. Examination found blue discolouration of the digit primarily on the volar aspect with associated swelling. All investigations, including blood tests, X-rays and Doppler scanning, were normal. The symptoms resolved spontaneously within 48hours. There were no recurrent episodes or long-term sequelae. Patients presenting with an acutely blue finger need rapid assessment to exclude digit ischaemia. Knowledge of this rare benign condition may prevent unnecessary distress, invasive investigations and potentially harmful treatment of a healthy patient.

### A case of unilateral extremity swelling [^115n6M6s]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 33-year-old woman presented with swelling of the left arm that had persisted for 2 years with pain. The swelling involved her forearm, hand, and fingers. There was no preceding trauma, drug use, travel, or arthralgia. She denied any relevant family history. Physical examination showed nonpitting, 2+ edema of her left forearm (Figs 1 and 2). There was tenderness but no synovitis, erythema, or other rash. Limb length was symmetric with full range of motion, and there was no lymphadenopathy of her axilla. Her other extremities and breast examination results were normal. Mammography, Doppler ultrasonography, and electromyography results were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast coronal sections showed soft-tissue and superficial fascial edema of the left forearm and wrist (Fig 3).

### Two cases of thenar compartment syndrome from blunt trauma [^111m7AKt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Compartment syndrome is a limb-threatening complication associated with extremity trauma. The existence of compartment syndrome involving the thenar space is considered controversial and has not been reported in association with blunt traumatic injury of the hand.

Objective

We report two cases involving compartment syndrome of the thenar space in association with blunt trauma to the hand.

Case Report

Patient A was a young man who suffered a fracture/dislocation of the right thumb after a fall. Compartment pressures were measured at 70 mm Hg in the thenar space. The patient underwent successful fasciotomy and K-wire stabilization of the thumb and was ultimately discharged with good function on day 4. Patient B suffered a crush injury of the right hand and presented with diffuse swelling associated with median nerve paresthesia. Radiographs revealed a fracture of the triquetrum and of the base of the third metacarpal bone. The patient underwent multiple fasciotomies of the hand, including a release of the thenar space. He was discharged on day 2 with improving function of his thumb.

Conclusion

Compartment syndrome of the thenar space may be more common than previously reported. Given the limited time frame after which permanent damage occurs, clinicians should consider measurement of thenar compartment pressures in high-risk injuries.

### Consensus on a multidisciplinary treatment guideline for de quervain disease: results from the European HANDGUIDE study [^114cYB7n]. Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for de Quervain's tenosynovitis, more specifically with respect to postoperative care, HANDGUIDE 2014 guidelines recommend to advise patients on the following for the first 10–14 days postoperatively:

- elevate the hand above heart level to prevent swelling

- move the fingers to prevent scar adhesions

- refrain from heavy lifting or forceful activities until 2–6 weeks after surgery

- rest the hand and avoid thumb activity (splinting can be used).

### Hamate body and capitate fracture in punch injury [^111nPUB7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hamate fractures represent only 2% to 4% of all carpal bone fractures because they require a large degree of force to the hand or wrist. This is a case report of a patient with hamate and capitate fractures after a punch injury. It details the minute change seen in routine 3-view radiographic imagery and indications for computed tomography. A 29-year-old African American man with professional boxing training presented to the emergency department with pain and swelling in the hand and wrist after striking a refrigerator with his right hand. Enough force generated along the axial plane of the fourth and fifth metacarpals either from punching or from falling with a clenched fist is capable of fracturing both the hamate and capitate bones. Three-view radiographs may not visualize the fracture, so computed tomography should be ordered to better visualize any pathology. The risks to not detecting a hamate body fracture are nonunion of the bone, posttraumatic arthritis, decreased grip strength, and decreased range of motion of the hand. Because of rarity, there is no criterion standard therapy, but the general approach is open reduction and internal fixation using Kirschner wires and wrist immobilization for a minimum of 8 weeks. A high degree of clinical suspicion on examination is required for the proper approach to confirm a hamate fracture.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^113EwF3E]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

First aid for frostbite — additional care steps and cautions: A person with frostbite should seek prompt medical attention. Jewelry or other constricting materials should be removed from a frostbitten extremity as soon as possible. A person with moderate to severe hypothermia should receive core rewarming before frostbite is treated. If possible, a person should protect frostbitten tissue from further injury and avoid walking on frozen feet and toes. For frozen and thawed tissue and between the toes and fingers, bulky, clean, dry gauze or sterile cotton dressings should be applied. Circumferential dressings should be wrapped loosely to allow for swelling without placing pressure on the underlying tissue. It may be reasonable to give ibuprofen to a person with frostbite to prevent further tissue damage and to treat pain. It is not recommended for first aid providers to debride blisters associated with frostbite.

### Traumatic finger injuries: what the orthopedic surgeon wants to know [^112hRiRr]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Traumatic finger injuries account for a substantial number of emergency visits every year. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and in directing management of these injuries. Although many injuries can be managed conservatively, some require more invasive interventions to prevent complications and loss of function. Accurate diagnosis of finger injuries can often be difficult, given the complicated soft-tissue anatomy of the hand and the diverse spectrum of injuries that can occur. To best serve the patient and the treating physician, radiologists must have a working knowledge of finger anatomy, the wide array of injury patterns that can occur, the characteristic imaging findings of different finger injuries, and the most appropriate treatment options for each type of injury. This article details the intricate anatomy of the hand as it relates to common finger injuries, illustrates the imaging findings of a range of injuries, presents optimal imaging modalities and imaging parameters for the diagnosis of different injury types, and addresses which findings have important management implications for the patient and the orthopedic surgeon. With this fund of knowledge, radiologists will be able to recommend the most appropriate imaging studies, make accurate diagnoses, convey clinically relevant imaging findings to the referring physician, and suggest appropriate follow-up examinations. In this way, the radiologist will help improve patient care and outcomes. Online supplemental material is available for this article. (©)RSNA, 2016.

### Swelling, stiffness, and dysfunction following proximal interphalangeal joint sprains [^1113j1Wm]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint sprains are common injuries that often result in prolonged swelling, stiffness, and dysfunction; however, the duration of these sequelae is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the duration of time that patients experience finger swelling, stiffness, and dysfunction following a PIP joint sprain.

Methods

This was a prospective, longitudinal, survey-based study. To identify patients with PIP joint sprains, the electronic medical record was queried monthly using International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, codes for PIP joint sprain. A five-question survey was emailed monthly for 1 year or until their response indicated resolution of swelling, whichever occurred sooner. Two cohorts were established: patients with (resolution cohort) and patients without (no-resolution cohort) self-reported resolution of swelling of the involved finger within 1 year of a PIP joint sprain injury. The measured outcomes included self-reported resolution of swelling, self-reported limitations to range of motion, limitations to activities of daily living, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score, and return to normalcy.

Results

Of 93 patients, 59 (63%) had complete resolution of swelling within 1 year of a PIP joint sprain. Of the patients in the resolution cohort, 42% reported return to subjective normalcy, with 47% having self-reported limitations in range of motion and 41% having limitations in activities of daily living. At the time of resolution of swelling, the average VAS pain score was 0.8 out of 10. In contrast, only 15% of patients in the no-resolution cohort reported return to subjective normalcy, with 82% having self-reported limitations in range of motion and 65% having limitations in activities of daily living. For this cohort, the average VAS pain score at 1 year was 2.6 out of 10.

Conclusions

It is common for patients to experience a prolonged duration of swelling, stiffness, and dysfunction following PIP joint sprains.

### Pain, swelling and irritability in the sun: what is the diagnosis? [^115ZHEt3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2021). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented with a 24-hour history of severe burning pain affecting both hands that had started within minutes of playing outdoors. His mother reported that he had been running his hands under cold water and shaking his hands and head to try and relieve the pain. On examination, there was swelling of his hands, eyelids and cheeks. His parents mentioned that his hands and face had 'swollen in the sun' every summer from the age of 2years. A 3-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of left upper limb swelling following a day of prolonged sun exposure. Examination revealed non-pitting oedema extending from her left shoulder to hand with no associated tenderness, erythema or rash. Her mother reported six previous episodes of irritability following sun exposure during which she would cry and flap her hands 'for hours'. Oral steroids and antihistamines were prescribed in both cases with little effect. Findings of routine baseline investigations were normal in both cases. A radiograph of the upper limb in the second patient disclosed nothing abnormal.

### Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis resulting in atraumatic pediatric forearm compartment syndrome [^114ETYWW]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Description

Two and a half weeks before presentation, an otherwise healthy, 10-year-old, African American boy fell forward onto an outstretched left arm while running, experiencing mild wrist pain without deformity. The following day, he presented to his pediatrician with pain and swelling despite cold therapy and anti-inflammatories. Injury radiographs (Figure 1) were normal. He developed a low-grade fever with runny nose 2 days after initial injury with spontaneous resolution. One week later, he experienced atraumatic ipsilateral elbow swelling and pain. He sought follow-up care at an urgent care where he had normal elbow and wrist radiographs. They trialed NSAIDs, cold therapy, and compressive wrapping without improvement over the following week. He ultimately developed an inability to move his elbow, prompting presentation to our emergency department at his pediatrician's recommendation.

Figure 1
AP, oblique, and lateral radiographs of the left wrist 2 weeks before presentation to our emergency department.

Radiographs demonstrated subcutaneous swelling and mottling of the distal radius physis, suggesting ongoing infection and prompting orthopaedic consultation (Figure 2). Examination revealed marked swelling circumferentially about the forearm and elbow (Figure 3). The elbow was held flexed at 110° and was unable to range without severe pain passively or actively. The wrist range of motion was limited to 20° of passive flexion and extension because of swelling and pain. He held his fingers in a semiflexed position and had significant forearm pain with passive finger extension. His palmar and dorsal forearm were tense and painful with palpation. His sensation was intact in the radial, median, and ulnar nerve distributions. He had intact ulnar nerve motor function; however, he exhibited posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) weakness and a complete inability to flex the thumb at the interphalangeal joint indicating anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) dysfunction. Laboratory studies were universally elevated: white blood cell count 16.2 k/mcL (normal institutional range: 4.5 to 13.5 k/mcL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate 120 mm/hr (zero to 10 mm/hr), and C-reactive protein (CRP) 15.6 mg/dL (≤ 1 mg/dL). Compartment pressures were not measured because the clinical diagnosis was clear from his pain with passive finger extension, motor palsy, and tense compartments. CS with evolving neurologic deficits was diagnosed clinically, and he was indicated for emergent forearm fasciotomies.

### Complex regional pain syndrome or limb pain: a plea for a critical approach [^1178E4oy]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

A Clinical Examination is Mandatory for CRPS

In particular, with red flags, a comprehensive clinical examination must be performed. The first steps are inspection and palpation. For instance, a skin lesion as an entrance for an infection could be found by inspection. If the "refractory" CRPS patient presents with an overprotected arm fixed to the body but without muscle wasting or contractures and with rough palms indicating physical work, there might be a mismatch between reported symptoms and objective findings. Objective typical CRPS findings are skin color changes, temperature difference, sweating, edema and reduced range of motion. However, those signs alone cannot differentiate between CRPS and localized inflammation like infection or arthritis. It is the distal limb generalization, which characterizes CRPS (see Figure 3 for illustration of non-CRPS where fingers are not affected).

Figure 3
Example of a toxic-induced skin ulcer. This painful extremity is red, swollen and has extensive hair growth, and the proximal skin was dry. The CRPS criteria 1–3 would be fulfilled but notice that the distal fingers have normal color and are without edema. The lack of a distal generalization of the symptoms speaks against CRPS. The obvious etiology in this case is a skin ulcer which developed after erroneous subcutaneous infusion of mitoxantrone and was finally cured with skin transplantation. In less obvious cases, when the phenomenon of distal generalization is ignored, such a constellation of symptoms could lead to a false CRPS diagnosis.

Sweating might be of particular interest. A local trauma does not induce hyperhidrosis, a peripheral nerve lesion causes sweat loss within the innervation territory, while sympathetic chain lesion causes sweat loss in the respective quadrants of the body. This means that hyperhidrosis might be relatively specific for CRPS while hypohidrosis is unspecific. Affected distal and proximal joints and trigger points in muscles of the affected limb (possibly involved in guarding mechanisms) should be manually investigated. A generalized joint affection in connective tissue disease should be recorded. The peripheral arterial pulses should be palpated and the capillary responses have to be noticed in some cases. Signs of deep venous thrombosis with pain in the lower leg should be looked for particularly after immobilization or after travelling a long distance.

Thereafter, patients should be exposed to a full neurological examination looking for upper and lower motor neuron signs and sensory symptoms including the spatial distribution of sensory loss or gain.

### Post-traumatic Raynaud's phenomenon: a case report [^112KoJva]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Raynaud's phenomenon has multiple etiologies, ranging from occupational causes to systemic disease. Most occupational causes of Raynaud's phenomenon usually present with vascular compromise.

Case Report

A 41-year-old Chinese woman presented to the emergency department with progressive pain and bluish discoloration over her right index finger after minor trauma. The clinical examination revealed discoloration over multiple fingertips on both hands. She was diagnosed with Raynaud's phenomenon with possible underlying systemic disease. Additional laboratory workup led to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with complex regional pain syndrome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? It is rare for the emergency physician to diagnose Raynaud's phenomenon in the setting of minor trauma. It is important to diagnose this condition because of its potential complications.

### Fist sign-associated post ambulatory swollen hands [^113FFJq3]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A positive fist sign is a pathognomonic clinical feature of post ambulatory swollen hands. The affected individual is not able to tightly clench their fingers into the palm to form a fist. In addition to POTASH, some of the other potential etiologies for a positive fist sign include compartment syndrome, congenital conditions (such as Blau syndrome), endocrine disorders (such as acromegaly), giant lipoma (with associated carpal tunnel syndrome), intravenous drug use (with puffy hand syndrome), and rheumatologic diseases (such as remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema).,

In patients with POTASH, the fist sign occurs secondary to edema. Other causes of a positive fist sign include fibrosis, hemorrhage, infection, lymphatic obstruction, overgrowth of bone and soft tissue, space occupying lesion with nerve compression, and trauma. Depending on the etiology, the inability to make a fist will persist or may resolve either spontaneously, after corticosteroid treatment, or post-surgery.,

In summary, POTASH is a benign condition that may occur in people who ambulate. The asymptomatic swelling of the hands and their digits typically prevents the individual from clenching their fingers into the palm; hence, a positive fist sign is a characteristic feature of POTASH. Although the etiology of POTASH is unknown, the condition is acquired and recurrent; spontaneous resolution typically occurs after the ambulatory activity has been discontinued.

### If it is not healing, do worry about it! [^113hJb1t]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 44-year-old patient who crushed her ring finger in a door 4 months earlier. She was treated in the community for her chronic fingertip wound/pyogenic granuloma. As the lesion was not healing with regular wound management she was eventually referred to secondary care for an opinion. She underwent immediate excisional biopsy with safe margins for tissue diagnosis and had histological confirmation of an advanced malignant melanoma. The staging head, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvic CT showed lymph node enlargement and widespread metastatic lesions. Our case shows how if hand lesions are not resolved following trauma, the patient needs to be assessed for unusual pathologies and, if necessary, or in doubt, referred to the specialists.

### Unusual presentation of acute compartment syndrome of the forearm and hand [^114Lybyn]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 49-year-old man was referred to orthopaedics with an acute onset of left forearm and hand swelling, widespread blisters and erythema after lying face down on the floor for an unknown period of time. He also presented with left wrist stiffness due to pain and clawing of the fingers and glove-type loss of sensation in the whole hand. Any attempt to straighten the fingers or extend the wrist exacerbated the pain. Symptoms deteriorated rapidly. Compartment syndrome was diagnosed and surgical fasciotomies of his left forearm and left hand were performed following multidisciplinary urgent discussions between plastic surgeons, microbiologists, anaesthetists and orthopaedic surgeons. The left forearm and left hand underwent extensive decompression and subsequent skin grafting and had good healing despite the initial skin presentation. The patient has made a satisfactory recovery and has required extensive hand physiotherapy and social care.

### Symptom complexes at the earliest phases of rheumatoid arthritis: a synthesis of the qualitative literature [^1153y8sn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Theme 1: swelling

Swelling was described as the joint becoming "puffed out". The feet and hands were most often affected. Swelling was often described as severe; one woman found the swelling in her feet was so bad at the onset of RA that she had begun to wear her husband's slippers. The impact of swelling in the small joints was often described in the context of its effect on day-to-day activities such as walking, gripping, writing, and cooking.

"I couldn't even make the chapatti. The swelling had gone really worse and I thought I have to go to the GP [general practitioner]".

"My feet began to swell and my hands began to swell. I couldn't hold a pen, I had difficulty getting between machines and difficulty getting hold of small things".

"Aware of swelling to fingers of the right hand… waited two weeks to see if condition improved".

"I noticed that my feet and ankles started to swell and I thought, I am doing too much walking".

"Then one day, all of a sudden my joints all swelled up. All over. And they were so tender and horrible. My legs swelled up and my hands were so sore I couldn't touch anything. When my feet swelled up, I finally went to the doctor".

Bury highlighted that symptoms (such as swelling and pain) often "creep up", with a transition from trivial symptoms to severe symptoms associated with significant functional impairment.

"To begin with I thought I had sprained my wrist, 'cos my wrist went as you normally do if you sprain it, it hurt and it became swollen a little bit, so I stuck a wrist strap on it and carried on. It did not get any better for a week and a half, but then the swelling started from the wrist into the back of the hand… and that all swollen up until it got quite large. Now, at that stage, I thought well I had better go up and see the doctor".

### Safety and efficacy of prophylactic closed incision negative pressure therapy after acute fracture surgery [^111mdbCT]. Injury (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Soft tissue swelling after acute fracture surgery is a challenge which may increase wound dehiscence, delay early range of motion, and increase infection rate postoperatively. This study investigates closed incision negative pressure therapy (ciNPT) using wide-range cover over the incision site and the peripheral swelling trauma zone to promote early active motion and to mitigate joint stiffness, bulla formation, and tendon adhesion.

Methods

Twenty-nine patients were enrolled between January 2018 and December 2018. Patients with high-energy soft tissue trauma and comminuted fractures over distal end of limbs (hand and foot; wrist and ankle) or muscle scarcity areas (tibial shaft or patella) were included. ciNPT was applied over closed incisions in the operating room and subatmospheric pressure (-125 mmHg) initiated continuously for 5~7 days.

Results

In hand and foot patients (n = 8), active motion over all fingers or toes occurred after post-operative Day 2. Mild swelling without any bullous formation was observed over the dorsal aspect of hand. In wrist and ankle patients (n = 16), flexion angle over the finger joints over 90 degrees was observed after 5 days post-surgery. For patients with tibial shaft comminuted fractures with impending compartment syndrome, early active motion of knee and ankle joint was observed as soft tissue swelling and distension pain had subsided after surgery.

Conclusion

The prophylactic ciNPT use in the trauma area after surgery reduced postoperative distension pain and improved early range of motion of the tendon and joint in these patients.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

17.1 Patient Counseling for Dupuytren's Contracture

Advise patients of the following:

Serious complications of XIAFLEX injection include tendon rupture, serious ligament damage, or skin laceration that may result in the inability to fully bend the finger and may require surgery to correct the complication.
XIAFLEX injection is likely to result in swelling, bruising, bleeding, and/or pain of the injected site and surrounding tissue.

After the XIAFLEX injections, instruct patients:

Not to flex or extend the fingers of the injected hand to reduce extravasation of XIAFLEX out of the cord(s).
Not to attempt to disrupt the injected cord(s) by self-manipulation.
To elevate the injected hand until bedtime.
To promptly contact their physician if there is evidence of infection (e.g., fever, chills, increasing redness or edema), sensory changes in the treated finger(s), trouble bending the finger(s) after the swelling goes down (symptoms of tendon rupture), or skin laceration.
To return to their healthcare provider's office 1 to 3 days after the injection visit for an examination of the injected hand and for possible finger extension procedure(s) to disrupt the cord.

Following the finger extension procedure(s) and fitting patient with a splint, instruct patients:

Not to perform strenuous activity with the injected hand until advised to do so.
To wear the splint at bedtime for up to 4 months.
To perform a series of finger flexion and extension exercises each day.

### Acute finger injuries: part I. tendons and ligaments [^114k1GQq]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Improper diagnosis and treatment of finger injuries can cause deformity and dysfunction over time. A basic understanding of the complex anatomy of the finger and of common tendon and ligament injury mechanisms can help physicians properly diagnose and treat finger injuries. Evaluation includes a general musculoskeletal examination as well as radiography (oblique, anteroposterior, and true lateral views). Splinting and taping are effective treatments for tendon and ligament injuries. Treatment should restrict the motion of injured structures while allowing uninjured joints to remain mobile. Although family physicians are usually the first to evaluate patients with finger injuries, it is important to recognize when a referral is needed to ensure optimal outcomes.

### Fist sign-associated post ambulatory swollen hands [^117X72mc]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A healthy 64-year-old man presented with acute-onset positive fist sign of both hands; he had just completed a 13.1-mile race. For 3 hours and 52 minutes, he continuously ambulated; the ambient temperature was 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Similar to prior half marathons in which he had participated, the asymptomatic bilateral progressive swelling of his hands began after 1 hour of running.

Examination demonstrated that he was not able to clench his fingers into his palm to make a fist; the effort resulted in erythema of the digits and palms (Fig 1). In addition, painless edematous hands, fingers, and thumbs of both upper extremities were observed; the swelling was readily noted proximal and distal to the ring on his left fourth finger (Fig 2). His dorsal hands and digits showed changes from chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation; however, hives and angioedema, pruritus, and swelling of other body sites were absent.

Fig 1
After completing a half marathon, a 64-year-old man had a positive fist sign. He could not clench the fingers on his left hand into the palm to make a fist.

Fig 2
The man's left hand and its digits are markedly swollen. The prominent swelling can readily be observed proximal and distal to the ring on his left fourth finger.

Correlation of the patient's history and clinical presentation established the diagnosis of post ambulatory hand swelling (POTASH) with an associated positive fist sign. Similar to his previous episodes of post ambulatory swollen hands, the swelling of his hands and their digits eventually resolved spontaneously once he had finished the race and stopped running (Fig 3). Indeed, within 2 hours after he discontinued ambulating, he could clench his fingers to make a fist (Fig 4).

Fig 3
Spontaneous resolution of the man's swollen hands and digits began approximately 1 hour after he stopped running; within 2 hours, his left hand and its digits were normal in appearance.

Fig 4
After the swelling resolved spontaneously, the man was able to make a fist by clenching his fingers into his palm. He now had a negative fist sign.

### Activity of daily living impairment mediates the relationship between pain and falls in Chinese older adults: a cohort study [^113nxwns]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

We conducted a prospective cohort study using the 2018 survey as baseline and the 2020 survey as follow-up. Participants were included if they completed the 2018 survey. We excluded individuals who (1) lacked 2020 follow-up data; (2) were younger than 60 years at baseline; (3) resided in institutions (e.g. nursing homes or hospitals) at baseline; (4) had missing ADL data; (5) had missing fall data at baseline or follow-up; and (6) lacked information on physician-diagnosed conditions. After applying these criteria, 6,280 participants remained for analysis. The participant flow chart is presented in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Flow chart of sample selection and the exclusion criteria

Falls

As the outcome variable, falls were ascertained from the 2020 follow-up survey. Participants were asked: "Since the last interview, have you experienced a fall?" Responses were recorded as either "yes" or "no". For this study, participants were classified as having experienced a fall if they answered "yes" to the question.

Pain

Pain data was derived from the 2018 survey. Participants were initially asked: "How often do you suffer from physical pain?" with response options of "none", "a little", "somewhat", "quite a bit", or "very". If participants reported experiencing pain (i.e. responded with "a little", "somewhat", "quite a bit", or "very"), they were further asked to identify the specific body parts where they experienced pain. The options included: head, shoulders, arms, wrists, fingers, chest, stomach, upper back, lower back, buttocks, legs, knees, ankles, toes, neck, and other. Two pain variables were included in the analysis: pain frequency (PF), the number of pain sites (NPS). PF was defined based on participants' initial responses regarding the frequency of pain. NPS was determined by the number of specific pain sites identified by participants.

Subungual hematoma — diagnosis and treatment emphasize that diagnosis is primarily clinical, with radiography used when injury extent or associated fracture is uncertain, and care aims to relieve pain, prevent complications, and preserve the nail. For small, nonpainful hematomas without nail bed injury, management involves observation and reassurance, and patients are advised to elevate the finger and apply ice; for painful or enlarging hematomas, nail trephination is performed by creating a small hole in the nail plate to release blood, which can be done using a heated paper clip or specialized trephination tools.

### Diagnostic imaging of A2 pulley injuries: a review of the literature [^116CziPa]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rock climbing has the highest incidence of A2 pulley injuries of all sports. A survey of competitive rock climbers in the United States found that 26% of climbers were found to have flexor pulley injuries involving A2. This is because climbers will often support their entire body weight using one or two fingers in a flexed position, imparting significant stress on the pulleys. In addition, climbers will sometimes use a crimp grip (Figure 2) to successfully latch on to small surface areas while climbing. The crimp grip positions the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint at 90+ degrees of flexion and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint in maximal hyperextension, which places 36 times more force on the A2 pulley than a standard slope grip. This underlying tension has been described to exceed the threshold for A2 pulley rupture.

Figure 2
Representation of crimp grip of the fingers in a typical climbing position.

Clinically, A2 pulley tears can present either acutely or chronically and range in severity from small, partial tears to large, complete tears. Acute pulley tears can involve a sudden sharp pain that occurs during activity with an audible "pop" followed by finger swelling. Chronic injuries are caused by repetitive microtrauma to the pulley, which can lead to symptoms of focal tenderness and pain while gripping. Bowstringing is generally considered to be indicative of a major A2 pulley injury as it typically results in cosmetic and functional deficiencies. The clinical diagnosis of bowstringing can be particularly challenging because pain and swelling can obscure bowstringing, and lower severity injuries may present with more subtle bowstringing. Therefore, clinicians must often rely on advanced imaging to make an accurate diagnosis and determine the best available treatment options, which may range from observation to surgical reconstruction. Several modalities have been proposed for this purpose, including ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT).

Case

A 64-year-old woman presented to the orthopaedic clinic with six months of numbness and tingling on the plantar aspect of her left foot. Medical history was notable for chronic lower back pain managed by pain management, lumbosacral spinal stenosis, and bilateral carpal tunnel release undergone more than 10 years prior. Her arrival to this appointment was preceded by a presentation to the emergency department 1 month earlier with an outpatient follow-up with a neurologist after a mechanical fall on her staircase. This fall was stated to be secondary to her left foot slipping and difficulty walking secondary to numbness in her foot. At her appointments after the emergency department visit, she described worsening numbness, particularly with activity. The numbness was stated to involve much of the plantar surface of her left foot, beginning at her heel before passing into the rest of her foot. These symptoms were accompanied by left foot and ankle pain and chronic swelling in her left lower extremity.

### Common finger fractures and dislocations [^116tLvG1]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Finger fractures and dislocations are commonly seen in the primary care setting. Patients typically present with a deformity, swelling, and bruising with loss of function. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiography should be performed to identify fractures and distinguish uncomplicated injuries from those requiring referral. Uncomplicated distal phalanx fractures, caused by a crush injury to the end of the finger, require splinting of the distal interphalangeal joint for four to six weeks. Uncomplicated dorsal avulsion fractures (mallet finger) of the distal interphalangeal joint, caused by forced flexion against resistance, require strict splint immobilization for eight weeks. Flexor digitorum profundus fractures are caused by forceful extension of the distal interphalangeal joint when in a flexed position, resulting in an avulsion fracture at the volar base of the distal phalanx, and usually require surgery. Uncomplicated middle and proximal phalanx fractures, typically caused by a direct blow, can be treated with buddy splinting if there is minimal angulation (less than 10 degrees); however, larger angulations, displacement, and malrotation often require reduction or surgery. Dorsal proximal interphalangeal joint dislocations require reduction and buddy splinting in slight flexion with an extension-block splint. Volar proximal interphalangeal joint dislocations require reduction and splinting in full extension for four to six weeks. Distal interphalangeal joint dislocations require reduction and splinting in full extension (for volar dislocations) or 15 to 30 degrees of flexion (for dorsal dislocations) for two to three weeks. Dorsal metacarpophalangeal joint dislocations are managed with reduction and splitting, but referral to an orthopedic specialist is required if the dislocation is not easily reduced. Volar metacarpophalangeal dislocations are rare and warrant referral.

### Enigmatic and unusual cases of upper extremity pain: mislabeling as malingerers [^1164BKRi]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

With the intricate anatomy of the hand and upper extremity, there are many possible etiologies of pain. In addition, one must be alert to conditions typically affecting other areas of the body presenting in the hand and upper extremity. To add to the complexity of diagnosis, one must also be aware of potential secondary gains. With this in mind, a thorough history, physical examination, and broad differential can help avoid mislabeling patients with uncommon ailments. In this article, we present 4 cases of unusual causes of hand and upper extremity pain.

### In brief: kanavel's signs and pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis [^1117whbe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Description

Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis usually is caused by penetrating trauma to the finger, although patients who are immunocompromised may have a more indolent and chronic presentation, and a history of trauma in these patients may be remote or absent. The site of penetrating trauma often can be identified and may appear relatively mild, even appearing like nothing more than a superficial scratch (Fig. 1). Multiple series have shown Staphylococcus aureus as the most common pathogen in pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis cultures, although polymicrobial infections, methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus species also are commonly encountered pathogens, and rare organisms have been isolated from pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis cultures, including Eikenella corrodens, Pasteurella multocida, Kingella kingae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Clostridium difficile, and Mycobacterium species. Initial treatment of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis includes timely administration of intravenous antibiotics and surgical irrigation and drainage. Although open irrigation and débridement, closed tendon sheath irrigation, local antibiotic delivery systems, and continuous closed irrigation strategies using external pump local anesthesia have been described, no single approach is clearly superior to others regarding long-term function, need for repeat surgery, amputation risk, and infection eradication.

Although the absence of one or more Kanavel's signs does not exclude a diagnosis of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, the classic description of exquisite tenderness along the flexor tendon sheath, the digit held in flexion at rest, fusiform swelling of the digit (often described as a "sausage digit"), and pain with passive extension of the digit should raise concern for the presence of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis (Fig. 2).

Frostbite background — frostbite is a condition that results from the freezing of skin and, in severe cases, underlying tissues, in which the formation of ice crystals within the cells causes cellular and tissue damage. The extremities — fingers, toes, nose, and ears — are particularly susceptible to frostbite, and the severity ranges from superficial frostbite affecting only the outer layers of the skin to more severe cases involving deeper tissues. Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and changes in skin color, and in extreme cases frostbite can cause tissue necrosis leading to digit or limb loss.

### Proximal interphalangeal hyperextension injuries in children: the development of a clinical decision guide [^112H54jF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a clinical decision guide for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperextension injuries of long fingers.

Study Design

Consecutive patients age < 16 years (n = 300) with an acute proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint hyperextension injury were included. High-risk and low-risk measures for severe injury were established with a standardized clinical examination and anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the injured finger. Four clinical variables were assessed: location of pain; swelling and bruising, stability, and mobility. Pathological radiographic findings were compiled, and the risk of late complications was analyzed. The predictive value of the clinical examination in the identification of low-risk injuries was assessed.

Results

The majority (67%) of children consulting for a hyperextension finger trauma did not have a fracture. No child with a low-risk clinical examination had a subsequent high-risk diagnosis (eg, relevant intra-articular fracture, dislocation). Among 64 clinical high-risk diagnoses only 12 significant fractures were found.

Conclusion

Treatment decisions after PIP hyperextension injuries can be based on a clinical examination using a standardized evaluation protocol. Application of the clinical decision guide presented here has a sensitivity of 100% to rule out a significant injury. Present results showed that the majority of radiographs currently performed are avoidable. Once the decision rule is validated, its clinical application will improve patient care, reduce waiting times in emergency departments, avoid unnecessary radiation exposure, and possibly reduce costs.

### Fingertip injuries [^112B8L3J]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Nail bed laceration — evaluation and management state that these injuries generally occur after crushing trauma, with outcomes influenced by mechanism and extent and injury classified as simple, complex, or stellate. Management includes radiography (anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique) because distal tuft fractures are commonly associated, and nail bed lacerations can be treated by removal of the nail and repair of the nail bed. However, recent studies suggest no difference in the incidence of subsequent nail deformity between patients undergoing nail bed repair vs nonoperative management without nail removal. If repair is pursued, proper analgesia is used, typically a digital nerve block, to allow assessment of injury extent.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^116stNTn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Perceived causes of cellulitis

In both the qualitative interviews and survey, participants expressed diverse beliefs about what had caused their cellulitis, including sustaining damage to the skin from trauma, insect bites or surgery, oedema and fungal foot disease (Table 2). Qualitative interviewees also cited causes that were not included as a response option in the questionnaire, such as 'unhygienic' environments (e.g. woodlands, household lofts or coming into contact with matter such as bird faeces or dead rodents) and stressful life events.

I knocked that little finger against a wing mirror. And that was all and it didn't even draw blood or scratch. There must have been something on the wing mirror, you know? It could have been anything, bird droppings or anything. Just something, obviously

At that time I was under a considerable amount of pressure and what have you. Then the next big hit was 2010 and again work was extremely busy… there was a big amount of stress at the time and just prior to that my father had died in 2009. So 2009, 2010 and it was like… a graze or something like that on my leg and I think I'd been under quite a bit of pressure, being kind of rundown, at a low ebb

Although some interviewees appeared to have a clear idea of the cause of their cellulitis, many were uncertain owing to the lack of visible evidence of a bite mark or cut on the affected area. Similar uncertainty was reflected in the survey data.

But the funny thing was, they couldn't find any reason why; when they were checking my legs for cuts that sort of thing, and mosquito bites; there was nothing. They don't really know what caused it, other than I got it… and they treated it

Well my legs were swollen, especially this left one, but then they have been swollen for some time – I mean I didn't cut myself or scratch myself or anything, you know, to bring on an infection. I just don't know. And the doctor, I don't think knows either

Distal radius fracture rehabilitation — custom compression glove plus standard therapy: A custom-made compression glove (20–30 mmHg worn 10 hours/day) added to standard therapy (n = 17; 82% female; mean age, 61.5) versus standard therapy only (n = 15; 13 females/2 males; mean age, 68) delivered 2 times per week for 6 weeks led to greater reductions in finger (P < .001), hand (P < .01), and wrist (P < .001) swelling at 2 weeks, with differences maintained at 6 weeks. The same pattern occurred for AROM with wrist flexion (P < .01), extension (P < .01), and radial (P < .001) and ulnar (P < .001) deviation; PRWE pain and function also improved more in the glove group (P < .05) at both 2- and 6-week assessments.

### Predictors of self-reported neglect-like symptoms and involuntary movements in complex regional pain syndrome compared to other chronic limb pain conditions [^117RCNQ9]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Pain Characteristics

We asked whether respondents had experienced pain on most days for ≥ 3 months, and if so, how long respondents had been experiencing pain, the average hours of pain per day, whether they had received a medical diagnosis for their pain condition, what this diagnosis was, and who they had received their diagnosis from (i.e. which type of medical professional, if any). We predefined 15 pain-related medical diagnoses; including CRPS (we did not dissociate between CRPS I and II, as many people do not know which type they have). An "other" option was included with a free-text box for respondents to specify additional diagnoses; multiple items were counted as separate diagnoses.

Respondents were asked to indicate where in their body they experienced pain over the past week. We measured pain intensity using the Numeric Pain Rating scale. Respondents were asked to select a number on a sliding scale ranging from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("worst pain imaginable") that best reflected the average level of their pain over the last week for each body part that they experienced pain in. We used the pain ratings for the most painful limb for the current study. Respondents were asked what event or injury triggered the onset of their pain condition. We predefined seven events/injuries and included an "other" option with a free-text box.

Two survey questions provided insight into how many pain triggers and bodily changes that reflect symptoms of CRPS were reported. These questions, which we created for the purposes of another study, asked which, if any, of 13 pre-defined triggers give the respondent pain; and which of 46 predefined bodily changes respondents have experienced for the first time or that have become worse since the onset of their pain condition. For the current study, we used one item from the pain triggers question (i.e. the touch of clothing/water/breeze), and 13 items from the bodily changes question (i.e. losing hair or extra hair growth, changes in the texture or color of the skin, swelling, changes in the nails of hands/toes, weakness, tremor, sweating more/less, and body parts feeling unusually cold/hot). It is not possible to diagnose CRPS based on these questions, therefore, the sole purpose of this analysis was to provide some insight into CRPS-related characteristics of the two groups.

Ciprofloxacin (sip"roe flox'a sin) Tablets, USP

for oral use

Read this Medication Guide before you start taking ciprofloxacin tablets and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about ciprofloxacin tablets?

Ciprofloxacin tablets, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial medicine, can cause serious side effects. Some of these serious side effects can happen at the same time and could result in death.

If you get any of the following serious side effects while you take ciprofloxacin tablets, you should stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away.

Tendon rupture or swelling of the tendon (tendinitis).
Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take ciprofloxacin tablets. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Symptoms of tendon problems may include:
Pain
Swelling
tears and swelling of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, thumb, or other tendon sites.
The risk of getting tendon problems while you take ciprofloxacin tablets is higher if you:
are over 60 years of age
are taking steroids (corticosteroids)
have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant
Tendon problems can happen in people who do not have the above risk factors when they take ciprofloxacin tablets.
Other reasons that can increase your risk of tendon problems can include:
physical activity or exercise
kidney failure
tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
Stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling or inflammation. The most common area of pain and swelling is the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons.
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking ciprofloxacin tablets. Tendon ruptures can happen within hours or days of taking ciprofloxacin tablets and have happened up to several months after people have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.
Stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately and get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
hear or feel a snap or pop in a tendon area
bruising right after an injury in a tendon area
unable to move the affected area or bear weight
The tendon problems may be permanent.
Changes in sensation and possible nerve damage (Peripheral Neuropathy). Damage to the nerves in arms, hands, legs, or feet can happen in people who take fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Stop taking ciprofloxacin tablets immediately and talk to your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in your arms, hands, legs, or feet:

### Nuanced trans-scaphoid, perilunate fracture dislocations with complete scapholunate dissociation: two cases with proximal row preservation [^117HKTZd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 25-year-old right-handed man was referred to the orthopaedic clinic for evaluation of his dominant wrist 1-day status after a fall on his outstretched hand while snowboarding in a terrain park. Examination was positive for erythema and swelling of the fingers, and the patient reported decreased light-touch sensation of the middle and index fingers. Radiographs displayed a trans-styloid, trans-scaphoid perilunate fracture-dislocation with the capitate dislocated dorsally over the lunate (Figure 1, A and D). Radiographs additionally displayed a displaced fracture of the middle-third of the scaphoid in addition to a chip fracture of the ulnar styloid process.

Figure 1
Case 1 serial right wrist, navicular view radiographs demonstrating (A) 1-day post-trauma, (B) postoperative, and (C) 22 weeks postoperative. Lateral wrist radiographs (D) at 1 day and (E) 22 weeks post-trauma.

The patient was agreeable to open surgical intervention to be done under general anesthesia the following day. At the time of surgery, a dorsal approach over Lister's tubercle was used to enter the capsule. Within the joint space, the proximal pole of the scaphoid was observed to be completely devoid of any soft-tissue attachments. With tourniquet inflated, the cancellous surface of the proximal pole showed no evidence of active perfusion. This was fixated to the distal pole with a single compression screw, and anatomical reduction was achieved (Figure 1 B). A suture anchor was now fixed to the proximal pole where the torn scapholunate ligament had previously attached. Two Kirschner wires were driven from the ulnar and the radial aspects, respectively, crossing the scapholunate interval to hold anatomical alignment while the previously placed suture anchor was used to tie down the scapholunate ligament. Kirschner wire fixation was once again used to fix the distal pole of the scaphoid to the capitate and the lunate to the triquetrum percutaneously. AP, lateral, and oblique projections confirmed that the triquetrum was well reduced to the hamate and to the lunate. A suture anchor was applied in the proximal pole of the capitate, and this was used to directly repair the radioscaphocapitate ligament. A final percutaneous Kirschner wire was used to fix the ulnar styloid fracture. On release of the tourniquet, excellent hemostasis to the extremity was observed.

### Fingertip injuries [^111KkECT]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Jersey finger — mechanism, presentation, and diagnosis describe flexor digitorum profundus tendon avulsion most common with contact sports when an athlete grasps an opponent's jersey, causing the finger to suddenly and forcibly extend against active flexion; this hyperextension causes the tendon to tear away from its insertion at the distal phalanx, and the injury can be purely tendinous or an avulsion fracture, most commonly occurs in the ring finger, and presents with pain, swelling, and inability to make a full fist due to failure to flex the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. A positive sweater finger sign is diagnostic, defined by inability to flex the DIP joint when the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints are held in extension, and a palpable lump on the volar side can indicate a retracted tendon.

Jersey finger — imaging and initial management: Imaging studies, such as radiography and ultrasonography, are used to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for the presence of any associated fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used for a more detailed view of the soft tissue structures and improve preoperative localization of the tendon. Once jersey finger is diagnosed, the finger should be splinted, and expedited referral to a hand surgeon should be pursued. Prompt surgical management is necessary to avoid tendon retraction and decreased blood supply that could affect surgical outcomes.

### Two cases of unidentified acute compartment syndrome [^1138q8im]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation 1

In April 2016, a 38-year-old man with no medical history presented to the emergency department complaining of severe pain of his left upper extremity. Eight hours prior to presentation, he sustained a fall in his backyard and noticed swelling over his left forearm with tolerable pain. X-ray and enhanced CT performed at the nearest hospital showed no evidence of fracture and/or internal haemorrhage of his forearm. He was subsequently referred to our institution for suspected ACS when his pain and swelling progressed. On first examination in our institution, his left forearm was markedly swollen, with extension to the left shoulder. He complained of severe pain as well as marked divergent squint and diplopia.

Investigations

There was no evidence of bite marks, blisters or skin necrosis (figure 1A). His white cell count was 11.5 × 10⁹/L, while his creatine kinase (CK) level was 758 IU/L. There was thrombocytopaenia, elevated liver transaminases, elevated C reaction protein (CRP) level as well as coagulopathy and renal dysfunction. Urgent continuous intracompartmental pressure (ICP) measurement was performed with a slit catheter; the ICP within the flexor compartment of the left forearm was 55 mm Hg.

Figure 1
Case 1. (A) The left forearm was extremely swollen and extended to the left shoulder. (B) An urgent fasciotomy with partial incision of the left forearm was performed.

Emergent MRI was performed to confirm the presence of segmental lesion and to assess the range for fasciotomy during preoperative preparation right after ICP monitoring. MRI was efficient to identify the distribution and extent of muscle damage especially because both cases were unidentified. It showed oedema of the subcutaneous tissue and flexor muscle compartments (figure 2A).

### Topology-optimized splints vs casts for distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^116pMbxv]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Interventions

All surgeons involved in this study were trained in the treatment of DRFs and the application of splints and casts. In accordance with routine clinical practice, the fracture was reduced by closed manipulation under local anesthesia (nondisplaced fractures do not require closed reduction). Radiographic films were used to assess the success of reduction after closed manual reduction (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2). External immobilization was achieved using splints and casts, according to the assigned group. After immobilization, participants were encouraged to engage in finger activity.

In the cast group, the cast was applied directly over the skin to immobilize the fracture, extending from below the elbow to the metacarpals. Conversely, in the splint group, prefabricated topology-optimized splints (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2), which were crafted by combining topology optimization technology with 3D printing technology, were used to immobilize the fracture. For patients presenting unique anatomical considerations, customized topology-optimized splints were made available. The detailed technical methods for both the splints and casts are described in eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2. Swelling degree and pain were observed during follow-up appointments at 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks. If severe swelling and discomfort were present, adjustments to the splint or cast may have been necessary. External immobilization was typically removed after a mean (SD) of 6.0 (0.2) weeks for both groups. Participants in both groups were provided with the same detailed home exercise program (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2), and any additional rehabilitation exercise (including physical therapy) beyond the program was at the discretion of the clinician or patient.

### The effects of compression gloves on hand symptoms and hand function in rheumatoid arthritis and hand osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^113mdFSW]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

to evaluate the effects of compression gloves in adults with rheumatoid arthritis and hand osteoarthritis.

Data Sources

Systematic review of randomized controlled trials identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, OT Seeker, The Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Knowledge, Science Direct and PubMed from their inceptions to January 2015.

Review Methods

Methodological quality of identified trials was evaluated using the PEDro scale by three independent assessors. Effects were summarized descriptively.

Results

Four trials (n = 8–24; total n = 74), comparing night wear of full-length finger compression gloves with placebo gloves, were assessed. Three were of moderate (PEDro score 4–5) and one low (score 3) methodological quality. Effect sizes or standardized mean differences could not be calculated to compare trials due to poor data reporting. In rheumatoid arthritis, finger joint swelling was significantly reduced, but results for pain and stiffness were inconclusive and no differences in grip strength and dexterity were identified. One study reported similar effects in pain, stiffness and finger joint swelling from both compression and thermal placebo gloves. Only one study evaluated gloves in hand osteoarthritis (n = 5) with no differences.

Conclusions

All the trials identified were small with a high risk of Type I and II errors. Evidence for the effectiveness of compression gloves worn at night is inconclusive in rheumatoid arthritis and hand osteoarthritis.

### Topology-optimized splints vs casts for distal radius fractures: a randomized clinical trial [^1169n9f5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcome Measures

Participants were followed up and data were collected by the CRCs at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Baseline data included age, sex, fracture type (AO [Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen] classification), fractured wrist, VAS score, grading of swelling degree, radiographic parameters of fracture, radiographic parameters after reduction of fracture, and comorbidities.

The primary outcome was the G-W wrist score (range, 0–38; higher scores indicate worse pain) evaluated at 6 weeks. This score integrates 4 key dimensions: residual deformities (presence of residual radial or dorsal deformity), subjective evaluation (patient's self-assessment of pain, limited mobility, and loss of function), objective evaluation (surgeon's assessment of wrist range of motion, distal radioulnar joint pain, and grip strength), and complications (arthritis, neuropathy, and poor finger function). In addition, we examined 3 dimensions of the G-W score as secondary outcomes to thoroughly understand patients' recovery trajectories under different treatment modalities.

Secondary outcomes included changes in fracture displacement (radius height, volar angle, or radius inclination) and fracture healing at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after reduction using radiographs; VAS score changes at 3 days, 7 days, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks (range, 0–10 points, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the most severe pain); degree of swelling in the wrist joint at 3 days, 7 days, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks (with 0 degrees indicating no swelling, 1 degree indicating mild swelling with visible skin lines, 2 degrees indicating obvious skin swelling with disappearing lines, and 3 degrees indicating skin depression and tension blisters); and complications such as arthritis, complex regional pain syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, shoulder-elbow pain and dysfunction, tension blisters, skin irritation syndrome (redness, swelling, itching, allergies, dermatitis, and odor), and poor finger function.

### Fingertip injuries [^111ryLCb]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — mallet finger classification, presentation, imaging, and splinting management are detailed as follows: There are two classifications of mallet finger, with a tendinous mallet defined by rupture of the distal aspect of the extensor tendon and a bony mallet involving an avulsion fracture of the adjacent distal phalanx; patients present with pain, swelling, and inability to actively extend the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and a bony fragment might be palpable if an avulsion fracture is present. Initial management includes radiography to evaluate for an avulsion fracture, and most cases can be treated nonoperatively with splint immobilization for a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks. The DIP joint should be immobilized in a neutral position but can be placed in slight hyperextension, and research has shown that the proximal interphalangeal joint does not need to be concurrently immobilized. Nighttime splinting is also recommended for an additional 2 weeks after the continuous splint immobilization period is completed. Bony mallets can be immobilized for 6 to 8 weeks, whereas purely tendinous mallets should be immobilized for 8 to 12 weeks. Although no singular type of splint has shown superiority over another, stack splints are most commonly used; composite aluminum and foam splints, as well as thermoplastic splints, are also appropriate. Swan neck deformity is noted as a potential complication of untreated mallet finger.

Definitions

We applied the following definitions for the purpose of our analysis: vaso-occlusive episode was defined as a new episode of acute pain requiring hospitalisation which results from tissue ischaemia. Acute chest syndrome was defined as acute respiratory illness with fever and/or respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea, tachypnoea or hypoxia requiring hospitalisation. Dactylitis was defined as a new episode of acute pain and swelling in the fingers or toes due to vaso-occlusion and is usually associated with fever. Priapism was defined as painful, persistent, unwanted erection of the penis. Hepatic sequestration was defined as sequestration of RCCs in hepatic sinusoids, leading to liver enlargement and decreased Hb concentration. Acute splenic sequestration was defined as rapid intrasplenic trapping of sickle cells, which causes a precipitous fall in Hb level and spleen enlargement. Leg ulcers was defined as the ulceration of the skin of the legs with prolonged wound healing requiring medical attention for wound treatment, debridement or dressings. Jaundice was defined as yellowish pigmentation of the skin and sclerawhile Arthritis was defined as acute or chronic inflammation of a joint, often accompanied by pain, stiffness, warmth, swelling and redness. Clinically, anaemia was defined as the presence of pallor conjunctivae, mucous membranes, nail beds and palms. The laboratory definition of anaemia was acute lowering of the Hb level below normal reference rangeswhile severe anaemia was defined as Hb level of less than 4 g/dL. Sepsis was considered to be the presence of fever with a negative malaria parasite test, and/or raised WCC.

### Tendon and ligament injuries of the finger and thumb in athletes: a narrative review [^114R9STj]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Tendon injuries

Mallet finger

Mallet finger or 'baseball finger' occurs when the terminal extensor tendon or it's attachment at the distal phalanx is injured (figure 1). Mallet finger has a mean incidence of 0.58 per 1000 person-years in patients 18 years of age or older and is most commonly seen in young men. The mechanism of this injury usually involves an object (eg, a baseball) that forces an extended distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint into hyperflexion. Fingers three through five of the dominant hand are most frequently affected. On examination, patients typically present with pain and swelling in the dorsal aspect of the DIP joint with accompanying extension lag (impaired or absent active extension of the joint). If a mallet finger is left untreated, future function may be impacted due to swan neck deformity, chronic extensor lag and DIP joint osteoarthritis.

Figure 1
Anatomy and pathology of the extensors. (A) The extensor anatomy of the digits is depicted. (B) The dorsal side of the fourth finger is magnified to show the anatomy in detail. (C) Mallet injuries occur either through the rupture of the extensor tendon (tendinous mallet injury) or through an avulsion fracture with the tendon remaining intact (bony mallet injury). If a central slip injury is left untreated, a boutonnière deformity might develop; this results in volar subluxation of the lateral bands leading to flexion and extension of the PIP and DIP joints (red arrow), respectively. The Elson test may be used to assess for this injury. To perform the Elson test, the injured digit is flexed at a 90° over the edge of a table, the patient then tries to extend the PIP joint against resistance. The test is positive when there is an absence of extension force at the PIP joint and fixed extension at the DIP joint (black arrow). DIP, distal interphalangeal; PIP, proximal interphalangeal.

### Ultrasound features of trigger finger: review of the literature [^1155upoq]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Trigger finger is a common pathologic condition of the digital pulleys and flexor tendons in the hand. The key clinical finding is a transient blockage of the digit when it is flexed with subsequent painful snapping when it is extended. Imaging is a helpful guide for establishing the severity of the disease, identifying the underlying cause, and deciding the appropriate management. This narrative review aims to recall the anatomic and pathologic bases and describe the ultrasound features of trigger finger, also including common ultrasound findings and complications after therapy. Ultrasound enables an accurate static and dynamic evaluation of trigger finger as well as a comparison with the adjacent normal digits and thus should be considered the radiologic modality of first choice for its diagnosis.

RCL injury of the thumb

RCL injury of the thumb occurs 10 times less often than UCL injury of the thumb. Mechanism of RCL injuries is due to sudden forced adduction of the thumb. Common mechanisms include a fall into an abducted thumb or a ball strike at the radial side of the thumb. This injury may occur concomitantly with UCL ligament injury, especially in NFL Football players where a retrospective study showed simultaneous combined UCL and RCL tears occurred in 25% of all thumb injuries. This injury could also be seen in ball sports such as basketballand volleyball. Patients may have weakness of the pinch grip and point tenderness at the proximal origin of the ligament at the radial side on physical examination. Ultrasonography and MRI may be necessary if diagnosis is in doubt because this injury is often missed.

Management of this injury is similar to UCL injury of the thumb, such as a thumb-spica cast or splint for 4–6 weeks followed by thumb rehabilitation exercises for grade I–II injuries (table 1). Operative management is especially considered for Grade III RCL (complete ligament tear) injuries since they are more prone to complications (eg, joint instability, arthritis), most likely due to incompetent healing.

### A painful finger as first sign of a malignancy [^1143fwTQ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bone metastases are frequently seen in patients with malignancies, but only 0.007% to 0.3% of these metastases are located in the hand or foot. In 16%, the metastasis is the first manifestation of a malignancy. These acrometastases have a poor prognoses with a median survival of 6 months. Treatment is usually palliative and consists of radiation or amputation.

Case Description

An 83-year-old woman was seen with pain and swelling of the right middle finger since 3 months. A radiograph of this finger showed a lytic lesion of the proximal phalanx. A metastasis, primary bone tumor, or osteomyelitis was considered. Because of a radically resected colon carcinoma in patient's medical history, the carcinoembryonic antigen level was analyzed and proved to be elevated. Computed tomography scan of thorax and abdomen showed 2 (primary) pulmonary tumors with mesenteric metastases. Patient refrained from further analysis and treatment of these lung tumors. However, because of persistent pain the right middle finger was amputated. Pathological examination of the finger confirmed the diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma most likely to be a metastasis of lung cancer. Lung cancer is in most cases responsible for metastases in the hand.

Conclusion

Acrometastasis may be the first manifestation of malignancy. Given the poor prognosis, early diagnosis is important to offer adequate treatment. Delay of appropriate treatment can adversely affect the quality of life in these often preterminal patients. This case report could contribute to a (more) rapid recognition of acrometastases as patients with acrometastases are often presented to specialists who do not frequently deal with cancer.

### Hand allodynia, lack of finger flexion, and the need for carpal tunnel release [^112YFxyY]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The clinical features of classic carpal tunnel syndrome are well known. However, some patients who may respond equally well to carpal tunnel release (CTR) display atypical signs and symptoms. The chief differential features are allodynia (painful dysesthesias), lack of finger flexion, and, on examination, pain on passive finger flexion. The goal of the study was to present the clinical features, increase awareness, facilitate accurate diagnosis, and report the outcomes after surgery.

Methods

Thirty-five hands, from 22 patients with the main features of allodynia and lack of full finger flexion, were gathered in the period 2014–2021. The other common complaints included sleeping disturbances (20 patients), hand swelling (31 hands), and shoulder pain on the same side as the hand problem with limited range of motion (30 sides). The Tinel or Phalen signs were obscured by the pain. However, pain with passive flexion of the fingers was universally present. All the patients were treated with carpal tunnel release through a mini-incision approach: four patients had a trigger finger, which was treated concomitantly in six hands, and one patient underwent contralateral CTR for carpal tunnel syndrome with a more standard presentation.

Results

At a minimum of 6 months of follow-up (mean, 22 months; range, 6–60 months), the pain decreased by 7.5 ± 1.9 points on the Numerical Rating Scale, which ranges from 0 to 10. The pulp-to-palm distance improved from 3.7 to 0.3 cm. The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score decreased from 67 to 20. The mean Single-Assessment Numeric Evaluation score for the whole group was 9.7 ± 0.6.

Conclusions

Hand allodynia and lack of finger flexion may be indications of median neuropathy in the carpal canal, which responds to CTR. Awareness of this condition is important because the uncharacteristic clinical presentation may not be considered an indication for surgery that can be beneficial.

### Acute finger injuries: part I. tendons and ligaments… [^112VQQrh]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The severity of acute finger injuries is often underestimated, which can lead to improper treatment. Basic knowledge of the anatomy of the finger and a thorough evaluation of the patient can ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. Part I of this two-part article focuses on common tendon and ligament injuries of the finger. Part II 1 discusses common finger fractures, dislocations, and thumb injuries. Family physicians can manage most finger injuries; however, knowledge of referral criteria is important to ensure optimal outcomes. Treatment should restrict the motion of injured structures while allowing uninjured joints to remain mobile. Patients should be counseled that it is not unusual for an injured digit to remain swollen for some time and that permanent deformity is possible, even after treatment. Common Injuries Several techniques may be used to diagnose common ligament and tendon injuries. Most injuries require splinting and follow-up to evaluate the healing process.

Patients with mallet finger present with pain at the dorsal DIP joint; inability to actively extend the joint; and, often, with a characteristic flexion deformity. It is important to isolate the DIP joint during the evaluation to ensure extension is from the extensor tendon and not the central slip. The absence of full passive extension may indicate bony or soft tissue entrapment requiring surgical intervention. 4, 7, 10 Bony avulsion fractures are present in one third of patients with mallet finger. 11, 12 If no avulsion fracture is present on radiographs, the DIP joint should be splinted in a neutral or slight hyper-extension position for six weeks. A patient with jersey finger may present with pain and swelling at the volar aspect of the DIP joint and the finger may be extended with the hand at rest. There may be a tender fullness if the tendon has been retracted. The digitorum profundus tendon should be evaluated by isolating the affected DIP joint and asking the patient to flex the DIP joint. Maximal tenderness will be located at the volar aspect of the affected joint. Full extension and flexion will be possible if the joint is stable. The collateral ligaments should be tested as with collateral ligament injuries. Radiographs may show an avulsion fragment at the base of the involved phalanx. A stable joint without a large avulsion fragment should be splinted with a progressive extension splint.

### Fingertip injuries | AAFP… [^114PQSkx]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The mechanism of fracture is usually a crush injury. On clinical examination, the fingertip is swollen and painful. Extensive soft tissue damage to the finger pulp with associated nail bed laceration may occur. Examination should include evaluation of the motion of the distal interphalangeal joint and two-point discrimination. Three-view radiographs should be obtained to determine the fracture pattern. Generally, three types of fracture occur: longitudinal, transverse and comminuted 5. The lateral view is optimal to visualize a bony avulsion at the dorsal base of the distal phalanx. With serious injury, the bony avulsion may be accompanied by a volar subluxation of the distal phalanx. Radiographs of a tendinous mallet may disclose only soft tissue swelling.

Nonoperative treatment is recommended for most mallet finger injuries; however, bony avulsions involving one third or more of the articular surface of the distal phalanx or those with volar subluxation of the distal phalanx should be referred. 6 Bony avulsions involving less than one third of the articular surface of the distal phalanx can be reduced with dorsal pressure followed by dorsal splinting. Post-reduction radiographs with the splint applied must be obtained to assess proper alignment. Bony avulsions that cannot be reduced and that fail nonsurgical treatment should be referred as well. Continuous splinting for six to eight weeks is the recommended treatment for mallet finger injuries. Dorsal, volar and stack splints have been used with good results. On clinical examination, the finger may be swollen and tender along the volar surface of the DIPJ. With the finger extended to isolate the FDP, DIPJ flexion is absent.

Flexion at the proximal interphalangeal joint and the metacarpophalangeal joint is preserved because of the flexor digitorum superficialis and lumbrical muscles, respectively. Three-view radiographs are recommended because a bony avulsion from the volar aspect of the distal phalanx can occur. If a large bony fragment is present, retraction of the FDP could be limited to the level of the middle phalanx. In pure tendinous injuries, the FDP can retract to the level of the palm. Once the diagnosis has been made, the finger should be splinted, and the patient should be referred to a hand surgeon as soon as possible.

Patients should be counseled that it is not unusual for an injured digit to remain swollen for some time and that permanent deformity is possible, even after treatment. EXTENSOR TENDON INJURY AT THE DIP JOINT Injury to the extensor tendon at the DIP joint, also known as mallet finger, is the most common closed tendon injury of the finger. Mallet finger usually is caused by an object striking the finger, creating a forceful flexion of an extended DIP. The extensor tendon may be stretched, partially torn, or completely ruptured or separated by a distal phalanx avulsion fracture.
