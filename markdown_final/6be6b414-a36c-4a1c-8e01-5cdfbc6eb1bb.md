## Question

Etoricoxib and asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the safety and use of etoricoxib in patients with asthma, especially those with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, and how to apply guideline-based precautions and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the asthma phenotypes and the pathophysiology of NSAID-triggered reactions. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about COX-2 inhibitors in AERD. Next, I will review direct etoricoxib data, followed by broader COX-2 inhibitor evidence and FDA labeling for celecoxib as a class signal. After that, I need to check cardiovascular safety and weigh risk–benefit. Finally, I will translate this into practical prescribing recommendations, monitoring, and documentation, and consider alternatives if etoricoxib is not suitable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions. AERD is a phenotype defined by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and respiratory reactions to COX-1–inhibiting NSAIDs, with reactions typically within 30–180 minutes of ingestion. Prevalence is about 7% in adult asthma and higher in severe asthma, so I need to keep this front-of-mind when selecting NSAIDs [^114ssyJV] [^114bMu3g]. The mechanism is non–IgE-mediated and driven by COX-1 inhibition shifting arachidonic acid metabolism toward cysteinyl leukotrienes, which provoke bronchospasm and upper airway symptoms; this explains why COX-2–selective agents are often better tolerated mechanistically [^116QPfQ5] [^116dpq1T].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. GINA advises that patients with AERD avoid aspirin and other COX-1 inhibitors, but when an NSAID is truly indicated, a COX-2 inhibitor such as celecoxib or etoricoxib may be considered with healthcare provider supervision and observation for at least 2 hours after the first dose, which operationalizes a cautious, supervised approach rather than a blanket prohibition [^112MZbPx]. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies to all asthma or specifically AERD. GINA also notes that NSAIDs are not generally contraindicated in asthma without a history of reactions, so the supervised COX-2 strategy is most relevant for AERD or those with documented NSAID reactions, not routine asthma without such history [^113ouL65] [^115jiFgY].

> I will now examine direct etoricoxib data in AERD. A prospective challenge study in 77 aspirin/NSAID-induced asthmatic patients showed no immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to etoricoxib across escalating doses, with an estimated cross-reaction probability of 0–2%, which is reassuring but not absolute. This supports the mechanistic rationale that highly selective COX-2 inhibition avoids the COX-1–driven leukotriene surge [^116r3Vsn]. Wait, let me verify consistency with broader COX-2 data. A meta-analysis of controlled trials found no significant increase in respiratory symptoms or FEV1 decline with COX-2 inhibitors in AERD, reinforcing the class signal of low cross-reactivity, though rare reactions can still occur and warrant observation on first exposure [^117GRB27].

> But wait, what about regulatory labeling for the class. FDA labeling for celecoxib warns about severe bronchospasm in aspirin-sensitive asthma and advises against use in that subpopulation, with caution in preexisting asthma. This is a conservative class signal and reflects historical safety concerns rather than contemporary challenge data, so I should balance label language with modern evidence and guideline nuance rather than apply it reflexively to etoricoxib in AERD [^116BGQue] [^111cV4Bd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the mechanistic and clinical data suggest that highly selective COX-2 agents are generally safe in AERD when given under supervision, even if labels remain cautious, so shared decision-making and documented observation are key [^113xrZCk].

> I need to ensure I address cardiovascular risk. Etoricoxib has been associated with increased cardiovascular thrombotic events in network meta-analyses, with confidence that its MI risk increase exceeds 30% compared with placebo, and this risk is dose- and duration-dependent; therefore, I should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid in patients with high cardiovascular risk, and consider naproxen if an NSAID is needed and cardiovascular safety is paramount [^114tjZrc] [^117JE4Vd]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought naproxen might be a safer NSAID alternative for AERD, but I should correct that; naproxen is a nonselective COX-1 inhibitor and can precipitate AERD reactions, so it is not appropriate for AERD despite its favorable cardiovascular profile, reinforcing that COX-2 agents are the preferred NSAID class when an NSAID is necessary in AERD [^113xrZCk] [^112MZbPx].

> Let me translate this into practical prescribing. Before prescribing any NSAID, I should screen for AERD by asking about prior aspirin or NSAID reactions, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and severe asthma. If AERD is suspected or confirmed, I should avoid COX-1 NSAIDs and, if an NSAID is indicated, prefer a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor such as etoricoxib with supervised first-dose observation for at least 2 hours, clear return precautions, and access to urgent care if symptoms occur [^112MZbPx] [^114ssyJV]. I should confirm baseline spirometry and symptoms, document informed consent regarding rare but potential reactions, and arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours after the first dose to reassess tolerance and reinforce avoidance of COX-1 agents going forward [^116r3Vsn].

> I should double-check dosing and monitoring details. Typical etoricoxib doses for pain and inflammation are 60–90 mg once daily. In AERD, I would start at 60 mg, observe for 2 hours with peak flow or spirometry if feasible, and only continue if there is no bronchospasm, nasal congestion, ocular symptoms, or rash. If tolerated, I would maintain the lowest effective dose and reassess the ongoing need regularly to limit cardiovascular exposure [^112MZbPx] [^116r3Vsn] [^114tjZrc]. If any respiratory symptoms occur, I should treat promptly with SABA and consider systemic corticosteroids if moderate to severe, consistent with asthma exacerbation management principles, and permanently avoid etoricoxib thereafter [^1117x8e1].

> Next, I should review alternatives and adjuncts. Acetaminophen is generally preferred for analgesia in AERD when an NSAID is not essential, though high doses may provoke mild reactions in highly sensitive patients; if NSAID therapy is essential and etoricoxib is not tolerated or contraindicated, aspirin desensitization with daily aspirin therapy is an evidence-based pathway that can improve upper and lower airway outcomes in selected patients, ideally coordinated by allergy specialists [^112MZbPx] [^113xrZCk] [^116ezbep]. Hold on, I should verify that desensitization is not first-line for everyone; it is best reserved for patients with significant NSAID indications, refractory CRSwNP, or corticosteroid dependence after standard therapy optimization, given procedural risks and the need for daily aspirin thereafter [^111H4dA1].

> I need to ensure baseline asthma is optimized to mitigate risk. In AERD, inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay, with leukotriene receptor antagonists frequently added, and biologic therapy considered for severe eosinophilic disease. Optimizing control reduces the likelihood that any NSAID exposure will unmask instability and facilitates safer supervised challenges if needed [^111QC36u] [^114ssyJV]. Let me reconsider whether poor control changes the NSAID calculus. Yes, in poorly controlled asthma I would defer NSAID initiation until control improves to reduce the severity of any potential reaction and to allow clearer attribution if symptoms occur [^notfound].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and patient education. I will record the indication for NSAID therapy, the AERD screening and any prior reactions, the supervised administration plan, emergency action steps, and the agreed monitoring and follow-up. I will also counsel on strict avoidance of COX-1 NSAIDs and provide a written list of common agents to avoid, including ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and others, to prevent inadvertent exposures [^112MZbPx] [^113xrZCk]. If the patient has only asthma without AERD features, I should still ask about NSAID tolerance and advise stopping if asthma worsens, but routine supervised COX-2 strategies are not required in the absence of a suggestive history [^113ouL65] [^115jiFgY].

Etoricoxib is **generally safe for patients with asthma** who do not have aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) [^113ouL65], but it should be used with caution and close monitoring for any respiratory symptoms. In patients with AERD, etoricoxib is **not absolutely contraindicated**; guidelines allow cautious use with supervised observation for at least 2 hours after the first dose [^112MZbPx], as cross-reactivity is rare but possible [^113xrZCk]. For non-AERD asthma, etoricoxib does not significantly affect lung function or airway responsiveness [^1129V4cy] and is not associated with increased exacerbation risk. If asthma symptoms worsen after dosing, discontinue etoricoxib and seek medical attention.

---

## Mechanism of action and asthma relevance

Etoricoxib is a **selective COX-2 inhibitor** [^111H4dA1] that reduces prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing inflammation and pain. In asthma, prostaglandins — particularly prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) — play a protective role in maintaining airway tone and preventing bronchoconstriction. COX-1 inhibition reduces PGE2 and can precipitate bronchospasm in susceptible individuals, whereas selective COX-2 inhibition largely preserves PGE2 and is less likely to trigger bronchospasm [^117GRB27].

---

## Clinical evidence on etoricoxib use in asthma patients

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD)

- **Definition**: AERD is characterized by asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin and other NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 [^114ssyJV] [^116QPfQ5].

- **Cross-reactivity**: Traditional NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 can cause severe bronchospasm in AERD patients due to reduced PGE2 and increased leukotriene production [^113xrZCk].

- **COX-2 inhibitors**: Selective COX-2 inhibitors, including etoricoxib, have minimal COX-1 inhibition and are generally well tolerated in AERD patients [^113xrZCk].

- **Clinical studies**: A study by Bavbek et al. (2006) demonstrated that etoricoxib was well tolerated in 77 AERD patients, with no immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions observed [^116r3Vsn]. The estimated probability of cross-reactivity was 0% to 2%.

- **Guidelines**: The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines suggest that COX-2 inhibitors, including etoricoxib, may be considered in AERD patients under medical supervision, with observation for at least 2 hours after administration [^112MZbPx].

---

### Non-AERD asthma patients

In non-AERD asthma patients, etoricoxib **does not significantly affect lung function**, airway responsiveness, or inflammatory markers [^1129V4cy]. No significant increase in asthma exacerbations or respiratory symptoms has been reported with etoricoxib use in this population.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Etoricoxib is **generally well tolerated** in asthma patients, but the following adverse effects should be considered:

- **Respiratory symptoms**: Although rare, some patients may experience mild respiratory symptoms such as cough or dyspnea.

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Common NSAID-related gastrointestinal side effects, such as dyspepsia, nausea, and abdominal pain, may occur.

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Long-term use of COX-2 inhibitors, including etoricoxib, has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions [^114tjZrc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide the following **recommendations** for etoricoxib use in asthma patients:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AERD patients | - Etoricoxib may be considered under medical supervision <br/> - Observation for at least 2 hours after administration is recommended [^112MZbPx] |
| Non-AERD asthma patients | - Etoricoxib is generally considered safe <br/> - Monitor for any respiratory symptoms or exacerbations [^1129V4cy] |
| Patients with cardiovascular risk factors | - Use with caution <br/> - Consider alternative analgesics if possible [^114tjZrc] |

---

## Precautions and monitoring

When prescribing etoricoxib to asthma patients, the following precautions and monitoring steps are **recommended**:

- **Medical history**: Assess for a history of aspirin or NSAID-induced respiratory reactions [^113ouL65].

- **Initial administration**: Consider supervised administration of the first dose, particularly in AERD patients [^112MZbPx].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for any respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, dyspnea, or cough, especially after the first dose [^112MZbPx].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop etoricoxib immediately if respiratory symptoms occur or worsen [^115jiFgY].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

If etoricoxib is contraindicated or not tolerated, **alternative analgesic options** include:

- **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)**: Generally considered safe for asthma patients, including those with AERD [^113xrZCk].

- **Opioids**: May be considered for short-term pain relief, but caution is advised due to potential respiratory depression and dependence risks.

- **Non-NSAID analgesics**: Such as tramadol, may be considered based on individual patient factors and clinical judgment.

---

Etoricoxib is **generally safe for asthma patients without AERD**, with no significant impact on lung function or exacerbation risk [^1129V4cy]. In AERD patients, etoricoxib may be considered under medical supervision, with observation after the first dose due to rare cross-reactivity [^112MZbPx]. Close monitoring and individualized risk assessment are essential when prescribing etoricoxib to asthma patients.

### Safety of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [^111NvH38]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In 5 to 10% of adult patients with asthma, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) and most other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) precipitate acute asthmatic attacks. Therefore, choosing an alternative anti-inflammatory agent for patients with adverse reactions to an NSAID is a common problem in clinical practice. The discoveries that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is an inducible form of COX that is involved in inflammation and that COX-1 is the major isoform responsible for the production of prostaglandins have provided a reasonable basis for the development of specific COX-2 inhibitors as a new class of anti-inflammatory agents.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that rofecoxib, a specific inhibitor of COX-2, does not cause asthmatic attacks in patients with ASA and/or other NSAID-induced asthma.

Methods

We studied 40 patients, all of whom had experienced asthma induced by at least two different NSAIDs. The patients were challenged in a single-blind manner with different doses of rofecoxib on 3 different days, until either the therapeutic dose of 25 mg or intolerance was reached. Each patient was rechallenged with 25 mg of rofecoxib 7 days later if no evidence of intolerance had been observed previously.

Results

Rofecoxib, 25 mg, was proven to be well tolerated in all 40 patients with ASA-induced and NSAID-induced asthma.

Conclusion

Our study appears to demonstrate that rofecoxib is a suitable NSAID for treatment of patients with ASA and/or other NSAID-induced asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115zSY4A]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that oral dexamethasone (12–16 mg once daily in adults and 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily in children for 1–2 days) has also been studied, showing similar efficacy to 3–5 days of oral prednisolone, with better adherence and a significantly lower risk of vomiting.

### Aspirin-induced asthma: advances in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^1115iAcw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

In some asthmatic individuals, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit cyclooxygen-ase 1 (COX-1) exacerbate the condition. This distinct clinical syndrome, called aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), is characterized by an eosinophilic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, aspirin sensitivity, and asthma. There is no in vitro test for the disorder, and diagnosis can be established only by provocation challenges with aspirin or NSAIDs. Recent major advances in the molecular biology of eicosanoids, exemplified by the cloning of 2 cysteinyl leukotriene receptors and the discovery of a whole family of cyclooxygenase enzymes, offer new insights into mechanisms operating in AIA. The disease runs a protracted course even if COX-1 inhibitors are avoided, and the course is often severe, many patients requiring systemic corticosteroids to control their sinusitis and asthma. Aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided, but highly specific COX-2 inhibitors, known as coxibs, are well tolerated and can be safely used. Aspirin desensitization, followed by daily aspirin treatment, is a valuable therapeutic option in most patients with AIA, particularly those with recurrent nasal polyposis or overdependence on systemic corticosteroids.

### Typical antipsychotics is associated with increased risk of severe exacerbation in asthma patients: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^117W29k4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although previous studies have shown that the use of antipsychotics at the time of hospital admission increases the risk of asthma-related death and hospital readmission, the association between the use of antipsychotics and severe asthma exacerbation has not been investigated in a nationwide asthma population. The effects of atypical antipsychotics on severe asthma exacerbation have not yet been examined. In this case-crossover study, we analyzed 18,657 newly diagnosed asthma patients with severe exacerbation leading to ED visits or hospitalization. Using multivariable conditional logistic regression, we found that the use of antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR: 1.27). This result was not confounded by respiratory infection, schizophrenia, use of NSAIDs or non-selective β-blockers, or different types of inhaled bronchodilator prescriptions. In the subgroup analysis, the use of typical antipsychotics significantly increased the risk of severe asthma exacerbation by 40%. Furthermore, antipsychotics, particularly typical antipsychotics, have a dose-dependent effect on severe exacerbation of asthma. Analysis of the use of atypical antipsychotics did not show an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation. Thus, we tentatively conclude that the use of typical antipsychotics is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation.

We found that the use of typical antipsychotics led to a higher risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR: 1.40), whereas the use of atypical antipsychotics did not. This finding is consistent with the different adverse events observed among typical and atypical antipsychotic users. The use of typical antipsychotics is more likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms, and the use of atypical antipsychotics is often associated with weight gain and metabolic disturbance. A possible explanation for the discordance of side effects between these two groups of drugs is that typical antipsychotics have a higher affinity to the dopaminergic receptor and lower affinity to the serotonin receptor compared to those for atypical agents. The higher antipsychotic affinity to specific receptors is associated with a higher risk of different side effects.

We found that the simultaneous use of typical and atypical antipsychotics increases the risk of severe asthma exacerbation compared to the use of monotherapy. The combination of two antipsychotics is a widely used strategy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and a combination of typical and atypical antipsychotics is the most common management in real-world practice. Compared with monotherapy, several studies have reported that combination therapy is associated with increased adverse events and mortality rates. However, a recent meta-analysis did not show a different risk of serious adverse events between combination antipsychotics and monotherapy. Further research is needed to investigate the risk of combination of atypical and atypical antipsychotics.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114ssyJV]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — clinical features, diagnosis, and management — The clinical picture starts with nasal congestion and anosmia, progressing to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; asthma and hypersensitivity to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) develop subsequently, and following ingestion of aspirin or NSAIDs, an acute asthma attack develops within minutes to 1–2 hours, sometimes progressing to severe bronchospasm, shock, loss of consciousness, and respiratory arrest. AERD is more likely to be associated with low lung function and severe asthma, and the prevalence of AERD is 7% in general adult asthma populations and 15% in severe asthma. For diagnosis, a history of exacerbation following ingestion of aspirin or other NSAIDs is highly suggestive, and aspirin challenge (oral, bronchial or nasal) is the gold standard as there are no reliable in vitro tests; oral aspirin challenge tests must only be conducted in a specialized center with cardiopulmonary resuscitation capabilities because of the high risk of severe reactions, while bronchial and nasal challenges with lysine aspirin are safer than oral challenges and may be safely performed in allergy centers. For management, patients with AERD should avoid aspirin or NSAID-containing products and other medications that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1); when an NSAID is indicated for other conditions, a COX-2 inhibitor or paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be considered with supervision and observation for at least 2 hours after administration, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of asthma therapy in AERD, but oral corticosteroids (OCS) are sometimes required and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) may also be useful.

### Risk factors for asthma exacerbations [^114cR2HB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that patients with childhood asthma and adult-onset asthma should be reviewed differently regarding exacerbations and risk factors. Single risk factors may have a relatively larger effect on children who are usually otherwise healthy and have few comorbidities. Moreover, the most common reasons behind asthma exacerbations differ when comparing children and adults; for example, children are typically more atopic with higher serum IgE levels and demonstrate a more reversible airway obstruction compared to their adult counterparts. Adult-onset asthma patients have comorbidities and lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, obesity, work-related exposures) that influence asthma severity and exacerbation frequency. The prevalence of these comorbidities increases with age(eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, GERD), decreasing the significance of a single risk factor.

GERD was shown to increase the risk for asthma exacerbations in regression analyses. GERD has been identified as a common feature in patients with severe asthma and frequent exacerbations. In relation to GERD, a Taiwanese study reported that patients with Helicobacter pylori infection exhibited a higher risk of adult-onset asthma than those without H pylori infection. A recent large meta-analysis addressing 32 studies showed an association between GERD and asthma exacerbations that indicated that GERD increases the risk of asthma exacerbations. A multicenter double-blind randomized study reported a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprazole) to reduce asthma exacerbations, although no improvement in asthma symptoms or pulmonary function was reported. Although the results of these studies are in line with ours, the findings of studies on GERD in asthma exacerbations remain controversial. However, a bidirectional association between GERD and asthma seems to exist. We cannot confirm that GERD is causally related with an increased risk of exacerbations, but our results clearly indicate that among evaluated risk factors, even with treatment, GERD (and/or use of proton pump inhibitor medication) is a sign indicating higher risk for asthma exacerbations.

### Does IgE have a role in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease? [^11156trj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors cautiously, but justifiably, conclude that omalizumab "has inhibitory effects on ongoing MC activation". These omalizumab-associated MC inhibitory effects are convincing because both the respiratory reaction and expected increase in urinary excretion of LTE 4 and PGD-M to aspirin were inhibited. How do these findings explain mechanisms of AERD and MC function to also direct future treatment options for this asthma phenotype? Omalizumab is an effective treatment in selected patients with allergic asthma, presumably by preventing IgE-allergen activation of pulmonary MCs. Omalizumab is also effective in chronic spontaneous urticaria in which allergen-specific IgE responses are usually absent and, in this sense, parallels AERD in which the reaction to NSAIDs is not an IgE-antigen response. Omalizumab's mechanisms of action in chronic urticaria are not established, but the prompt reduction of hives suggests a suppression of MC function. Whether this benefit relates to diminished MC IgE receptor expression on MCs and/or a suppression of MC activation is not established but possible. The data from Hayashi and colleagues showing both diminished baseline and post–aspirin challenge increases in urinary LTE and PGD-M generation strongly supports but does not prove the possibility of reduced MC activation.

There are limitations to the Hayashi and colleagues study. The number of subjects enrolled was small, 16, with a protective response to omalizumab found in only 10. The fall in FEV₁ to aspirin while on placebo treatment was modest, a mean drop of 10%; however, these aspirin-associated pulmonary reactions were associated with increased LT generation. These shortcomings aside, this study is the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in which both airway AERD reactions and measures of MC function were made. I believe these findings represent a major step forward to more fully understand mechanisms of AERD.

Important questions remain about the AERD puzzle, particularly identifying mechanisms underlying dysregulated reactions to NSAIDs and how omalizumab modified AERD. Intriguing and enlightening to me were new insights gained by using omalizumab to probe the roles of MCs and IgE in AERD. Hayashi and colleagues have directed attention to IgE as a potential component of dysregulated MC function in AERD and as a possible therapeutic target in this high-risk asthma population, and have provided new clues to more definitively solve this complicated puzzle.

### Typical antipsychotics is associated with increased risk of severe exacerbation in asthma patients: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^113qG1sv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe asthma exacerbation reduces patients' quality of life, results in visits to the emergency department (ED) and hospitalization, and incurs additional medical costs. Antipsychotics block receptors with bronchodilation function; however, the association between antipsychotic use and severe asthma exacerbation is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of antipsychotics on asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations.

Methods

A case-crossover design was used in this study. Using the 2003–2017 Taiwan National Health Insurance Reimbursement Database, we established a cohort of 18,657 adults with asthma exacerbation leading to ED visits or hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regressions were conducted to explore the association between antipsychotic use and severe asthma exacerbation. Subgroup analyses of different classes, doses, receptor functions of antipsychotics, different psychiatric disease, and sensitivity analyses of excluding patients with schizophrenia were also performed.

Results

Antipsychotic use was associated with a higher risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.54; P = 0.013) compared with no use of antipsychotics. The use of typical antipsychotics increased the risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.10–1.79, P = 0.007), whereas the use of atypical antipsychotics did not. These results did not change after the exclusion of patients with schizophrenia. There was a dose-dependent effect of antipsychotics (trend test, P = 0.025). Antipsychotics that block the M2 muscarinic or D2 dopaminergic receptors were associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR: 1.39, 95% CI 1.10–1.76, P = 0.007 and adjusted OR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.08–1.63, P = 0.008, respectively). However, use of antipsychotics did not increase risk of severe asthma exacerbation in patients with psychiatric disorder.

Conclusions

The use of typical antipsychotics is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation, especially for patients without psychiatric disorders. Further research on the impact of typical antipsychotics on asthma exacerbation is warranted.

### Efficacy and safety of fevipiprant in patients with uncontrolled asthma: two replicate, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ZEAL-1 and ZEAL-2) [^1161hyze]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways associated with airway hyper-responsiveness and structural remodelling, and is characterised by respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough. The goals of asthma therapy are to attain asthma control and to reduce the risk of asthma worsening. For patients who remain uncontrolled on low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy (step 2), the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends progression to step 3: a combination of low-dose ICS plus long-acting β₂-agonist (LABA), medium-/high-dose ICS, or low-dose ICS plus leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA). Asthma patients who are uncontrolled on low-dose ICS plus LABA (step 3) may benefit from increasing to medium-/high-dose ICS plus LABA, high-dose ICS plus LTRA, or the addition of tiotropium (step 4). Despite current guidelines and available treatments, asthma control remains suboptimal in a large percentage of patients and additional oral add-on therapies are needed.

Research in context

Fevipiprant (QAW039) is an oral, highly selective, competitive, reversible antagonist of the prostaglandin D₂ (PGD₂) receptor. PGD₂ is a major prostanoid inflammatory mediator identified in asthma. By binding to the DP₂ receptor, fevipiprant inhibits the migration and activation of eosinophils, basophils, ILC-2 (type 2 innate lymphoid cells) and T lymphocytes into the airway tissues and blocks the PGD₂-driven release of Th2 cytokines. In a phase 2 'proof-of-concept' study in a subgroup of patients with reduced lung function at baseline, treatment with fevipiprant 500 mg once daily showed significant improvements in pre-dose trough FEV₁ and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores compared with placebo. A phase 2 dose-finding study showed significant differences in FEV₁ with fevipiprant compared with placebo, with the largest difference being observed with fevipiprant 150 mg total daily dose. In a third phase 2 study, patients treated with fevipiprant 225 twice daily showed a 3.5 times greater reduction in sputum eosinophils compared with placebo.

### Effects of selective COX-2 inhibition on allergen-induced bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation in asthma [^1129V4cy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Prostaglandins that constrict and relax airways are synthesized in reactions catalyzed by either COX-1 or COX-2. It is not known whether selective inhibition of COX-2 makes asthmatic responses better or worse.

Objective

To determine the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor, etoricoxib, on allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic subjects.

Methods

Sixteen subjects with mild atopic asthma underwent rising dose inhalation challenges with allergen or methacholine to determine PD₂₀ FEV₁ during a control study period or after 10 to 13 days of treatment with etoricoxib (90 mg once daily). The order of study periods was randomized with at least 2-week washout periods. Induced sputum cells and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels were used to assess airway inflammation and blood assays for COX-1 and COX-2 activity to assess enzyme inhibition. Urinary excretion of lipids was used to assess prostaglandin biosynthesis.

Results

Etoricoxib did not change baseline lung function, nor airway responsiveness to allergen or to methacholine. Neither were the allergen-induced increase in sputum eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels affected by treatment. The biochemical effectiveness of the treatment was established both in the blood assays and by the distinct inhibitory effect of etoricoxib on urinary excretion of tetranor-prostaglandin E2 (P < .001).

Conclusions

This first study of COX-2 inhibition in provoked asthma found no negative effects of etoricoxib on allergen-induced airflow obstruction and sputum eosinophils, basal lung function, or methacholine responsiveness. The study suggests that short-term use of COX-2 inhibitors is safe in subjects with asthma.

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FmmzV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparing the asthmatic and general populations for short-term asthma-relevant outcomes after ibuprofen use, no conflicts in results were observed. The two observational studies in the general population both observed reductions in asthma-related outcomes, while one observational and one interventional study in the asthmatic population both observed increases in asthma-related outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of avoiding naïve pooling of results from studies in these different paediatric populations.

It is noteworthy that all RCTs reviewed compared ibuprofen with an active comparator. Of the studies comparing ibuprofen with a baseline of no alternative drug, three were cohort studies, and one was cross-sectional. One non-randomised interventional study compared an asthmatic sample with a healthy control sample. This highlights one of the limitations of the RCT design approach in assessing adverse events in the youngest children. As a recent RCT feasibility study found, almost three quarters of parents surveyed described the use of a placebo comparator treatment as unacceptable for treating their child's fever or pain. This ethical unacceptability of using a placebo arm in clinical trials for treating pain and fever in young children introduces an ambiguity into these active comparator RCT studies, as a lack of difference among active comparators does not exclude the possibility that both ibuprofen and active comparator use may be associated with parallel increases in asthma exacerbations. It has been argued that, given that ibuprofen and paracetamol have different mechanisms of action, it is unlikely that their use could be associated with similar increases in the rate of asthma-related complications that are known to be determined by disparate mechanisms of disease. However, this speculation requires careful examination and empirical support. Observational studies with comparator groups in which an active treatment was not prescribed or taken can be used as a baseline control to assess the impact of ibuprofen alone, acknowledging the challenges of inferring causality in observational studies. It is these advantages and disadvantages of both RCTs and observational designs that require a review of the association between ibuprofen use and asthma-related outcomes in children to consider and attempt to synthesise all study design types. This feature of our review adds substantially to two recent systematic reviews in this area that either limited the study designs to RCTs or limited the population to those under 2 years.

### Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium (vimovo) [^113fFuFX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.8	Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, VIMOVO is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When VIMOVO is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9	Serious or Severe Skin Reactions

Naproxen

NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning.

Esomeprazole

PPIs can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including SJS, TEN, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

VIMOVO

Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious or severe skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of VIMOVO at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. VIMOVO is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^117JE4Vd]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been the cornerstone of pain management in patients with osteoarthritis and other painful conditions. In the United States an estimated 5% of all visits to a doctor are related to prescriptions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and they are among the most commonly used drugs. In 2004, rofecoxib, marketed as a cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX 2) selective inhibitor, was withdrawn from the market after the results of a randomised placebo controlled trialshowed an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with the drug. This finding was confirmed in other trials and a cumulative meta-analysis. Since then debate has surrounded the cardiovascular safety of cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors, followed by similar concerns about traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration decided against the approval of etoricoxib because of its inadequate risk-benefit profile.

These debates and the patchwork of evidence resulting from multiple trials and cohort studies have unsettled practising clinicians. Several standard meta-analyses were unable to resolve the debate because they failed to integrate all available randomised evidence in one analysis. Network meta-analysis allows a unified, coherent analysis of all randomised controlled trials that compare non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs head to head or with placebo while fully respecting randomisation. We analysed the cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by integrating all available direct and indirect evidence in network meta-analyses.

### Pharmacologic interventions to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations [^114nUXas]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are known to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations and asthma fatalities. In addition, an increased dose of ICS at the onset of exacerbation can reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids, although this may require a fourfold increase in dose. The overuse of short-acting beta(2)-agonists or long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists, used as monotherapy, increases these risks. By contrast, the use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists together with ICS has been demonstrated to reduce the doses of ICS needed for ideal asthma control, as well as to reduce asthma exacerbations. This has been best demonstrated in the Formoterol and Corticosteroids Establishing Therapy and Oxis and Pulmicort Turbuhaler in the Management of Asthma studies, which demonstrated that the combination of inhaled budesonide and formoterol reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations over that achieved by budesonide alone. Even the "as needed" use of inhaled formoterol added to ICS reduces asthma exacerbations. The combination inhaler, Symbicort, containing both budesonide and formoterol, reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations to a similar extent as the monocomponents, given separately. Treatment with either leukotriene receptor antagonists or anti-IgE also reduces the risks of asthma exacerbations, but the magnitude of the benefit compared with the combination of ICS and long-acting beta(2)-agonists is not yet known.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management… [^113yA9Y8]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations. An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation. If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended.

STEP 2 Preferred step 2 controller options in adults and adolescents include a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed or low-dose ICS/formoterol as needed. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are less effective but can be considered for patients who are unable or unwilling to use an ICS or who have concomitant allergic rhinitis. The preferred step 2 controller for children six to 11 years of age is a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed. Less effective options include a daily leukotriene receptor antagonist or using a low-dose ICS as needed with a SABA. STEP 3 Options in adults and adolescents include low-dose ICS/long-acting beta 2-agonist as daily treatment with a SABA as needed, or low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily treatment and as needed. In children six to 11 years of age, either a medium-dose ICS or a low-dose ICS/LABA combination should be used as a controller, with a SABA as needed.

A subsequent study demonstrated that as-needed combination therapy reduced severe exacerbations in mild and moderate asthma, which was highlighted as a POEM in AFP. These data, with evidence of increased severe exacerbations and mortality with as-needed albuterol alone, resulted in these dramatic changes in treatment recommendations for mild to moderate asthma. — Michael J.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111gzNiu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (rescue medication use) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 9 is in EtD Table XIII in Appendix B.

Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence, compared SABA alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief. This treatment resulted in a 33% relative risk (RR) reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Two of these three trials assessed growth but found different effects on this outcome. Ducharme et alfound a 5% lower gain in height and weight in study participants receiving intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily at onset of a respiratory tract infection for up to 10 days) than in participants receiving a placebo. The authors noted a significant correlation between the cumulative dose of fluticasone and changes in height. In contrast, Bacharier et aldid not find an effect on linear growth of budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in comparison with placebo in children with an "identified respiratory tract illness". Whether these differences in growth effects were due to differences in drugs, doses, duration of treatment, or other factors is not clear.

Rationale and discussion

The main comparator for which data are available is SABA-only therapy. The demonstrated efficacy but conflicting data regarding the effect of a short course of a daily ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy on growth led the Expert Panel to develop a conditional recommendation for this therapy starting at the on set of an apparent respiratory tract infection for children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing. Although one study that compared short ICS courses with regular daily ICS treatment showed no differences in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids with moderate certainty of evidence, the Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison because this study was not adequately powered to demonstrate equivalence. No studies produced robust data on comparisons of intermittent ICS use with no treatment or a nonpharmacologic therapy.

Question 4.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of intermittent ICS compared to ICS controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 10: In individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends either daily low-dose ICS and as needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly.

Case 3

Premenopausal woman, menarche at the age of 11, one high-risk pregnancy due to placental abruption and rupture, one spontaneous abortion due to fetal growth restriction and a third pregnancy without complications, two cesarean sections, with a history of hysterectomy for a hemorrhagic uterine leiomyoma complicated by retroperitoneal bleeding with acute anemia at the age of 40. The patient is obese (body mass index, BMI: 30.1 kg/m²), has a history of dyslipidemia, smoking in late adolescence (7 pack-years), childhood adenoidectomy, childhood asthma and vertebral bone degenerative disease, and an allergy to etoricoxib (facial edema). The patient has no personal history of cancer but has a family history of cancer: father died at 57 with oral cavity and esophageal cancers (was a smoker and alcoholic), paternal grandfather died at 72 with lung cancer (was a smoker), paternal uncle died at 50+ with pancreatic cancer, maternal uncle died at 50 with gastric cancer. There was no history of renal cell cancer or of other tumors in the family. Four years after hysterectomy (at the age of 44), the patient developed what seemed to be a recurrence of her childhood asthma symptoms, with episodes of dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, and hypersomnia. The symptoms would exacerbate on physical exertion. A chest X-ray revealed a right lung mass. A subsequent thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan showed a tissue-dense, spiked-countour node on the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, invading the mediastinal pleura, plus a second tissue-dense, bilobed, ampulliform mass in the left pulmonary hilum, involving the left pulmonary artery anteriorly and compressing the left main bronchus and adjacent segmental bronchii. There were no lymphadenopathies or any other findings. A PET scan revealed increased metabolism of the lung lesions. The right lung node was biopsied, presenting a fusocellular proliferation, without atypia, necrosis or mitotic activity, positive for desmin, caldesmon, estrogen receptors, and actin (weak expression). Remaining markers were negative, namely cytokeratins, ALK1, S100, CD34, myogenin, myoD1, inhibin, calretinin, CD117, and HMB-45. This result was compatible with a benign mesenchymal neoplasia with smooth muscle differentiation. A fine needle aspiration cytology was performed on the left lung hilar mass, which showed the same fusocellular, benign proliferation pattern. CA 125 and routine blood tests were normal. Serum assessment of estradiol and FSH and LH were at premenopausal levels. The patient was started on hormone therapy with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days subcutaneous + letrozole 2.5 mg once daily. Estrogen levels decreased from premenopausal levels of 166 to < 9 pg/mL. The patient mentioned no desire to have more children and was submitted to bilateral annexectomy. After bilateral annexectomy, goserelin was discontinued and letrozole was kept at 2.5 mg once daily. At a follow-up assessment, serum hormone levels were found to be compatible with postmenopausal levels. A follow-up chest CT scan performed 6 months after starting hormonal blockade and 2 months after surgical castration showed a significant reduction of the pulmonary lesions' size, the right upper lobe mass with a 74% reduction in size, and the left pulmonary hilum mass with a 44% reduction in size. The patient has been on respiratory kinesitherapy and her symptoms have improved.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116iFeG9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — avoidance of medications that may make asthma worse — Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause severe exacerbations, and beta‑blocker drugs, including topical ophthalmic preparations, may cause bronchospasm. Clinicians are advised to always ask people with asthma about concomitant medications, including eyedrops, and to always ask about asthma and previous reactions before prescribing NSAIDs, advising patients to stop using these medications if asthma worsens. Aspirin and NSAIDs are not generally contraindicated in asthma unless there is a history of previous reactions to these agents (Evidence A). For people with asthma who may benefit from oral or ophthalmic beta‑blocker treatment, a decision to prescribe these medications should be made on a case‑by‑case basis, and treatment should only be initiated under close medical supervision by a specialist (Evidence D). Asthma should not be regarded as an absolute contraindication to use cardioselective beta‑blockers when they are indicated for acute coronary events, but the relative risks and benefits should be considered (Evidence D), and the prescribing physician and patient should be aware of the risks and benefits of treatment.

5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When celecoxib is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9 Serious Skin Reactions

Serious skin reactions have occurred following treatment with celecoxib, including erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). These serious events may occur without warning and can be fatal.

Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of celecoxib at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reports in patients taking NSAIDs such as celecoxib. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue celecoxib and evaluate the patient immediately.

### Typical antipsychotics is associated with increased risk of severe exacerbation in asthma patients: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^117LogHo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Characteristics of patients in the case and control periods

GERD: gastroesophageal reflux disease; ICS: inhaled corticosteroid, LABA: long-acting β-agonist; LAMA: long-acting muscarinic antagonist; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; OR: odds ratio; SABA: short-acting β-agonist; SAMA: short-acting muscarinic antagonist

Table 2 shows the results of the conditional logistic regression for the risk of severe asthma exacerbation associated with the use of antipsychotics. There were 713 (3.8%) patients who used antipsychotics during the case period and 601 (3.2%) patients during the control period. The adjusted OR was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.54; P = 0.013). The adjusted ORs of all covariates in the multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis are shown in Additional file 1: Table S5. Schizophrenia increased the risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR, 5.46; 95% CI 1.48–20.18, P = 0.011). For patients with schizophrenia, depression or bipolar disorder, use of antipsychotics did not increase the risk of asthma severe exacerbation (Additional file 1: Table S6, Additional file 1: Table S7 and Additional file 1: Table S8). After excluding patients with schizophrenia, any use of antipsychotics increased the risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR, 1.29; 95% CI 1.07–1.57, P = 0.009) (Table 3). Similarly, any use of antipsychotics increased the risk of severe asthma exacerbation after excluding patients with psychiatric disorder-related ER visits or hospitalizations (adjusted OR: 1.29, 95% CI 1.06–1.56, P = 0.009) (Additional file 1: Table S9). On the other hand, use of antidepressant did not increase the risk of severe asthma exacerbation (Additional file 1: Table S10).

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SaGZa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Two studies assessing differences between ibuprofen and paracetamol use over longer follow-up periods in asthmatic populations report conflicting results. Due to several study similarities, we tentatively synthesised the two results, and no aggregate difference between ibuprofen and paracetamol was observed. However, in the RCT, the median dose of trial medication (ibuprofen or paracetamol) was 5.5 doses (IQR = 1–15) and matched between trial arms. In the retrospective cohort study, it could not be determined by the original investigators whether patients took the medication prescribed. Additionally, the observational study did not control for upper respiratory tract infections, a well-documented source of confounding by indication, which were not well-matched between the ibuprofen and paracetamol cohorts. For these reasons, the RCT finding alone or the synthesised outcome of no difference between drugs seems most justifiable.

### Safety of high-dose rofecoxib in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^113ZNDY7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by progressive sinusitis, nasal polyposis, and asthma that begins and continues in the absence of exposure to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Cross-sensitivity to all NSAIDs that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) occurs in these individuals. Reactions to aspirin and NSAIDs in patients with AERD are largely due to inhibition of COX-1. Despite accumulating data on the safety of COX-2 selective inhibitors in AERD, concern still remains that high doses of a COX-2 inhibitor may be sufficient to induce a cross-reaction.

Objective

To determine whether high-dose rofecoxib cross-reacts in patients with AERD and asthma.

Methods

Sixty asthmatic patients underwent blinded placebo-controlled oral challenges with 50 mg of rofecoxib. Aspirin sensitivity was subsequently confirmed in all patients with the use of single-blinded aspirin challenges.

Results

None of the 60 patients experienced any symptoms, changes in nasal examination results, or declines in lung function during rofecoxib challenge. All 60 patients experienced respiratory reactions to aspirin challenge, with a mean provoking dose of 57 mg. The exact 1-sided 95% confidence interval for the underlying probability of 50 mg of rofecoxib inducing respiratory cross-reactions in patients with AERD is 0 to 0.05, or 0% to 5%.

Conclusions

These results confirm the lack of cross-reactivity of aspirin and the highly selective COX-2 inhibitors in AERD. We suggest that it is time for the labeling of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors to reflect these data and for the warning that patients with AERD in particular and asthmatic patients in general avoid selective COX-2 inhibitors to be removed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117YNbRp]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering ipratropium in addition to short-acting β-agonists for the management of moderate-to-severe exacerbations in the emergency department to reduce hospitalizations in adult,
adolescent, and pediatric patients
and to improve peak expiratory flow and FEV₁ in adolescent and adult patients.

### Safety risks for patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease after acute exposure to selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 inhibitors: meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials [^117GRB27]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause bronchospasm in susceptible patients with asthma, often termed aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), with the risk being greatest after acute exposure. Selective NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 might be safer.

Objective

We sought to systematically evaluate changes in symptoms and pulmonary function after acute selective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor exposure in patients with the AERD phenotype.

Methods

A systematic review of databases was performed to identify all blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating acute selective NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor exposure in patients with AERD. Effect estimates for changes in respiratory function and symptoms were pooled by using fixed-effects meta-analysis, with heterogeneity investigated.

Results

No significant difference in respiratory symptoms (risk difference, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.01; p = 0.57), decrease in FEV1 of 20% or greater (RD, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.02; p = 0.77), or nasal symptoms (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.02; p = 0.42) occurred with COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib). Selective NSAID exposure caused respiratory symptoms in approximately 1 in 13 patients with AERD (RD, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.14; p = 0.01). No significant differences were found according to leukotriene antagonist exposure or whether NSAIDs were randomly allocated.

Conclusion

According to clinical trial evidence in patients with stable mild-to-moderate asthma with AERD, acute exposure to COX-2 inhibitors is safe, and selective NSAIDs exhibit a small risk. Thus COX-2 inhibitors could be used in patients with AERD or in patients with general asthma unwilling to risk nonselective NSAID exposure when oral challenge tests are unavailable.

### Safety of COX-2 inhibitors in asthma patients with aspirin hypersensitivity [^114gYA8t]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the safety of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in asthma patients with aspirin hypersensitivity.

Data Sources

Clinical studies were identified using MEDLINE (1966-September 2002). Key search terms included cyclooxygenase inhibitors, aspirin, asthma, and hypersensitivity. English-language articles were identified and included. References from the identified articles were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The literature provides information regarding the safety of COX-2 inhibitors in asthma patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). The mechanism of AERD involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase, particularly COX-1. Inhibition of COX-1 causes an increased production of certain inflammatory mediators, which results in the reactions seen with AERD. Considering this mechanism, COX-2 inhibitors may be an alternative to aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in a patient with AERD. This article analyzes 4 studies to evaluate the safety of COX-2 inhibitors in this population.

Results

The 4 studies evaluated included a total of 172 patients with AERD. All patients included demonstrated intolerance to aspirin or NSAIDs and tolerated the selective COX-2 inhibitor administered.

Conclusions

COX-2 inhibitors provide a potentially safe alternative for treatment of inflammatory conditions in patients with AERD.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112gXHFq]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Considerations for the GINA recommendation against SABA-only treatment of asthma include that patients with few interval symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, the distinction between 'intermittent' and 'mild persistent' asthma is arbitrary with no evidence of difference in response to ICS, and a large reduction in risk of severe exacerbations with as-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed SABA was seen even in patients with SABA use twice a week or less at baseline. A post hoc analysis found that a single day with increased as-needed budesonide-formoterol reduced the short-term (21-day) risk of severe exacerbations compared to as needed SABA alone, adherence with prescribed daily ICS is very poor in patients with infrequent symptoms, and there is a lack of evidence for the safety or efficacy of SABA-only treatment. Additional risks include that taking SABA regularly for as little as one week significantly increases exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, and decreases bronchodilator response, and that even modest over-use of SABA (indicated by dispensing of 3 or more 200-dose canisters a year) is associated with increased risk of severe exacerbations and, in one study, asthma mortality.

### Typical antipsychotics is associated with increased risk of severe exacerbation in asthma patients: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^115gUz8G]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe asthma exacerbation reduces patients' quality of life, results in visits to the emergency department (ED) and hospitalization, and incurs additional medical costs. Antipsychotics block receptors with bronchodilation function; however, the association between antipsychotic use and severe asthma exacerbation is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of antipsychotics on asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations.

Methods

A case-crossover design was used in this study. Using the 2003–2017 Taiwan National Health Insurance Reimbursement Database, we established a cohort of 18,657 adults with asthma exacerbation leading to ED visits or hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regressions were conducted to explore the association between antipsychotic use and severe asthma exacerbation. Subgroup analyses of different classes, doses, receptor functions of antipsychotics, different psychiatric disease, and sensitivity analyses of excluding patients with schizophrenia were also performed.

Results

Antipsychotic use was associated with a higher risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.54; P = 0.013) compared with no use of antipsychotics. The use of typical antipsychotics increased the risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.10–1.79, P = 0.007), whereas the use of atypical antipsychotics did not. These results did not change after the exclusion of patients with schizophrenia. There was a dose-dependent effect of antipsychotics (trend test, P = 0.025). Antipsychotics that block the M2 muscarinic or D2 dopaminergic receptors were associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR: 1.39, 95% CI 1.10–1.76, P = 0.007 and adjusted OR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.08–1.63, P = 0.008, respectively). However, use of antipsychotics did not increase risk of severe asthma exacerbation in patients with psychiatric disorder.

Conclusions

The use of typical antipsychotics is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation, especially for patients without psychiatric disorders. Further research on the impact of typical antipsychotics on asthma exacerbation is warranted.

Medication Guide for Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

(See the end of this Medication Guide for a list of prescription NSAID medicines.)

What are Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

NSAID medicines are used to treat pain and redness, swelling, and heat (inflammation) from medical conditions such as:

different types of arthritis
menstrual cramps and other types of short-term pain

Who should not take a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)?

Do not take an NSAID medicine:

if you had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reaction with aspirin or any other NSAID medicine
for pain right before or after heart bypass surgery

Tell your healthcare provider:

about all of your medical conditions.
about all of the medicines you take. NSAIDs and some other medicines can interact with each other and cause serious side effects. Keep a list of your medicines to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist.
if you are pregnant. NSAID medicines should not be used by pregnant women late in their pregnancy.
if you are breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor

What are the possible side effects of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)?

Get emergency help right away if you have any of the following symptoms:

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical
trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to
three years' duration have shown an increased risk of serious
cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and
stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and
nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease
or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the
potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an
NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest
duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the
development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV
symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms
of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. Two
large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the
treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery
found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke [see
Contraindications (4.2)]. There is no consistent evidence that
concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV
thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of
aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events [see
Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114cs7sy]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management — minimizing OCS exposure and adverse effects: Optimize asthma treatment to minimize cumulative adverse effects of OCS use because OCS can be life-saving during severe asthma exacerbations but there is increasing awareness of the risks of adverse effects; in adults, short-term adverse effects of OCS include sleep disturbance, increased appetite, reflux, mood changes, sepsis, pneumonia, and thromboembolism, and even 4–5 lifetime courses of OCS are associated with a significantly increased dose-dependent risk of diabetes, cataract, heart failure, osteoporosis and several other conditions; the need for OCS can be reduced by optimizing asthma therapy including ICS-containing medications, treating modifiable risk factors, using relevant non-pharmacological strategies, and providing education and skills training including inhaler technique and adherence, ensuring all patients receive ICS-containing therapy, and for adults and adolescents using GINA Track 1 with ICS-formoterol as anti-inflammatory reliever which reduces the risk of severe exacerbations requiring OCS compared with using a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever; all patients should have a written asthma action plan showing how to increase inhaled medications and when to contact medical care.

### Typical antipsychotics is associated with increased risk of severe exacerbation in asthma patients: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^112TiLtB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this nationwide population-based cohort study, patients with asthma showed a dose-dependent increase in the risk of severe asthma exacerbations when receiving typical antipsychotics. For patients with psychiatric disorders, antipsychotics might not increase the risk of severe asthma exacerbation. Further research for the effect of typical antipsychotics on severe asthma exacerbation is warranted.

Asthma risk — managing other modifiable risk factors — Some patients continue to experience exacerbations even with maximal doses of current treatment, and having even one exacerbation increases the risk that a patient will have another within the next 12 months. In clinical practice, exacerbation risk can be reduced both by optimizing asthma medications, and by identifying and treating modifiable risk factors, and not all risk factors require or respond to a step up in controller treatment.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — clinical features and epidemiology include aspirin- and NSAID-induced respiratory reactions in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma, with upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms frequently sudden and often severe after administration of aspirin or any NSAID that inhibits COX-1. AERD is rare in children with asthma, becomes increasingly more common in adults, and approximately 7% of adults with asthma and one-third of patients with asthma and nasal polyposis have AERD.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^114bMu3g]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — defined as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, and a respiratory reaction to COX-1 inhibitors including aspirin and NSAIDs — has higher incidence in patients with severe asthma. In fact, 30 to 40% of asthma patients with nasal polyps have AERD and 7% of all asthma patients have AERD, and 8% to 26% of patients with CRS and nasal polyps have AERD. Clinical reactions to NSAIDs occur within 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion and include flushing, gastrointestinal issues, rash, and wheezing; this disease may be underdiagnosed and delay in diagnosis often leads to persistent or early recurrent disease after surgery because these patients are often not receiving targeted postoperative therapy.

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 200 mg) [^116BGQue]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.13 Preexisting Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.

5.14 Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen, celecoxib should be discontinued.

In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.

5.15 Inflammation

The pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

5.16 Concomitant NSAID Use

The concomitant use of celecoxib with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.

### Meta-analysis: effect of long-acting β-agonists on severe asthma exacerbations and asthma-related deaths [^113HFx3R]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting beta-agonists may increase the risk for fatal and nonfatal asthma exacerbations.

Purpose

To assess the risk for severe, life-threatening, or fatal asthma exacerbations associated with long-acting beta-agonists.

Data Sources

English- and non-English-language searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Web site; and references of selected reviews through December 2005.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials that lasted at least 3 months and evaluated long-acting beta-agonist use in patients with asthma. All trials allowed the use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists.

Data Extraction

Outcomes measured were Peto odds ratio (OR) and risk difference of severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization, life-threatening exacerbations requiring intubation and ventilation, and asthma-related deaths. The OR for asthma-related deaths was obtained from the Salmeterol Multi-center Asthma Research Trial (SMART).

Data Synthesis

Pooled results from 19 trials with 33 826 participants found that long-acting beta-agonists increased exacerbations requiring hospitalization (OR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.6 to 4.3]) and life-threatening exacerbations (OR, 1.8 [CI, 1.1 to 2.9]) compared with placebo. Hospitalizations were statistically significantly increased with salmeterol (OR, 1.7 [CI, 1.1 to 2.7]) and formoterol (OR, 3.2 [CI, 1.7 to 6.0]) and in children (OR, 3.9 [CI, 1.7 to 8.8]) and adults (OR, 2.0 [CI, 1.1 to 3.9]). The absolute increase in hospitalization was 0.7% (CI, 0.1% to 1.3%) over 6 months. The risk for asthma-related deaths was increased (OR, 3.5 [CI, 1.3 to 9.3]), with a pooled risk difference of 0.07% (CI, 0.01% to 0.1%).

Limitations

The small number of deaths limited the reliability in assessing this risk, and 28 studies did not report information on the outcomes of interest.

Conclusions

Long-acting beta-agonists have been shown to increase severe and life-threatening asthma exacerbations, as well as asthma-related deaths.

### Should biologics Be used before aspirin desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease? [^114e1eJN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

There has been a paradigm shift in the management of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). It started in 2015 when the first biologic was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for severe eosinophilic asthma. Thus, there emerged a new era in the treatment of patients with type 2-mediated airway diseases. This has led to an increasing number of options for patients, undoubtably a great thing, but has left clinicians without a clear answer for how to balance the therapies that exist for AERD, what to recommend for treatment, and how to best assess the benefits and risks of each therapy. This paper aims to explore these benefits and risks, and to provide a roadmap for future studies.

### Efficacy of aspirin therapy after desensitization on chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps patients with asthma and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease – A randomized clinical trial [^116qJVjq]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) exacerbated respiratory disease (N‐ERD) is an inflammatory condition of the respiratory system, typically presented with NSAID intolerance, asthma, and/or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).

N‐ERD represents a severe, difficult‐to‐treat phenotype in both asthma and CRSwNP. Most N‐ERD patients have moderate to severe asthma, and compared to non‐N‐ERD asthma patients, they have an increased risk for a severe asthma disease (RR 1.58), uncontrolled asthma (RR 1.96), as well as asthma exacerbations leading to emergency room visits (RR 1.79) or hospitalizations (RR 1.37). Compared to CRSwNP patients without N‐ERD, patients suffering from CRSwNP with N‐ERD are more prone to have partial or total loss of smell, worse upper airway symptoms, and recurrent nasal polyps. N‐ERD patients may need frequent endoscopic sinus surgeries to control their polyposis, burdening both the patients and the healthcare system.

NSAIDs trigger a reaction in N‐ERD patients within 30–180 min of ingestion, comprising many upper and/or lower symptoms, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, laryngospasm, wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. In addition to the respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) and cutaneous symptoms may be involved in the reaction. The disease is chronic by nature, and sole avoidance of NSAIDs does not fully prevent the symptoms of CRSwNP, asthma, and recurrent nasal polyposis.

The prevalence of N‐ERD among adult asthma patients varies between 5.5% and 12.4% depending on diagnostic methods, and it is higher in patients with severe asthma (14.9%). The prevalence of N‐ERD is 9.7% in patients with nasal polyps and 8.7% in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). In Finland specifically, the prevalence of N‐ERD in the general adult population is approximately 1.4%, and 17% among the adult CRSwNP patients.

### NSAIDs for early management of acute respiratory infections [^1158TWaw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Two meta-analyses of randomized trials reported that both selective and nonselective COX2 inhibitors were associated with an increased risk of serious vascular ischaemic events, predominantly myocardial infarction. Myocardial failure was associated with etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, and rofecoxib as well as diclofenac and ibuprofen but not with naproxen.

These findings suggest that mechanisms other than COX2/COX1 selectivity may be implicated in cardiovascular toxicity. Interestingly, a recent study reports that diclofenac but not ketoprofen appears toxic to cardiac cells, despite the two drugs having comparable COX2/COX1 activity. Despite both drugs inducing an increase in ROS production, only diclofenac exposure shows a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential decreasing in turn the proteasome 26S DC, leading to cell death. Confirming this, a large epidemiological study derived from a database among 8.5 million new NSAID users, 79 553 AMI cases were identified. Among the NSAIDs with the greatest risk, in addition to Coxibs (rofecoxib, etoricoxib), we also find ketorolac and diclofenac, while ketoprofen appears to be the widely used drug with the least cardiovascular risk (Table 3). It could be hypothesized that NSAIDs derived from acetic acid have a greater cardiovascular risk.

Table 3
Specific effects of the most used NSAIDs

Anyway, gastrointestinal and renal side effects of NSAIDs are dose and duration-dependent. The acute administration required to control early inflammation in viral ARTIs is not likely to induce the toxicity of prolonged treatment. However, considering the toxicokinetic mechanism of NSAIDs, it must be admitted that a short treatment, as happens in infections, may not induce serious gastrointestinal problems but may induce serious cardiovascular problems. For this reason, good cardiovascular tolerability is very important for NSAIDs, especially in the elderly. Furthermore, different NSAIDs have different tolerability profiles (Table 3). Regarding specifically NSAIDs safety in respiratory infections, as previously mentioned, the wealth of evidence generated during the COVID-19 pandemics overall supports that NSAIDs do not increase susceptibility to infection, nor worsen disease outcomes.

### Major comorbid conditions in asthma and association with asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency department admissions in adults: results from the German national health telephone interview survey (GEDA) 2010 [^116X7WYt]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common disease among adults. It can have a substantial impact on the health-related quality of life and constitutes a high socioeconomic burden on the health care system. Allergic rhinitis (AR), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) intolerance can be assigned to comorbid conditions that are commonly related to asthma. These comorbidities are considered highly relevant for asthma control and exacerbation outcomes. The consideration and specific management of these comorbid conditions is therefore of high importance in asthma care.

Allergic rhinitis and asthma commonly coexist. Allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for asthma and may even be on the same disease continuum as asthma. The presence of concomitant AR in adult asthma was associated with worse asthma outcomes resulting in a higher risk of asthma-related emergency hospital care in some studies. The evaluation and consequent management of AR may improve asthma outcomes according to national and supranational guidelines.

Although an association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and asthma has also been reported, the extent and underlying mechanism of this relationship remain unclear. There is controversy regarding the effect of GERD on asthma outcomes. For individuals with asthma and concomitant GERD-like symptoms prior studies only inconsistently suggested that treatment of GERD might reduce exacerbations.

Intolerance to ASA or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) marks a distinct clinical entity – ASA exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), or ASA-induced asthma (AIA). On the basis of intractable inflammation of the upper and lower airways, asthma might precede the development of an upper airway disease comprised of chronic hypertrophic eosinophilic sinusitis and nasal polyps or follow it. AERD is characterized by a potentially more severe disease course of asthma with a higher likelihood of an asthma-related emergency department or hospital admission. Its recognition and appropriate management is crucial to effectively reduce morbidity and acute severe outcomes.

AR, GERD and AERD are common conditions among adults with asthma. To date, however, prevalence estimates of these conditions among adults with asthma vary widely. Furthermore, population-based information on the impact of each condition on asthma outcome is scarce, especially with regard to exacerbations that considerably increase morbidity and health care needs. Against this background, we aimed to assess population-based data on the prevalence of AR, GERS and AERD among adults with asthma and examine the association of these comorbidities with asthma exacerbations requiring hospital care in the past 12 months in the framework of a national health interview survey.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111MWiyk]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Optimize asthma treatment to minimize the use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) — OCS can be life-saving during severe asthma exacerbations, but there is increasing awareness of the risks of repeated courses. In adults, short-term adverse effects of OCS include sleep disturbance, increased appetite, reflux, mood changes, sepsis, pneumonia, and thromboembolism. In adults, even 4–5 lifetime courses of OCS are associated with a significantly increased dose-dependent risk of diabetes, cataract, heart failure, osteoporosis and several other conditions. The need for OCS can be reduced by optimizing inhaled therapy, including attention to inhaler technique and adherence. For adults and adolescents, GINA Track 1 with ICS-formoterol as anti-inflammatory reliever reduces the risk of severe exacerbations requiring OCS compared with using a SABA reliever.

### Etodolac [^113siuLW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre-existing Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthmas has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, etodolac should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in all patients with pre-existing asthma.

Information For Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

1.000000000000000e+00 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately (see WARNING S).

2. Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects, Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).

3. **Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS**: Advise patients to stop taking etodolac tablets immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see WARNINGS].

### Typical antipsychotics is associated with increased risk of severe exacerbation in asthma patients: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^114Dr7oY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

b See Additional file 1: Table S1

The risk of severe asthma exacerbation by different classes of antipsychotics and doses is shown in the lower part of Table 2. The use of typical antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation (adjusted OR, 1.40; 95% CI 1.10–1.79, P = 0.007). In contrast, the use of atypical antipsychotics did not increase the risk (adjusted OR: 1.10, 95% CI 0.84–1.44, P = 0.481). Use of both typical and atypical antipsychotics had a higher risk of asthma exacerbation than the use of one of them (adjusted OR: 2.47, 95% CI 1.09–5.62, P = 0.031). A dose-dependent effect was also observed with the use of any class of antipsychotics. The effect was obvious for the use of typical antipsychotics; however, not statistically significant for atypical antipsychotics (in the test for trend, any class of antipsychotics: P = 0.025, typical antipsychotics: P = 0.006; atypical antipsychotics: P = 0.652). After excluding patients with schizophrenia, the results of the analysis were similar to the results of the analysis for all enrolled patients. The use of typical antipsychotics was still associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbation with a dose-dependent effect; however, the use of atypical antipsychotics was not (for typical antipsychotics: adjusted OR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.07–1.76, P = 0.012; for atypical antipsychotics: adjusted OR: 1.17, 95% CI 0.88–1.56, P = 0.293) (Table 3). Additionally, after excluding patients with psychiatric disorders related to ER visits or hospitalizations, the use of typical antipsychotics increased the risk of severe asthma exacerbation in a dose-dependent manner (adjusted OR: 1.39, 95% CI 1.08–1.78, P = 0.010) (Additional file 1: Table S7). For different classes of antidepressants, use of SSRI/SNRI or TCA did not increase the risk of severe asthma exacerbation (Additional file 1: Table S10).

### Population-based analysis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use among children in four European countries in the SOS project: what size of data platforms and which study designs do we need to assess safety issues? [^113oz9No]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Required exposure time for NSAID safety assessment in children

Table 2 shows the number of NSAIDs that have enough exposure to detect weak (RR = 2), moderate (RR = 4) or strong (RR = 6) associations for the ten adverse events of interest. The stronger the association and the more common the event to be studied, the lower is the required exposure time for a specific NSAID substance. Thus, the lower the required exposure time for a specific NSAID substance the higher is the number of drugs that can be studied, which is expected from the power calculations. Taking asthma exacerbation as example with the highest incidence rate (IR) of 82/100 000 PYs, only one NSAID (ibuprofen) had enough person time exposure (9,788 person-years or more) to detect a weak association (RR = 2). To assess a moderate (RR = 4) or a strong (RR = 6) association with asthma exacerbation, four and six NSAID substances had adequate person time of exposure, respectively. None of the drugs accounted for adequate exposure time to detect a strong association for the following rare events: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute liver failure, acute myocardial infarction, and Reye's syndrome. For a very rare outcome such as Reye's Syndrome, the SOS platform would require 998 times as much exposed person time in order to study a weak association for ibuprofen (the most commonly used NSAID) (Table 2). Table 3 shows for which events of interest sufficient person time was available to study a strong association (RR = 6) for the most frequently used NSAIDs.

### Subphenotypes of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory disease-exacerbated respiratory disease identified by latent class analysis [^116dpq1T]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

According to the current recommendations nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)‐exacerbated respiratory disease (abbreviated as NERD) is a proper term to describe the distinct phenotype of aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid; ASA) and other NSAIDs hypersensitivity, which involves upper and lower airway mucosa. 1

It is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of upper and lower airways, an onset in early adulthood and a predilection for females. Respiratory symptoms are exacerbated by intake of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAID's). 2 Diagnosis is confirmed by aspirin challenge tests. 3 NERD usually has a severe course accompanied by chronic rhinosinusitis with recurrent nasal polyps, often requiring multiple sinus surgeries. 2, 4 Atopy is rather frequent in this population.

A recent meta‐analysis has indicated that 7% of asthmatics are aspirin‐sensitive but that the prevalence doubles in severe asthmatics. 5 A more insightful analysis of individual patients has shown this group to be nonhomogeneous. 6, 7

There is a consensus on the nonallergic mechanism responsible for asthmatic attacks in NERD, involving abnormal metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA) by cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LO) pathways. 2 Following ingestion of NSAIDs, COX‐1 inhibition decreases biosynthesis of PGE₂ leading to enhanced or disinhibited synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). CysLTs released from eosinophils and mast cells cause abrupt onset moderate‐to‐severe bronchoconstriction and sometimes extrapulmonary signs of facial edema and skin erythema. 2 Transcellular metabolism of AA derivatives in the airway during multi‐cellular interaction generates various eicosanoids able to regulate inflammation and functional responses. The broken balance between anti‐inflammatory mediators known as lipoxins, 8, 9 PGE 2, 10, 11 and potentially pro‐inflammatory mediators such as cysLTs and PGD₂ 12 has been linked to both severe asthma and NERD. 13

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159AEV5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We conducted a systematic review to assess the association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma. The aim was to expand on previous reviews by looking across the entire age range of childhood from 0 to 18 years, including both interventional and observational studies, and assessing the association separately for clinically distinct paediatric subpopulations: general, asthmatic, and ibuprofen-hypersensitive.

### Safety of etoricoxib, a new cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, in patients with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced urticaria and angioedema [^116ks15G]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The use of selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) has been shown to be safe in patients with aspirin-induced asthma. However, a few individuals with cutaneous reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) experience urticaria or angioedema when challenged with various coxibs.

Objective

To investigate the clinical tolerance of NSAID-sensitive individuals to the selective COX-2 inhibitors etoricoxib and celecoxib.

Methods

Patients with NSAID-induced urticaria or angioedema were challenged in a double-masked, placebo-controlled design protocol with etoricoxib (120 mg) and celecoxib (200 mg). Cutaneous, respiratory, and general symptoms; vital signs; and pulmonary function were monitored hourly for 3 hours.

Results

Fifty-eight patients (46 females and 12 males) with a mean ± SD age of 31.7 ± 14.1 years (range, 13–66 years) who showed urticaria or angioedema when challenged with NSAIDs were included in this study. A cutaneous clinical pattern was observed in 34 patients (59%), and a mixed pattern (cutaneous and respiratory) was seen in 24 (41%). Celecoxib provocation of 54 patients induced urticaria in 3, urticaria and angioedema in 2, and urticaria, rhinorrhea, and conjunctival erythema in 1 (reaction rate, 11.1%). Etoricoxib challenges performed in 56 patients induced urticaria in 3 and angioedema in 1 (reaction rate, 7.1%).

Conclusions

These results confirm that most NSAID-sensitive individuals with cutaneous reactions to classic NSAIDs will tolerate specific COX-2 inhibitors, supporting the use of thesedrugs after careful oral provocation in such patients.

### Diclofenac sodium delayed release tablets, ranitidine tablets, capsaicin cream (deramsilkRx anodynexa pak) [^111bkP8q]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Carefully consider the potential bene ts and risks of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

Diclofenac is indicated:

For relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis
For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis
For acute or long-term use in the relief of signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to diclofenac.

Diclofenac should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see WARNINGS, ANAPHYLACTOID REACTIONS, and PRECAUTIONS, PREEXISTING ASTHMA).

Diclofenac is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see WARNINGS).

WARNINGS

Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocar-dial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see GI WARNINGS, GI EFFECTS).

Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Celecoxib (celecoxib 100 mg) [^114mZqQW]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

5.13 Preexisting Asthma

Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients withaspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal.

Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, celecoxib should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution

in patients with preexisting asthma.

5.14 Laboratory Tests

Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have a CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen, celecoxib should be discontinued. In controlled clinical trials, elevated BUN occurred more frequently in patients receiving celecoxib compared with patients on placebo. This laboratory abnormality was also seen in patients who received comparator NSAIDs in these studies. The clinical significance of this abnormality has not been established.

5.15 Inflammation

The pharmacological activity of celecoxib in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

5.16 Concomitant NSAID Use

The concomitant use of celecoxib with any dose of a non-aspirin NSAID should be avoided due to the potential for increased risk of adverse reactions.

### Effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other eicosanoid pathway modifiers on antiviral and allergic responses: EAACI task force on eicosanoids consensus report in times of COVID-19 [^114mrKJr]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other eicosanoid pathway modifiers are among the most ubiquitously used medications in the general population. Their broad anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects are applied against symptoms of respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, as well as in other acute and chronic inflammatory diseases that often coexist with allergy and asthma. However, the current pandemic of COVID-19 also revealed the gaps in our understanding of their mechanism of action, selectivity, and interactions not only during viral infections and inflammation, but also in asthma exacerbations, uncontrolled allergic inflammation, and NSAIDs-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD). In this context, the consensus report summarizes currently available knowledge, novel discoveries, and controversies regarding the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19, and the role of NSAIDs in asthma and viral asthma exacerbations. We also describe here novel mechanisms of action of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), outline how to predict responses to LTRA therapy and discuss a potential role of LTRA therapy in COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, we discuss interactions of novel T2 biologicals and other eicosanoid pathway modifiers on the horizon, such as prostaglandin D2 antagonists and cannabinoids, with eicosanoid pathways, in context of viral infections and exacerbations of asthma and allergic diseases. Finally, we identify and summarize the major knowledge gaps and unmet needs in current eicosanoid research.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and the unified airway: a contemporary review [^111PDHDG]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by abnormal arachidonic acid metabolism leading to chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), asthma, and upper and/or lower respiratory symptoms after ingestion of cyclooxygenase-1 inhibiting nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Diagnosis is clinical and may involve an aspirin challenge. Inflammatory biomarkers may be useful for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Conventional medical management for asthma and CRSwNP is often inadequate. Endoscopic sinus surgery followed by continued medical management with or without aspirin desensitization frequently improves symptoms and objective disease measures. Biological agents targeting eosinophilic inflammation are promising alternatives to conventional management.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112MZbPx]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to advise avoiding aspirin or NSAID-containing products and other medications inhibiting COX-1 in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Consider preferring a COX-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib) or acetaminophen, with appropriate healthcare provider supervision and observation for at least 2 hours after administration, when an NSAID is indicated for other medical conditions.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Celecoxib (ELYXYB-celecoxib) [^113ExUbF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, ELYXYB is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When ELYXYB is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9 Serious Skin Reactions

Serious skin reactions have occurred following treatment with celecoxib, including erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)], acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and fixed drug eruption (FDE), which may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE). These serious events may occur without warning and can be fatal.

Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of ELYXYB at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

ELYXYB is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as ELYXYB. Some of these events have been fatal or life- threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue ELYXYB and evaluate the patient immediately.

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113TymgW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Here, we found that research is most lacking for populations of children with pre-existing asthma, who are the population at most risk for potential respiratory adverse events following ibuprofen use. Our review highlights the importance of assessing both interventional and observational studies and analysing the general population and asthmatic population separately. Continued investigation into the role of early-life ibuprofen use and its short-term and long-term impact on childhood asthma is needed.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^113xrZCk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease — cross-reactivity and medication choices indicate that aspirin and NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 can all cause reactions and are considered cross-reactive. Weak COX-1 inhibitors such as nonacetylated salicylates and acetaminophen may cause reactions in highly sensitive individuals if administered at higher doses (650–1000 mg) but are typically mild. NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 but also inhibit COX-1 at higher doses may result in reactions depending on dose, whereas reactions to selective COX-2 inhibitors are extremely rare in patients with AERD and they can typically be taken safely.

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Ym727]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we assessed the association between ibuprofen use and asthma in children aged 0–18 years. Both observational and interventional studies were reviewed in the general population as well as the asthmatic population. Studies that benchmarked ibuprofen against an active comparator almost exclusively used paracetamol, and in both populations of children, the combined evidence suggested no difference in asthma-related adverse events between ibuprofen and paracetamol (or ketoprofen) use. A single observational study suggested a potential benefit of ibuprofen over paracetamol prescription in response to bronchiolitis in the general paediatric population after a one-year follow-up. When ibuprofen use was assessed relative to no alternative drug administration, differences emerged between the general and asthmatic populations. In the short-term follow-up (1–14 days) to ibuprofen use, two observational studies reported favourable effects in the general population, while one observational and one interventional study observed unfavourable effects in the asthmatic population. Over a longer follow-up period (12 weeks to 10 years), no clear effect emerged for either population.

The majority of research on the association between ibuprofen use and asthma-related adverse events in children has been conducted in the general population, benchmarked relative to paracetamol, and participants followed-up over a short duration. The aggregate result from five RCTs conducted in this context is driven primarily by the Boston University Fever Study, conducted almost 30 years ago on children aged 6 months to 12 years. While a single observational study conducted five years ago corroborates this finding, research is sparse. Furthermore, only a single study comparing ibuprofen with paracetamol use with a short-term follow-up was conducted in children with asthma, and this study was a second post-hoc analysis publication of the same Boston University Fever Study dataset. Given the increased vulnerability of the asthmatic population to respiratory adverse events from ibuprofen use that was observed in our review, there is a clear lack of research comparing the short-term effects of ibuprofen relative to alternative analgesics and antipyretics such as paracetamol in children with asthma.

NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS

After antibiotics, NSAIDs are the second most common drug class causing hypersensitivity reactions, described in up to 3.5% of the population.NSAIDs may induce a variety of reactions, although most reactions occur within 6 hours and are cutaneous (eg, urticaria and angioedema). However, systemic reactions such as severe anaphylaxisand delayed skin reactions (eg, fixed drug eruptions or Stevens-Johnsons syndrome,) have also been reported from NSAIDs.

Classification of NSAID-induced reactions is based on clinical history (eg, reaction timing and characteristics), presence of comorbid conditions, and drug challenges. NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis (NIUAA) is the most common phenotype, representing > 40% of reported reactions in adults. Symptoms are typically elicited by potent cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitors, with isolated cutaneous symptoms reported most commonly; however, 9% to 28% of adults may report reactions consisting of blended features with symptoms or signs extending outside of the skin or anaphylaxis. Up to 30% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) experience an acute exacerbation of their disease after NSAID exposure, (NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease [NECD]). Notably, patients with NECD may tolerate NSAIDs during CSU remission or clinical control. Patients with underlying asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis may react with acute respiratory reactions to COX-1 inhibitors in the context of aspirin- or NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD). As with the other cross-reactive phenotypes, including NIUAA and NECD, patients with N-ERD can report reactions to chemically nonrelated NSAIDs.

Less commonly, some patients may develop immediate reactions (often within an hour) to a single NSAID, or structurally related NSAIDs (single NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis [SNIUAA]). These reactions are thought to be IgE-mediated, and no cross-reactivity with other NSAIDs is expected. Although 1 study did observe cross-reactivity in some patients with reactions induced by more than 1 drug within the class of propionic acid derivatives, it is also important to note that most patients with SNIUAA in this same study demonstrated tolerance of structurally related NSAIDs.

Separately, NSAIDs can act as cofactors to aggravate hypersensitivity reactions to foods (NSAID-exacerbated or -induced food allergy), and patients may be misdiagnosed with NSAID hypersensitivity; for these patients, a food rather than drug allergy workup should take precedence.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity — COX-2 inhibitor tolerance and adjunctive strategies are outlined, noting that specific COX-2 inhibitors will generally be tolerated and that, given the low rate of reactions (8%-11%) that also occur to COX-2 inhibitors, the first dose could be given under observation; compared with 1- to 3-day aspirin desensitization protocols in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, there are limited data on more rapid (> 5 hours) protocols, and concomitant high dose (2–4 times the standard daily dose of a nonsedating antihistamine) H1-antihistamines might also be another avenue to allow occasional safe use of NSAIDS.

### Diagnosis and management of NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD)-a EAACI position paper [^1179C3hb]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD) is a chronic eosinophilic, inflammatory disorder of the respiratory tract occurring in patients with asthma and/or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), symptoms of which are exacerbated by NSAIDs, including aspirin. Despite some progress in understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome, which affects 1/10 of patients with asthma and rhinosinusitis, it remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. In order to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of N-ERD, a panel of international experts was called by the EAACI Asthma Section. The document summarizes current knowledge on the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of N-ERD pointing at significant heterogeneity of this syndrome. Critically evaluating the usefulness of diagnostic tools available, the paper offers practical algorithm for the diagnosis of N-ERD. Recommendations for the most effective management of a patient with N-ERD stressing the potential high morbidity and severity of the underlying asthma and rhinosinusitis are discussed and proposed. Newly described sub-phenotypes and emerging sub-endotypes of N-ERD are potentially relevant for new and more specific (eg, biological) treatment modalities. Finally, the document defines major gaps in our knowledge on N-ERD and unmet needs, which should be addressed in the future.

### The association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wpQPk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We identified four drug provocation trials in which ibuprofen hypersensitivity was confirmed in children by controlled administration of ibuprofen and respiratory adverse events were recorded. The average percentage of children with confirmed ibuprofen hypersensitivity who displayed respiratory adverse events was 12.5%. Relative to other adverse events, such as angio-oedema and urticaria (which were by far the most common adverse events), asthma and asthma-like respiratory events were less commonly reported. While adverse respiratory reactions to ibuprofen ingestion in those with ibuprofen hypersensitivity can be quite severe, as reported in a handful of case reports, fatalities appear to be very rare. In this review, only a single case of ibuprofen-induced asthma fatality was identified.

The number of studies in this review that were relevant to important clinical populations and contexts was unfortunately sparse. Only a single publication was identified for each of the following three contexts: the general population where ibuprofen is compared with an active comparator with a follow-up duration longer than 1 month; the asthmatic population where ibuprofen is compared with an active comparator with a short-term follow-up; and the asthmatic population where ibuprofen is compared with a baseline of no active comparator with a follow-up duration longer than 1 month. These limitations hinder the generalisability of findings to several important clinical contexts and are an ongoing issue to be addressed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115jiFgY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma non-pharmacological interventions — avoidance of medications that may make asthma worse: Always ask about asthma before prescribing NSAIDs, and advise patients to stop using them if asthma worsens. Always ask people with asthma about concomitant medications. Aspirin and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are not generally contraindicated unless there is a history of previous reactions to these agents. Decide about prescription of oral or ophthalmic beta-blockers on a case-by-case basis. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision by a specialist. If cardioselective beta-blockers are indicated for acute coronary events, asthma is not an absolute contra-indication, but the relative risks/benefits should be considered.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116TpvVW]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Risk factors for exacerbations — poor asthma symptom control itself substantially increases the risk of exacerbations, and additional independent risk factors include a history of ≥ 1 exacerbation in the previous year, poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, chronic sinusitis and smoking; the risk of severe exacerbations and mortality increases incrementally with higher SABA use, independent of treatment step, and prescribing of three or more 200-dose SABA inhalers in a year, corresponding to more than daily use, is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and, in one study, increased mortality; risk factors and comorbidities that are modifiable are sometimes called 'treatable traits'.

### Celecoxib (Elyxyb) [^116Aaspe]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, ELYXYB is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When ELYXYB is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

5.9	Serious Skin Reactions

Serious skin reactions have occurred following treatment with celecoxib, including erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). These serious events may occur without warning and can be fatal.

Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of ELYXYB at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. ELYXYB is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4)].

5.10 Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month), including ELYXYB, may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

5.11 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus

ELYXYB may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including ELYXYB, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Sumatriptan and naproxen sodium [^115yaC69]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma

Advise patients with preexisting asthma to seek immediate medical attention if their asthma worsens after taking sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets. Patients with a history of aspirin-sensitive asthma should not take sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.18)].

Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs

Inform patients that the concomitant use of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in "over the counter" medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.

Use of NSAIDS and Low-Dose Aspirin

Inform patients not to use low-dose aspirin concomitantly with sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tablets until they talk to their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Safety of etoricoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in asthmatic patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^116r3Vsn]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of rheumatic conditions is limited in patients with asthma owing to concerns of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs potentially provoking asthma. Cross-sensitivity to all anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes occurs in these individuals.

Objectives

To study the safety of etoricoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, and to determine whether it cross-reacts with asthma in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).

Methods

This study included 77 patients who had experienced asthma induced by aspirin and at least 1 other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Baseline evaluation included blood pressure measurement, nasal examination, spirometry, and peak expiratory flow rate measurement. Patients were given placebo the first day and then were challenged with once-daily etoricoxib in 3 different doses: 60 mg on day 2, 90 mg on day 3, and 120 mg on day 4. If no evidence of intolerance was seen, each patient was rechallenged with 60 or 90 mg of etoricoxib once daily (according to the rheumatic condition) 7 days later. Reassessment of the baseline measurements was performed daily from day 1 to day 4 after the initial challenge, on day 7 after rechallenge, and after 1 month of drug intake. If the patient developed any mucosal or skin reaction, hypotension, upper or lower airway obstruction, conjunctival reaction, or laryngeal edema during the challenge test, it was considered a positive response.

Results

Etoricoxib was well tolerated, without any signs of immediate or delayed hypersensitivity in aspirin- and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthmatic patients. None of 77 study patients experienced any symptoms or developed dyspnea, change in nasal examination, significant variation in peak expiratory flow rate greater than 20%, or decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second greater than 15% during etoricoxib challenge. The exact 1-sided confidence interval for the probability of etoricoxib inducing cross-reactions in patients with AERD was 0% to 2%.

Conclusions

These results confirm the lack of cross-reactivity between specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and aspirin in AERD. Etoricoxib was safe for treating inflammation in patients with AERD.

### Cardiovascular safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: network meta-analysis [^114tjZrc]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this network meta-analysis of cardiovascular safety data of seven non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and placebo, naproxen seemed least harmful (fig 3). Safety profiles of individual drugs varied considerably depending on the outcome, and estimated rate ratios for comparisons with placebo were generally imprecise. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are mainly used for symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. Clearly, as for any symptomatic treatment, doing more harm than good with this class of drugs should be avoided (primum non nocere). Taking this into account, we presented confidence levels (fig 4), which can be interpreted as confidence that a drug is associated with an increase in risk that is smaller than a specified threshold. For the primary outcome of myocardial infarction, the confidence that the increase in risk associated with the evaluated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs does not exceed 30% (the risk increase used as non-inferiority margin in the Multinational Etoricoxib and Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term programme) is sufficiently high only for naproxen. Conversely, we are confident that several other drugs — ibuprofen, diclofenac, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib — are associated with a risk increase of more than 30% on several cardiovascular outcomes.

### Diclofenac sodium [^112LEt8y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity

A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). When diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.

Serious Skin Reactions

NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin reaction or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Aspirin or other nonsteroidal inflammatory agent exacerbated asthma [^115wSYjw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is an asthma phenotype with a prevalence that ranges from 2% to 25% of the asthma population. The 2% prevalence applies to patients with mild and 25% to severe, persistent asthma. COX-1-inhibiting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, aggravate the preexisting upper and lower respiratory disease, sometimes in a life-threatening manner. The upper airway disease is characterized by an eosinophilic, hyperplastic rhinosinusitis with polyps. Eosinophilia, both peripheral and in the airways with Th2 inflammation, characterizes this disease. The role of allergic sensitivity in AERD is unclear, even though more than 30% of affected patients produce specific IgE to environmental allergens. Clinically, the respiratory symptoms are not usually associated with allergen exposure. The mechanism responsible for this phenotype is likely related to leukotriene (LT) metabolism because patients who are affected compared with patients who were aspirin tolerant, produce greater amounts of cysteinyl LTs. The synthesis of cysteinyl LTs is further increased after aspirin challenge and symptom exacerbation. Eosinophilia as well as a variety of other biologic markers, for example, Th2 cytokines, peripheral blood periostin, and LT enzymes and receptors, are associated with AERD both in the blood and in respiratory mucosa. These markers may help identify patients with AERD, but aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs challenge is the primary means to confirm the diagnosis. A variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms and genes are associated with AERD, but the studies to date are limited to select populations and have not conclusively demonstrated a uniform genetic pattern in subjects with this disease. Treatment of AERD can be challenging because the nasal symptoms, including polyposis, are often refractory to both surgery and medical treatment, and the asthma can be difficult to control. Aspirin desensitization, followed by daily aspirin administration, can improve both upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms in up to 60% of individuals.

### Clinical and mechanistic advancements in aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease [^113pW54i]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by the clinical triad of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and a hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). AERD is estimated to occur in as many as 15% of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and/or asthma. Uniquely, patients with AERD develop respiratory symptoms within 30 to 180 minutes after ingesting NSAIDs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. However, even in the absence of NSAIDs, patients tend to have more severe upper and lower respiratory disease. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms contributing to AERD are complex and intertwined; they include a systemic dysregulation in arachidonic acid metabolism, an aberrant inflammatory response, a disruption in the respiratory epithelial barrier, and an imbalance between the formation and degradation of fibrin locally in nasal polyps. This review will highlight novel mechanistic findings contributing to the pathogenesis of AERD. In addition, recent advancements in the clinical understanding and management of patients with AERD will be discussed.

### Clinical and pathologic perspectives on aspirin sensitivity and asthma [^1176xic2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit COX-1 induce unique nonallergic reactions, consisting of attacks of rhinitis and asthma. These hypersensitivity reactions occur in a subset of asthmatic subjects, thus identifying them as having this exclusive clinical presentation. We refer to these patients as having aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, a disease process that produces devastating eosinophilic inflammation of both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. This review focuses on a description of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, methods available to diagnose their condition, the unique ability of all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit COX-1 to cross-react with aspirin, an update on pathogenesis, and current thoughts about treatment.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) — ATAD vs no ATAD: In people with AERD, the guideline panel suggests ATAD rather than no ATAD (conditional recommendation based on moderate certainty of evidence). The benefit of ATAD is moderate and is balanced by the risk of adverse effects that can lead to discontinuation. Decision factors include risks that impact the safety of performing an aspirin desensitization such as severe poorly controlled asthma; risks that impact safety of long-term aspirin use such as conditions or treatments that increase bleeding risk, such as age, male, low weight or BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, prednisone use, or previous GI or intracranial bleed; that biologics may be preferred over ATAD in AERD for patients who have increased risk of harms with ATAD or who are avoiding a strict daily oral medication regimen and its associated desensitization procedure; and that patients intolerant to NSAIDs who require an NSAID for alternative indications (eg, cardiovascular disease) may prefer ATAD over other options.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114QTrxX]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbation — oral corticosteroids (OCS) course and risks: OCS should usually be continued for 5–7 days in adults and 3–5 days in children, and patients should be advised about common short‑term side-effects including sleep disturbance, increased appetite, reflux and mood changes. In adults, the risk of sepsis and thromboembolism is also increased after a short course of OCS, and use of 4–5 lifetime courses in adults is associated with a dose‑dependent increased risk of long‑term adverse effects such as osteoporosis, fractures, diabetes, heart failure and cataract. This emphasizes the importance of optimizing asthma management after any severe exacerbation to reduce the risk of further exacerbations.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114t8MyU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and three important outcomes (quick-relief medication, adverse events [harms], and long-term medication use). The summary of evidence for Recommendation 18 can be found in EtD Table XXVII in Appendix B.

The evidence shows that SLIT provides a trivial benefit for the critical outcomes of exacerbations, asthma control, – and quality of life –, (moderate certainty of evidence). No studies assessed the impact of SLIT on emergency department visits, clinic visits, or hospitalizations. Three studies evaluated exacerbations using different end points. One study did not report the number of exacerbations, but it did report on the time to first exacerbation.SLIT decreased the severity of the first moderate exacerbation, but it did not increase the time to first severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Another study did not provide any raw data or rates of the critical outcomes, and the authors only noted that the results showed no statistically significant improvement in asthma exacerbations. The third study, which enrolled only 60 participants, found a significantly lower number of exacerbations in the treatment group. Four studies (N = 1193) that evaluated asthma control using validated outcome tools (three used the ACQ, and one used the ACT) found no consistent improvement after treatment. – Finally, multiple studies showed no difference in quality of life in those treated with SLIT or placebo. (high certainty of evidence).

For important outcomes, SLIT reduced the use of quick-relief medications,– and doses of ICSs, with moderate certainty of evidence.

The harms were difficult for the Expert Panel to evaluate. Local reactions were frequent and occurred in up to 80% of individuals treated with SLIT, but adverse local reactions were also common in those receiving placebo. The rate of side effects did not differ by the setting of administration (home, clinic, or other), and the relationship between the risk of side effects and the strength of the dose administered was not consistent across studies. None of the RCTs (N = 1772),– reported episodes of anaphylaxis. The Expert Panel found no reports of death that was secondary to SLIT.

### Do etoricoxib and indometacin have similar effects and safety for gouty arthritis? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1173n6we]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a common medical problem that mainly affects middle-aged men, with a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life. The prevalence of gout increases among postmenopausal women with diuretic-treated hypertension and renal insufficiency. Risk factors for gout include obesity, alcohol intake, diuretic use, a diet rich in meat, seafood, or high-fructose food or drink intake, and poor kidney function.–Furthermore, an increased risk of cardiac disease in patients with gout was observed and this risk is above and beyond that contributed by the traditional risk factors for heart disease. Gouty arthritis not only contributes to heart disease but also directly influences the quality of life. Acute gouty arthritis often peaks within 24 hours of onset with a very painful, warm, tender, and swollen joint, and it commonly affects the joints of the lower extremity, particularly the metatarsophalangeal joint. According to the 2012 American College of Rheumatology Guidelines for Management of Gout, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or oral colchicine are appropriate first-line options for the treatment of acute gout and certain combinations can be used for severe or refractory attacks. They suggest the use of the NSAIDs, such as naproxen, indometacin, and sulindac, for the treatment of acute gout. However, nonselective NSAIDs, which inhibit both cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, are associated with dyspepsia and potential gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, ulcers, and bleeding. Etoricoxib, a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, has demonstrated anti-inflammation, analgesic, and antipyretic properties and reduces the incidence of GI-related adverse events, compared with nonselective NSAIDs.–Besides, the cardiovascular safety of COX-2 inhibitor has been revealed. Indometacin is the most potent inhibitor of nonselective NSAIDs, although a more potent inhibitor of COX-1 than that of COX-2. We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of etoricoxib and indometacin in the treatment of acute gout.

### Major comorbid conditions in asthma and association with asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency department admissions in adults: results from the German national health telephone interview survey (GEDA) 2010 [^111Kqx6w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Our results regarding the impact of AERD on asthma-specific hospitalizations and/or ED admission are in line with the concept of a specific asthma phenotype. This phenotype has been characterized by frequent exacerbation of symptoms and an increased risk of progressive airflow obstruction compared to ASA-tolerant persons with asthma in a selected patient study. In this study, significant differences between the two cohorts were also found with respect to emergency department admissions among individuals with AERD (18%; n = 81) compared to those without (13%; n = 372, p = 0.017). Individuals with AERD also showed a higher proportion of hospitalizations: 6% (n = 29) vs. 5% (n = 131), p = 0.068. Likewise in a case comparison with community control, the odds ratio of an hospitalization for acute asthma was more than three times increased for ASA/NSAID-intolerant asthma patients compared to ASA/NSAID-tolerant asthma patients (OR = 3.63; 95%-CI = 1.70–7.74). Additionally in a population-based study, significant differences were found with respect to the prevalence of an asthma-specific emergency department admission: 28.8% (n = 52) among individuals with AIA vs. 12.2% (n = 135) among subjects with ASA-tolerant asthma and with respect to an asthma-specific hospitalization: 15.0% (n = 27) vs. 6.2% (n = 69).
