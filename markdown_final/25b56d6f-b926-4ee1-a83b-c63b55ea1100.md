## Question

Complicated breast cyst management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of complicated breast cysts, specifically when to use BI-RADS 3 versus BI-RADS 4, when to aspirate, and when to biopsy, with explicit reasoning and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and sonographically characterize a complicated cyst. Then, I should verify how BI-RADS 3 and BI-RADS 4 categories are applied and why. Next, I will review evidence on malignancy risk to anchor decision-making. After that, I will map management pathways for asymptomatic versus symptomatic complicated cysts, including special populations like postmenopausal women and those on hormone therapy. Finally, I should consider technical details for aspiration versus biopsy, concordance principles, and follow-up, making sure to double-check where I might be conflating "complicated" and "complex" cysts so I can correct myself explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: a complicated cyst meets most sonographic criteria for a simple cyst but contains internal debris, is not purely anechoic, and lacks any solid mural nodule, thick irregular wall, or thick septation. Mobility of debris or a fluid–debris level supports a benign process and helps distinguish it from a complex cyst, which contains both cystic and solid components and is managed differently [^116SYYuA] [^111efgS8].

> Wait, let me verify the categorization logic before assigning risk: when a lesion has only internal debris without suspicious solid features, BI-RADS 3 (probably benign) is appropriate. When there is a solid component, thickened or irregular wall, thick septations, or intracystic mass, BI-RADS 4 (suspicious) is indicated and biopsy is generally recommended due to malignancy risk [^116SYYuA] [^113gqAFD] [^117A51VW].

> I should confirm the malignancy risk data that justify BI-RADS 3 for complicated cysts: contemporary series show a very low cancer rate in isolated complicated cysts, around 0–0.4%, which supports probably benign assessment and short-interval follow-up rather than immediate biopsy. In contrast, complex cystic and solid masses carry substantially higher risk, approximately 8–41% depending on features, justifying biopsy [^116ny1st] [^114ULLCk] [^117A51VW] [^114NoXvs].

> Hold on, let's not conflate terms. I initially almost equated "complicated" with "complex", but I need to ensure I correct that: complicated cysts are fluid-filled lesions with internal debris and no solid component, whereas complex cystic masses have a solid component or concerning wall/septations. That distinction drives BI-RADS 3 for the former and BI-RADS 4 for the latter, and I should double-check each case for debris mobility or a fluid–debris level to avoid overcalling a complicated cyst as complex [^116SYYuA] [^111efgS8] [^113gqAFD].

> Next, I should review the management of asymptomatic complicated cysts: assign BI-RADS 3 and offer short-interval ultrasound follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months to document stability. If stable, return to routine screening. If new suspicious features develop, escalate to biopsy. This approach reduces unnecessary procedures while maintaining sensitivity for early change [^113gqAFD] [^1134rGji] [^116SYYuA].

> For symptomatic complicated cysts, let me think about immediate steps: ultrasound-guided aspiration is reasonable for symptom relief. If the fluid is clear and the mass resolves completely, malignancy is unlikely and routine follow-up suffices. If the fluid is bloody or tenacious, if no fluid is obtained, or if a residual mass persists, I should confirm that core needle biopsy is indicated to exclude occult solid components or malignancy [^113ZtFQT] [^1163z7vS] [^114GicdH].

> I need to ensure I address special populations: in postmenopausal women, even though baseline risk is higher, isolated asymptomatic complicated cysts still carry extremely low malignancy risk and can be managed as BI-RADS 3 with short-interval follow-up. In women on hormone therapy, the same sonographic criteria apply, and management should not be altered solely based on hormone use in the absence of suspicious features [^116ny1st] [^116SYYuA].

> Let me reconsider the role of aspiration in asymptomatic cases: I initially thought aspiration might be necessary to exclude malignancy, but wait, I should verify the evidence. Large series show cancer presenting as a pure complicated cyst is exceedingly rare, so routine aspiration of asymptomatic complicated cysts is not required and may lead to unnecessary procedures. Aspiration is reserved for symptomatic relief or when diagnostic uncertainty remains after careful sonographic assessment [^114ULLCk] [^116ny1st] [^116SYYuA].

> For complex cystic and solid masses, I should confirm that biopsy is the standard: ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is preferred. If the solid component is very small, vacuum-assisted biopsy improves sampling adequacy. I should place a marker after sampling if the lesion collapses to preserve localization for potential surgery. Given malignancy risks of roughly 8–41%, tissue diagnosis is warranted rather than observation [^115BXjx3] [^111mk4uy] [^117A51VW] [^114NoXvs].

> I will now examine technical execution and concordance principles: use ultrasound guidance for all interventions, document needle position, and correlate pathology with imaging. If pathology is discordant or the lesion shows interval suspicious evolution, I should double-check the sampling and consider repeat biopsy or excision. For complicated cysts, typical cyst fluid can be discarded, but bloody fluid warrants cytology and further work-up [^115BXjx3] [^117Tc7AY] [^113ZtFQT].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and triggers to escalate: for BI-RADS 3 complicated cysts, obtain ultrasound at 6, 12, and 24 months. If stable, return to routine screening. If there is growth, new solid components, or other suspicious changes, reclassify to BI-RADS 4 and proceed to biopsy. This schedule is consistent with BI-RADS validation for probably benign lesions across modalities [^113gqAFD] [^1134rGji].

> But wait, what if the lesion is actually a clustered microcyst rather than a complicated cyst? I should double-check the morphology: clustered microcysts without a solid component are generally categorized as BI-RADS 2 and do not require intervention or short-interval follow-up, which avoids unnecessary anxiety and procedures when correctly identified [^116SYYuA].

> In summary, I need to ensure my algorithm is explicit and internally consistent: define the lesion carefully as complicated versus complex. Assign BI-RADS 3 to isolated, asymptomatic complicated cysts with short-interval ultrasound surveillance. Reserve aspiration for symptomatic relief or diagnostic uncertainty. Assign BI-RADS 4 and biopsy to complex cystic and solid masses. And maintain strict radiologic–pathologic concordance with a low threshold to re-biopsy or excise if discordant or evolving, thereby balancing cancer detection with avoidance of overtreatment [^116SYYuA] [^113gqAFD] [^115BXjx3].

Complicated breast cysts are **managed based on symptoms and imaging features** [^116SYYuA]. Asymptomatic lesions are **typically BI-RADS 3** [^113gqAFD] and managed with short-interval ultrasound follow-up (6–12 months) [^notfound] because malignancy risk is < 2% [^113gqAFD]. Symptomatic cysts or those with atypical features should undergo **image-guided aspiration** [^113ZtFQT]; clear fluid that yields complete resolution requires no further workup, whereas bloody or atypical fluid warrants cytology and possible core biopsy [^113ZtFQT]. Complex cysts with solid components are **BI-RADS 4/5** [^116SYYuA] and require core needle or vacuum-assisted biopsy [^111mk4uy] due to higher malignancy risk (≈20–30%) [^114NoXvs]. All management should ensure radiology–pathology concordance [^11458YPq], with excision if discordant or if high-risk pathology is identified [^1146wszX].

---

## Classification and imaging features

Complicated cysts are defined by **internal debris without a solid component** [^116SYYuA]; they are otherwise round/oval, circumscribed, and show posterior enhancement [^116SYYuA]. Key sonographic features include:

- **Internal debris**: Mobile or leveling debris, often producing a fluid–debris level [^111efgS8].
- **No solid component**: Absence of intracystic masses or mural nodules [^114ULLCk].
- **Posterior enhancement**: Typical of fluid-containing lesions [^116SYYuA].

These features distinguish complicated cysts from **complex cystic masses**, which contain solid components and carry higher malignancy risk [^117A51VW].

---

## Malignancy risk

The malignancy risk of complicated cysts is **low**, generally < 2% [^113gqAFD], supporting BI-RADS 3 categorization and short-interval follow-up [^116ny1st]. In contrast, complex cystic masses with solid components have a higher malignancy risk (approximately 20–30%) [^114NoXvs] and require biopsy [^116SYYuA].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **symptoms, imaging features, and patient factors** [^111mk4uy]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic, typical features | BI-RADS 3; short-interval ultrasound follow-up (6–12 months) [^113gqAFD] |
| Symptomatic (pain, palpable mass) | Image-guided aspiration; clear fluid with complete resolution requires no further workup [^113ZtFQT] |
| Bloody or atypical fluid | Cytology and possible core needle biopsy [^113ZtFQT] [^1163z7vS] |
| Solid component or suspicious features | Core needle or vacuum-assisted biopsy (BI-RADS 4/5) [^116SYYuA] [^111mk4uy] |
| Discordant imaging–pathology | Surgical excision [^11458YPq] |

---

## Role of aspiration and biopsy

Aspiration is both diagnostic and therapeutic for symptomatic cysts [^113ZtFQT]; clear fluid with complete resolution indicates benign disease, whereas **bloody or atypical fluid** warrants cytology and possible core biopsy [^115BXjx3]. Core needle biopsy is indicated for cysts with solid components or suspicious imaging features, providing histopathologic diagnosis and guiding management [^115BXjx3].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Short-interval ultrasound follow-up is recommended for asymptomatic complicated cysts categorized as BI-RADS 3 [^113gqAFD]. Stability over 1–2 years allows return to routine screening; new or progressive features should prompt **biopsy** [^113gqAFD].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing management

Age, menopausal status, and clinical presentation influence management [^111efgS8]. Postmenopausal patients may warrant a **lower threshold for biopsy** due to higher baseline malignancy risk, whereas younger patients with typical features may be observed [^113gqAFD].

---

## Potential complications and risks

Complications of aspiration or biopsy are uncommon and include infection, hematoma, and rare pneumothorax [^1163z7vS]. The **risk of malignancy** is low but not negligible; careful follow-up is essential [^113gqAFD].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize individualized management based on symptoms, imaging features, and patient factors [^11458YPq]. Asymptomatic complicated cysts are managed conservatively with short-interval follow-up, whereas symptomatic or atypical lesions require aspiration or biopsy [^113gqAFD] [^111mk4uy].

---

Complicated breast cysts are managed conservatively when asymptomatic, with short-interval follow-up, while symptomatic or atypical lesions require aspiration or biopsy. Management should be **individualized**, ensuring radiology–pathology concordance and considering patient-specific factors [^116SYYuA] [^113gqAFD] [^111mk4uy] [^11458YPq].

### Breast cyst aspiration [^113ZtFQT]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

The breast mass is a clinical problem commonly encountered by family physicians. Fine-needle and core biopsy techniques require training and cytopathologist support. In contrast, breast cyst aspiration using a 21- or 22-gauge needle is a simple, cost-effective, minimally invasive procedure. The technique is easy to learn and can be practiced on a breast model. Breast cyst aspiration may be attempted in many women who present with a palpable, dominant breast mass. If clear fluid is aspirated and the mass resolves, malignancy is unlikely, and breast cyst is the probable diagnosis. In this situation, reevaluation in four to six weeks is appropriate; if the cyst has not recurred, only routine mammographic surveillance is required. Referral for fine-needle or excisional biopsy is indicated if the aspirate is bloody or extremely tenacious, if no fluid can be aspirated, or if there is residual mass after aspiration. Complications such as local discomfort, bruising, and infection are uncommon.

Diagnosis

Papillomas can be asymptomatic and detected at routine breast screening. However, when symptomatic, they can be present as a palpable mass near the nipple or with bloody nipple discharge, in up to 20–50% of cases, due to pedicle torsion. Mammography is limited with poor sensitivity and specificity; when visible, mammographic findings are represented by asymmetric areas of increased density, dilated ducts, or solitary lesions with associated microcalcifications. Since the features of papillary lesion at mammography can be non-specific, the main role of this technique is the detection of microcalcifications that can be suspicious and related to papillary malignant lesions (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7
Three different cases of solitary papillomas. 1. a, b Ultrasound shows dilated ducts and an oval and isoechoic intraductal mass with a fibrovascular stem, demonstrated with color Doppler imaging. 2. c, d Ultrasound shows a complex cystic mass with dominant cystic component within a small solid nodule. 3. e Mammography demonstrates a lobular isodense mass in the retroareolar region and (f) ultrasound shows a corresponding intraductal mass

Breast ultrasound is of great value in the diagnosis of papillomas, whether conventional ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound, or elastography. Ultrasound may demonstrate a solid, round mass; a mass with well-defined borders; an intra-cystic mass; or a hypo-echoic, well-defined mass in a dilated duct. The fibrovascular stalk of papillomas can be further assessed with color or power Doppler ultrasound. Elastography can show increased stiffness of the area within the duct which increases the degree of suspicion of malignancy, which can be helpful in differential diagnosis.

MRI is useful for determining the extent of disease in cases when a diagnosis of papilloma has already been established. MRI allows a comprehensive assessment including the identification of connections with the ductal system and a more accurate estimation of disease extent in cases of malignant papillary lesions. The MRI protocol should include acquisitions before and after intravenous contrast administration, due to the significant enhancement of small papillary lesions. MR ductography images can also be obtained to map the entire breast ductal system, whereby the ductal system would be characterized by strong enhancement in which papillomas can be detected as defects (Table 3).

### Cystic breast masses and the ACRIN 6666 experience [^111efgS8]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Masses due to cystic lesions of the breast are extremely common findings on mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Although many of these lesions can be dismissed as benign simple cysts, requiring intervention only for symptomatic relief, complex cystic and solid masses require biopsy. Perhaps, the most challenging are complicated cysts, that is, cysts with internal debris. When the debris is mobile or a fluid-debris level is seen, complicated cysts can be dismissed as benign findings. As an isolated finding, homogeneous complicated cysts can be classified as probably benign, with intervention only considered with interval development or enlargement, abscess is suspected, or if suspicious features develop. When multiple and bilateral complicated and simple cysts are present (ie, at least three, with at least one in each breast), a benign, BI-RADS 2, assessment is usually appropriate. Clustered microcysts are common benign findings in pre- and perimenopausal women, though short-interval surveillance may be appropriate for many such lesions in post-menopausal women, particularly if the lesion is new or rather small or deep (ie, diagnostic uncertainty).

### Clinical and radiologic characteristics of ruptured epidermal inclusion cysts in the nipple and subareolar regions: a report of two cases [^115BjFZv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Epidermal inclusion cysts (EICs) in the breast, particularly in the nipple and subareolar regions, are rare entities that pose significant diagnostic challenges and management dilemmas in clinical practice. This study retrospectively analyzes two case reports of women presenting with EICs located in these unusual breast areas. The subjects included a 35-year-old female with congested nipple symptoms and bilateral mastodynia, and a 58-year-old female with a palpable right breast nodule. Diagnostic efforts involved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sonography, and mammography, which highlighted the cysts' onion-like asymmetry and heterogeneous characteristics with posterior acoustic enhancement. Despite detailed imaging, distinguishing these cysts from malignancies or typical abscesses proved difficult. Both cases experienced spontaneous cyst rupture with subsequent resolution following antibiotic therapy. A literature review confirmed the rarity of such cases, emphasizing the importance of recognizing EICs to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions. These findings underscore the need for heightened clinical awareness and detailed imaging to accurately diagnose and manage EICs in atypical breast locations, and call for further research to explore their etiology and optimal treatment strategies.

Imaging recommended at time of diagnosis — compared with fibroadenoma, BPTs often present at older ages and larger sizes with distinctive imaging features; diagnostic imaging should be performed prior to excision, distant-staging imaging is not necessary for BPT given a metastatic rate less than 0.1%, and magnetic resonance imaging may assist preoperative planning for large tumors. PTs may present at an older age (median of 40–45 years), BPTs are more likely to be larger than 3 cm with higher Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories and other features, and radiographic staging for distant disease is not required in BPT.

Galactocele and infected galactocele — ductal narrowing can obstruct milk flow leading to a cyst-like milk collection; typical presentation is a moderately firm mass that may gradually or rapidly enlarge, with daily size fluctuation and temporary decrease after breastfeeding, and it is generally not as overtly painful as an abscess and lacks erythema or systemic symptoms unless infected. Ultrasound shows a simple or loculated cystic fluid collection, and image-guided aspiration may be utilized to confirm the diagnosis.

Management algorithm for fibroadenomas — after a core needle biopsy pathology report indicates fibroadenoma (including cellular, complex, juvenile), if imaging is concordant: no surgery or surveillance needed; consider surgical excision for size (4 to 6 cm), patient symptoms or preference, or substantive growth on clinical examination, and return to age-appropriate screening. If imaging is not concordant: perform surgical excision for discordance with imaging via surgical excisional biopsy with complete excision of the mass without transection or morcellation, dissection to the capsule without excision of normal breast tissue, and consideration of aesthetics, implications on future breastfeeding, and nipple/skin sensation when selecting incision placement. Additional guidance states medical management is not recommended; most biopsies of proven fibroadenomas of any type should not undergo surgical excision; cryoablation may be considered for small symptomatic fibroadenomas (< 2 cm) by those with cryotherapy experience; and patients not undergoing excision should return to screening or excision if clinical examination reveals substantial growth or if the fibroadenoma reaches 4 to 6 cm. Following pathology after excision, actions include: fibroadenoma (cellular, complex, juvenile) — return to age-appropriate screening; benign phyllodes — return to age-appropriate screening, refer to FEL/BPT pathway, and review NCCN guidelines; borderline or malignant phyllodes — treat per NCCN guidelines; other malignancy — treat per NCCN guidelines. Manage cellular, complex, and juvenile fibroadenomas as standard, and manage fibroadenomas in pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant the same as nonpregnant woman.

### Resource guide: surgical management of benign or high-risk lesions [^113kiAQ9]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Mucocele-like lesions (MLLs) — pathology description and historical management are outlined. MLLs are rare lesions characterized by epithelium-lined cysts filled with mucin that are prone to rupture and extravasate mucin into the surrounding stroma. There are classic and variant forms of MLL, but there is limited information about the clinical significance of the different forms. Previously, it was recommended that all MLLs be excised due to the difficulty in distinguishing them from mucinous carcinoma, and a MLL typically presents with calcifications on mammography.

### BI-RADS 3 on screening breast ultrasound: what is It and what is the appropriate management? [^1153BE8G]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

US is widely used in breast imaging for diagnostic purposes and is also used increasingly for supplemental screening in women with dense breasts. US frequently depicts masses that are occult on mammography, even after tomosynthesis, and the vast majority of such masses are benign. Many masses seen only on screening US are easily recognized as benign simple cysts. Probably benign, BI-RADS 3, or low suspicion, BI-RADS 4A masses are also common and often prompt short-interval follow-up or biopsy, respectively, yet the vast majority of these are benign. This review details appropriate characterization, classification, and new approaches to the management of probably benign masses seen on screening US that can reduce false positives and, thereby, reduce costs and patient anxiety.

### I saw the sign: Go nuts, it's the "acorn cyst" sign [^112JJHxT]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

The "acorn cyst" sign is an imaging sign encountered on breast ultrasound exams denoting a type of benign complicated cyst. An acorn cyst is comprised of a deep anechoic fluid portion (the "acorn") and a more superficial echogenic layer of material (the "acorn cap"). Radiologists should attempt to distinguish the acorn cyst from more suspicious complex cystic and solid masses; if unable to do so, aspiration/biopsy can be performed to exclude a malignant lesion.

### Complicated breast cysts on sonography: is aspiration necessary to exclude malignancy? [^114ULLCk]. Academic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To determine the incidence of breast cancer in women presenting for fine needle aspiration of sonographically diagnosed complicated breast cysts.

Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained. A retrospective study was performed of 186 consecutive women who presented for fine needle aspiration of 243 sonographic complicated cysts detected by clinical examination or imaging between January 2002 and August 2003. Sonographic complicated cysts were defined as those meeting most but not all criteria for simple cysts similar to current Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System classification. We excluded solid masses, cysts with solid components, intracystic masses, and simple cysts. Prospective mammography, ultrasound, and procedure reports were reviewed. A case was considered positive if cytology, core needle biopsy, or surgical excision was positive for cancer. Final diagnosis was established by biopsy, cytology, clinical resolution, or stability over time.

Results

One of 243 (0.4%) lesions proved malignant (95% confidence interval 0–1.94%); 210/243 (86.4%) of cases yielded fluid on aspiration. Of 141 samples submitted to cytology, 138 (97.9%) were benign and 3 (2.1%) atypical. All cases of atypia were benign at surgical excision. Ninety five of 243 (39.1%) aspiration samples with typical cyst fluid were discarded. A total of 33/243 (13.6%) cases did not yield fluid, 1 of which was positive for cancer. Thirty cases underwent core needle or excisional biopsy for imaging discordance with benign results.

Conclusions

Breast cancer presenting as a complicated cyst by ultrasound was rare (0.4%, 95% confidence interval 0–1.94%). These results provide support for classification of complicated cysts as probably benign.

### Accuracy of cyst versus solid diagnosis in the breast using quantitative transmission (QT) ultrasound [^114ZW7Pz]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Current Standard of Care

When XRM identifies a lesion(s), or when a patient has a symptom(s) (eg, palpable lump, focal pain, or nipple discharge), handheld ultrasound (HHUS) is used as an adjunct to XRM for further evaluation. Additionally, HHUS or automated ultrasound may also be used for secondary screening in patients with a normal, dense mammogram to further evaluate the breast and improve upon the lower sensitivity for breast cancer detection seen with XRM alone in this subset of patients. When ultrasound is used to evaluate dense breasts, however, Gerson and Berg reported the "risks of additional testing" and found that "two to six in 100 women who undergo screening sonography will require a breast aspiration or biopsy because of the sonogram". Additionally, "in as many as one out of 10 women, additional short-interval follow-up sonography (usually in 6 months) may be recommended because of the screening sonogram". In Daly et al. only 1 out of 243 lesions (complicated cysts) was found to be malignant. These studies highlight the problem that using adjunctive ultrasound in these situations identifies more benign lesions, without providing the specificity required to prevent these benign lesions from requiring additional imaging and procedures. Because cysts are the most common breast lesion with estimated frequency between 50% and 90% and because they are benign, with only a 0.23% risk of malignancy for complicated cysts, no further work-up is needed. Berg et al. also indicated that false-positives will be substantially increased with the addition of screening ultrasound. To avoid the additional imaging work-up, follow-up, and unnecessary procedures, as well as the significant anxiety and psychological burden experienced by the patient, transmission ultrasound of the breast aims to improve specificity and prevent women from additional work-up and procedures while maintaining a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of early breast cancer.

### Complex solid and cystic breast cancer: a series of six case reports [^114NoXvs]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A cyst in the breast containing a thick wall, internal septations, or a solid intracystic component is defined as a complex solid and cystic breast mass. These lesions carry a malignant potential between 23–31% and thus require further evaluation with biopsy [1]. We report six cases in which patients were found to have a complex solid and cystic mass, all of which were proven to be malignant breast cancers of varying etiologies. We also review the literature on malignant etiologies of complex solid and cystic breast masses, including their clinical presentation, work-up, histopathologic and immunochemistry findings, treatment, and prognosis.

A 37-year-old woman with a palpable retroareolar nodule in her right breast, without inflammation. a Synthesized 2D mammogram (craniocaudal view) shows a well-defined isodense nodule measuring 25 mm (arrows) adjacent to the nipple. b Ultrasound shows a well-defined hypoechogenic nodule below the skin of the right areola (N nipple)

Complications of epidermal inclusion cysts include rupture, inflammation, infection (abscess), and even malignant transformation into squamous-cell carcinoma (0.045–12%, depending on the series). Malignant transformation is more common in lesions greater than 5 cm.

Cases with typical clinical and ultrasound findings require no treatment. In these cases, biopsy is not recommended because the contents of the cyst can irritate the surrounding tissue and increase the risk of infection. Some authors recommend surgical excision of lesions greater than 2 cm to avoid the risk of malignant transformation or of lesions that cause discomfort.

### American Society of Breast Surgeons and society of breast imaging 2025 guidelines for the management of benign breast fibroepithelial lesions [^117SDA4U]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Benign breast conditions guidelines scope and development — These guidelines are intended for use by general and subspecialist surgeons, radiologists, advanced practice practitioners, obstetricians/gynecologists, primary care professionals (internal medicine/family practice), and trainees. The guideline scope is limited to management of the benign condition at time of diagnosis, not the diagnostic process preceding the diagnosis of the condition, and concordance is assumed when biopsy pathology explains imaging results; age-appropriate screening refers to consideration of age and other breast cancer risk factors. A modified Delphi consensus methodology was used, with a consensus panel including ASBrS (n = 12), the Society of Breast Imaging (n = 2), a breast pathology representative (n = 1), and a patient advocate (n = 1), and recommendations were developed by conducting 2 rounds of consensus panel ratings with a priori scoring methods; draft statements underwent public comment and were revised accordingly.

Papillary lesions — indications for excision are as follows: When no further pathologic characterization is provided, the lesion should be surgically excised; intraductal papilloma with atypia or atypical papillary lesions are pathologically upgraded at the time of surgical excision up to 20–30% of the time, therefore surgical excision for these lesions is recommended.

Table 1 — most common breast masses diagnosed during lactation — treatment options are as follows: Lactating adenoma — Observation (mass spontaneously regresses after weaning). Galactocele — Observation (mass spontaneously resolves) versus serial aspirations and/or drainage catheter for symptomatic control. Phlegmon — Conservative measures (e.g., ice), antibiotic therapy, and surveillance to monitor for progression to abscess. Abscess — Drainage +/− antibiotic therapy. Fibroadenoma — Surveillance versus surgical excision for symptomatic control. Breast cancer — Treatment varies according to stage and tumor characteristics such as histologic subtype and hormone receptor expression.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^114Q1o3n]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Management

Available data suggest that the most common management for phyllodes tumor is surgical excision. The possibility of phyllodes underestimation diagnosed at CNB is approximately 20%, whereas it is lower at 8% when diagnosed at VAB. Based on the current evidence, the second International Consensus Conference on lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3) recommends that a phyllodes tumor, when found at CNB, should undergo open surgical excision with clear margins. If accidentally found at VAB without any corresponding imaging finding, surveillance of a benign phyllodes tumor is justified, while borderline and malignant phyllodes tumors require re-excision to obtain clear margins. Similar guidelines are issued by the NHSBSP which recommend surgical excision for phyllodes. In case of rapid changes in size of a lesion previously biopsied as fibroadenoma, surgical excision should be performed (Table 1).

### Outcomes in sonographically categorized complex cystic breast lesions [^117A51VW]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate outcomes of patients with complex cystic breast lesions and to determine malignancy rates for each sonographic category.

Material and Methods

A total of 124 women with a mean age of 45 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Complex cysts were classified into four categories according to sonographic findings (thick septa/wall, intramural nodule, solid/cystic ratio) by two radiologists. Size, margin, short-to-long axis ratio, and vascularity were also noted. The relationship between sonographic features and histopathological/follow-up results was evaluated.

Results

Of 124 complex cysts, 11 were malignant and 113 were benign. There were 31 with thick septa/wall (category 1), 14 with intramural nodule (category 2), 60 with solid/cystic ratio < 1 (category 3), and 19 with solid/cystic ratio > 1 (category 4). Among 11 malignant tumors, six intraductal papillary carcinomas and three invasive ductal carcinomas were in category 3, whereas one invasive ductal carcinoma was in category 1 and one was in category 4. Most of malignant lesions (9/11, 82%) were in category 3. Most of benign lesions (96/113, 85%) were fibroadenomatoid/fibrocystic changes. The presence of vascularity (96%), irregular margin (94%), and short-to-long axis ratio ≥ 1 (94%) had higher accuracy rates for diagnosis of malignancy.

Conclusion

The malignancy rate was 8.8% in our study. Besides internal morphological features, other sonographic features should be considered in the evaluation of complex cystic breast lesions. Due to substantial risk of malignancy and the overlapping sonographic features of benign and malignant lesions, tissue sampling of all complex cysts should be performed.

### Contrast-enhanced mammography BI-RADS: a case-based approach to radiology reporting [^113ccctX]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Structured report example

Indication: Post-biopsy management of B3 lesion.
Technique: Examination conducted after intravenous administration of iodine-based contrast medium (1.5 mL/kg). Two minutes after injection, DM projections (cranio-caudal and medio-lateral-oblique) were acquired at both LE (26–32 kVp) and HE (45–49 kVp). An RC image was then reconstructed to highlight any contrast medium uptake.
Observations
- Breast composition (LE Fig. 6 a and b): Scattered areas of fibroglandular density (ACR B)
- BPE (RC): Minimal (Fig. 6 c)
- Findings

LE image (Fig. 6 a): Fine and pleomorphic microcalcifications with a maximum extension of 20 mm in the right breast
Associated features: No
RC image (Fig. 6 c) Non-mass enhancement (same extension of microcalcifications) Location: Central quadrant
Distribution: Linear Pattern: Heterogeneous Lesion conspicuity: Moderate Note: A mild rim enhancement around the post-biopsy marker was detected as a biopsy outcome.

4 Assessment category: BI-RADS 4
5 Management: The patient was scheduled for surgery based on suspicions of residual disease within the biopsy area despite the B3 histological result of the biopsy (atypical ductal hyperplasia), which could have allowed for active surveillance.

These findings indicated a potential persistence of the disease. Subsequently, the patient underwent conservative peri-biopsy surgery, revealing a few foci of low-grade carcinoma in situ.

The role of CEM in B3 lesion management, in situations where the necessity of surgical intervention is still debated, as in the case of atypical ductal hyperplasia, may be significant: the presence of peri-biopsy enhancement could serve as an indication for surgery.

Tips: Post-biopsy CEM should ideally be conducted at least 2 weeks after biopsy to mitigate the impact of the procedure. Even at this interval, rim enhancement is frequently observable as a subtle, circular enhancement surrounding the biopsied area. This form of enhancement is also commonly observed in cases of inflammatory cysts.

Regarding medical management for renal cysts, more specifically with respect to expectant management, Bosniak III-IV, AUA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider renal mass biopsy for further oncologic risk stratification in patients with a Bosniak III or IV complex cystic renal mass with an equivocal risk/benefit ratio for treatment electing active surveillance. Obtain repeat cross-sectional imaging approximately 3–6 months later to assess for interval growth. Consider deciding on periodic clinical/imaging surveillance based on growth rate and shared decision-making with offering intervention if substantial interval growth is observed or if other clinical/imaging findings suggest that the risk/benefit analysis is no longer equivocal or favorable for continued active surveillance.

### Benign-appearing incidental adnexal cysts at US, CT, and MRI: putting the ACR, O-RADS, and SRU guidelines all together [^113Y1ddn]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Adnexal cysts are a common incidental finding at US, CT, and MRI but have historically caused a diagnostic dilemma for determining when to follow up and how to manage them. Characteristic imaging features of simple adnexal cysts include a simple fluid collection with smooth walls and no solid or vascular components. Day-to-day practice guidelines were recently updated to reflect the overwhelming evidence that incidental cystic adnexal masses are almost always benign. Three major consensus articles on adnexal cystic masses were published between 2019 and 2020: the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) consensus update on adnexal cysts, the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US consensus guideline, and the American College of Radiology (ACR) white paper on the management for incidental adnexal findings at CT and MRI. All three standardize reporting terminology, are based on evidence-based data and institutional practice patterns, and apply to nonpregnant women of average risk for ovarian cancer. While there are small differences in follow-up recommendations based on size thresholds, the goal of each is the same-to limit unnecessary imaging follow-up and, by doing so, save the patient time, money, and anxiety. For the diagnostic radiologist to use these guidelines, it is essential that the entire mass is visualized well. Without adequate visualization, further characterization of the mass may be necessary. To put it all together, the SRU consensus guideline and ACR white paper are easily applied in day-to-day practice for masses that are O-RADS 2 and below.

Ultrasound is second in importance only to mammography in the evaluation of breast abnormalities. The ability of US to diagnose benign simple cysts accurately has spared innumerable women from needless biopsies and aspirations. When a suspicious solid abnormality is detected by ultrasound, it readily provides convenient, inexpensive, accurate imaging guidance for interventional procedures. Future studies of US as a screening tool must weigh potential benefits against the potential risks because of increased biopsies performed for false-positive results.

### Image-guided biopsy of breast lesions-when to use what biopsy technique [^111mk4uy]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Suggested approaches in US-visible lesions

Although CNB is the first choice in US-visible masses, incidentally, other biopsy techniques need to be considered. This is dependent on lesion type, size and indication of tissue sampling. Specific lesion categories and indications for which recommendations might deviate from the general CNB recommendation when biopsy is performed under ultrasound are discussed below.

Table 2 provides an overview of approaches for specific US-visible lesions.

Table 2
Summary of statements and results of panel voting for US-visible lesions

CNB core-needle biopsy, EVAB extended vacuum-assisted biopsy, FNA fine-needle aspiration, VAB vacuum-assisted biopsy

Small masses (< 5 mm)

For diagnostic biopsy of small masses (< 5 mm), VAB is recommended by the panel (consensus: 100% of panel), due to the relatively high likelihood of sampling errors with CNB in these lesions. As it is likely that the lesion will be completely removed with VAB, placement of a marker at the biopsy cavity is essential.

Larger masses (> 5 mm)

The panel recommends CNB for larger masses (> 5 mm) visible under ultrasound (consensus: 87.5% of panel). Incidentally, VAB may be considered (recommended by one panelist, 12.5%).

Simple and complicated cyst

The panel recommends FNA for simple and complicated cysts in symptomatic patients to relieve the symptoms (consensus: 100% of panel). In asymptomatic patients, sampling is not necessary.

Complex cystic and solid lesions with small (< 5 mm) solid part(s)

The panel recommends VAB (consensus: 87.5% of panel) for complex cystic and solid breast lesions with a limited solid component, due to the higher chance of underestimation and the risk of non-visualization of the solid part after rupture of the cyst. Just as with small masses, placement of a marker at the biopsy cavity is essential.

Complex cystic and solid lesions with larger (> 5 mm) solid part(s)

For biopsy of complex cystic and solid lesions with large solid parts, no consensus was reached. Half of the panelists (50%) recommended CNB for such complex cystic and solid lesions. Alternatively, VAB, EVAB or excision is proposed. Regardless of the approach, if the lesion collapses during biopsy, a post-biopsy marker should be placed.

### Cystic breast lesions: diagnostic approach and US assessment [^116SYYuA]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Various cystic breast lesions are encountered during screening and diagnostic breast imaging. According to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) from the American College of Radiology, cystic breast lesions can be classified into the following categories based on sonographic findings: simple cysts, complicated cysts, clustered microcysts, and complex cystic and solid masses. With appropriate technique, simple cysts can be diagnosed easily by satisfying the diagnostic criteria, which include anechoic round or oval lesions with circumscribed margins and posterior enhancement on US images. Simple cysts are categorized as BI-RADS category 2, benign. Complicated cysts contain debris and satisfy all other sonographic criteria for simple cysts, except they are not anechoic. Clustered microcysts are defined as lesions comprising a cluster of small anechoic masses without a solid component. Based on recent investigations, complicated cysts are categorized as BI-RADS category 3, probably benign, whereas clustered microcysts are categorized as BI-RADS category 2. Complex cystic and solid masses contain fluid and solid components and include those with a thick wall, thick septations, an intracystic or mural mass, and both cystic and solid components. They usually are considered BI-RADS category 4, suspicious, and are accompanied by a biopsy recommendation. Radiologists must evaluate cystic lesions carefully, with meticulous technique, and provide appropriate assessment and management recommendations, thereby reducing unnecessary follow-up and biopsies while preventing cancers from being missed or dismissed. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

A review of breast and emergencies may seem mutually exclusive of one another, but breast interventions beyond pathologic diagnosis are encountered and may be urgent. Acute breast situations that can potentially require interventional techniques to resolve include abscess or complications from percutaneous biopsy or trauma such as hemorrhage or pseudoaneurysm. Acute breast interventions are not commonly seen, but a working knowledge of the various treatment approaches and management is important. These entities can be similar to other areas of the body, but there are some specifics to the breast that can allow for optimal treatment and management.

### Resource guide: surgical management of benign or high-risk lesions [^11458YPq]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Breast high-risk lesion evaluation and excision decision-making — Patients with clinical or imaging findings that are discordant with core needle biopsy (CNB) histology should undergo excision, and consideration can be given to repeat biopsy if the initial biopsy procedure was felt to be inadequate. Selective excision for the remaining patients is recommended, and the final decision to excise depends on shared decision making with the patient and includes careful clinical, imaging, and pathology concordance assessment with multidisciplinary input, patient-specific estimates of the risk of upgrade to malignancy, disclosure of operative and cosmetic risks, and whether the patient can or will comply with follow-up. All patients should undergo comprehensive breast cancer risk assessment and be considered for risk reducing medication and high-risk screening as appropriate; the presence of a high-risk lesion is not an indication for genetic testing; however, all patients should be evaluated for personal or family history that would indicate that genetic evaluation is appropriate. Certain high-risk lesions such as lobular neoplasia and atypical ductal hyperplasia are associated with elevated lifetime breast cancer risk which is not mitigated by surgical excision, and these recommendations assume that the pathology and imaging results are deemed concordant.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^113VH6Rt]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast lesions with uncertain malignant behavior, also known as high-risk or B3 lesions, are composed of a variety of pathologies with differing risks of associated malignancy. In the past several decades, the diagnosis of B3 lesions has significantly increased with the widespread implementation of screening programs and the advent of new imaging modalities. B3 lesions reportedly represent approximately 3–21% of all breast lesions and carry a low but potential risk of associated malignancy ranging from 0.2 to 5%. B3 lesions are considered non-obligate precursors of malignancy because they can develop into higher-grade lesions, predominantly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and less frequently low-grade invasive tumors. Some B3 lesions also function as risk indicators; for example, women diagnosed with a proliferative breast disease with atypia have a fourfold to tenfold higher risk of developing breast cancer compared with those without atypia in any location of the same or the contralateral breast.

### Can short-term follow-up with ultrasound be offered as an acceptable alternative to immediate biopsy or surgery for patients with first ultrasound diagnosis of BI-RADS 4A lesions? [^115G4AhV]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the relevant factors associated with malignancy in Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4A and to determine whether it was possible to establish a safe follow-up guideline for lower-risk 4A lesions.

Methods

In this retrospective study, patients categorized as BI-RADS 4A on ultrasound who underwent ultrasound-guided biopsy or/and surgery between June 2014 and April 2020 was analyzed. Classification-tree method and cox regression analysis were used to explore the possible correlation factors of malignancy.

Results

Among 9965 patients enrolled, 1211 (mean age, 44.3 ± 13.5 years; range, 18–91 years) patients categorized as BI-RADS 4A were eligible. The result of cox regression analysis revealed the malignant rate was only associated with patient age (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.038, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.029–1.048) and the mediolateral diameter of the lesion (HR = 1.261, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.159–1.372). The malignant rate for patients (≤ 36 y) with BI-RADS 4A lesions (the mediolateral diameter ≤ 0.9 cm) was 0.0% (0/72). This subgroup included fibrocystic disease and adenosis in 39 patients (54.2%), fibroadenoma in 16 (22.2%), intraductal papilloma in 8 (11.1%), inflammatory lesions in 6 (8.3%), cyst in 2 (2.8%), and hamartoma in 1 (1.4%).

Conclusions

Patient age and lesion size are associated with the rate of malignancy in BI-RADS 4A. For patients with lower-risk BI-RADS 4A lesions (≤ 2% likelihood of malignancy), short-term follow-up with ultrasound may be offered as an acceptable alternative to immediate biopsy or surgery.

### Comparison of emergency pediatric breast ultrasound interpretations and management recommendations between pediatric radiologists and breast imaging radiologists [^115767hx]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While pediatric breast cancer is rare, malignancy remains in the differential diagnosis of breast-related symptoms in this population, especially those patients presenting with a palpable breast mass. Currently, there are no specific breast cancer screening protocols for the pediatric population. Therefore, breast-related symptoms in this population may alarm both the parent and child when present. Although most causes for these symptoms are benign, newly appearing symptoms, especially a new palpable mass, always require further medical evaluation as this can be an initial presenting symptom of a breast cancer.

Pediatric patients with breast-related symptoms often initially present to the emergency department for evaluation. Unlike in the adult population, ultrasound is typically the initial imaging modality of choice for work-up instead of mammography due to the lack of ionizing radiation and higher sensitivity in dense breast tissue. Depending on the institution, pediatric breast ultrasound examinations performed in the emergency setting may be interpreted by either the pediatric or breast imaging division. While pediatric radiologists are accustomed to evaluating acute infectious and traumatic etiologies, they may be less familiar with breast-specific findings such as cluster of microcysts, complicated cysts, and invasive carcinomas which are predominantly evaluated by breast imaging radiologists. This can present a diagnostic challenge for pediatric radiologists if asked to interpret these studies and can lead to increased anxiety for radiologists, providers, pediatric patients, and their parents.

To optimize the breast care provided to pediatric patients in the emergency setting, adequate evaluation of breast complaints without missing suspicious lesions is vital for the initial work-up. Therefore, investigating the existence of discrepancies between management recommendations given by pediatric radiologists and breast imaging radiologists is relevant and can improve the quality of patient care. The purpose of this study is to compare management recommendations given by pediatric and breast imaging radiologists for pediatric breast ultrasounds performed in the emergency setting.

### Complex cystic lesions of the breast on ultrasonography: feature analysis and BI-RADS assessment [^111ECGoS]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the features of breast complex cystic lesions at ultrasonography (US) and to determine appropriate Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories and management recommendations for these lesions based on US findings with pathologic correlation.

Materials and Methods

From July 2001 to June 2007, 152 consecutive pathologically proven complex cystic lesions on US were retrospectively reviewed. All lesions at US were evaluated for size, lesion characteristics, margins, and presence of abnormal axillary nodes. US features of lesions were classified into four types, and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated for each type. Clinical, imaging, and histopathological findings were reviewed.

Results

Of the 152 lesions based on US appearance, 36 (24%) were classified as type I, 49 (32%) as type II, 28 (18%) as type III, and 39 (26%) as type IV. The PPVs for malignancy in each type were 14% for type I, 16% for type II, 14% for type III, and 41% for type IV. There was a significantly higher frequency of malignancy among lesions of type IV compared with the other three types (16/39 = 41% vs 5/36 = 14%, p = 0.0089; 16/39 = 41% vs 8/49 = 16%, p = 0.0098; and 16/39 = 41% vs 4/28 = 14%, p = 0.018 [Chi-squared test]). Lesions with maximum diameter equal to or larger than 20mm, not circumscribed margins, or a mammographic finding of suspected malignancy had a high probability of malignancy (p < 0.05 for each).

Conclusion

US is useful in evaluating the complex cystic lesions and in clarifying the indication for biopsy of these lesions. The four types of US classifications used in our study establish accepted benchmarks for these breast abnormalities when stratified according to BI-RADS categories.

### ABM clinical protocol # 30: breast masses, breast complaints, and diagnostic breast imaging in the lactating woman [^111pX81c]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Non-lactation-specific benign breast masses in lactating women — benign masses that are not specific to lactation include fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, cysts, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia, intramammary lymph nodes, fat necrosis, hematoma, and periductal mastitis. Fibroadenoma is the most common benign breast mass to present in the reproductive years. Any suspicion of phyllodes requires wide excision to rule out malignancy. Cysts are classified by ultrasonography; complex cysts require aspiration for cytologic analysis, whereas simple cysts can be observed. Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia is benign and does not require surgical excision if proven on biopsy. Intramammary lymph nodes may be discovered by patients, and imaging can distinguish between benign versus malignant appearance. Fat necrosis after prior surgery or trauma may present as an irregular palpable mass that may be tender or asymptomatic. Hematoma can follow motor vehicle accident with seat belt injury or vigorous massage in the setting of lactation, and transient nipple discharge may occur. Periductal mastitis generally presents in smokers with squamous metaplasia of the lactiferous ducts and causes chronic, persistent abscesses and fistulae in the superficial periareolar region.

### Breast emergencies: types, imaging features, and management [^116cP4YT]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to describe the types of breast emergencies that can be encountered in a breast imaging practice, discuss the characteristic imaging features of these emergencies, and explain the most common methods and interventions used for the treatment of breast emergencies and complications.

Conclusion

Breast emergencies are uncommon but require prompt identification and management when they do occur. Patients with mastitis or a breast abscess may be seen for either diagnosis or treatment. Most complications are the result of interventional procedures. Pseudoaneurysms, postbiopsy hematoma, and localization wire migration are the most common situations encountered. A milk fistula resulting from a core biopsy is uncommon. Fortunately, seat-belt injuries to the breast are rare. Knowledge of these entities — of the usual presentation, management, and appropriate follow-up protocols — is essential for breast imagers.

### Breast ultrasound for the interventionalist [^117Tc7AY]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ultrasound (US)-guided interventional procedures are routinely performed for lesions visualized on US and are the standard of care in the diagnosis and management of breast disease. When performed correctly, these procedures are safe, minimally invasive, and have a high diagnostic accuracy comparable to surgical biopsy. The most commonly performed US-guided procedures include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, and preoperative wire localization. The success of these procedures depends on a thorough understanding of the indications, strong technical skills, and appropriate postbiopsy management. This article reviews the indications and techniques for US-guided interventional procedures. Concordance of imaging and pathology results, potential challenges, and associated complications are also discussed.

### Management of cystic echinococcosis complications and dissemination: where is the evidence? [^116gZrxD]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

This systematic review was designed to provide "evidence-based" answers to identify the best treatment for a complicated hydatid cyst of the liver and the appropriate management of disseminated cystic echinococcosis. An extensive electronic search of the relevant literature was performed using Medline and the Cochrane Library. This systematic review enabled us make to determine the best treatment options for the following conditions. Liver hydatid cysts ruptured into the biliary tract: Common bile duct exploration should be conducted using intraoperative cholangiography and choledoscopy. When the biliary tract is cleared of all cystic content, T-tube drainage should be sufficient. The principal difficulty concerned the management of the large biliocystic fistula: suture or internal transfistulary drainage or fistulization. Medical treatment is indicated in association with surgery for 3 months postoperatively. During the preoperative period, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) combined with preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) may decrease the incidence of postoperative external fistula. Liver hydatid cysts involving the thorax: An abdominal approach is mandatory when common bile duct drainage is required, and it may be sufficient to treat a direct rupture into bronchi. An acute abdomen, owing to Liver hydatid cysts ruptured into peritoneum, requires an emergent operation. Medical treatment should be associated. Cystic echinococcosis of the lung: Surgery is still the main therapeutic option to remove the cyst, suture bronchial fistula if necessary, followed by capitonnage. Osseous cystic echinococcosis: Wide surgical excision is recommended. Cystic echinococcosis of the heart: Cystopericystectomy is the "gold standard" procedure but is sometimes unsuitable for particular sites. Cystic echinococcosis of the kidney: Cystectomy with pericystectomy is feasible in 75% of cases; nephrectomy must be reserved for destroyed kidney. Multiple associated cystic echinococcosis locations: Complicated cysts should be treated with high priority. In case of several cysts in the liver, spleen, and peritoneum, removal of all cysts in the same intervention is indicated when there is no threat to the life of the patient. Otherwise, a planned reoperation should be considered.

A central goal of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is the development of clinical protocols, free from commercial interest or influence, for managing common medical problems that may impact breastfeeding success. These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient.

### Asymptomatic complicated cysts in postmenopausal women: is tissue sampling unnecessarily high? [^116ny1st]. Academic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To determine the malignancy rate of complicated cysts in postmenopausal women and to discuss appropriate (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment and recommendation.

Materials and Methods

This study was approved by our institutional review board and informed consent was waived. One hundred fourteen postmenopausal patients with 183 complicated cysts as defined by the newest Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System edition were identified retrospectively between January 2013 and December 2015 (to allow for 2 years follow-up period). One hundred eight complicated cysts were assessed as probably benign and 75 as suspicious. Prospective review of all images and pathology was performed and patient's age, breast density, risk factors, use of hormone replacement therapy, and family history of breast cancer were recorded. A total of 30 symptomatic patients and lesions not meeting criteria for complicated cysts were excluded from our cohort. Benignity was determined by aspiration, biopsy, resolution, recategorization to a simple cyst, or adequate follow-up.

Results

None of our complicated cysts proved malignant. Fifteen of 108 probably benign complicated cysts were aspirated yielding benign fluid in 10 and 5 were biopsied yielding benign pathology (only 2 with atypical cells). Twenty-nine of 75 complicated cysts categorized as suspicious were aspirated and fluid was discarded in 25 and 4 sent for cytology yielding benign pathology. The other 41 complicated cysts thought to be suspicious were biopsied with benign pathology (only 1 atypical).

Conclusion

This study supports the use of a probably benign assessment of asymptomatic complicated cysts irrespective of age. The sensitivity for malignancy was 100% in our cohort.

Galactocele and infected galactocele — For symptomatic galactoceles, drainage is recommended for symptom relief, confirmation of diagnosis, and to decrease mass effect to facilitate latch, as aspiration almost always results in incomplete drainage and/or recurrence and repeated aspirations risk converting a sterile galactocele into an infected galactocele; therefore, drain placement is recommended. An infected galactocele requires drainage as well as antibiotics. Level of evidence: 3. Strength of recommendations: C.

### Breast cyst aspiration… [^1163z7vS]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

2 In women younger than 40 years, fibroadenomas and other solid benign lesions are the most likely cause of newly discovered dominant breast lumps. It often is difficult to differentiate cystic from solid lesions by physical examination alone. Ultrasonography or mammography can help, but performance of either study involves a time delay and another appointment for the patient. Thus, breast cyst aspiration is an appropriate first step in the care of women who present with a dominant breast mass suspected of being a cyst.
3. 3, 4 Surgical or radiologic referral is necessary if no fluid is aspirated, the aspirated fluid is bloody or unusually tenacious, or there is residual mass. A physician trained in fine-needle biopsy techniques may proceed to sample a solid mass and send the sample for immediate evaluation.

Bloody aspirate should be sent to the laboratory for evaluation, but additional biopsy will be needed. Management and Follow-up Breast cyst aspiration is a diagnostic procedure that is potentially therapeutic if a watery, nonbloody aspirate is obtained and the cyst resolves completely. However, follow-up is imperative, because the false-negative rate for the procedure may be as high as 15 to 20 percent. 5 With appropriate follow-up, the false-negative rate becomes negligible.
6. Further evaluation is required for breast cysts that remain palpable after aspiration, contain bloody or unusually tenacious fluid, or subsequently refill. In these situations, patients should be referred for biopsy, even if the mammogram is normal. 3, 6. In summary, after-care and follow-up include the following 3: Palpation of the cyst after aspiration to ensure complete resolution.

Reevaluation of the patient in four to six weeks to be certain that the cyst has not refilled. Referral of the patient for surgical biopsy if there is refilling or residual mass. Possible complications of the breast cyst aspiration technique include discomfort at the aspiration site, bruising, localized infection, small hematoma formation and, rarely, pneumothorax. No evidence shows that aspiration of a breast carcinoma spreads cancer cells or worsens survival. 7 Breast cyst aspiration does not appear to increase the number of false-positive mammograms as long as the mammographer has information about the exact location of the aspiration.

AIUM practice parameter — indications for ultrasound guidance state that image guidance is generally indicated for percutaneous soft tissue sampling or ablative procedures to ensure accurate needle or device placement, avoid unnecessary contamination of adjacent tissue compartments, optimize the diagnostic yield, accurately deliver ablative/therapeutic agents, and/or minimize complications; specific indications include fine needle aspiration for sampling accessible thyroid and parathyroid nodules, lymph nodes, cysts, salivary glands, congenital cervical mass lesions, muscle, soft tissue masses, and abscesses of the head and neck region, with samples that may be submitted for cytology, flow cytometry, hormone analysis (thyroglobulin, calcitonin, parathormone, and amylase), genetic and molecular markers, and cultures of infectious lesions; core biopsy is indicated for lymph nodes suspicious for lymphoma and aggressive thyroid lesions, and fine-needle aspiration for cytology, often with flow cytometry when lymphoma is suspected, should precede consideration of core biopsy, while when results are equivocal or suggest a Hodgkin lymphoma is suspected, a tissue sample is required with core biopsy as a first step before open biopsy; for breast lesions, most breast surgeons and radiologists prefer to perform core breast sampling as an initial assessment rather than fine-needle aspiration with cytology; additional uses include percutaneous ethanol injection of thyroid cysts, selected metastatic papillary carcinoma in lymph nodes, and specific hyperparathyroid conditions, noting that except for thyroid cysts, which have a very low complication rate, ethanol injections for other conditions are highly specialized and should be reserved for centers with specific interest and experience in these treatments, and sclerosing agents to treat macrocystic lymphangiomas and cystic hygromas.

### Practical management of breast fibroadenomas… [^1171rzW1]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Conversely, higher body mass index, greater number of full-term pregnancies, higher intake of vitamin C and cigarette smoking are associated with a decreased risk of these lesions. Greenberg and associates present a literature-based approach to fibroadenomas and propose practical algorithms for their management. Depending on the patient's age, family history and history of previous biopsies, conservative treatment of fibroadenomas may or may not be warranted. A woman under 25 years of age with fibroadenomas is unlikely to have a "missed" malignancy if she has had a clinical examination, negative sonography and negative fine-needle aspiration. It is not until age 35 that the risk increases somewhat. Multiple fibroadenomas should be excised, with care taken to avoid scarring or ductal damage, which may occur when one incision is used.

Giant fibroadenomas generally shrink after hormonal balance is achieved, so conservative management is preferred, with excision warranted after the lesions become smaller. The authors conclude that, in women younger than 35 years, conservative management of fibroadenomas is recommended, with a follow-up every six to 12 months until complete regression. Fibroadenomas that don't regress or that remain unchanged by age 35 should be excised. Women older than 35 years should have mammograms in addition to the above-mentioned diagnostic modalities, with follow-up after six to 12 months. If the fibroadenoma has not resolved after 12 months, excision is recommended. Even when conservative management is reasonable, patients often prefer excisional biopsy of persistent fibroadenomas.

The authors advise excisional biopsy of any mass for which a diagnosis of fibroadenoma is not clear-cut; however, if, after a clinical examination, ultrasound examination and fine-needle aspiration, a diagnosis of multiple fibroadenomas can be confidently made, conservative treatment is warranted. editor's note: When mammography is going to be used to assist in the diagnosis of fibroadenomas, it should be performed before fine-needle aspiration, so that subsequent hematoma formation does not distort the mammographic picture. It should also be emphasized that when the nature of a lesion is not definite after ultrasonography, mammography and fine-needle aspiration, the lesion should be excised. — g. b. h.

### Understanding BI-RADS category 3 [^113gqAFD]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 assessment is used for breast imaging findings considered "probably benign", with less than a 2% likelihood of malignancy. It is used to increase specificity by decreasing the number of breast biopsies. It has been validated for mammography, breast US, and emerging indications for use in contrast-enhanced breast MRI. Despite the long-term use of category 3 and numerous published studies that evaluate characteristic imaging findings appropriate for this category, there is still misuse and confusion regarding its accurate use. Imaging findings classified as category 3 require short-term follow-up to assess stability and identify changes that may warrant a biopsy for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Category 3 should not be used in a screening study without a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation that may reveal suspicious features or downgrade a finding to benign. In mammography, category 3 findings are validated for grouped round calcifications, oval circumscribed masses, and nonpalpable asymmetries. In US, category 3 can be applied to oval circumscribed parallel solid masses and complicated cysts. Category 3 can be assigned to clustered microcysts when they are very small or deep in the breast. Recent studies have yielded characteristic findings appropriate for MRI category 3 that are expected to be included in the sixth edition of the BI-RADS atlas. These include oval circumscribed masses with associated T2-hyperintense signal, focal non-mass enhancement, and foci of enhancement with associated T 2-hyperintense signal. Surveillance with short-interval imaging enables radiologists to monitor findings and act early when a change is detected. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### A novel technique for teaching challenging ultrasound-guided breast procedures to radiology residents [^111poi3i]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Ultrasound-guided breast interventions (core biopsies, needle-wire localizations, and fine-needle cyst aspirations) are common procedures performed by radiologists. Residents must gain competency in these interventions during training. Phantoms and simulations have been advocated for teaching interventions, and various systems are available for standard breast interventions. However, simulations for difficult/high-risk interventions are not readily available. We describe an inexpensive method for simulating difficult ultrasound-guided breast procedures, including masses over breast implants, deep masses along the chest wall, and lymph nodes adjacent to axillary vessels.

### Management of fat necrosis after autologous fat transplantation for breast augmentation [^116oHyEh]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Palpable lumps as sequelae of fat necrosis after fat grafting to the breast may not only cause physical or psychological symptoms to patients but also potentially complicate breast cancer screening. In this article, the authors present their experience in management of fat necrosis following fat grafting for breast augmentation.

Methods

Over a 5-year period, a total of 685 Asian women (age range, 20 to 58 years) underwent autologous fat transplantation to the breasts. The average volume of fat graft to each breast was 205 ± 45 cc. The preoperative and postoperative photographs and the breast volume were recorded. Detection of fat necrosis was based on clinical examinations and imaging studies. The mean follow-up was 208 ± 36 days.

Results

The mean volume increase was 135 ± 20 cc in a single breast, with a mean graft retention rate of 65 percent. Sixty-six patients (9.6 percent) were found to have fat necrosis in the form of solitary or multiple cysts, sclerotic nodules, or calcifications in either one or both breasts postoperatively. The average time before first detection of the breast lump was 108 ± 45 days. Management of fat necrosis included aspiration or excision based on the authors' treatment algorithm. The symptoms related to fat necrosis such as discomfort on palpation, pain, or possible skin reaction were significantly improved in 54 of 57 patients (94.7 percent).

Conclusions

Fat necrosis following autologous fat grafting for breast augmentation can be managed successfully and its related symptoms can be relieved in 94.7 percent of patients. It can be approached safely based on a sound algorithm developed by the authors.

### Sonographic differentiation of benign and malignant cystic lesions of the breast [^117WAcfT]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to subdivide the types of sonographic findings of benign versus malignant cystic masses and to determine appropriate patient care according to the sonographic findings with pathologic correlation.

Methods

The sonographic findings of 175 symptomatic cystic breast lesions were pathologically proven and reviewed retrospectively. Cystic lesions were classified as 6 types: simple cysts (type I), clustered cysts (type II), cysts with thin septa (type III), complicated cysts (type IV), cystic masses with a thick wall/septa or nodules (type V), and complex solid and cystic masses (type VI). Sonographic findings were compared with the pathologic results and were evaluated according to the incidence of benign and malignant masses.

Results

All 23 type I, 15 type II, 22 type III, and 35 type IV cases were pathologically proven to be benign. Seven (25.9%) of the 27 type V cases and 33 (62.3%) of the 53 type VI cases were proven to be malignant. We analyzed the shapes and margins of 80 cases of cystic masses with a solid component (types V and VI); 16 (44%) of 36 sonographically circumscribed masses were malignant.

Conclusions

Because the sonographically detected simple cysts (type I), clustered cysts (type II), and cysts with thin septa (type III) were all benign, annual routine follow-up appears reasonable. Symptomatic complicated cysts (type IV) should be aspirated and appropriately treated according to clinical symptoms. Cystic masses with a solid component (types V and VI) should be examined by biopsy with pathologic confirmation.

### The sonographic findings and differing clinical implications of simple, complicated, and complex breast cysts [^112H3iA7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

Although palpable and mammographic breast masses are common and frequently reflect underlying fibrocystic change, they must be distinguished from breast malignancy. Clinical characterization of these masses is often unreliable, and mammographic appearances alone cannot distinguish between those that are solid and those that are cystic. Sonography is an important adjunct to characterize these abnormalities further. Management of solid masses is well established, but overlap in appearance of cystic lesions has led to variability in reporting and management. With current high-resolution ultrasound, specific observations can accurately characterize most cystic masses, thereby facilitating management decisions.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^1134CNxv]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Diagnosis of high-risk lesions occurs frequently and incidentally at percutaneous biopsy, following suspicious imaging findings such as distortion, a group of microcalcifications, or even a mass. Traditionally, high-risk lesions are managed with surgical excision because of their low but latent potential of upgrade to malignancy. The most recent guidelines recommend a more conservative approach, sparing open surgery when this can be avoided. This trend has been adopted for the continued concerns raised regarding potential harms associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgeries when suspicious imaging findings are found. Further, radiological follow-up by means of mammography and breast MRI should be considered in patients diagnosed with high-risk lesions as they are not only non-obligate precursors of malignancy but also risk indicators for the homolateral and contralateral breast. It is essential that management of high-risk lesions takes on a multidisciplinary approach with close communication between all members of the breast team (surgeon, pathologist, oncologist, geneticist, radiotherapist) to assess the individual risk of patients with such a diagnosis and their suitability for either surgical excision or imaging surveillance.

### Resource guide: surgical management of benign or high-risk lesions [^1127fR33]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Intraductal papilloma (IP) without atypia — management includes ensuring concordance and tailoring excision to symptoms. As with other high-risk or benign lesions, careful radiographic and pathologic concordance is recommended. Asymptomatic intraductal papillomas can undergo active imaging surveillance, supported by a prospective multicenter registry that enrolled 116 asymptomatic patients with intraductal papillomas and BI-RADS ≤ 4 and found a 1.7% upgrade to DCIS regardless of lesion size or patient age, with no invasive cancers identified. Several large retrospective studies have reported 1–5% upgrade rates for asymptomatic intraductal papillomas with excellent clinical, radiologic, and pathologic concordance, and factors associated with higher risk of upgrade include size > 1 cm, age > 50 years at diagnosis, lesion multiplicity, location (peripheral), and > 50% of the lesion remaining after CNB, though these associations are not consistent across studies. Symptomatic intraductal papillomas that present as a palpable mass or with nipple discharge are associated with a slightly higher risk of upgrade to DCIS or invasive cancer, and surgical excision can be considered to rule out malignancy and provide symptom relief.

### Complex cystic breast masses: diagnostic approach and imaging-pathologic correlation [^113gfSz6]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Complex cystic breast masses demonstrate both anechoic (cystic) and echogenic (solid) components at ultrasonography (US). US is used to identify and characterize such masses and to guide percutaneous biopsy. Numerous pathologic entities may produce complex cystic breast lesions or may be associated with them, and biopsy is usually indicated. Common benign findings include fibrocystic changes, intraductal or intracystic papilloma without atypia, and fibroadenoma. Common atypical findings include atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical papilloma, atypical lobular hyperplasia, and lobular carcinoma in situ. Malignant findings include ductal carcinoma in situ, infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and infiltrating lobular carcinoma. If the biopsy approach is tailored to the individual patient and if the imaging features are closely correlated with findings at pathologic analysis, US-guided percutaneous biopsy may be used effectively to diagnose and to guide management of complex cystic masses.

Breast scintigraphy — pre-exam assessment and scheduling — requires that a breast physical examination must be performed by either the nuclear medicine physician or the referring physician, and the time of last menses and pregnancy and lactating status of the patient should be determined with appropriate radiation safety recommendations if proceeding. Breast scintigraphy should be delayed at least 2 wk after a cyst aspiration or fine needle aspiration, and 4–6 wk after a core or excisional biopsy because this procedure can produce false-positive results if performed within 4–6 wk after core or excisional biopsy. Known hypersensitivity to 99mTc-sestamibi should be noted, and the nuclear medicine physician should be aware of physical signs and symptoms and prior surgical procedures or therapy.

a, b Conventional views of digital mammography of the right breast demonstrate a round and hyperdense mass. Ultrasound (c, d) demonstrates a corresponding complex mass with inner vascular flow with color Doppler imaging. e Histology image with the diagnosis of borderline phyllodes tumor (low-grade sarcoma)

Ultrasound findings of phyllodes are variable. Several reviews report that these lesions can have either circumscribed as well as non-circumscribed borders; the most common characteristics are mildly hypoechoic internal echoes, a heterogeneous internal echo pattern, and a posterior acoustic shadow, with the latter presenting frequently in malignant variants. Cole-Beuglet et al. reported an intramural cyst in a phyllodes tumor. They proposed that the diagnosis of phyllodes tumor should be considered if intramural cysts suggest focal necrosis or degeneration within a large, lobulated, solid breast mass.

There is lack of data regarding the assessment of phyllodes using MRI. Several authors focused on identifying signal features that may predict benignity or malignancy. Farria et al. reported that rapid enhancement after gadolinium injection is associated with benign phyllodes tumor; in addition, Kinoshita et al. reported that smooth margins, lobular or polygonal shape, and occasional cystic changes or internal septa are characteristic of benign phyllodes tumor. In Yabuuchi et al.'s study, which evaluated MRI characteristics in relation to phyllodes histologic grade, cystic change with irregular wall, tumor signal intensity higher than normal breast tissue signal intensity on T1-weighted images, tumor signal intensity lower than or equal to normal breast tissue signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and/or low ADC on diffusion-weighted images, were found to be suggestive of histopathologically malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast.

Lesion identification and description

A bMRI lesion is defined as any enhancing structure that cannot be attributed to normal anatomy, including background parenchymal enhancement and complicated cysts or technical artefacts. As > 99% of all diagnostically relevant lesions show pathological enhancement, the first and second subtractions are perfectly suited for the identification of a lesion. Motion artefacts may compromise image assessment and the corresponding non-subtracted pre- and post-cotrast T1w images should always be screened for lesions. False-negative findings at this step are usually associated with a location next to the thoracic wall, in the axillary breast parenchyma, or in the axilla itself. If prior mammography or ultrasound-identified lesions are present, it is important that these be identified as well, using pre-constrast T1w and T2w images, as these lesions may not enhance.

Each lesion description should include:

Size, localisation, and anatomical relationships

The largest diameter of a lesion should be documented as [cm] in the anterior-posterior direction. In more complex lesions, the diameter should be given in the perpendicular planes. For communication and second-look ultrasound, we prefer a clockwise localisation accompanied by the area in which the lesion is located: retroareolar, central gland, or posterior. This includes a specification of whether breast parenchyma extends into the axilla and whether the lesion is inside or outside the breast parenchyma. The latter strongly hints at an intramammary lymph node. In case of suspected breast cancer, it is also crucial to report the minimal distance toward the nipple, the skin, and the thoracic wall and whether these structures are infiltrated, as these determine the surgical approach.

### Contemporary management of phyllodes tumours of the breast: recommendations from the UK Association of Breast Surgery [^1165y3Ft]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Phyllodes are rare tumours, historically referred to as cystosarcoma or cystosarcoma phyllodes, that account for about 0.5% of all breast tumours, most frequently occurring in women in their 40s and 50s. Recent data from National Health Service (NHS) Digital have shown that there are approximately 60 new cases of malignant phyllodes tumours (PT) diagnosed per year in England with an incidence of 2 per 1 000 000 women. PT are biphasic with both stromal and epithelial components and are classified into three groupswith the following proportions: benign, 50–70%; borderline, 12–26%; and malignant, 20–30%. Group stratification is important to guide clinical management and inform prognosis and recurrence risk.

Internationally, there is a considerable variation in the management of PT with a tendency for overtreatment of benign lesions, especially in regional hospitals and with clinicians less experienced in the condition. Similarly, within the UK, clinical practice varies widely, and this is also observed in other parts of Europe. A recent analysis of data from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) in England showed that patients with breast sarcomas, including malignant PT, were more likely to have a preoperative biopsy and less likely to require multiple operations if managed at a centre with specialist sarcoma services compared with non-specialist centres.

Cystic conditions are the most common disorder of the breast. Simple cysts are not malignant and do not require intervention. Patients with symptomatic simple cysts can undergo elective aspiration, and typical cyst fluid can be discarded. Bloody fluid should be sent for cytology. Cysts with thick walls, thick septations, or solid components have a risk of malignancy and should undergo biopsy.

### Mimickers of breast malignancy: imaging findings, pathologic concordance and clinical management [^112us6NA]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Many benign breast entities have a clinical and imaging presentation that can mimic breast cancer. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the wide spectrum of imaging features that can be associated with benign breast diseases with an emphasis on the suspicious imaging findings associated with these benign conditions that can mimic cancer. As radiologic-pathologic correlation can be particularly challenging in these cases, the radiologist's familiarity with these benign entities and their imaging features is essential to ensure that a benign pathology result is accepted as concordant when appropriate and that a suitable management plan is formulated.

### Don't routinely drain non-painful fluid-filled breast cysts.… [^113kFUUv]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Breast cysts are common. They are harmless fluid filled sacs. If an ultrasound confirms that a breast mass is a simple cyst, it does not need to be drained unless it is bothersome to the patient or if there are concerns it could be something other than a cyst or has complex characteristics.

5.7 Ovarian Cysts

Because the contraceptive effect of Mirena is mainly due to its local effects within the uterus, ovulatory cycles with follicular rupture usually occur in women of fertile age using Mirena. Ovarian cysts have been reported in approximately 8% of women using Mirena. Most cysts are asymptomatic, although some may be accompanied by pelvic pain or dyspareunia.

In most cases the ovarian cysts disappear spontaneously during two to three months observation. Evaluate persistent ovarian cysts. Surgical intervention is not usually required.

5.8 Bleeding Pattern Alterations

Mirena can alter the bleeding pattern and result in spotting, irregular bleeding, heavy bleeding, oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea. During the first 3–6 months of Mirena use, the number of bleeding and spotting days may be higher and bleeding patterns may be irregular. Thereafter the number of bleeding and spotting days usually decreases but bleeding may remain irregular. If bleeding irregularities develop during prolonged treatment, appropriate diagnostic measures should be taken to rule out endometrial pathology.

Amenorrhea develops in approximately 20% of Mirena users by one year.

If a significant change in bleeding develops during prolonged use, take appropriate diagnostic measures to rule out endometrial pathology. Consider the possibility of pregnancy if menstruation does not occur within six weeks of the onset of previous menstruation. Once pregnancy has been excluded, repeated pregnancy tests are generally not necessary in amenorrheic women unless indicated, for example, by other signs of pregnancy or by pelvic pain [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

In most women with heavy menstrual bleeding, the number of bleeding and spotting days may also increase during the initial months of therapy but usually decrease with continued use; the volume of blood loss per cycle progressively becomes reduced [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

5.9 Breast Cancer

Women who currently have or have had breast cancer, or have a suspicion of breast cancer, should not use hormonal contraception, including Mirena, because some breast cancers are hormone-sensitive [see Contraindications (4)].

Spontaneous reports of breast cancer have been received during postmarketing experience with Mirena. Observational studies of the risk of breast cancer with use of a LNG-releasing IUS do not provide conclusive evidence of increased risk.

### Imaging characteristics of malignant lesions of the male breast [^114F5cMo]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

Most men referred for breast imaging have palpable lumps, breast enlargement, or tenderness. Most of the evaluated lesions are benign. Male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of total male breast lesions. Differentiation between benign and malignant masses is critical because it alleviates patient anxiety and allows unnecessary procedures to be avoided. Clinically suspicious lesions referred for imaging should first be evaluated with mammography. In patients with questionable findings at mammography and for lesions that are difficult to image with mammography, ultrasonography (US) is often useful for further characterization. A discrete mass at mammography or US is suspicious for malignancy. The relationship of the mass to the nipple should be carefully assessed; an eccentric location is highly suspicious for cancer. Secondary signs occur earlier in male patients because of smaller breast size. Such signs include nipple retraction, skin ulceration or thickening, increased breast trabeculation, and axillary adenopathy. US of the axillary region is helpful for staging. At pathologic analysis, cystic lesions commonly demonstrate malignant findings; therefore, all cysts and complex masses should be worked up as potentially malignant lesions. Benign conditions that may mimic male breast cancer include gynecomastia, lipoma, epidermal inclusion cyst, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia, and intraductal papilloma.

### Laparoscopy in the diagnosis and management of a complicated paraovarian cyst [^1118gbvZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Paraovarian cysts account for 10% of adnexal masses and are most common in the 3rd and 4th decades of life. They vary from small asymptomatic lesions to larger cysts, which may undergo hemorrhage or torsion. Children are rarely affected, and the diagnosis — particularly if pain presents in the right lower quadrant — may be difficult because the differentials diagnosis is wide. We report the case of a child who presented with a complicated paraovarian cyst. Laparoscopy enabled immediate diagnosis and appropriate management. We discuss the role of laparoscopy and the value of the Harmonic Scalpel in the management of these rare cysts.

### Challenges in the management of breast conditions during lactation [^115dFuzt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The lactating breast can develop a wide range of conditions that require surgical management, from abscess drainage to the evaluation of nipple-areolar complex (NAC) lesions. In addition, both benign and malignant masses can present in the lactating population. Patients should undergo routine diagnostic workup including core needle biopsy if indicated. Ultrasound, mammogram, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast are safe in lactation and do not require interruption of breastfeeding.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on percutaneous catheter drainage of infected fluid collections [^111KFP6Z]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Abnormal fluid collections occur throughout the body and represent a wide range of pathologies, including abscesses, pseudocysts, cysts, lymphoceles, seromas, bilomas, hematomas, urinomas, and infected neoplasms. Appropriate management often depends on clinical presentation, location, type of collection, early response to treatment, and the presence of complicating factors such as fistulas, septations, and increased viscosity. Physicians should carefully review clinical and imaging findings and make evidence-based recommendations for the best treatment, which may include antibiotics, needle aspiration, percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage, or surgical drainage. This paper addresses percutaneous catheter drainage and alternative treatment options for the management of fluid collections and is the result of evidence-based consensus by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology.

### Image-guided breast biopsy and localisation: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^115BXjx3]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

US-guided fine-needle aspiration is widely accepted for draining complicated cysts (e.g. cysts with internal debris), seromas or haematomas, for therapeutic purposes for pain relief from swelling cysts, or in the case of therapy of lactational and non - lactational breast abscesses, as an effective alternative to surgery. In particular, lactational abscesses can be managed by US-guided percutaneous treatment, avoiding surgery even for abscesses greater than 5 cm and allowing continued breastfeeding. In the case of complex cysts (thick-walled cystic lesions with or without thick internal septations, intracystic solid masses, and mixed cystic/solid lesions), CNB is preferred.

Core needle biopsy

Ultrasound guidance is the most commonly used approach for CNB. After local anaesthesia is administered through subcutaneous injections of drugs similar to those used by dentists (e.g. lidocaine), a needle with a size usually varying from 16 to 12 gauge (most commonly 14 gauge), is inserted by the radiologist, often through a small skin incision. Once the needle is confirmed to be on target, a tissue sample (core) is obtained with a needle of variable length (from about 10 to over 20 mm), depending on the used device, and immediately fixed in small formalin containing jars. Since a lesion may be pushed ahead while shooting, the longer samples obtained from longer acquisition chambers are usually preferred. Biopsy devices utilise a spring-loaded needle (or "gun") that are semiautomatically or automatically fired into the lesion. This fire is accompanied by a noise and the patient should be informed of this to avoid movements during the biopsy. A variable number of cores (usually 3–5) are obtained through subsequent samples and needle extractions. Images are acquired to document the correct needle positioning. CNB yields material that can be histologically evaluated; it allows a high rate of adequate sampling and a low false-negative rate; in addition, it allows obtaining biological markers necessary for treatment planning. In the case of US-guided 14-gauge CNB, the false-negative rate has been reported to range from 1.2 to 3.3% (mean 2%).

### The validity of complex breast cysts after surgery… [^113qGwJ3]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract 1519 Objective: Breast cysts are the most common cause of benign breast masses. Simple breast cysts do not need further evaluation, but complex breast cysts require additional assessment due to the potential presence of malignancy. However these complex cysts have rarely been examined and quantified according the associated cancer detection rate. Our study is the first investigation that evaluates the malignancy rate of complex breast cysts identified by histo-pathological results. Material and Methods: Imaging findings of complex cysts were correlated retrospectively with clinical and pathologic outcomes. Results: 150 complex breast cysts were found in 132 women. We detected a high malignancy rate of 14%. Sonographic criteria of a complex cyst such as thick cyst wall, lobulation or hyperechogenicity were predictive of neoplasm. Two or more criteria combined were associated with a 13. 6
- fold higher risk of malignancy.

Menopause status, family history or personal history of breast cancer did not influence the detection rate of neoplasm. Conclusion: Based on our results we raise the issue for the need of surgical intervention, compared to observation by ultrasound of complex breast cysts to prevent a missed or delayed diagnosis of breast cancer.

### Image-guided biopsy of breast lesions-when to use what biopsy technique [^114gX7bA]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Under ultrasound, various biopsy techniques are viable. Choice of method is, in essence, a balance between expected diagnostic accuracy, costs, and potential complications. Larger needles are, in general, more costly, with slightly more complications but higher diagnostic accuracy. Choosing a bigger needle is therefore appropriate in situations where the likelihood that a smaller needle might lead to failure of obtaining an accurate diagnosis is present. FNA is generally discouraged for breast interventional procedures, except for drainage of abscesses or symptomatic cysts. FNA requires extensive experience from both interventionalists and pathologists, and even then, the diagnostic accuracy is surpassed by histological biopsy techniques. CNB is the most important biopsy method under ultrasound due to the fact that most breast lesions appear as a mass that can be accurately targeted using real-time imaging. It should be noted that the 5 mm cut-off is somewhat arbitrary and should be regarded as an aid, rather than a hard threshold.
