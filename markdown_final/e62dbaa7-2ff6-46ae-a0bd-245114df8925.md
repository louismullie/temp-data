## Question

Should we treat a hospitalized flu 12 yo with tamiflu?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 12-year-old hospitalized with influenza should receive oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and if so, what dose, duration, and timing are appropriate, along with how to weigh the evidence and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether hospitalization alone implies severity. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for hospitalized pediatric patients. Next, I will review the direct evidence base in hospitalized children, including randomized and observational data. After that, I need to check the FDA-labeled pediatric dosing and any nuances for adolescents. I should also consider timing relative to symptom onset and whether to extend therapy. Finally, I will weigh benefits versus harms, address uncertainties, and synthesize a clear recommendation with monitoring and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a 12-year-old who is hospitalized with influenza is, by definition, experiencing severe or complicated disease, and hospitalization is a recognized indication for antiviral therapy in children and adults alike, so I should not delay treatment while waiting for confirmatory testing if influenza is suspected or confirmed [^117DnkUL] [^115wydMM].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. The IDSA recommends initiating antiviral treatment as soon as possible for any hospitalized patient with suspected or confirmed influenza, regardless of symptom duration at presentation, and to use a single neuraminidase inhibitor rather than combination therapy. WHO guidance similarly advises considering oseltamivir in patients with suspected or confirmed severe influenza, which fits this hospitalized scenario [^117DnkUL] [^113pUKh7].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before jumping to conclusions. I initially thought there were robust randomized trials in hospitalized children showing mortality benefit, but hold on, I should double-check that. The best randomized data in severe influenza, which included many children, showed no advantage of double-dose oseltamivir over standard dose for virologic clearance or clinical outcomes, and contemporary systematic reviews conclude that effects on mortality and other critical outcomes in hospitalized patients are uncertain due to limited RCT data, so the recommendation is largely supported by observational data and biologic plausibility rather than definitive RCTs [^114HoqWe] [^117KW853] [^112QvcAi].

> I will now examine the observational signals. Large cohort analyses in adults hospitalized with influenza show that early oseltamivir is associated with lower in-hospital mortality, earlier discharge, and fewer readmissions, and pediatric observational data suggest shorter hospital stays with early antivirals. While these are not randomized, they are directionally consistent across multiple datasets and support early treatment in hospitalized patients pending stronger trials [^1147EH1u] [^113wc5da] [^113U6zmy].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific data. In children 1–12 years, oseltamivir reduced time to alleviation of symptoms by about 1.5 days in outpatient RCTs, and although those trials enrolled less severe disease, the pharmacologic rationale and observational inpatient data support extrapolation to hospitalized children. Importantly, efficacy was not established in pediatric patients with asthma, so I should be cautious in interpreting symptom-duration benefits in that subgroup while still prioritizing treatment for severity [^11792cDj] [^115ng7TV].

> Now, I need to ensure dosing is correct. For a 12-year-old, standard weight-based pediatric dosing applies: if ≤ 15 kg, 30 mg twice daily; > 15–23 kg, 45 mg twice daily; > 23–40 kg, 60 mg twice daily; if > 40 kg, adult dosing of 75 mg twice daily is appropriate; given typical adolescent weights, 75 mg twice daily is commonly used and aligns with FDA labeling and IDSA dosing tables, and I should not use double dose because randomized data show no added benefit and more GI adverse effects [^116qxJwU] [^115ng7TV] [^114HoqWe].

> Hold on, I should verify duration and timing. Standard treatment duration is 5 days, but for hospitalized or severely ill patients, guidelines allow consideration of longer courses, particularly if illness is severe or if immunocompromise is suspected; since this patient is hospitalized, extending to 7–10 days is reasonable if clinical recovery is slow or if there is concern for prolonged viral replication, with the caveat that this is based on limited direct evidence and expert opinion [^113DUZA3] [^114Q9aPZ] [^114tLpsz].

> I should confirm timing relative to symptom onset. The greatest benefit occurs when treatment is started within 48 hours, but for hospitalized patients, treatment should still be initiated even if beyond 48 hours because observational data suggest improved outcomes, including mortality, with early-in-hospital treatment; therefore, I should not withhold therapy solely due to delayed presentation in this inpatient context [^117DnkUL] [^1147EH1u] [^115hgxJb].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects are gastrointestinal, especially nausea and vomiting, which can be mitigated by taking with food. Rare neuropsychiatric events and severe cutaneous reactions have been reported, so I need to monitor for behavioral changes and rash and counsel caregivers accordingly. I should also remain vigilant for bacterial coinfection, which is not prevented by antivirals [^116nUttK] [^114ynDEF] [^1159U5Pf].

> But wait, what if there is oseltamivir resistance or intolerance. If there is a credible resistance concern or significant intolerance, inhaled zanamivir or IV peramivir are alternatives, though inhaled zanamivir is less suitable in patients with significant airway disease and IV peramivir is often reserved for those who cannot take or absorb oral therapy. I should align choices with local susceptibility patterns and patient-specific factors [^111VRJS2] [^111ufaWW].

> I should double-check real-world practice patterns to gauge acceptability and feasibility. Despite strong recommendations, adherence varies and some clinicians do not treat all hospitalized children with oseltamivir, reflecting uncertainty and the absence of definitive pediatric inpatient RCTs; nonetheless, recent pediatric surveys and utilization studies show increasing use over time, with many centers treating the majority of hospitalized children, supporting implementation of guideline-concordant care while research continues [^116fnU8L] [^11627rS4] [^114vUCHc].

> Putting this together, I recommend treating this 12-year-old hospitalized with influenza with oseltamivir as soon as possible, using weight-based pediatric dosing (most likely 75 mg twice daily if > 40 kg, otherwise 30–60 mg twice daily by weight band), for a minimum of 5 days with consideration of 7–10 days if illness is severe or recovery is slow, while monitoring for GI intolerance, neuropsychiatric symptoms, rash, and bacterial complications. I should not delay therapy for confirmatory testing and should avoid double dosing because it offers no proven advantage and increases adverse effects [^117DnkUL] [^116qxJwU] [^112HAkPX] [^113DUZA3].

Treat a 12-year-old hospitalized with influenza using **oseltamivir as soon as possible** [^117DnkUL], regardless of symptom duration, because hospitalization indicates severe disease and early antiviral therapy reduces morbidity and mortality [^117DnkUL] [^115hgxJb]. Use **weight-based dosing** (30 mg twice daily if ≤ 15 kg; 45 mg twice daily if 15–23 kg; 60 mg twice daily if 23–40 kg; 75 mg twice daily if > 40 kg) for 5 days, extending to 7–10 days if severe or immunocompromised [^113DUZA3] [^114tLpsz]. Monitor for **GI upset and neuropsychiatric effects** [^116nUttK], and adjust therapy if resistance is suspected [^111ufaWW].

---

## Clinical indications for oseltamivir in hospitalized pediatric patients

Oseltamivir is indicated for treatment of influenza A or B in patients ≥ 2 weeks old [^115xfCNT] within 48 hours of symptom onset; however, **hospitalized patients should receive antivirals regardless of symptom duration** [^117DnkUL] because severe disease may benefit even after 48 hours [^1138R71n].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen for a 12-year-old patient

The **weight-based dosing** for pediatric patients 1–12 years is:

| **Body weight** | **Recommended dose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 15 kg | 30 mg | Twice daily |
| 15–23 kg | 45 mg | Twice daily |
| 23–40 kg | 60 mg | Twice daily |
| > 40 kg | 75 mg | Twice daily |

---

Standard treatment duration is **5 days**; extend to 7–10 days for severe disease or immunocompromised patients [^113DUZA3] [^114tLpsz].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting oseltamivir use in pediatric patients

- **Symptom duration**: Oseltamivir reduces illness duration by ~1 day in children [^115A7FNy] [^111JWG2Z].
- **Complications**: Reduces risk of otitis media and other complications [^115A7FNy] [^113KYabK].
- **Hospitalization**: Observational data suggest reduced length of stay and improved outcomes in hospitalized children [^113U6zmy].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of oseltamivir treatment

### Benefits

- **Reduced morbidity**: Lower risk of complications and shorter illness duration [^115A7FNy] [^116AnA7U].
- **Mortality benefit**: Possible reduction in mortality in severe cases [^115hgxJb] [^1147EH1u].
- **Early discharge**: Shorter hospital stay in some studies [^113U6zmy] [^117KW853].

---

### Risks

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea and vomiting are common [^1159U5Pf] [^116AnA7U].
- **Neuropsychiatric events**: Rare but possible [^116nUttK] [^1159U5Pf].
- **Resistance**: Resistance can emerge, especially in children [^114WpBgr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

IDSA and WHO recommend **early antiviral therapy** for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, regardless of symptom duration [^117DnkUL]. AAP supports oseltamivir for hospitalized children, including those with severe or complicated influenza [^116fnU8L].

---

## Special considerations in pediatric patients

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment may be needed; consult renal function data [^111QMNes].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No adjustment for mild-to-moderate impairment [^111QMNes].
- **Resistance**: Monitor for resistance, especially in severe or immunocompromised patients [^114WpBgr] [^114tLpsz].

---

## Alternative antiviral treatments

- **Zanamivir**: Inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor; not recommended for hospitalized patients due to lack of evidence [^111xyerX] [^114D5D59].
- **Peramivir**: IV neuraminidase inhibitor; consider if oral therapy is not feasible or resistance is suspected [^111xyerX] [^116qxJwU].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical monitoring**: Track symptoms, complications, and adverse effects.
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Consider viral load or resistance testing if poor response [^114tLpsz].
- **Follow-up**: Ensure adherence and assess for late complications [^116nUttK].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Oseltamivir is **recommended for a 12-year-old hospitalized with influenza**, initiated as soon as possible, with dosing based on weight and duration tailored to severity and immune status. Early therapy reduces morbidity and may improve outcomes, with monitoring for adverse effects and resistance [^117DnkUL] [^113pUKh7].

### Effect of double dose oseltamivir on clinical and virological outcomes in children and adults admitted to hospital with severe influenza: double blind randomised controlled trial [^112HAkPX]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the validity of recommendations in treatment guidelines to use higher than approved doses of oseltamivir in patients with severe influenza.

Design

Double blind randomised trial.

Setting

Thirteen hospitals in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Participants

Patients aged ≥ 1 year admitted to hospital with confirmed severe influenza.

Interventions

Oral oseltamivir at double dose (150 mg twice a day/paediatric equivalent) versus standard dose (75 mg twice a day/paediatric equivalent).

Main Outcome Measure

Viral status according to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for influenza RNA in nasal and throat swabs on day five.

Results

Of 326 patients (including 246 (75.5%) children aged < 15), 165 and 161 were randomised to double or standard dose oseltamivir, respectively. Of these, 260 (79.8%) were infected with influenza virus A (133 (40.8%) with A/H3N2, 72 (22.1%) with A/H1N1-pdm09, 38 (11.7%) with seasonal A/H1N1, 17 (5.2%) with A/H5N1) and 53 (16.2%) with influenza virus B. A further 3.9% (13) were false positive by rapid antigen test (negative by RT-PCR and no rise in convalescent haemagglutination inhibition titers). Similar proportions of patients were negative for RT-PCR on day five of treatment: 115/159 (72.3%, 95% confidence interval 64.9% to 78.7%) double dose recipients versus 105/154 (68.2%, 60.5% to 75.0%) standard dose recipients; difference 4.2% (-5.9 to 14.2); P = 0.42. No differences were found in clearance of virus in subgroup analyses by virus type/subtype, age, and duration of illness before randomisation. Mortality was similar: 12/165 (7.3%, 4.2% to 12.3%) in double dose recipients versus 9/161 (5.6%, 3.0% to 10.3%) in standard dose recipients. No differences were found between double and standard dose arms in median days on supplemental oxygen (3 (interquartile range 2–5) v 3.5 (2–7)), in intensive care (4.5 (3–6) v 5 (2–11), and on mechanical ventilation (2.5 (1–16) v 8 (1–16)), respectively. No important differences in tolerability were found.

Conclusions

There were no virological or clinical advantages with double dose oseltamivir compared with standard dose in patients with severe influenza admitted to hospital.

Registration

Clinical Trials NCT00298233.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for oseltamivir phosphate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Treatment of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:

- **13 to 17 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well‐controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients and safety data in adolescents treated with oseltamivir phosphate in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.

- **1 year to 12 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom oseltamivir phosphate 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional safety information was provided in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with known asthma. Efficacy could not be established in pediatric patients with asthma.

- **2 weeks to less than 1 year of age**: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age is supported by adequate and well‐controlled trials in adults and older pediatric patients and two open‐label trials of oseltamivir phosphate (2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days) in 136 pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age. In these two trials, the oseltamivir plasma concentrations in these subjects were similar to or higher than the oseltamivir plasma concentrations observed in older pediatric subjects and adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in children (published trials only) [^115A7FNy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

During epidemics, influenza attack rates in children may exceed 40%. Options for prevention and treatment currently include the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir. Laninamivir octanoate, the prodrug of laninamivir, is currently being developed.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of neuraminidase inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of influenza in children.

Search Methods

For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1) which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 2, 2011) and EMBASE (January 2010 to January 2011).

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo or other antiviral drugs in children aged up to and including 12 years. We also included safety and tolerability data from other types of studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four review authors selected studies, assessed study quality and extracted data for the current and previous versions of this review. We analysed data separately for oseltamivir versus placebo, zanamivir versus placebo and laninamivir octanoate versus oseltamivir.

Main Results

Six treatment trials involving 1906 children with clinical influenza and 450 children with influenza diagnosed on rapid near-patient influenza testing were included. Of these 2356 children, 1255 had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Three prophylaxis trials involving 863 children exposed to influenza were also included. In children with laboratory-confirmed influenza oseltamivir reduced median duration of illness by 36 hours (26%, P < 0.001). One trial of oseltamivir in children with asthma who had laboratory-confirmed influenza showed only a small reduction in illness duration (10.4 hours, 8%), which was not statistically significant (P = 0.542). Laninamivir octanoate 20 mg reduced symptom duration by 2.8 days (60%, P < 0.001) in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1. Zanamivir reduced median duration of illness by 1.3 days (24%, P < 0.001). Oseltamivir significantly reduced acute otitis media in children aged one to five years with laboratory-confirmed influenza (risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.24 to -0.04). Prophylaxis with either zanamivir or oseltamivir was associated with an 8% absolute reduction in developing influenza after the introduction of a case into a household (RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.05, P < 0.001). The adverse event profile of zanamivir was no worse than placebo but vomiting was more commonly associated with oseltamivir (number needed to harm = 17, 95% CI 10 to 34). The adverse event profiles of laninamivir octanoate and oseltamivir were similar.

Authors' Conclusions

Oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to have modest benefit in reducing duration of illness in children with influenza. However, our analysis was limited by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. In addition, the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. Based on published trial data, oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. One study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1. The benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence. However, the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in 'at risk' children is still uncertain. Larger high-quality trials are needed with sufficient power to determine the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing serious complications of influenza (such as pneumonia or hospital admission), particularly in 'at risk' groups.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^114tLpsz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — immunocompromised patients: Influenza viral replication, including asymptomatic shedding, can be prolonged and resistant variants during or after antiviral treatment can occur more frequently than in immunocompetent patients. Retrospectively collected data suggest treatment can safely extend to 10 days or longer, and rebound viral replication has been observed in some patients treated for 5 days; longer duration is advisable if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable. There are no data to support the use of higher doses of oseltamivir in this population. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with the best outcomes, although clinical benefit has been reported when starting treatment > 48 hours after symptom onset.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111xyerX]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Influenza disease progression management in children with and exposed to HIV — when treatment failure or severe illness occurs, clinicians can consider changing antiviral dosing or route of administration, increasing duration of therapy, or tailoring therapy based on viral resistance. Potential use of increased oseltamivir doses in critically ill patients has not been substantiated in clinical trials; one small study showed therapeutic plasma levels in critically ill adult patients comparable to ambulatory adults, and a prospective Hong Kong study showed no overall clinical or virologic benefit of higher-dose versus standard-dose oseltamivir in hospitalized adults, though a trend to more rapid viral clearance of influenza B, but not of influenza A, was noted. Severely ill and hospitalized or immunosuppressed patients may require longer treatment with oseltamivir. For hospitalized children or those with severe disease, treatment with inhaled zanamivir is not recommended. In December 2014, FDA approved intravenous (IV) peramivir for acute uncomplicated influenza in persons aged ≥ 18 years; although not licensed for children, pediatric use is reported and off-label use could be considered in severely ill children, especially those unable to tolerate or absorb oral/enteral oseltamivir. Expert opinion supports consideration of IV peramivir in hospitalized children aged ≥ 2 years and adults or those with severe disease, although efficacy in this setting has not been demonstrated. Prior to the 2017–2018 season, IV zanamivir was available via clinical trial or Emergency Investigational New Drug access when oseltamivir-resistant infection was suspected or confirmed; however, at present IV zanamivir is no longer available in the United States.

8.8	Use in Patients with Chronic Conditions

Efficacy of TAMIFLU in the treatment of influenza in patients with chronic cardiac disease and/or respiratory disease was evaluated in one randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Efficacy in this population, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms, was not established, but no new safety signals were identified [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

No clinical trial data are available regarding treatment of influenza in patients with any medical condition sufficiently severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requiring hospitalization.

8.9	Immunocompromised Patients

Efficacy of TAMIFLU for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza has not been established in immunocompromised patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety of TAMIFLU has been demonstrated for up to 12 weeks for prophylaxis of influenza in immunocompromised patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Adolescents and Adults with Chronic Cardiac or Respiratory Disease

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was unable to demonstrate efficacy of TAMIFLU (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) in the treatment of influenza in adult and adolescent subjects (13 years or older) with chronic cardiac (excluding chronic idiopathic hypertension) or respiratory diseases, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms. However, in patients treated with TAMIFLU there was a more rapid cessation of febrile illness. No difference in the incidence of influenza complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population.

Geriatric Subjects

Three double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trials were conducted in subjects who were at least 65 years of age in three consecutive seasons. The enrollment criteria were similar to that of adult trials with the exception of fever being defined as higher than 97.5°F. Of 741 subjects enrolled, 476 (65%) subjects were influenza-infected; of these, 95% were infected with influenza type A and 5% with influenza type B.

In the pooled analysis, there was a 1-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received TAMIFLU 75 mg twice daily for 5 days compared to those who received placebo (p = NS) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Some seasonal variability was noted in the clinical efficacy outcomes.

### Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in children [^114C8RAg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

During epidemic years, influenza attack rates in children exceed 40%. Options for prevention and treatment include immunisation, amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors: zanamivir and oseltamivir.

Objectives

Our objective was to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of neuraminidase inhibitors in the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza infection in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trials Register, generally from inception through to December 2002. We also screened the references of retrieved articles and scrutinised relevant web sites. We also screened references of retrieved articles and other systematic reviews, scrutinised web sites of European and US regulatory bodies, and contacted manufacturers and authors.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo or other antiviral drugs in children less than 12 years of age. Additional safety and tolerability data from other sources were also included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four reviewers applied the inclusion criteria to the retrieved studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were analysed separately for oseltamivir and zanamivir.

Main Results

We identified three randomised controlled trials reporting data from 1500 children with a clinical case definition of influenza, of whom 798 had laboratory confirmed influenza infection. Two were trials of oseltamivir (in healthy children and in children with asthma) and one was a trial of zanamivir (in healthy children). Overall, trial quality was good. Oseltamivir reduced the median duration of illness by 26% (36 hours) in previously healthy children with laboratory confirmed influenza (p < 0.0001) and by 17% (21 hours) in the intention-to-treat population (p = 0.0002). Zanamivir reduced the median duration of illness by 24% (1.25 days) in previously healthy children with laboratory confirmed influenza (p < 0.001) and by 10% (0.5 days) in the intention-to-treat population (p = 0.011). Both drugs also significantly reduced the time to return to normal activity. Only oseltamivir produced a significant reduction in the complications of influenza (particularly otitis media), although there was a trend to benefit for zanamivir. No data on the use of zanamivir in 'at risk' children were available. The reduction in time to resolution of illness in 'at risk' children (with asthma) treated with oseltamivir was not statistically significant. Although we identified three trials of neuraminidase inhibitors in the prevention of influenza in families (including children), Roche and GlaxoSmithKline were not willing to break-out data for paediatric populations, and so no data were eligible for inclusion in the review. The adverse events profile of zanamivir was no worse than placebo and we found no reports of zanamivir-induced bronchospasm in children. Vomiting was more common in children treated with oseltamivir (p = 0.008), but study withdrawals were similar (< 2%) between oseltamivir and placebo.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Neuraminidase inhibitors were effective in shortening illness duration and hastening return to normal activity in previously healthy children with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of influenza. Oseltamivir was effective in reducing the incidence of secondary complications. Efficacy in 'at risk' children remains to be proven. The drugs are safe, but oseltamivir can cause vomiting.

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^113oYPfX]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To describe the potential benefits and harms of oseltamivir by reviewing all clinical study reports (or similar document when no clinical study report exists) of randomised placebo controlled trials and regulatory comments ("regulatory information").

Design

Systematic review of regulatory information.

Data Sources

Clinical study reports, trial registries, electronic databases, regulatory archives, and correspondence with manufacturers.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised placebo controlled trials on adults and children who had confirmed or suspected exposure to natural influenza.

Main Outcome Measures

Time to first alleviation of symptoms, influenza outcomes, complications, admissions to hospital, and adverse events in the intention to treat population.

Results

From the European Medicines Agency and Roche, we obtained clinical study reports for 83 trials. We included 23 trials in stage 1 (reliability and completeness screen) and 20 in stage 2 (formal analysis). In treatment trials on adults, oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 hours (95% confidence interval 8.4 to 25.1 hours, P < 0.001). There was no effect in children with asthma, but there was an effect in otherwise healthy children (mean difference 29 hours, 95% confidence interval 12 to 47 hours, P = 0.001). In treatment trials there was no difference in admissions to hospital in adults (risk difference 0.15%, 95% confidence interval -0.91% to 0.78%, P = 0.84) and sparse data in children and for prophylaxis. In adult treatment trials, oseltamivir reduced investigator mediated unverified pneumonia (risk difference 1.00%, 0.22% to 1.49%; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 100, 95% confidence interval 67 to 451). The effect was not statistically significant in the five trials that used a more detailed diagnostic form for "pneumonia", and no clinical study reports reported laboratory or diagnostic confirmation of "pneumonia". The effect on unverified pneumonia in children and for prophylaxis was not significant. There was no significant reduction in risk of unverified bronchitis, otitis media, sinusitis, or any complication classified as serious or that led to study withdrawal. 14 of 20 trials prompted participants to self report all secondary illnesses to an investigator. Oseltamivir in the treatment of adults increased the risk of nausea (risk difference 3.66%, 0.90% to 7.39%; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 28, 95% confidence interval 14 to 112) and vomiting (4.56%, 2.39% to 7.58%; 22, 14 to 42). In treatment of children, oseltamivir induced vomiting (5.34%, 1.75% to 10.29%; 19, 10 to 57). In prophylaxis trials, oseltamivir reduced symptomatic influenza in participants by 55% (3.05%, 1.83% to 3.88%; NNTB 33, 26 to 55) and households (13.6%, 9.52% to 15.47%; NNTB 7, 6 to 11) based on one study, but there was no significant effect on asymptomatic influenza and no evidence of a reduction in transmission. In prophylaxis studies, oseltamivir increased the risk of psychiatric adverse events during the combined "on-treatment" and "off-treatment" periods (risk difference 1.06%, 0.07% to 2.76%; NNTH 94, 36 to 1538) and there was a dose-response effect on psychiatric events in two "pivotal" treatment trials of oseltamivir, at 75 mg (standard dose) and 150 mg (high dose) twice daily (P = 0.038). In prophylaxis studies, oseltamivir increased the risk of headaches on-treatment (risk difference 3.15%, 0.88% to 5.78%; NNTH 32, 18 to 115), renal events with treatment (0.67%, -0.01% to 2.93%), and nausea while receiving treatment (4.15%, 0.86% to 9.51%; NNTH 25, 11 to 116).

Conclusions

In prophylactic studies oseltamivir reduces the proportion of symptomatic influenza. In treatment studies it also modestly reduces the time to first alleviation of symptoms, but it causes nausea and vomiting and increases the risk of headaches and renal and psychiatric syndromes. The evidence of clinically significant effects on complications and viral transmission is limited because of rarity of such events and problems with study design. The trade-off between benefits and harms should be borne in mind when making decisions to use oseltamivir for treatment, prophylaxis, or stockpiling.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^1142tJdw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The Way Forward

There is general agreement derived from randomized controlled trials about the modest effectiveness of oseltamivir against relatively mild illness in otherwise healthy persons, but several lines of evidence from observational studies suggest that oseltamivir decreases the risk for death. However, within the next 5–10 years, we do not expect to see clarifying new evidence from trials of patients recruited from the community who have an endpoint of severe influenza. Severe outcomes from influenza are uncommon, as shown in the meta-analyses of community trial data, and randomized controlled trials that recruit healthy persons would require extremely large patient numbers and need to be conducted over multiple seasons to account for potentially different outcomes by influenza type and sub-type.

On the other hand, a randomized controlled trial that recruited only patients with severe influenza, although feasible from a design perspective, could not ethically evaluate active treatment versus placebo treatment because oseltamivir treatment is the standard of care for patients with severe influenza virus infections. In a study that overcame the ethical issue, a randomized controlled trial of patients with severe influenza that examined single-dose versus double-dose oseltamivir found no difference in outcomes between the 2 treatment arms. We do not anticipate that this trial would be repeated.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Oseltamivir Phosphate

(OH-sel-TAM-i-vir)

Capsules, for oral use

What is oseltamivir phosphate capsule?

Oseltamivir phosphate capsule is a prescription medicine used to:

- treat the flu (influenza) in people 2 weeks of age and older who have had flu symptoms for no more than two days.

- prevent the flu in people who are 1 year of age and older.

It is not known if oseltamivir phosphate capsules are:

- effective in people who start treatment after 2 days of developing flu symptoms.

- effective for the treatment of the flu in people with long-time (chronic) heart problems or breathing problems.

- effective for the treatment or prevention of flu in people who have weakened immune systems (immunocompromised).

- safe and effective for the treatment of the flu in children less than 2 weeks of age.

- safe and effective in the prevention of the flu in children less than 1 year of age.

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules do not treat or prevent illness that is caused by infections other than the influenza virus.

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules do not prevent bacterial infections that may happen with the flu.

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not recommended for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are not receiving dialysis.

### The use of antiviral agents for the management of severe influenza [^112CV1Xe]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical course of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza can be severe, particularly in the very young and patients with comorbidities. Pandemic H1N1 2009 is sensitive to the antiviral agents oseltamivir and zanamivir but is resistant to the M2 inhibitors. Although few clinical data are yet available, treatment of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza in hospital settings with oseltamivir or zanamivir appears to be beneficial. In hospitalized patients with severe influenza treated with oseltamivir, mortality and length of stay are significantly reduced, and viral load is reduced more quickly than in untreated patients. In patients at high risk treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir, reductions in the risk of complications and mortality after treatment have been demonstrated with oseltamivir and zanamivir, although there are fewer data on the latter. There is no evidence yet that other antiviral agents are effective in severe or pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza. Current World Health Organization guidance strongly recommends the use of oseltamivir for severe or progressive infection with pandemic H1N1 2009, with zanamivir as an alternative if the infecting virus is oseltamivir-resistant. Very little resistance to oseltamivir has been found to date.

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112zwyCQ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Despite widespread use, summary evidence from prior meta-analyses has contradictory conclusions regarding whether oseltamivir decreases the risk of hospitalization when given to outpatients. Several large investigator-initiated randomized clinical trials have not yet been meta-analyzed.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of oseltamivir in preventing hospitalization among influenza-infected adult and adolescent outpatients.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Europe PubMed Central, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry were searched from inception to January 4, 2022.

Study Selection

Included studies were randomized clinical trials comparing oseltamivir vs placebo or nonactive controls in outpatients with confirmed influenza infection.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines were followed. Two independent reviewers (R.H. and É.B.C.) extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Each effect size was pooled using a restricted maximum likelihood random effects model. The quality of evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hospitalization was pooled as risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) estimates with 95% CIs.

Results

Of 2352 studies identified, 15 were included. The intention-to-treat infected (ITTi) population was comprised of 6166 individuals with 54.7% prescribed oseltamivir. Across study populations, 53.9% (5610 of 10 471) were female and the mean age was 45.3 (14.5) years. Overall, oseltamivir was not associated with reduced risk of hospitalization within the ITTi population (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.29; RD, -0.17%; 95% CI, -0.23% to 0.48%). Oseltamivir was also not associated with reduced hospitalization in older populations (mean age ≥ 65 years: RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.21 to 4.90) or in patients considered at greater risk of hospitalization (RR, 0.65; 0.33 to 1.28). Within the safety population, oseltamivir was associated with increased nausea (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.82) and vomiting (RR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.28 to 2.63) but not serious adverse events (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46 to1.08).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis among influenza-infected outpatients, oseltamivir was not associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization but was associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events. To justify continued use for this purpose, an adequately powered trial in a suitably high-risk population is justified.

Seasonal influenza — management when oseltamivir resistance is suspected states that patients previously treated with oseltamivir and suspected of developing oseltamivir resistance should be switched to inhaled zanamivir, unless contraindicated. Inhaled zanamivir is FDA approved for children aged ≥ 5 years for chemoprophylaxis and ≥ 7 years for treatment, but options for treating oseltamivir-resistant virus are limited; clinicians should evaluate reliable use in children 5–7 years old and seek expert consultation for management of antiviral-resistant influenza viruses.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

The efficacy of TAMIFLU in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness was demonstrated in a randomized, open-label post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts that included pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this trial received TAMIFLU for oral suspension 30 to 60 mg taken orally once daily for 10 days. The efficacy parameter was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

oral temperature at least 100°F (37.8°C),
cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, and
either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.

Among household contacts 1 year to 12 years of age not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was lower in the group who received TAMIFLU prophylaxis [3% (3/95)] compared to the group who did not receive TAMIFLU prophylaxis [17% (18/106)].

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^114xQ4j7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir Policies for Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza

The evidence from randomized controlled trials is clear that oseltamivir treatment decreases the duration of symptoms by up to 1 day in adolescent and adult patients with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza whose infections are able to be managed in the community. Oseltamivir provides no benefit to patients who have influenza-like illness not caused by influenza virus. Reviews of observational data regarding patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza A(H5N1) infections found that risk for death is cut in half if treatment is initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset. Small prepandemic observational studies, although they generally have controlled less for potential biases, also support the conclusion that risk for death is decreased with oseltamivir treatment.

These 2 lines of evidence may appear inconsistent. How would an intervention that has a modest effect on symptom duration in patients whose uncomplicated influenza was treated after a visit to a general practitioner be able to cut in half the risk for death among hospitalized patients?

### Clinician preferences for oseltamivir use in children with influenza in the outpatient setting [^116e5sbr]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Professional societies recommend antiviral treatment of all children at high risk for severe or complicated influenza disease, regardless of symptom duration. However, outpatient antiviral prescribing practices are inconsistent. We aimed to assess pediatric clinicians' outpatient prescribing practices for oseltamivir in children with influenza.

Methods

This vignette-based study of pediatric clinicians was conducted from March to June 2024 at 7 US children's hospitals and their affiliated clinics. The survey included 4 clinical influenza vignettes, 3 of which represented scenarios warranting treatment per national recommendations. One vignette was randomized to explore the impact of symptom duration on treatment preferences. Our primary outcome was the proportion of vignettes for which respondents were likely, somewhat or extremely, to recommend oseltamivir.

Results

Of 1124 eligible participants, 452 (40.2%) responded to the survey. Successive wave analysis revealed no evidence of response bias. Participants were likely to recommend oseltamivir in 36.2% of cases, with variation among specialties (29.6% for emergency medicine, 37.2% for general pediatrics, and 48.6% for infectious diseases; P < .001) and among study sites from 28.6% to 50.7% (P = 0.018), adjusted for clustering. Longer symptom duration (2 vs 4 days) significantly decreased respondents' likelihood to recommend oseltamivir from 30.9% to 1.8% (P < .001).

Conclusions

We demonstrate considerable nonadherence to national influenza treatment recommendations and variability regarding the outpatient use of oseltamivir to treat children with influenza. This indicates uncertainty of the perceived benefit of oseltamivir in a relatively healthy pediatric population with non-severe disease. Treatment standardization in accordance with national guidelines and rigorous monitoring of subsequent outcomes is needed.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Treatment of Influenza

Of the 4,765 adults in clinical trials of TAMIFLU for the treatment of influenza, 948 (20%) were 65 years and older, while 329 (7%) were 75 years and older. In three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in the treatment of influenza in patients at least 65 years old, that enrolled 741 subjects (374 received placebo and 362 received TAMIFLU), no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Prophylaxis of Influenza

Of the 4,603 adults in clinical trials of TAMIFLU for the prophylaxis of influenza, 1,046 (23%) were 65 years and older, while 719 (16%) were 75 years and older. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in elderly residents of nursing homes who took TAMIFLU for up to 42 days for the prophylaxis of influenza (TAMIFLU n = 276, placebo n = 272), no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.6	Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment had higher blood levels of oseltamivir carboxylate compared to patients with normal renal function which may increase the risk of TAMIFLU-associated adverse reactions. Therefore, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with a serum creatinine clearance between 10 and 60 mL/minute and for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing routine hemodialysis or continuous peritoneal dialysis treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. TAMIFLU is not recommended for patients with ESRD not undergoing dialysis [see Indications and Usage (1.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7	Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety and pharmacokinetics in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules during a community outbreak.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule or 12.5 mL of oral suspension once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, oseltamivir phosphate capsules may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as oseltamivir phosphate capsules dosing is continued.

GRADE Certainty of Evidence

It was concluded with moderate-certainty evidence that oseltamivir had little to no effect on hospitalization. Although all included studies were RCTs directly evaluating oseltamivir, there was imprecision in the estimates due to wide variability between study results, not all studies were placebo-controlled, and some studies were at risk of bias. Although the present analysis stratified by risk of bias produced similar estimates, these aforementioned factors decreased the present study's certainty from strong to moderate.

### Oseltamivir treatment for influenza in adults: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116AnA7U]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use, questions remain about the efficacy of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza. We aimed to do an individual patient data meta-analysis for all clinical trials comparing oseltamivir with placebo for treatment of seasonal influenza in adults regarding symptom alleviation, complications, and safety.

Methods

We included all published and unpublished Roche-sponsored randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of 75 mg twice a day oseltamivir in adults. Trials of oseltamivir for treatment of naturally occurring influenza-like illness in adults reporting at least one of the study outcomes were eligible. We also searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials register for other relevant trials published before Jan 1, 2014 (search last updated on Nov 27, 2014). We analysed intention-to-treat infected, intention-to-treat, and safety populations. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of all symptoms analysed with accelerated failure time methods. We used risk ratios and Mantel-Haenszel methods to work out complications, admittances to hospital, and safety outcomes.

Findings

We included data from nine trials including 4328 patients. In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted a 21% shorter time to alleviation of all symptoms for oseltamivir versus placebo recipients (time ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.74–0.85; p < 0.0001). The median times to alleviation were 97.5 h for oseltamivir and 122.7 h for placebo groups (difference -25.2 h, 95% CI -36.2 to -16.0). For the intention-to-treat population, the estimated treatment effect was attenuated (time ratio 0.85) but remained highly significant (median difference -17.8 h). In the intention-to-treat infected population, we noted fewer lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotics more than 48 h after randomisation (risk ratio [RR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.42–0.75; p = 0.0001; 4.9% oseltamivir vs 8.7% placebo, risk difference -3.8%, 95% CI -5.0 to -2.2) and also fewer admittances to hospital for any cause (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17–0.81; p = 0.013; 0.6% oseltamivir, 1.7% placebo, risk difference -1.1%, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.3). Regarding safety, oseltamivir increased the risk of nausea (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.29–1.99; p < 0.0001; 9.9% oseltamivir vs 6.2% placebo, risk difference 3.7%, 95% CI 1.8–6.1) and vomiting (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.83–3.23; p < 0.0001; 8.0% oseltamivir vs 3.3% placebo, risk difference 4.7%, 95% CI 2.7–7.3). We recorded no effect on neurological or psychiatric disorders or serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Our findings show that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates time to clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admittance to hospital, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.

### Oseltamivir (oseltamivir phosphate) [^113uRQn3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts (aged 13 years or older) of an index influenza case, oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally was administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for 7 days (index cases did not receive oseltamivir phosphate treatment). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 12% (24/200) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to 1% (2/205) in the oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness was demonstrated in a randomized, open-label post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts that included pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this trial received oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension 30 to 60 mg taken orally once daily for 10 days. The efficacy parameter was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

oral temperature at least 100°F (37.8°C),
cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, and
either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — testing and empiric treatment during community circulation: Confirmation of influenza virus infection by diagnostic testing is not required for decisions to prescribe antiviral medication, and initiation of empiric antiviral treatment should not be delayed while influenza testing results are pending; antiviral treatment is clinically most beneficial when started as close to illness onset as possible. All hospitalized patients with suspected influenza should be tested, and influenza testing may be used to inform decisions on use of antibiotics or continuation of antiviral medication, on need for further diagnostic tests, on consideration for home care, or on recommendations for ill persons living with others who are at high risk for influenza complications; influenza testing may be useful in order to inform decisions in infection control practices. Antiviral treatment is recommended for outpatients with suspected influenza who are at high risk for complications or those with progressive disease not requiring hospital admission, and antiviral treatment of outpatients who are not at high risk can be considered based upon clinical judgment if presenting within 2 days of illness onset.

### Influenza virus-related critical illness: prevention, diagnosis, treatment [^115hgxJb]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

No completed randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antiviral treatment have been conducted in hospitalized influenza patients to establish the efficacy of oseltamivir or other NAIs. A number of observational studies have reported clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitors in hospitalized patients, including reduction in duration of hospitalization and risk of death, including in ICU patients. Additionally, a systematic review of published reviews/meta-analyses reported survival benefit of NAI treatment in hospitalized patients, although another meta-analysis of observational studies did not. In particular, a large pooled individual patient-level meta-analysis of observational studies from 38 countries identified a 38% reduction in risk of mortality in critically ill adults and those aged ≥ 16 years old when comparing early NAI treatment (< 48 h) with later treatment (> 48 h), and a 69% reduction in mortality risk between influenza patients receiving early NAI treatment and those who did not receive NAIs. The mortality risk reduction of NAI treatment at any time versus no treatment was 28% for critically ill patients aged ≥ 16 years old; while a similar reduction in mortality was identified in critically ill children aged < 16 years, the result was not statistically significant and was likely underpowered because death is less common in hospitalized children with influenza than in adults.

Although studies have shown the greatest clinical benefit when antivirals are started within 2 days of illness onset, some observational studies have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitors when started up to 5 days following symptom onset. The large meta-analysis mentioned above also identified a significantly reduced mortality risk reduction (35%) in critically ill patients aged ≥ 16 years old who received NAI treatment > 48 h after symptom onset compared with those who did not. A cohort study of early versus late oseltamivir treatment reported a significant reduction in mortality and median duration of ICU hospitalization in severely ill patients with influenza A(H3N2), but not A(H1N1pdm09) or B virus infection in Greece. One French study reported delays in initiation of oseltamivir treatment prescribed to hospitalized influenza patients and suggested empiric administration of oseltamivir treatment in the emergency department for patients being admitted with lower respiratory tract disease during influenza season. Overall, based upon available observational data to date in hospitalized patients with influenza, including ICU patients, initiation of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza.

### Oseltamivir pharmacokinetics, dosing, and resistance among children aged [^115oR5Pv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Children < 2 years of age are at high risk of influenza-related mortality and morbidity. However, the appropriate dose of oseltamivir for children < 2 years of age is unknown.

Methods

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group evaluated oseltamivir in infants aged < 2 years in an age-de-escalation, adaptive design with a targeted systemic exposure.

Results

From 2006 to 2010, 87 subjects enrolled. An oseltamivir dose of 3.0 mg/kg produced drug exposures within the target range in subjects 0–8 months of age, although there was a greater degree of variability in infants < 3 months of age. In subjects 9–11 months of age, a dose of 3.5 mg/kg produced drug exposures within the target range. Six of 10 subjects aged 12–23 months receiving the Food and Drug Administration-approved unit dose for this age group (ie, 30 mg) had oseltamivir carboxylate exposures below the target range. Virus from 3 subjects developed oseltamivir resistance during antiviral treatment.

Conclusions

The appropriate twice-daily oral oseltamivir dose for infants ≤ 8 months of age is 3.0 mg/kg, while the dose for infants 9–11 months old is 3.5 mg/kg.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for oseltamivir phosphate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Treatment of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:

13 to 17 years of age: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients and safety data in adolescents treated with oseltamivir phosphate in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.
1 year to 12 years of age: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom oseltamivir phosphate 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional safety information was provided in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with known asthma. Efficacy could not be established in pediatric patients with asthma.
2 weeks to less than 1 year of age: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and older pediatric patients and two open-label trials of oseltamivir phosphate (2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days) in 136 pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age. In these two trials, the oseltamivir plasma concentrations in these subjects were similar to or higher than the oseltamivir plasma concentrations observed in older pediatric subjects and adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### New treatments for influenza [^113sPaS8]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The influenza NA is a classic example of rational drug design based on the crystal structure of NA. Currently, two NA inhibitors are used in clinical practice: oseltamivir (Tamiflu; Roche/Genentech) and zanamivir (Relenza; GlaxoSmithKline) (Figure 2). The 2009 H1N1 pandemic witnessed record sales of both drugs, together exceeding US $4 billion, partly due to stockpiles for fear of a forthcoming epidemic. Both drugs bind the catalytic pocket of NA and function as competitive inhibitors of NA activity.

Oseltamivir as a prodrug is sold in capsules containing 30 mg, 45 mg or 75 mg oseltamivir phosphate and also as powder for oral suspension in water (6 mg/mL). For treatment of influenza, the recommended dose for adults is 75 mg, twice a day, for 5 days. The preventive (prophylactic) dose is usually 75 mg, once a day for at least 10 days, or for up to 6 weeks during a community influenza outbreak. Smaller doses are recommended for children, according to age and weight. Adverse drug reactions may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and neuropsychiatric events such as self-inflicted injury and delirium (Table 1). As with many drugs, such as the M2 inhibitors, oseltamivir may be less effective if used in late-stage influenza.

Table 1
Old and new influenza drugs

Some information was obtained from manufacturers' inserts and/or websites.

Zanamivir (Relenza)

Zanamivir is more effective than oseltamivir and is supplied for oral inhalation only. It is sold as double-foiled 'blisters' that release the drug in an inhaler when pierced by the user. Each blister contains a powder mixture of 5 mg of zanamivir and 20 mg of lactose (plus milk proteins). The recommended dose for treatment of influenza in adults and pediatric patients aged 7 years and older is 10 mg twice daily (that is, two inhalations, one 5-mg blister per inhalation) for 5 days. For prevention of influenza (prophylaxis), the recommended dose in adults and pediatric patients 5 years and older is 10 mg once daily for 10 days, inhaled as above. Adverse drug reactions are rarer than with oseltamivir (Table 1).

For oseltamivir, adults: 75 mg twice daily and 75 mg once daily; children 1 year or older and ≤ 15 kg: 30 mg twice daily and 30 mg once daily; > 15–23 kg: 45 mg twice daily and 45 mg once daily; > 23–40 kg: 60 mg twice daily and 60 mg once daily; > 40 kg: 75 mg twice daily and 75 mg once daily; infants 9–11 months: 3.5 mg/kg per dose twice daily and 3.5 mg/kg per dose once daily; term infants 0–8 months: 3 mg/kg per dose twice daily and 3 mg/kg per dose once daily with the note 'if ≥ 3 months; not recommended for infants < 3 months unless the situation is judged critical due to lack of safety and efficacy data'; preterm infants are listed as 'See details in footnote'. For zanamivir, adults and children (≥ 7 years): 10 mg (two 5-mg inhalations), twice daily for treatment and 10 mg (two 5-mg inhalations), once daily for chemoprophylaxis. For peramivir, adults: 600 mg intravenous infusion once, given over 15–30 minutes (chemoprophylaxis NA); children 2 — 12 years: one 12 mg/kg dose, up to 600 mg maximum, intravenous, given over 15–30 minutes (NA); children 13 — 17 years: 600 mg intravenous infusion once, given over 15–30 minutes (NA).

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^114YzPCC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Secondary analyses from the Roche-sponsored meta-analysis suggested the following: a 63% (95% CI 19%–83%) decreased risk in hospitalization for any cause, based on 9/1,591 (0.6%) oseltamivir treated vs 22/1,302 (1.7%) placebo-treated patients; and a 44% (95% CI 25%–58%) decreased risk of antibiotic prescription for lower respiratory disease in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, based on 65/1,544 (4.2%) oseltamivir-treated vs 110/1,263 (8.7%) placebo-treated patients. However, hospital admissions were all cause and not confined to those that may have been associated with influenza infection; also, no formal diagnostic criteria existed for lower respiratory tract infection. We consider these secondary analyses less convincing than the analyses of primary endpoints. The latter were largely in agreement with those of the Cochrane group. Yet, despite this agreement and the arm's length funding mechanism, the Roche-sponsored meta-analysis has been criticized as being influenced by the manufacturer.

- safe and effective for the treatment of the flu in children less than 2 weeks of age.

- safe and effective in the prevention of the flu in children less than 1 year of age.

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules do not treat or prevent illness that is caused by infections other than the influenza virus.

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules do not prevent bacterial infections that may happen with the flu.

Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not recommended for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are not receiving dialysis.

### Assessment of temporal patterns and patient factors associated with oseltamivir administration in children hospitalized with influenza, 2007–2020 [^114vUCHc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study, oseltamivir use among children hospitalized with influenza increased over time; however, this increase was only marginal over the last 5 years of the study period. In the highest-use season, 22.1% of children hospitalized with influenza did not receive oseltamivir despite guidelines recommending its use. Children who were critically ill, older children, and children with high-risk medical histories were more likely to receive oseltamivir. Patient outcomes remained unchanged despite higher use of oseltamivir, which suggests a closer examination of the benefits of oseltamivir therapy is warranted in this population.

### Early flu antiviral treatment can shorten hospital stays in children with flu, new CDC study shows… [^113U6zmy]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

The first cohort included 309 children with at least one underlying medical condition not admitted to the intensive care unit.
- The second cohort included 299 children admitted to an ICU with and without underlying conditions. The children were treated almost exclusively with oseltamivir. Influenza causes thousands of hospitalizations and deaths every season in the United States, with children representing a substantial portion of those hospitalized with flu. Antiviral medications are an important adjunct to flu vaccine in the control of flu. Antiviral treatment is already recommended for hospitalized patients with suspected and confirmed flu. However, evidence for this recommendation in children was previously limited. This study serves to strengthen the body of evidence behind the recommendation for early antiviral treatment in children who are hospitalized with flu. There are four U. S.

Food and Drug Administration approved flu antiviral drugs that are recommended by CDC for use in children this flu season: Oseltamivir is approved for treatment of flu in children 2 weeks old or older. Oral oseltamivir comes in the form of pills and liquid. Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of flu in infants younger than 14 days old. Zanamivir is approved for treatment of flu in children 7 years and older. It is not recommended for use in children with underlying respiratory disease, including those with asthma and other chronic lung diseases. Inhaled zanamivir is given via a special inhaler. Peramivir is given intravenously and recommended for use in children 2 years and older.

Baloxavir is a pill that is given as a single dose by mouth and is approved for early outpatient treatment of children with flu who are aged 12 years and older. Families of children at higher risk for serious flu complications should seek care early in the course of flu illness. Your child's health care provider can help decide whether your child should take antiviral drugs if they become sick with flu this season. Flu signs and symptoms include fever, headache, extreme tiredness, dry cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose and muscle aches. It's important to note that some children with flu will not have a fever.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Prophylaxis of Influenza

Initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules within 48 hours following close contact with an infected individual. Initiate seasonal prophylaxis with oseltamivir phosphate capsules during a community outbreak.

Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older)

The recommended dosage of oseltamivir phosphate capsules for prophylaxis of influenza in adults and adolescents 13 years and older is 75 mg orally once daily (one 75 mg capsule once daily) for at least 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak. In immunocompromised patients, oseltamivir phosphate capsules may be continued for up to 12 weeks [see Use in Specific Populations (8.9)]. The duration of protection lasts for as long as oseltamivir phosphate capsules dosing is continued.

Pediatric Patients (1 year to 12 years of age)

Table 1 displays the recommended oral dosage of oseltamivir phosphate for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age based on body weight and provides information about prescribing the capsule or the formulation for oral suspension. Prophylaxis in pediatric patients is recommended for 10 days following close contact with an infected individual and up to 6 weeks during a community outbreak [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JSnbC]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza was one of the most clinically burdensome respiratory viruses. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 29 million cases, 380 000 hospitalizations, and 28 000 deaths from influenza in the US during the 2018 to 2019 season. While COVID-19 led to a temporary reduction in infections, influenza is now expected to have a resurgence. Novel strains or a rise in a relatively less immune population could trigger an influenza pandemic resembling the crises experienced in 1968 or 2009. As such, the availability of safe and effective treatments is critical to avoid overwhelming health care systems and to reduce morbidity and mortality. Indeed, a breakthrough in the COVID-19 pandemic occurred when outpatient randomized clinical trials demonstrated reductions in hospitalization and death. In contrast, despite the substantial threat that influenza poses, there are no evidence-based outpatient treatments proven to prevent the progression to hospitalization.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an antiviral that is commonly prescribed to outpatients with influenza to accelerate recovery and prevent complications. Detailing by key opinion leaders, guideline panels, and the manufacturer has even led to stockpiling of the medication as part of national pandemic responses. Yet, despite guideline recommendations, and millions of doses prescribed, it is unclear whether oseltamivir reduces severe complications requiring hospitalization. Three prior systematic reviews (1 independent and 2 supported by the manufacturer) have arrived at different conclusions. Since these publications, several large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been completed and have yet to be meta-analyzed. We, therefore, sought to clarify whether oseltamivir is a high-value medical treatment (achieving optimal results for patients balanced with an efficient use of resources). To do so, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of oseltamivir for the prevention of first hospitalization in adolescent and adult outpatients (efficacy) and treatment-associated adverse events (safety).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for oseltamivir and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Treatment of Influenza

The safety and efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:

13 to 17 years of age: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients and safety data in adolescents treated with oseltamivir phosphate in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.
1 year to 12 years of age: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom oseltamivir phosphate 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Additional safety information was provided in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with known asthma. Efficacy could not be established in pediatric patients with asthma.
2 weeks to less than 1 year of age: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and older pediatric patients and two open-label trials of oseltamivir phosphate (2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days) in 136 pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age. In these two trials, the oseltamivir plasma concentrations in these subjects were similar to or higher than the oseltamivir plasma concentrations observed in older pediatric subjects and adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Update: influenza activity – United States, September 28, 2014-February 21, 2015 [^1138R71n]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

CDC recommends that antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after illness onset (ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset) for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who is hospitalized, has severe, complicated, or progressive illness, or is at high risk for influenza-associated complications, including children aged < 2 years and adults aged ≥ 65 years. However, even when started after 48 hours of illness onset, antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in patients with severe, complicated, or progressive illness and in hospitalized patients. Antiviral treatment decisions should not be delayed awaiting laboratory confirmation of influenza.

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly and are available at. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available at.

What is already known on this topic?

CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity year-round in the United States. The timing and severity of circulating influenza viruses can vary by geographic location and season.

What is added by this report?

Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in mid-November, remained elevated through February 21, 2015, and is expected to continue for several more weeks. This has been an especially severe season for adults aged ≥ 65 years; this group has the highest recorded influenza-associated hospitalization rate and accounts for the majority of pneumonia and influenza–associated deaths this season. During September 28, 2014–February 21, 2015, influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated. Characterization data indicate that most of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses have antigenically or genetically drifted and are different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. The vast majority of currently circulating influenza viruses are sensitive to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Although vaccine effectiveness is reduced this season, influenza vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent influenza illness. Antiviral medications are more important than usual as an adjunct to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. Early antiviral treatment is recommended for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza illness and those at higher risk for influenza complications, including adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### Factors associated with nonprescription of oseltamivir for infant influenza over 9 seasons [^115fBFks]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends oseltamivir phosphate for children < 2 years old with confirmed or suspected influenza as they are at high risk for complications. We analyzed infant characteristics associated with nonprescription of oseltamivir over 9 years.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective electronic health record (EHR) review of infants < 12 months old born between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2019 within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center health system in Southwestern Pennsylvania who had > 2 well-child visits during their first year. Infants with a confirmed positive test for influenza were included in the analysis. Factors associated with infant oseltamivir nonprescription were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Of 457 infants with confirmed influenza, 86% were prescribed oseltamivir. The proportion of infants prescribed oseltamivir increased from an average of 64.6% during the 2012–2016 influenza seasons to 90.4% during the 2016–2020 influenza seasons. Infants were more likely to not be prescribed oseltamivir if they experienced > 2 days of influenza symptoms (odds ratio (OR): 9.4, 95% CI: 4.8, 18.7, P < .001), were diagnosed during the 2012–2016 influenza seasons (OR: 4.2, 95% CI: 1.8, 9.5, P < .001), tested positive for influenza via a multiplex/reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test (OR: 6.7, 95% CI: 2.7, 16.3, P < .001; OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 7.1; p = 0.04), or did not have a fever at point-of-care (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2, 4.6, P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Adherence to CDC influenza antiviral treatment guidelines for infants is high and improved over time. However, the provision of targeted education to providers may further improve oseltamivir prescribing practices for high-risk children < 12 months of age.

Adults

Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of TAMIFLU were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral TAMIFLU or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.

Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.

Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received TAMIFLU 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of TAMIFLU in men and women.

In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of TAMIFLU.

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Wu3wA]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the administration of oseltamivir to adult and adolescent outpatients with confirmed influenza associated with a reduced risk of first hospitalization?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 randomized clinical trials including 6166 patients, oseltamivir was not associated with reduced risk of first hospitalization compared with placebo or standard of care. Results were similar in a subgroup of patients considered at high risk of hospitalization; however, the CIs were wide.

Meaning

An adequately powered trial in a suitably high-risk population is needed to determine who might benefit from early treatment with oseltamivir to prevent hospitalization.

### Oseltamivir treatment vs supportive care for seasonal influenza requiring hospitalization [^1134vkos]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Seasonal influenza is a common infection that can be severe and lead to hospitalization and death. Each year, influenza causes approximately 140 000 to 810 000 hospitalizations as well as 12 000 to 61 000 deaths in the US, and 12 200 hospitalizations as well as 3500 deaths in Canada.

Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that can be used to treat severe influenza infection requiring hospitalization. The US and Canadian guidelines recommend treatment of all patients hospitalized with severe influenza regardless of illness duration, but this guidance is based on limited evidence. To date, there is a single randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing oseltamivir with supportive care in hospitalized patients with severe influenza. In the per-protocol population of 74 patients with confirmed influenza, there was no significant difference in clinical failures between the 2 groups. Observational studies showed a possible mortality benefit with oseltamivir in severe influenza, but most of the evidence was generated during the 2009 to 2010 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, and a newer study used a comparison group of delayed oseltamivir treatment. There is a knowledge gap in terms of effectiveness of oseltamivir compared with supportive care without oseltamivir in recent influenza seasons. Based on the suboptimal evidence, there continues to be equipoise resulting in low adherence to guideline recommendations on oseltamivir treatment for patients hospitalized with severe influenza. To add to the existing evidence, we conducted a large retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with severe influenza to evaluate the outcomes associated with oseltamivir treatment when compared with supportive care without oseltamivir treatment in terms of in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) use, time to discharge, and readmission.

Clinical studies: Reduced susceptibility isolates have been obtained during treatment with oseltamivir and from sampling during community surveillance studies. Changes in the viral neuraminidase that have been associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate are summarized in Table 8. The clinical impact of this reduced susceptibility is unknown.

Hemagglutinin (HA) substitutions selected in cell culture and associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir include (influenza virus subtype-specific numbering) A11T, K173E, and R453M in H3N2; and H99Q in influenza B virus (Yamagata lineage). In some cases, HA substitutions were selected in conjunction with known NA resistance substitutions and may contribute to reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir; however, the impact of HA substitutions on antiviral activity of oseltamivir in humans is unknown and likely to be strain-dependent.

Selection of influenza A viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies in children. Oseltamivir treatment-associated resistance in pediatric treatment studies has been detected at frequencies of 27 to 37% and 3 to 18% (3/11 to 7/19 and 1/34 to 9/50 post-treatment isolates, respectively) for influenza A/H1N1 virus and influenza A/H3N2 virus, respectively.

In immunocompromised adults and pediatrics (1 year of age and older), selection of influenza viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies than in the otherwise healthy population. In a treatment study of immunocompromised subjects, treatment-associated genotypic resistance was detected in 27% (8/30), 12% (6/52), and 0% (0/42) of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B virus infections, respectively. Treatment-emergent resistance was observed at a higher frequency in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (32%; 6/19).

The frequency of resistance selection to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such resistant virus vary seasonally and geographically.

Circulating seasonal influenza strains expressing neuraminidase resistance-associated substitutions have been observed in individuals who have not received oseltamivir treatment. The oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution H275Y was found in more than 99% of US-circulating 2008 H1N1 influenza virus isolates. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus ("swine flu") was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir; however, the frequency of circulating resistant variants can change from season to season. Prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use TAMIFLU.

### Variability of clinician recommendations for oseltamivir in children hospitalized with influenza [^116fnU8L]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Although national recommendations advise antivirals for all hospitalized children with influenza, this recommendation is not supported by high-quality evidence like a randomized clinical trial, and recent data suggest nonadherence to guidelines. Our objective was to describe clinician treatment preferences for oseltamivir in hospitalized children.

Methods

This cross-sectional survey of pediatricians from 5 specialties was conducted at 7 US children's hospitals from March to June 2024. Four clinical vignettes meeting 2023 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) criteria for antiviral treatment were included. Our primary outcome was the average proportion of vignettes for which respondents recommended oseltamivir.

Results

Of 1841 invited participants, 787 (42.7%) completed surveys. Participants were likely to recommend oseltamivir for 49.5% (95% CI, 47.0%-51.9%) of cases; this varied by site from 43.5% to 64.2% and by specialty from 41.6% (hospital medicine) to 70.9% (infectious disease). Longer duration of symptoms and less oxygen support significantly decreased the likelihood of recommending oseltamivir. Awareness of AAP recommendations increased the likelihood of recommending treatment, although aware respondents did not recommend treatment in 38% of cases. Most respondents (87.4%) believed a randomized trial of oseltamivir in hospitalized children was moderately to extremely important.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate nonadherence to national recommendations and variability in oseltamivir treatment for children hospitalized with influenza, indicating uncertainty and disagreement regarding which patients benefit from antivirals. A randomized controlled trial of oseltamivir in hospitalized children is needed to help strengthen current influenza treatment recommendations and inform clinicians of treatment benefit in specific pediatric populations.

### Evaluation of oseltamivir used to prevent hospitalization in outpatients with influenza: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11224zcc]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Based on the present analyses, it appeared unlikely that administration of oseltamivir to a general outpatient population had a meaningful effect on serious influenza-related outcomes culminating in hospitalization. That said, it should be noted that the rate of hospitalization was exceedingly low, with a control event rate of 0.81% (95% CI, 0.29%-2.20%). For oseltamivir to continue to be part of a viable influenza response with respect to preventing severe complications, future studies should focus on identifying the groups of higher-risk participants, with laboratory-confirmed influenza, who may derive benefit. Conducting an adequately powered trial would require a large sample size; however, given millions have received oseltamivir, such a trial does not seem unreasonable. As examples, we modeled 2 possible scenarios. First, if the risk of hospitalization is very low (eg, approximately a 1% rate as observed in the general population), a study of 30 716 participants would be required to demonstrate a 30% relative risk reduction with 80% power and 2-sided α = .05. By comparison, to conduct a trial focused on patients at greater risk of hospitalization, (eg, the 2% event rate among this population in the present analysis), 15 232 participants would be required. To succeed at recruitment, such trials would need to either take place during an epidemic or pandemic year or over several years of seasonal influenza. Although the required sample size is large, it is potentially achievable; PANORAMIC (Platform Adaptive Trial of Novel Antivirals for Early Treatment of COVID-19 in the Community) recruited 25 783 participants for early outpatient COVID-19 treatments between December 8, 2021, and April 27, 2022.

### Oseltamivir treatment vs supportive care for seasonal influenza requiring hospitalization [^1147EH1u]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines recommend oseltamivir treatment for all patients hospitalized with influenza, but this guidance is based on suboptimal evidence.

Objective

To evaluate outcomes associated with oseltamivir treatment when compared with supportive care for severe seasonal influenza requiring hospitalization.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation included adult patients admitted to hospital with influenza from 30 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 2015 to June 2023. Data were analyzed from November 2024 to March 2025.

Exposure

Oseltamivir treatment on hospital day 0 or 1 vs supportive care without oseltamivir.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included time to being discharged alive and readmission within 30 days. Overlap weighting of propensity scores was used to balance covariates, and a competing risk model was used to compare time to being discharged alive.

Results

Of 11 073 patients (mean [SD] age, 72.6 [16.8] years; 5793 female [52.3%]), there were 7632 patients (68.9%) and 3441 patients (31.1%) in the oseltamivir and supportive care groups, respectively. In hospital, 268 patients (3.5%) and 168 patients (4.9%) in the oseltamivir and supportive care groups died, respectively, with an adjusted risk difference of -1.8% (95% CI, -2.8% to -0.9%; P < .001). The oseltamivir treatment group was more likely to be discharged alive (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.25; P < .001). After discharge, 645 patients (8.5%) and 336 patients (9.8%) were readmitted in the oseltamivir and supportive care groups, respectively, with an adjusted risk difference of -1.5% (95% CI, -2.8% to -0.2%; p = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with influenza, oseltamivir treatment was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality risk, earlier discharge, and lower readmission rate, supporting evidence for the current guideline recommendation of oseltamivir treatment for severe influenza. Clinical trials are needed to definitively answer this question.

Seasonal influenza — evidence base and investigational strategies for resistant virus management note that there are no randomized trials to guide optimal care. Two studies in 2008–2009 when H275Y H1N1 variants circulated suggested that zanamivir or laninamivir led to superior clinical outcomes compared to oseltamivir. Most clinical data come from case reports and case series where patients on oseltamivir were switched late to other antivirals; the best outcomes appear to be associated with early changes to an agent with in vitro activity against the oseltamivir-resistant virus. Combination antiviral therapy with 2 or more active agents with different mechanisms of action is described as investigational and may reduce additional de novo resistance in immunocompromised and other higher-risk patients.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Influenza disease progression management — Clinicians developing management plans in response to treatment failure or severe illness associated with influenza viral infections can consider changing antiviral dosing or route of administration, increasing duration of therapy, or tailoring therapy based on viral resistance. Patients who are severely ill and hospitalized or who are immunosuppressed may require longer treatment with oseltamivir. For hospitalized children or those with severe disease, treatment with inhaled zanamivir is not recommended because evidence for its use in this setting is lacking. A prospective study from Hong Kong showed no overall clinical or virologic benefit of higher dose as compared to standard dose oseltamivir in hospitalized adults, though a trend to more rapid viral clearance of influenza B, but not of influenza A, was noted in a sub-analysis.

### Effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors in treatment and prevention of influenza A and B: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^111JWG2Z]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir for the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Published studies were retrieved from electronic bibliographic databases; supplementary data were obtained from the manufacturers.

Selection Of Studies

Randomised controlled, double blind trials that were published in English, had data available before 31 December 2001, evaluated treatment or prevention of naturally occurring influenza with zanamivir or oseltamivir (if given using the formulation and dosage licensed for clinical use), and reported at least one end point of relevance.

Review Methods

The main outcome measures were the median time to the alleviation of symptoms (for treatment trials) and number of flu episodes avoided (for prevention trials). Three population groups were defined: children aged 12 years and under; otherwise healthy individuals aged 12 to 65 years; and "high risk" individuals (those with certain chronic medical conditions or aged 65 years and older).

Results

Seventeen treatment trials and seven prevention trials identified met the inclusion criteria. All trials included compared one of the drugs against placebo or standard care. Treatment of children, otherwise healthy individuals, and high risk populations with zanamivir reduced the median duration of symptoms in days respectively by 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.5), 0.8 (0.3 to 1.3), and 0.9 (-0.1 to 1.9) for the intention to treat population. The corresponding results, in days, for oseltamivir were 0.9 (0.3 to 1.5), 0.9 (0.3 to 1.4), and 0.4 (-0.7 to 1.4). The effect of giving zanamivir and oseltamivir prophylactically resulted in a relative reduction of 70–90% in the odds of developing flu, depending on the strategy adopted and the population studied.

Conclusions

Evidence from randomised controlled trials consistently supports the view that both oseltamivir and zanamivir are clinically effective for treating and preventing flu. However, evidence is limited for the treatment of certain populations and for all prevention strategies.

### Antivirals for treatment of severe influenza: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112QvcAi]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we found that oseltamivir and peramivir might reduce duration of hospitalisation in patients with severe seasonal influenza compared with placebo or standard care, but the evidence was of low certainty due to scarce data from the small number of included randomised controlled trials. The effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir on mortality in patients with severe seasonal influenza or severe zoonotic influenza compared with placebo or standard care are very uncertain. Uncertainty also remains about the effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir on ICU admission. We did not find evidence of differences in any adverse events or serious adverse events among oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir.

This is the first systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different antivirals for treatment of severe influenza. We focused on evidence for approved antivirals from randomised controlled trials, assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach, and presented absolute effects for outcomes. To reflect typical clinical scenarios in practice, we used two separate baseline risks for mortality and separately estimated absolute effects for severe seasonal influenza and zoonotic influenza. The selection of patient-important outcomes, baseline risks, and MID values for outcomes was based on the independent WHO guideline panel's discussions and suggestions. The WHO panel also reviewed the results and assisted in their interpretation, ensuring a consistent interpretation of the available evidence to date. This systematic review provides the evidence base for the WHO clinical guideline recommendations for antiviral treatment of severe influenza.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral agent and duration: Clinicians should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible with a single neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) (either oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir) and not use a combination of NAIs (A-I), and clinicians should not routinely use higher doses of US Food and Drug Administration–approved NAI drugs for the treatment of seasonal influenza (A-II). Clinicians should treat uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy ambulatory patients for 5 days with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, or a single dose of intravenous peramivir (A-I). Clinicians can consider longer duration of antiviral treatment for patients with a documented or suspected immunocompromising condition or patients requiring hospitalization.

Treatment of influenza

Treatment of severe influenza presents multiple challenges. The mainstay of therapy for patients with influenza is initiation of antiviral medication as soon as possible after illness onset. Currently available FDA-approved antiviral medications include neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) (e.g. oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, and intravenous peramivir); cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor (baloxavir marboxil); and adamantanes (e.g. amantadine and rimantadine) (Table 4). NAIs and baloxavir have activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Adamantanes only have activity against influenza A viruses and are not recommended for treatment of influenza due to widespread resistance among currently circulating strains of seasonal influenza A viruses. Notably, FDA-approved antiviral medications for treatment of influenza are approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients based upon randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted among previously healthy outpatients. Meta-analyses of randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of early oseltamivir treatment of influenza in pediatric and adult outpatients have reported clinical benefit in reducing duration of illness and risk for some complications associated with influenza.

In the post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts (aged 13 years or older) of an index influenza case, oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily or placebo taken orally was administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms in the index case and continued for 7 days (index cases did not receive oseltamivir phosphate treatment). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was 12% (24/200) in the placebo-treated subjects compared to 1% (2/205) in the oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness was demonstrated in a randomized, open-label post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts that included pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years, both as index cases and as family contacts. All index cases in this trial received oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension 30 to 60 mg taken orally once daily for 10 days. The efficacy parameter was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the household. Laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza was defined as meeting all of the following criteria:

oral temperature at least 100°F (37.8°C),
cough and/or coryza recorded within 48 hours, and
either a positive virus isolation or a four-fold or greater increase in virus antibody titers from baseline or at illness visits.

### Antivirals for treatment of severe influenza: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117KW853]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal antiviral drug for treatment of severe influenza remains unclear. To support updated WHO influenza clinical guidelines, this systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated antivirals for treatment of patients with severe influenza.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Epistemonikos, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials published up to Sept 20, 2023, that enrolled hospitalised patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza and compared direct-acting influenza antivirals against placebo, standard care, or another antiviral. Pairs of coauthors independently extracted data on study characteristics, patient characteristics, antiviral characteristics, and outcomes, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or by a third coauthor. Key outcomes of interest were time to alleviation of symptoms, duration of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, hospital discharge destination, emergence of antiviral resistance, adverse events, adverse events related to treatments, and serious adverse events. We conducted frequentist network meta-analyses to summarise the evidence and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023456650.

Findings

Of 11878 records identified by our search, eight trials with 1424 participants (mean age 36–60 years for trials that reported mean or median age; 43–78% male patients) were included in this systematic review, of which six were included in the network meta-analysis. The effects of oseltamivir, peramivir, or zanamivir on mortality compared with placebo or standard care without placebo for seasonal and zoonotic influenza were of very low certainty. Compared with placebo or standard care, we found low certainty evidence that duration of hospitalisation for seasonal influenza was reduced with oseltamivir (mean difference -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.81 to -0.45) and peramivir (-1.73 days, -3.33 to -0.13). Compared with standard care, there was little or no difference in time to alleviation of symptoms with oseltamivir (0.34 days, -0.86 to 1.54; low certainty evidence) or peramivir (-0.05 days, -0.69 to 0.59; low certainty evidence). There were no differences in adverse events or serious adverse events with oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir (very low certainty evidence). Uncertainty remains about the effects of antivirals on other outcomes for patients with severe influenza. Due to the small number of eligible trials, we could not test for publication bias.

Interpretation

In hospitalised patients with severe influenza, oseltamivir and peramivir might reduce duration of hospitalisation compared with standard care or placebo, although the certainty of evidence is low. The effects of all antivirals on mortality and other important patient outcomes are very uncertain due to scarce data from randomised controlled trials.

Seasonal influenza — adult dosing and duration — standardizes drug dosing for oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, notes that oseltamivir requires dosage adjustment for reduced renal function and that zanamivir is an orally inhaled powder with limited systemic absorption excreted unchanged by the kidneys; duration of therapy for ambulatory adults with uncomplicated influenza is 5 days; in ambulatory adults, peramivir administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose is an alternative but is costlier; in hospitalized adults, oseltamivir is the preferred antiviral drug because data are very limited on inhaled zanamivir in severely ill influenza patients.

### Oseltamivir phosphate (oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension) [^11792cDj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age) One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.

Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided oseltamivir phosphate concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in children [^113KYabK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

During epidemic years, influenza attack rates in children exceed 40%. Options for prevention and treatment include the neuraminidase inhibitors: zanamivir and oseltamivir.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of neuraminidase inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of influenza infection in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005); EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2004); the on-line GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Trials Register; the on-line Roche Clinical Trial Protocol Registry and Clinical Trial Results Database (August 2005); and reference lists of articles. We also scrutinised web sites of European and US regulatory bodies and contacted manufacturers and authors.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomised, controlled trials comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo or other antiviral drugs in children less than 12 years of age. Additional safety and tolerability data from other sources were also included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors applied the inclusion criteria to the retrieved studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were analysed separately for oseltamivir and zanamivir.

Main Results

Three trials involving 1500 children with a clinical case definition of influenza were included, of whom 977 had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Overall, trial quality was good. Oseltamivir reduced the median duration of illness by 26% (36 hours) in healthy children with laboratory-confirmed influenza (P value less than 0.0001). The reduction was only 7.7% (10 hours) in 'at risk' (asthmatic) children, and this did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.54). Zanamivir reduced the median duration of illness by 24% (1.25 days) in healthy children with laboratory-confirmed influenza (P value less than 0.001). No data in 'at risk' children were available. Only oseltamivir produced a significant reduction in the complications of influenza (particularly otitis media), although there was a trend to benefit for zanamivir. We identified one randomised, controlled trial of oseltamivir for the prevention of influenza transmission in households, reporting data from 222 paediatric contacts. Where index cases had laboratory-confirmed influenza, a protective efficacy of 55% was observed, but this did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.089). The adverse events profile of zanamivir was no worse than placebo, but vomiting was more common in children treated with oseltamivir.

Authors' Conclusions

Neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in shortening illness duration in healthy children with influenza, but efficacy in 'at risk' children remains to be proven. Oseltamivir is also effective in reducing the incidence of secondary complications, and may be effective for influenza prophylaxis.

### Assessment of temporal patterns and patient factors associated with oseltamivir administration in children hospitalized with influenza, 2007–2020 [^11627rS4]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the temporal patterns in the use of oseltamivir among children hospitalized with influenza, and what patient factors are associated with its use?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 70 473 children hospitalized with influenza in the US between 2007 and 2020, oseltamivir use increased over time, from 20.2% in the 2007–2008 influenza season to a peak of 77.9% in the 2017–2018 season, with wide institutional variation. Oseltamivir was used more frequently among children who were critically ill, children who were older, and children who had high-risk conditions.

Meaning

This study's findings suggest that although the use of oseltamivir has increased over time, further work is needed to address guideline adherence and evaluate the impact of oseltamivir administration for outcomes.

### Cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment for children with uncomplicated seasonal influenza [^111fk7UH]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment for seasonal influenza in children and consider the impact of oseltamivir resistance on these findings.

Study Design

We developed a model to evaluate 1-year clinical and economic outcomes associated with 3 outpatient management strategies for unvaccinated children with influenza-like-illness: no antiviral treatment; diagnostic testing and oseltamivir treatment when positive; and empiric oseltamivir treatment. The model depicted a hypothetical non-pandemic influenza season with a 29% level of oseltamivir resistance in circulating viruses, and 14% to 54% probability of seasonal influenza with influenza-like-illness. Strategies were compared with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

Results

In our primary analysis, empiric oseltamivir treatment consistently produced the greatest benefit. The incremental cost-effectiveness of this alternative, compared with testing and treating, was < $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained in all age groups except the oldest. The testing strategy was consistently more effective compared with no treatment and cost between $25,900 and $71,200 per quality-adjusted life year gained, depending on age. Results were sensitive to the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance in circulating viruses.

Conclusion

Empiric oseltamivir treatment of seasonal influenza is associated with favorable cost-effectiveness ratios, particularly in children aged 1 to < 12 years, but ratios are highly dependent on the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance among circulating influenza viruses.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) or serious skin reactions. Instruct patients and/or caregiver to stop oseltamivir phosphate and seek immediate medical attention if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Neuropsychiatric Events

Advise patients and/or caregivers of the risk of neuropsychiatric events in oseltamivir phosphate-treated patients with influenza and instruct patients to contact their physician if they experience signs of abnormal behavior while receiving oseltamivir phosphate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Important Dosing Information

Instruct patients to begin treatment with oseltamivir phosphate as soon as possible from the first appearance of flu symptoms, within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. Similarly, instruct patients to start taking oseltamivir phosphate for prevention as soon as possible after exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Instruct patients to take any missed doses as soon as they remember, except if it is near the next scheduled dose (within 2 hours), and then continue to take oseltamivir phosphate at the usual times.

Influenza Vaccines

Instruct patients that oseltamivir phosphate is not a substitute for receiving an annual flu vaccination. Patients should continue receiving an annual flu vaccination according to guidelines on immunization practices. Because of the potential for oseltamivir phosphate to inhibit replication of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and possibly reduce efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks or 48 hours after oseltamivir phosphate administration, unless medically necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
