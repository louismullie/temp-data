## Question

Sirve la vitamina K en coagulopatía relacionada a daño hepático crónico?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin K helps in coagulopathy related to chronic liver damage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of coagulopathy in chronic liver disease. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about vitamin K in cirrhosis. Next, I will examine the evidence for vitamin K responsiveness in specific subgroups. After that, I need to check the pharmacokinetics and expected time course of effect. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation and address common misconceptions about INR and bleeding risk in cirrhosis.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: in chronic liver disease, coagulopathy is multifactorial, with reduced synthesis of vitamin K–dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X, low fibrinogen, thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism, and often hyperfibrinolysis; importantly, there is a rebalanced hemostasis where procoagulant and anticoagulant arms are both impaired, so INR and PT do not reliably predict bleeding risk, and patients can bleed or thrombose despite "abnormal" labs [^114o8aje] [^115N2q1v] [^1173i9Ua].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before recommending anything: multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same message — outside of clear vitamin K deficiency states, vitamin K typically does not meaningfully correct coagulopathy in cirrhosis, and INR should not be used to guide hemostatic decisions; the AASLD notes that vitamin K replacement has no measurable effect on INR in most cirrhotic patients, and the AGA advises that neither thrombocytopenia nor elevated INR predicts bleeding outcomes, so routine correction of INR with vitamin K or plasma is not supported [^115fgUR9] [^114o8aje] [^113w3ULy].

> Hold on, I should verify whether there are identifiable subgroups where vitamin K does help: yes, in cholestatic liver disease with fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption, in severe malnutrition, and in patients on antibiotics that disrupt gut flora, vitamin K deficiency can contribute to a prolonged INR, and in those settings vitamin K can improve PT/INR and thrombin generation; for example, in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, guidelines recommend vitamin K when PT is prolonged, and in Zellweger spectrum disorders with steatorrhea, IV vitamin K reduced PIVKA-II and improved thrombin generation, supporting a true deficiency mechanism in select contexts [^117G68Ue] [^116KbMDd] [^112atX1Z].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics and expected clinical effect so timing is realistic: vitamin K is not a fast-acting hemostatic drug; onset is 1–2 hours IV, with meaningful correction over 12–24 hours if hepatic synthetic capacity allows, and repeated large doses are unlikely to help if there is no response, which is precisely the scenario in most cirrhotic patients with impaired synthesis; importantly, IV administration carries a rare but serious anaphylaxis risk, so slow infusion with precautions is advised [^113XhACu] [^113w3ULy] [^113oBCYg].

> Hmm, wait a minute — does any society still recommend vitamin K to "correct INR" before procedures in cirrhosis? Initially, I thought the Society of Interventional Radiology endorsed routine INR correction with vitamin K pre-procedure, but hold on, I should verify the exact wording; the SIR guidance actually emphasizes that INR is unreliable in cirrhosis and does not recommend routine correction, and the AASLD similarly states no routine preprocedure correction of INR, while a Choosing Wisely campaign explicitly advises against routine vitamin K or plasma to reverse abnormal coagulation tests before common cirrhosis procedures, so I should correct that earlier assumption and align with the broader consensus [^116cwsL9] [^114V6VN2].

> Let me consider special scenarios where vitamin K is appropriate even in liver disease: reversal of warfarin-related coagulopathy is a distinct indication where vitamin K is indicated to restore γ-carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX, and X, typically 5–10 mg IV with PCC for rapid correction in bleeding, and this is standard regardless of underlying liver disease; likewise, in suspected vitamin K deficiency from malabsorption or antibiotics, a trial of vitamin K is reasonable, but if INR fails to improve meaningfully within 24–48 hours, further dosing is unlikely to help and should be stopped [^111c3vJA] [^114jvC9G] [^113w3ULy].

> I should double-check the practical approach to procedures and bleeding risk: viscoelastic testing (TEG/ROTEM) better reflects in vivo hemostasis in cirrhosis and can reduce unnecessary transfusions; when unavailable, prioritize platelets and fibrinogen rather than chasing INR, and avoid prophylactic FFP or vitamin K outside of specific indications; for low-risk procedures in stable cirrhosis, many guidelines do not require preprocedural correction of INR at all [^1173i9Ua] [^116T7MQ1] [^1111Wj1a].

> Putting this together, my clinical bottom line is: vitamin K is not routinely effective for coagulopathy in chronic liver disease because the dominant problem is impaired hepatic synthesis rather than vitamin K deficiency; it is reasonable to try vitamin K when deficiency is plausible (cholestasis, malnutrition, recent antibiotics), but if INR does not improve after a 10 mg dose (oral or IV), further dosing is unlikely to help and should be abandoned; INR should not be used to assess bleeding risk or to guide prophylactic correction in cirrhosis, and routine vitamin K or plasma to "normalize INR" before procedures is not recommended outside of warfarin reversal or proven deficiency [^115fgUR9] [^114o8aje] [^113w3ULy] [^114V6VN2].

---

Vitamin K is **not effective** for coagulopathy in chronic liver disease because the primary defect is impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors, not vitamin K deficiency [^114o8aje]. Vitamin K may only help if there is **true vitamin K deficiency** (e.g. cholestasis, malabsorption, prolonged antibiotics) [^1111Wj1a], but even then the effect is limited and slow [^113w3ULy]. Routine use is not recommended; management should focus on treating the underlying liver disease and using blood products or procoagulants only when clinically indicated [^116T7MQ1].

---

## Pathophysiology of coagulopathy in chronic liver disease

Chronic liver disease causes a **complex coagulopathy** characterized by:

- **Reduced synthesis of clotting factors**: The liver produces most clotting factors, including fibrinogen, prothrombin (factor II), and factors V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII. Hepatic impairment reduces their synthesis, prolonging PT/INR and aPTT [^115N2q1v].

- **Vitamin K-dependent factors**: Factors II, VII, IX, and X require vitamin K for γ-carboxylation. In chronic liver disease, impaired hepatic synthesis, not vitamin K deficiency, is the main cause of their deficiency [^113XhACu].

- **Platelet abnormalities**: Thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism and reduced thrombopoietin, plus platelet dysfunction, further impairs hemostasis [^115N2q1v] [^1123TcFB].

- **Hyperfibrinolysis and dysfibrinogenemia**: Increased fibrinolysis and abnormal fibrinogen are common in cirrhosis, contributing to bleeding [^1111Wj1a] [^1123TcFB].

---

## Role of vitamin K in coagulation

Vitamin K is a **cofactor for γ-carboxylation** of factors II, VII, IX, and X, enabling them to bind calcium and participate in clotting [^113XhACu]. Deficiency impairs synthesis of these factors, causing bleeding. However, in chronic liver disease, the primary problem is impaired hepatic synthesis, not vitamin K deficiency; thus, vitamin K supplementation does not correct the coagulopathy [^115fgUR9].

---

## Evidence regarding vitamin K supplementation in chronic liver disease

Clinical evidence shows that vitamin K has **limited or no benefit** in chronic liver disease:

- **AGA guidance**: Vitamin K has minimal impact on PT/INR in cirrhosis; repeated dosing is unlikely to help if there is no initial response [^113w3ULy].

- **AASLD guidance**: Outside advanced malnutrition or cholestasis, vitamin K replacement does not measurably improve INR in cirrhosis [^115fgUR9].

- **Cochrane reviews**: No randomized trials support vitamin K for upper GI bleeding in liver disease; its use is not recommended [^114Azjqe] [^116uEhdF].

- **Clinical studies**: Vitamin K only modestly improves INR in a subset with suspected deficiency, with no consistent clinical benefit [^116dgGmE].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **advise against routine vitamin K** for coagulopathy in chronic liver disease:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AGA | - Vitamin K has minimal impact on PT/INR in cirrhosis <br/> - Repeated dosing is unlikely to help if no initial response [^113w3ULy] |
| AASLD | - Outside malnutrition or cholestasis, vitamin K does not improve INR in cirrhosis [^115fgUR9] |
| Cochrane | - No evidence supports vitamin K for GI bleeding in liver disease [^114Azjqe] [^116uEhdF] |

---

## Situations where vitamin K may be beneficial

Vitamin K may help when **true deficiency** is present, such as:

- **Cholestatic liver disease**: Reduced bile salts impair fat-soluble vitamin absorption; vitamin K may improve PT/INR in this setting [^1111Wj1a].

- **Malnutrition**: Severe malnutrition or prolonged antibiotics can cause deficiency; vitamin K may help [^1111Wj1a].

- **Warfarin reversal**: Vitamin K is indicated to reverse warfarin-related coagulopathy, but this is distinct from liver disease coagulopathy [^111c3vJA].

---

## Alternative management strategies

Management of coagulopathy in chronic liver disease should focus on:

- **Treat underlying liver disease**: Address the cause and severity of liver dysfunction [^notfound].

- **Blood products**: Use FFP, PCC, or cryoprecipitate only for active bleeding or high-risk procedures, not routine correction [^1173i9Ua].

- **Thromboelastography (TEG)**: More accurately assesses hemostasis and can guide targeted therapy [^1173i9Ua].

- **Antifibrinolytic agents**: Consider tranexamic acid for hyperfibrinolysis-related bleeding [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and limitations of vitamin K supplementation

Vitamin K is **generally safe**, but risks include:

- **Anaphylaxis**: Rare with IV vitamin K; use caution and slow infusion [^113oBCYg].

- **Volume overload**: IV administration can worsen fluid overload in cirrhosis.

- **False reassurance**: Improving INR without clinical benefit may delay appropriate interventions [^116dgGmE].

---

Vitamin K is **not effective** for coagulopathy in chronic liver disease because the defect is impaired hepatic synthesis, not vitamin K deficiency. It may help only if true deficiency exists, and even then the effect is limited. Management should target the underlying liver disease and use blood products or procoagulants only when clinically indicated [^115fgUR9].

Background

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in the course of liver cirrhosis. Several treatments are used for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases. One of them is vitamin K administration, but it is unknown whether it benefits or harms patients with liver disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin K for patients with liver disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (September 2007), which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1950 to September 2007), EMBASE (1980 to September 2007), Science Citation Index Expanded (1945 to September 2007), and LILACS (1982 to November 2007). Additional randomised trials were sought from two registries of clinical trials, ClinicalTrials.gov and Sistema de Información Esencial en Terapéutica y Salud, the reference lists of the trials found, and reviews identified by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from randomised clinical trials were to be summarised by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies.

Main Results

We could not find any randomised trials on vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review found no randomised clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases. The effects of vitamin K need to be tested in randomised clinical trials. Unless randomised clinical trials provide evidence of a treatment effect and the trade off between potential benefits and harms are established, policy-makers, clinicians, and academics should not use vitamin K for upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver diseases.

### Reversing vitamin K antagonists: making the old new again [^117C6G3c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are commonly used for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders. The response to VKAs is highly variable due to their specific interaction with the vitamin K cycle, and hence interference with hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Monitoring the anticoagulant effect of VKAs by assessing the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is essential because complications are closely related to the intensity of anticoagulation. Treatment with VKAs contains a substantial risk of bleeding with a high case fatality rate. Reversal of VKAs is required in case of bleeding or a supratherapeutic INR, but also prior to high-risk surgery or interventions. Choice of methods to reverse VKAs depends on whether or not the patient is bleeding or is in need of an urgent procedure, and has to be based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the VKA. Reversal strategies include withholding the VKA, administration of vitamin K 1, and substitution of vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors, and need to be combined with measures according to general bleeding management.

### Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in cirrhosis of the liver: are low-dose non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants a reasonable alternative to warfarin? [^116fJA5B]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing global epidemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 1, 2 One of the most devastating complications associated with AF is stroke, a highly preventable event through the appropriate use of oral anticoagulation therapy. Furthermore, strokes associated with AF have an increased likelihood of causing death or disability. 3 Although oral anticoagulation therapy can significantly reduce the risk of AF‐related stroke, numerous international registries have demonstrated that guideline‐recommended prescription of anticoagulation remains suboptimal. 4 A major advance in stroke prevention in recent years has been the emergence of non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) given their superior efficacy and safety, predictable effect without routine monitoring, and fewer interactions compared with warfarin. The availability of NOACs is likely to be of great benefit in improving the rate of appropriate anticoagulation use and thus stroke prevention. However, despite increasing familiarity and comfort with their general use, there are still specific clinical situations in which more data are required to increase physician confidence in their efficacy and safety.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^113BKvLp]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Concentrated vitamin K–dependent clotting factors — prothrombin complex (4-factor concentrate) off-label use has been reported in cirrhosis and has the advantage of correcting vitamin K–dependent clotting factor deficiencies; because dosing is based on the INR, monitoring is problematic in cirrhosis, but the minimal volume required (10–20 mL) is noted and it deserves further study.

---

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^113w3ULy]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Vitamin K — onset is more than 12 hours and impact on prothrombin time is typically minor; a 10-mg oral tablet or 10-mg IV should be given, and IV dosing carries risk of anaphylaxis; absent an improvement in INR after a 10-mg dose, repeated administration is unlikely to have therapeutic benefit; there are a paucity of data to guide identification of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis who may benefit, as well as optimal dosing and route of administration.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^117BC8Le]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Reversal of OACs

The effects of warfarin on coagulation extend over the drug's half-life of several days; hence, simply stopping warfarin will not rapidly reverse the anticoagulated state. Emergency management of patients treated with warfarin is discussed in depth in many clinical guidelines that advise on interventions according to INR status, the need for invasive procedures and bleeding risk or severity; these are reviewed in table 3. Vitamin K 1 (phytonadione), administered orally or intravenously, can be used to accelerate warfarin reversal to some extent by counteracting its effects on vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor synthesis. The effect of vitamin K 1 on reversal of VKA-based anticoagulation is not immediate but will progress over 18–24 h or more as the liver synthesises sufficient quantities of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins (factors II, VII, IX and X) to re-establish effective clotting, a process that takes even longer in the presence of liver disease or other metabolic or nutritional problems.

### Quality of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists [^113YVJhk]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have a narrow therapeutic range, and literature analysis reveals poor quality of anticoagulation control. We sought to assess the prevalence of poor anticoagulant control in patients under VKA treatment in the prevention of stroke for atrial fibrillation (AF).

Hypothesis

Control of anticoagulation with VKA is inadequate in a high percentage of patients with AF.

Methods

Patients with AF under VKA treatment were prospectively recruited in this observational registry. The sample comprised 948 patients. The estimated time spent in the therapeutic range (TTR) was calculated, and variables related with a TTR > 65% were analyzed.

Results

Mean age was 73.8 ± 9.4 years, and 42.5% of the patients were women. Mean TTR was 63.77% ± 23.80% for the direct method and 60.27% ± 24.48% for the Rosendaal method. Prevalence of poor anticoagulation control was 54%. Variables associated with good anticoagulation control were university studies (odds ratio [OR]: 1.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08–3.64), chronic hepatic disease (OR: 8.15, 95% CI: 1.57–42.24), low comorbidity expressed as Charlson index (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76–0.99), no previous cardiac disease (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41–0.98), lower risk of bleeding assessed as hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly age, and use of drugs or alcohol (HAS-BLED; OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69–0.95), and lower heart rate (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98–0.99).

Conclusions

Patients who receive VKA to prevent stroke for AF spend less than half the time within therapeutic range.

### Assessment of vitamin K levels in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy [^116VnnrD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Levels of vitamin K fractions in women with mild and severe condition (µg/L)

Analysis of the contingency relation between the level of biliary acids and hypovitaminosis of all studied fractions of vitamin K in women with ICP revealed no statistically significant association between hypovitaminosis K and the severity of the condition, Table 1.

Table 1
Contingency between level of biliary acids and hypovitaminosis of studied fractions of vitamin K in women with ICP

In order to estimate the presence and severity of coagulation disorders in women included in the study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the coagulogram indices: fibrinogen (reference values: 3.7–6.2 g/L), prothrombin by Quick (reference values: 70–120%) and international normalized ratio (INR) (reference values: 0.8–1.4). Thus, it was found that vast majority of women had normal coagulogram. However, 1/71 (1.4%) case of modifications in blood clotting was found with the following values: fibrinogen – 1.9 g/L, prothrombin by Quick – 65.6%, INR –1.53. Therefore, we compared mean level of coagulogram indices in women with mild and severe ICP, Table 2.

Table 2
Mean level of coagulogram indices in women with mild and severe ICP

In order to assess possible complications in labor, the timing and method of delivery, the frequency and category of cesarean sections, and blood loss during childbirth were studied. The analysis revealed increased frequency of preterm births among women with ICP (19/71 (26.8%)), although at term births prevailed – 52/71 (73.2%) cases. Vaginal births were more common (41/71 cases (57.7%)), although the rate of cesarean sections was 42.3% (30/71) in women with ICP. Average estimated total blood loss was 480 (190) ml. At the same time, we compared estimated total blood loss in women who gave birth naturally with those who had a c-section. Therefore, average estimated blood loss in vaginal delivery was 376 (133) mL vs 688 (117) mL in women who had a cesarean section. It should be noted that in 4/41 (9.7%) cases the total blood loss during vaginal delivery was more than 500 mL, among which 1/4 (25.0%) women had massive blood loss (1000 mL), managed conservatively.

### Oral anticoagulation in patients with Liver disease [^117As6iJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with liver disease are at increased risks of both thrombotic and bleeding complications. Many have atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) necessitating oral anticoagulant agents (OACs). Recent evidence has contradicted the assumption that patients with liver disease are "auto-anticoagulated" and thus protected from thrombotic events. Warfarin and non-vitamin K-antagonist OACs have been shown to reduce thrombotic events safely in patients with either AF or VTE. However, patients with liver disease have largely been excluded from trials of OACs. Because all currently approved OACs undergo metabolism in the liver, hepatic dysfunction may cause increased bleeding. Thus, the optimal anticoagulation strategy for patients with AF or VTE who have liver disease remains unclear. This review discusses pharmacokinetic and clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of OACs in patients with liver disease and provides a practical, clinically oriented approach to the management of OAC therapy in this population.

### Oral vitamin K versus placebo to correct excessive anticoagulation in patients receiving warfarin: a randomized trial [^117XsE7u]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Low-dose oral vitamin K decreases the international normalized ratio (INR) in overanticoagulated patients who receive warfarin therapy. Its effects on bleeding events are uncertain.

Objective

To see whether low-dose oral vitamin K reduces bleeding events over 90 days in patients with warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

Design

Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization was computer-generated, and participants were allocated to trial groups by using sequentially numbered study drug containers. Patients, caregivers, and those who assessed outcomes were blinded to treatment assignment.

Setting

14 anticoagulant therapy clinics in Canada, the United States, and Italy.

Patients

Nonbleeding patients with INR values of 4.5 to 10.0.

Intervention

Oral vitamin K, 1.25 mg (355 patients randomly assigned; 347 analyzed), or matching placebo (369 patients randomly assigned; 365 analyzed).

Measurements

Bleeding events (primary outcome), thromboembolism, and death (secondary outcomes).

Results

56 patients (15.8%) in the vitamin K group and 60 patients (16.3%) in the placebo group had at least 1 bleeding complication (absolute difference, -0.5 percentage point [95% CI, -6.1 to 5.1 percentage points]); major bleeding events occurred in 9 patients (2.5%) in the vitamin K group and 4 patients (1.1%) in the placebo group (absolute difference, 1.5 percentage points [CI, -0.8 to 3.7 percentage points]). Thromboembolism occurred in 4 patients (1.1%) in the vitamin K group and 3 patients (0.8%) in the placebo group (absolute difference, 0.3 percentage point [CI, -1.4 to 2.0 percentage points]). Other adverse effects were not assessed. The day after treatment, the INR had decreased by a mean of 1.4 in the placebo group and 2.8 in the vitamin K group (P < 0.001).

Limitation

Patients who were actively bleeding were not included, and warfarin dosing after enrollment was not mandated or followed.

Conclusion

Low-dose oral vitamin K did not reduce bleeding in warfarin recipients with INRs of 4.5 to 10.0.

### Coagulation parameters in patients with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis treated sequentially with low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonists [^112gTZLM]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Information on coagulation for cirrhotics on anticoagulants is scanty. We investigated plasma from 23 cirrhotics treated with low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA).

Methods

On days 1–4 patients received full-dose LMWH. On day-5 VKA was started and LMWH was terminated when INR therapeutic-interval was reached. Blood was collected at peak and trough during LMWH, LMWH+VKA and VKA. Non-cirrhotics on VKA were included as controls.

Results

Anti-factor Xa increased from baseline-to-peak during LMWH. During LMWH+VKA was high and reverted to zero during VKA. INR was slightly high at baseline, trough or peak during LMWH and increased to 2.2 during LMWH+VKA or VKA. Mean VKA weekly-doses for cirrhotics and controls were 28.5mg and 28.6mg. Protein C decreased upon VKA, but not to the expected extent. Endogenous-thrombin-potential (ETP) decreased from baseline (1436nMmin) to trough (1258nMmin) and peak (700nMmin) during LMWH and was further reduced during LMWH+VKA (395nMmin).

Conclusions

Target-INR for cirrhotics can be reached by VKA dosages similar to those for non-cirrhotics. ETP reduction parallels the effect of LMWH and/or VKA. Whether these parameters represent the antithrombotic action elicited by these drugs remains to be determined by clinical-trials and laboratory-measurements. ETP, being a global-test reflecting both pro- and anti-coagulants targeted by antithrombotic drugs, seems the candidate for these trials.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. hematological abnormalities [^115N2q1v]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.8. Coagulation abnormalities

Several groups of metabolic disorders are associated with a bleeding tendency. Coagulopathy due to severe liver disease can be seen in any metabolic disorder which progresses to either acute or chronic liver failure. The coagulopathy of liver disease is complex. From a laboratory perspective, it is associated with prolongation of both the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), due to reduced levels of coagulation factors, most which are synthesized in the liver. The fibrinogen level is frequently low, due to decreased hepatic production or hyperfibrinolysis. The platelet count can be reduced, due to hypersplenism from portal hypertension, reduced liver production of thrombopoietin, or multifactorial in acutely unwell patients. The risk of bleeding is not proportionate to the degree of laboratory abnormalities. Indeed, there is increasing recognition that chronic liver failure is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. This is thought to be the concept of "rebalanced hemostasis" where similar reductions in the levels of the natural anticoagulants, and elevated levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor counteract the reduced levels of other coagulation factors.

Vitamin K deficiency can occur in any IMD due inadequate dietary intake or prolonged antibiotic therapy. Vitamin K deficiency should be suspected in any patient with a significantly prolonged PT +/− APTT and treatment is usually started empirically. Response to treatment is considered a diagnostic test, as measuring vitamin K levels or PIVKAs (Proteins Induced by Vitamin K Absence) is expensive and not routinely available and is usually unnecessary. Several metabolic disorders are associated with malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, particularly those associated with intrahepatic cholestasis and abetalipoproteinemia. There are also extremely rare inherited disorders of Vitamin K metabolism, caused by biallelic pathogenic variants of either gamma-glutamyl carboxylase or vitamin K2,3-epoxide reductase complex. These proteins are necessary for gamma carboxylation, which is a post-translational modification required for the function of the vitamin K dependent coagulation factors. This leads to variable reductions in the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, as well as the natural anticoagulants proteins C, S and Z. The spectrum of bleeding abnormalities varies from mild to severe. Developmental and skeletal abnormalities are also present which mimic fetal warfarin syndrome. Treatment can be with Vitamin K replacement which is variably effective, and plasma or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate replacement for major bleeding or surgery. These disorders are comprehensively reviewed elsewhere.

### Reversal of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) effect in patients with severe bleeding: a French multicenter observational study (optiplex) assessing the use of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in current clinical practice [^111JgAoK]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The anticoagulation reversal in patients with underlying thrombotic disease may be associated with a small risk of thromboembolic events. Given the heterogeneity in the composition of different formulations of PCC, the risk of thrombogenicity may vary. The presence of procoagulant factors, such as factors II and X, and of preactivated factors, such as factor VII, increases the risk of thrombogenicity. However, proteins C and S prevent excessive coagulation. Risk factors are also related to the patient's underlying condition. Thromboembolic events could be due to a combination of several factors such as hypercorrection, hepatic dysfunction, and induction of a prothrombogenic activation. In our cohort, four out of 686 patients treated with PCC experienced thromboembolism: one presented ischemic stroke and three presented deep vein thrombosis. Stroke was considered by the physician to be possibly related to PCC. One further patient experienced DIC in a context of septic shock and no less than 21 days after PCC infusion. No patient experienced arterial thrombosis or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. These results are in line with those of a meta-analysis (n = 460 patients) that reported a low thrombotic risk with PCC (1% to 5%). However, we acknowledge that thrombotic events could occur a long time after PCC infusion. In a study of 46 patients with intracranial bleeding, Imberti and colleagues reported that two patients experienced thrombotic events 47 and 56 days after a three-factor PCC administration, although the authors concluded that these events were unlikely to be related to PCC administration.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^114o8aje]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA clinical practice guideline on coagulation disorders in cirrhosis — background and conceptual framework states that cirrhosis is accompanied by alterations in platelet count (PLT) and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) used to estimate clotting, but it has become clear that neither thrombocytopenia nor elevated PT/INR predicts bleeding outcomes in most patients and that the severity of coagulopathy by these parameters is not predictive of bleeding complications, including variceal hemorrhage. The text also describes that patients are at risk for thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, splanchnic vein thrombosis, or stroke), notes clinician trepidation treating with conventional anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and cautions that PT/INR-based strategies to estimate bleeding risk and monitor VKA endpoints may not be relevant in cirrhosis; more integrative approaches using measurements of fibrin clot formation and lysis have been tested.

### French clinical practice guidelines on the management of patients on vitamin K antagonists in at-risk situations (overdose, risk of bleeding, and active bleeding) [^114zHD5h]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

The present report from several French medical societies in the field and the French National Authority for Health provides an expert consensus for the management of patients on vitamin K antagonists in at-risk situations (overdose, risk of bleeding, and active bleeding). Asymptomatic VKA overdose is defined as an International Normalized Ratio (INR) value above the upper limit of the therapeutic target. In this case, the guidelines describe the rapid reduction of the INR down to the therapeutic range, either by omitting a dose or using vitamin K. Regarding the haemorrhagic complications, the guidelines address the management of these patients according to the severity of bleeding, and especially focus on the use of prothrombin complex concentrate. Finally, the consensus addresses the management of patients in cases of elective or emergency surgery or other invasive procedures, and discusses whether treatment should be continued or not, and whether VKA substitution by heparin — "bridging anticoagulation" — is needed.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115fgUR9]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Coagulation interventions and factor assessment in cirrhosis highlight that the international normalized ratio (INR) does not predict bleeding risk and that certain corrective measures have limited utility or risks: "it is not a reliable indicator of hemostatic balance in patients with cirrhosis and is unable to predict procedural bleeding risk". Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions "carry important risks: (1) a potential for developing transfusion-related lung injury syndromes and (2) increases in portal pressures directly proportional to the volume transfused" and "show minimal efficacy in improving thrombin generation capacity in vitro". Outside of advanced malnutrition or cholestasis, "vitamin K replacement has no measurable effect on the INR in patients with cirrhosis", and "Determination of factor V levels can aid the practitioner in differentiating vitamin K deficiency from impaired liver function".

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British society of gastroenterology, the royal college of radiologists and the royal college of pathology [^116NVdJE]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

We recommend that vitamin K depletion should be corrected before liver biopsy (strength of recommendation STRONG; evidence WEAK).

We recommend that patients with a history of abnormal procedure-related bleeding, unrelated to portal hypertension, should be referred for specialist haematology assessment prior to biopsy (strength of recommendation STRONG; evidence WEAK).

The routine use of global haemostatic tests is not recommended at this time (strength of recommendation LOW; evidence WEAK).

Where the platelet count is < 50 x 10 9 /L, a transvenous approach is recommended, where possible (strength of recommendation STRONG; evidence MODERATE).

The effectiveness and risks of platelet transfusion for a platelet count < 50×10 9 /L have not been established but can be considered (strength of recommendation MODERATE; evidence WEAK).

TPO-RAs are an alternative to platelet transfusion according to local protocol (strength of recommendation MODERATE; evidence HIGH).

Phytonadione (vitamin K1) for warfarin-associated coagulopathy — route, time course, and safety: Low doses of phytonadione can be administered orally with temporary warfarin interruption in patients not requiring urgent reversal, and when given this way approximately 1.4 days are required for an INR between 6 and 10 to decline to < 4.0; when administered intravenously, low doses produce similar INR reductions at 24 h, while subcutaneous administration appears less effective than low-dose oral phytonadione. For bleeding patients at higher doses, intravenously administered phytonadione works more rapidly, with reduction of the INR beginning within 2 h and correction to within the normal range generally achieved within 24 h if hepatic function is normal and if a sufficiently large dose is given; at 24 h, 5 mg oral and 1 mg IV vitamin K produce similar effects on the INR. IV phytonadione may cause anaphylactoid reactions with a true frequency about three per 10,000 doses administered, and to minimize risk vitamin K should be mixed in a minimum of 50 mL of intravenous fluid and administered, using an infusion pump, over a minimum of 20 min.

### Procoagulant therapeutics in liver disease: a critique and clinical rationale [^111iGy7n]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

The complex nature of haemostasis in patients with liver disease can result in bleeding and/or thrombosis. These opposing outcomes, which have multiple contributing factors, can pose diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. With the high rate of haemorrhagic complications in patients with cirrhosis, we examine the various procoagulants available for use in this population. In this Review, we describe the clinical and current rationale for using each of the currently available procoagulants-vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, platelets, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), antifibrinolytics, prothrombin concentrate complexes (PCC), desmopressin and red blood cells. By examining the evidence and use of these agents in liver disease, we provide a framework for targeted, goal-directed therapy with procoagulants.

### Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation and liver cirrhosis [^116AvLDa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly recognized comorbidity in patients with liver cirrhosis, mainly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-associated liver disease, affecting the quality of life and prognosis. On the other hand, cirrhosis is associated with an elevated risk of both thrombosis and bleeding, making the decision about anticoagulation therapy very challenging. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are approved for patients with non-valvular AF. However, there is limited clinical experience and scientific evidence about their efficacy and safety in liver cirrhosis. This review article investigates the published literature concerning the administration of DOACs and traditional antithrombotic agents, such as vitamin K antagonists and heparins, in patients with liver cirrhosis and AF.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of coagulation disorders in patients with cirrhosis [^111C1zpw]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with cirrhosis — comparative effectiveness and harms show that the risk of nonfatal stroke appeared to be lower in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared with warfarin (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.91). Bleeding risk evaluations found a higher risk of bleeding in anticoagulated patients versus untreated controls, although the risk was lower among patients treated with DOACs versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.85). Similar trends were also seen for intracranial hemorrhage, with a lower rate in patients treated with DOACs versus VKAs (RR 0.7; 95% CI, 0.58–0.84). Major bleeding was increased in cirrhotic patients treated with anticoagulation compared with those not treated (rate ratio, 1.91), and the overall benefits of anticoagulation appear to outweigh the risk of bleeding in patients with a CHAD2DS2-VASC score ≥ 2.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Patients

The 3‐year study period included 2880 consecutive admissions for sepsis (Figure 1). After exclusion of patients with cirrhosis (n = 50, 1.7%), transfers from other ICUs (n = 294, 10.2%), readmissions within the same hospital stay or within 30 days after ICU discharge (n = 351, 12.2%), bleeding (n = 98, 3.4%), intravenous heparin administration (n = 288, 10.0%), chronic use of vitamin K antagonist prior to admission (n = 205, 7.1%), 1594 sepsis admissions remained. Of these, PT was not measured in 70 (4.4%) in the first 24 h after ICU admission, resulting in a final cohort of 1524 ICU admissions for sepsis. These admissions were divided into quartiles: 386 (25.3%) admissions involved patients with normal PT levels (≤ 12.7 s), 379 (24.9%) involved admissions with a slightly prolonged PT (12.8 ≤ PT ≤ 15.0 s), 383 (25.1%) involved admissions with an intermediately prolonged PT (15.1 ≤ PT ≤ 17.2 s), and 376 (24.7%) involved admissions with an extremely prolonged PT (≥ 17.3 s).

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA.

### Prophylactic vitamin K for the prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in preterm neonates [^116hboMD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K is necessary for the synthesis of coagulation factors. Term infants, especially those who are exclusively breast fed, are deficient in vitamin K and consequently may have vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). Preterm infants are potentially at greater risk for VKDB because of delayed feeding and subsequent delay in the colonization of their gastrointestinal system with vitamin K producing microflora, as well as immature hepatic and hemostatic function. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of vitamin K prophylaxis in the prevention of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) in preterm infants.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 5 December 2016), Embase (1980 to 5 December 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 5 December 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of any preparation of vitamin K given to preterm infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We evaluated potential studies and extracted data in accordance with the recommendations of Cochrane Neonatal.

Main Results

We did not identify any eligible studies that compared vitamin K to no treatment. One study compared intravenous (IV) to intramuscular (IM) administration of vitamin K and compared various dosages of vitamin K. Three different prophylactic regimes of vitamin K (0.5 mg IM, 0.2 mg vitamin K 1, or 0.2 mg IV) were given to infants less than 32 weeks' gestation. Given that only one small study met the inclusion criteria, we assessed the quality of the evidence for the outcomes evaluated as low. Intramuscular versus intravenousThere was no statistically significant difference in vitamin K levels in the 0.2 mg IV group when compared to the infants that received either 0.2 or 0.5 mg vitamin K IM (control) on day 5. By day 25, vitamin K 1 levels had declined in all of the groups, but infants who received 0.5 mg vitamin K IM had higher levels of vitamin K 1 than either the 0.2 mg IV group or the 0.2 mg IM group. Vitamin K 1 2,3-epoxide (vitamin K 1 O) levels in the infants that received 0.2 mg IV were not statistically different from those in the control group on day 5 or 25 of the study. All of the infants had normal or supraphysiologic levels of vitamin K 1 concentrations and either no detectable or insignificant amounts of prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA II). Dosage comparisonsDay 5 vitamin K 1 levels and vitamin K 1 O levels were significantly lower in the 0.2 mg IM group when compared to the 0.5 mg IM group. On day 25, vitamin K 1 O levels and vitamin K 1 levels in the 0.2 mg IM group and the 0.5 mg IM group were not significantly different. Presence of PIVKA II proteins in the 0.2 mg IM group versus the 0.5 mg IM group was not significantly different at day 5 or 25 of the study.

Authors' Conclusions

Preterm infants have low levels of vitamin K and develop detectable PIVKA proteins during the first week of life. Despite being at risk for VKDB, there are no studies comparing vitamin K versus non-treatment and few studies that address potential dosing strategies for effective treatment. Dosage studies suggest that we are currently giving doses of vitamin K to preterm infants that lead to supraphysiologic levels. Because of current uncertainty, clinicians will have to extrapolate data from term infants to preterm infants. Since there is no available evidence that vitamin K is harmful or ineffective and since vitamin K is an inexpensive drug, it seems prudent to follow the recommendations of expert bodies and give vitamin K to preterm infants. However, further research on appropriate dose and route of administration is warranted.

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British society of gastroenterology, the royal college of radiologists and the royal college of pathology [^1111Wj1a]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The recent guidelines from the American Gastroenterology Associationinclude the recommendations that blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunisation and/or transfusion reactions.

The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimise clot formation in advanced liver disease: haematocrit ≥ 25%, platelet count > 50 x 10 9 /L, and fibrinogen > 120 mg/dL. Commonly used thresholds for correction of the INR are not supported by evidence.

The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary INR target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the usefulness of this agent considerably.

In contrast, decompensated liver disease with acute or chronic liver failure is associated with a progressive consumptive coagulopathy and hypofibrinogenaemia, often with hyperfibrinolysis. Spontaneous mucocutaneous and other bleeding manifestations may become evident at this stage. In one study, a platelet count < 30×10 9 /L, fibrinogen level < 0.6 g/L and activated partial thromboplastin time values > 100 s were the strongest independent predictors for new onset of major bleeding. All but the most essential invasive procedures should be avoided under these circumstances. Acute kidney injury has also been associated with an increased risk of bleeding after paracentesis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Treatment with vitamin K should be considered in patients with an increased INR, which may in part reflect vitamin K deficiency; particularly in patients in intensive care, in patients with malnutrition, in patients using antibiotics and in patients with cholestatic liver disease.

### Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in cirrhosis of the liver: are low-dose non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants a reasonable alternative to warfarin? [^113hixpZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

This analysis by Dr Lee and colleagues is a welcome addition to the growing body of real‐world data supporting the potential use of NOACs in patient subgroups underrepresented in the major randomized clinical trials. In general, the subject of anticoagulation for AF in Asians is an important one for a multitude of reasons. From a population perspective, the burden of AF and its subsequent complications in Asia is of great concern. While the prevalence of this condition is lower, the absolute number of individuals living with AF in this region significantly outnumbers those in North America and Europe because of its populous nature. 6 Moreover, this discrepancy is expected to increase exponentially in coming decades as Asian societies continue to expand and undergo demographic transition. 6 However, there are unique and important subtleties that may alter the balance of efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in Asian populations. 7 First, Asians have a higher baseline risk of bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. 7 Second, the rate of ischemic stroke appears be higher in Asians. 7 Third, the quality of warfarin anticoagulation seems to be less in Asians, as assessed by time in therapeutic range; this may be in part related to healthcare systems as well as genetic influences. 8 Finally, Asians more often have lower body weight, reduced creatinine clearance, lesser use of gastroprotectant drugs, and greater use of antiplatelet medications – factors that are all relevant to anticoagulant prescription. 7 In spite of these factors, there is an increasing wealth of recent information regarding the use of anticoagulation in Asians with AF. Reassuringly, stroke and bleeding risk can still be adequately assessed with the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc and HAS‐BLED scores, respectively. 7 From a practical point of view, the available observational and randomized data also support the general use of NOACs in preference to warfarin anticoagulation in Asian patients with AF. 9

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^115ge9wN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Future Directions

The non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants constitute a major breakthrough in the management of thromboembolic disease. The ease of their use, the wide therapeutic window, and the fact that they do not require monitoring will help to overcome the significant obstacles encountered with VKAs. The studies conducted to date justify their use in patients with nonvalvular AF, and for VTE prophylaxis and treatment. However, there are specific conditions, such as valvular heart disease, cancer‐associated VTE, APS, and other hypercoagulable states, severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, pediatric patients, and pregnancy, where the efficacy and safety of NOACs have yet to be demonstrated. From a translational science perspective, it is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of thrombosis in these conditions. Determining the factors that have a nodal role in these diseases would lay the theoretical ground for developing anticoagulation strategies, specific for each disease, that achieve the maximal antithrombotic effect while minimizing hemorrhagic complications. From a clinical perspective, given the complexity and the challenges inherent to the management of these diseases, well‐designed randomized clinical trials should be performed specifically in patients with these medical conditions. Until such data become available, traditional anticoagulation with VKAs or heparins will remain the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy.

### Evaluation of response to high-dose intravenous vitamin K administration [^116dgGmE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Essential to the coagulation pathway, vitamin K (phytonadione) is used to correct clotting factor deficiencies and for reversal of warfarin-induced bleeding. In practice, high-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin K is often used, despite limited evidence supporting repeated dosing.

Objective

This study sought to characterize differences in responders and nonresponders to high-dose vitamin K to guide dosing strategies.

Methods

This was a case-control study of hospitalized adults who received vitamin K 10 mg IV daily for 3 days. Cases were represented by patients who responded to the first dose of IV vitamin K and controls were nonresponders. The primary outcome was change in international normalized ratio (INR) over time with subsequent vitamin K doses. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with response to vitamin K and incidence of safety events. The Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board approved this study.

There were 497 patients included, and 182 were responders. Most patients had underlying cirrhosis (91.5%). In responders, the INR decreased from 1.89 at baseline (95% CI = [1.74–2.04]) to 1.40 on day 3 (95% CI = [1.30–1.50]). In nonresponders, the INR decreased from 1.97 (95% CI = [1.83–2.13]) to 1.85 ([1.72–1.99]). Factors associated with response included lower body weight, absence of cirrhosis, and lower bilirubin. There was a low incidence of safety events observed.

Conclusions

In this study of mainly patients with cirrhosis, the overall adjusted decrease in INR over 3 days was 0.3, which may have minimal clinical impact. Additional studies are needed to identify populations who may benefit from repeated daily doses of high-dose IV vitamin K.

In conclusion, this large, observational study makes a significant contribution to the literature on the potential use of NOAC therapy in Asians patients with AF and cirrhosis. Low‐dose NOAC therapy may be safe and efficacious in this setting in the short term, despite the known differences in risk profiles and outcomes in Asian populations with AF combined with the balance of thrombosis and bleeding in cirrhosis. Some additional areas of uncertainty remain unanswered, however, and we thus look forward to future studies that may help us continue to reduce the burden of AF and stroke in Asia and elsewhere.

### Rare cause of isolated severe coagulation failure in cirrhosis: traditional healing with fenugreek [^112ArFtD]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis develop decompensation events during the natural history of the disease that encompass ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and jaundice. Coagulation failure, defined using the international normalised ratio, even though not a decompensation event, is important in patients with stratifying cirrhosis into those who require liver transplantation for long-term survival. Isolated coagulation failure in cirrhosis is rare and usually occurs with use of anticoagulants in the setting of vascular diseases. We reported the case of a patient with compensated cirrhosis in whom, isolated severe coagulation failure was found to be due to excessive use of fenugreek milk porridge as part of traditional healing. The coagulation failure was promptly reversed with avoidance of fenugreek and supplementation with vitamin K.

WARNING: INCREASED RISK OF BLEEDING WITH CONCOMITANT USE OF VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS

WARNING: INCREASED RISK OF BLEEDING WITH CONCOMITANT USE OF VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS

Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with oral vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Clinically significant increases in prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) have been reported in patients who were on stable doses of a vitamin K antagonist at the time capecitabine was introduced. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating capecitabine and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping capecitabine. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases.

Monitor INR more frequently and adjust the dose of the vitamin K antagonist as appropriate [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Phytonadione (mephyton) [^113JdgGf]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

An immediate coagulant effect should not be expected after administration of phytonadione.

Phytonadione will not counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin.

When vitamin K1is used to correct excessive anticoagulant-induced hypoprothrombinemia, anticoagulant therapy still being indicated, the patient is again faced with the clotting hazards existing prior to starting the anticoagulant therapy.

Phytonadione is not a clotting agent, but overzealous therapy with vitamin K1may restore conditions which originally permitted thromboembolic phenomena. Dosage should be kept as low as possible, and prothrombin time should be checked regularly as clinical conditions indicate.

Repeated large doses of vitamin K are not warranted in liver disease if the response to initial use of the vitamin is unsatisfactory. Failure to respond to vitamin K may indicate a congenital coagulation defect or that the condition being treated is unresponsive to vitamin K.

### Reversible coagulopathy associated with vitamin E excess [^1112KQWW]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Vitamin E refers to a group of compounds that are essential to the diet of animals, where its primary function is an antioxidant. Excessive vitamin E supplementation can cause a reversible coagulopathy in the setting of compromised vitamin K absorption or function. We describe the case of a woman in her mid-80s treated for micronutrient deficiencies following a biliopancreatic diversion as a bariatric procedure 14 years previously. Her coagulation tests were normal until she commenced vitamin E and accidentally over-administered the prescribed dose. This resulted in a coagulopathy, characterised by a prolonged international normalised ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The patient never had any signs of active bleeding. Both coagulation parameters normalised after stopping the vitamin E and with vitamin K supplementation. This case signifies the importance of careful instruction and monitoring of vitamin replacement, in particular vitamin E supplementation, which in excess leads to coagulopathy.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^1156yJMb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were first introduced in the 1920s from studies on the "hemorrhagic" effect of spoiled sweet clover consumption by cattle 1 and have evolved ever since to the cornerstone of oral anticoagulation therapy. The most commonly used VKA in the United States is warfarin, while in some European countries acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon are commonly used. 2 VKAs exhibit their anticoagulant effect by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the post‐translational modification of vitamin K–dependent proteins. Inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 results in impaired synthesis of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X as well as of anticoagulant proteins C, S, and Z. 3 The primary indications for VKA use are prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or mechanical cardiac valves.

Although VKAs are efficacious in the prevention and treatment of VTE 4 and AF‐related thromboembolic complications, 5 their use has some hindrances. First, the dose required to provide therapeutic anticoagulation is highly variable between individuals. It is influenced by various pharmacogenetic parameters, such as polymorphisms affecting VKA pharmacokinetics (cytochrome CYP2C9 gene that regulates VKAs hepatic metabolism) 6 and pharmacodynamics (VKORC1 gene). 7 Second, co‐administration of other medications, such as anti‐inflammatory, antibiotics, antiplatelets, statins, antidepressants, amiodarone, antifungals, antiretrovirals, and over‐the‐counter dietary supplements, can interact with VKAs. 8 Third, changes in dietary patterns or alcohol consumption alter the efficacy of VKAs, requiring adjustment of the maintenance dose. 8 Last, given this variability and the narrow therapeutic window of VKAs, frequent anticoagulation monitoring is required to ensure appropriate dosing. 9

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^115Bo1G4]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Anticoagulant therapy in cirrhosis addresses portal vein thrombosis (PVT) by noting that in the acute setting such as new (especially if symptomatic) PVT or extension of prior thrombosis, management notes systemic anticoagulation with IV heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), while asymptomatic incidentally discovered PVT does not invariably warrant therapy and spontaneous resolution may occur, especially if partial. For chronic PVT, especially in patients listed for transplantation or with a history of symptomatic PVT or mesenteric thrombosis, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are reported as safe and effective in Child–Pugh class A and early class B, whereas vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin) are problematic due to uncertainty of target INR. For prevention, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis is indicated, and in the absence of bleeding, routine DVT prophylaxis measures are recommended.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonist for portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115k4cYR]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Aim

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is associated with a higher risk of liver-related complications. Recent guidelines recommend direct-acting anticoagulants (DOAC) in patients with cirrhosis and non-tumoral PVT. However, data on the efficacy and safety of DOAC in these patients remain limited. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of DOAC compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) to treat non-tumoral PVT in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of six electronic databases using MeSH term and free text. We selected all studies comparing the use of DOACs with vitamin K antagonist to treat PVT in cirrhosis. The primary outcome was PVT recanalization. Secondary outcomes were and PVT progression, major bleeding, variceal bleeding and death.

Results

From 944 citations, we included 552 subjects from a total of 11 studies (10 observational and 1 randomized trial) that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found that DOAC were associated with a higher pooled rate of PVT recanalization (RR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.02, 2.74, I² = 79%) and lower pooled risk of PVT progression (RR = 0.14, 95%CI: 0.03–0.57, I² = 0%). The pooled risk of major bleeding (RR = 0.29, 95%CI: 0.08–1.01, I² = 0%), variceal bleeding (RR = 1.29, 95%CI: 0.64–2.59, I² = 0%) and death (RR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.01–9.578, I² = 80%) was similar between DOAC and VKA.

Conclusion

For the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis, the bleeding risk was comparable between DOAC and VKA. However, DOAC were associated with a higher pooled rate of PVT recanalization. Dedicated randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Coagulopathy in zellweger spectrum disorders: a role for vitamin K [^112atX1Z]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs) are caused by an impairment of peroxisome biogenesis, resulting in multiple metabolic abnormalities. This leads to a range of symptoms, including hepatic dysfunction and coagulopathy. This study evaluated the incidence and severity of coagulopathy and the effect of vitamin K supplementation orally and IV in ZSD.

Methods

Data were retrospectively retrieved from the medical records of 30 ZSD patients to study coagulopathy and the effect of vitamin K orally on proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II) levels. Five patients from the cohort with a prolonged prothrombin time, low factor VII, and elevated PIVKA-II levels received 10 mg of vitamin K IV. Laboratory results, including thrombin generation, at baseline and 72 h after vitamin K administration were examined.

Results

In the retrospective cohort, four patients (13.3%) experienced intracranial bleedings and 14 (46.7%) reported minor bleeding. No thrombotic events occurred. PIVKA-II levels decreased 38% after start of vitamin K therapy orally. In the five patients with a coagulopathy, despite treatment with oral administration of vitamin K, vitamin K IV caused an additional decrease (23%) of PIVKA-II levels and increased thrombin generation.

Conclusion

Bleeding complications frequently occur in ZSD patients due to liver disease and vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency is partly corrected by vitamin K supplementation orally, and vitamin K administered IV additionally improves vitamin K status, as shown by further decrease of PIVKA-II and improved thrombin generation.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Cirrhosis and ACLF — coagulation assessment and venous thromboembolism (VTE) management: INR, although strongly linked with liver function in the absence of vitamin K deficiency, does not measure coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, whereas thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are viscoelastic tests that are more physiologic than standard testing. Normal TEG or ROTEM measurements in compensated or decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF can avoid blood product transfusion for procedures even with elevated INR, and TEG-guided assessment decreases transfusions without changing rebleeding risk. When TEG/ROTEM are unavailable, fibrinogen and platelet levels should be evaluated, and no data support prophylactic transfusions in the absence of bleeding or need for invasive procedures. In patients with cirrhosis without ACLF, a rebalancing in coagulation occurs but hypercoagulability can be found; one cannot justify therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) chronically without a thrombus, whereas full-dose anticoagulation should be used for acute thromboembolic events, especially symptomatic acute portal vein thrombosis in the absence of contraindications. Hospitalized cirrhotic patients are at higher VTE risk than noncirrhhotics; pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis has not been shown to increase bleeding overall, but patients with recent bleeding and significant thrombocytopenia (platelets ≤ 50 × 10^9/L) are not optimal candidates for pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.

10.2 Treatment

The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of COUMADIN anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing COUMADIN therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.

The use of vitamin K1reduces response to subsequent COUMADIN therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of COUMADIN administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of COUMADIN is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to COUMADIN overdosage.

### Reversal of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) effect in patients with severe bleeding: a French multicenter observational study (optiplex) assessing the use of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in current clinical practice [^112W1kyL]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are oral anticoagulants that inhibit liver production of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, such as factors II, VII, IX, and X and proteins C and S. Bleeding in patients treated with VKA is the most serious iatrogenic complication, leading to more than 17,000 hospitalizations per year in France (that is, 12% of hospitalizations related to adverse events). Moreover, VKA causes 5,000 deaths per year. The incidence of bleeding associated with oral anticoagulants is expected to increase over time as the population ages.

Intracranial hemorrhage is the principal type of bleeding related to oral anticoagulants, accounting for approximately 15% of all intracranial hemorrhages. The rates of intracranial hemorrhages range from 0.25% to 1.1% per year to about 2% when the international normalized ratio (INR) exceeds 2 and rise dramatically thereafter. Concomitant use of antithrombotic treatments doubles the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Intracranial hemorrhages related to VKA have a high mortality rate, approaching 50% at 1 month. The prognosis of patients with VKA-related intracranial hemorrhage is generally poor compared with that of patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. In these patients, the hemorrhage is larger at baseline and hematoma expansion may persist after admission. Hematoma size is a major predictor of mortality and worsening neurological condition. Early and rapid INR correction is therefore crucial in the management of these patients. Coagulation reversal should be initiated as soon as symptom onset occurs to prevent hematoma expansion.

### Management of excessive anticoagulant effect due to vitamin K antagonists [^114Nf4wu]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Unexpectedly elevated INR values are commonly encountered in clinical practice. In the absence of bleeding, such values may be treated with either simple warfarin withdrawal or the administration of low doses of oral vitamin K. Oral vitamin K will more rapidly return the INR to the therapeutic reference interval; however, its impact on bleeding is unknown. If the INR is in excess of 10, most experts would recommend the administration of vitamin K and, in the case of active bleeding, additional administration of coagulation factors either in the form of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC). Coagulation factor replacement is required given the need to urgently correct the INR; however, vitamin K should not be forgotten since it is required to antagonize the effect of warfarin, preventing "rebound" anticoagulation after transfused coagulation factors are consumed. This paper will review the evidence supporting various treatment modalities and will provide suggestions for treatment. Future advances in this area will likely focus on evaluations of the relative merits of FFP and PCCs.

### Guideline-concordant administration of prothrombin complex concentrate and vitamin K is associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe bleeding under vitamin K antagonist treatment (EPAHK study) [^1127bqjG]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In developed countries, up to 2% of the general population receives chronic oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). The rate of severe bleeding complications is above 3.8% per person-year and the associated mortality rate ranges between 10 to 60%, especially in case of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), in the first week following the onset of the hemorrhage. In case of severe hemorrhage, the two main predictors of poor prognosis are over anticoagulation, that is, an international normalized ratio (INR) above the therapeutic range, and late VKA reversal (over eight hours after presentation).

For several decades the evidence supporting appropriate clinical use of VKA antidotes has remained scarce. In a recent randomized clinical trial, Sarode et al. demonstrated the superiority of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) versus fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to normalize coagulation within one hour (62.2 versus 9.6%; P < 0.05). The role of vitamin K in association with PCC, in maintaining the normalized coagulation over six hours has been emphasized. The importance of rapid hemorrhage control has led international guidelines to recommend the use of PCC rather than FFP. For complete VKA reversal, all guidelines recommend an infusion of PCC (at least 20 IU/kg factor IX equivalent) related to admission INR value in combination with at least 5 mg of vitamin K to rapidly achieve a post-reversal INR ≤ 1.5 and maintain a normal coagulation profile over six hours. So as to save time, French guidelines suggest, on the basis of a previous study, the possibility of administering a probabilistic single-regimen dose of 25 IU/kg of PCC and 10 mg of vitamin K as soon as a severe hemorrhage is diagnosed. In all situations, post-reversal INR must be measured 30 minutes after the infusion to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment and make any necessary adjustments thereafter, and measured six hours later to control the efficacy of vitamin K. French guidelines were published in 2008 and have become a standard of care for the management of these patients in France. Treatment time frames were not specified in the international guidelines and the effect of early reversal on mortality has not been studied. At a time when new oral anticoagulant agents without specific antidotes are emerging as promising alternatives to VKAs, it appears important to better define the prognosis benefit of anticoagulant reversal in the management of patients on oral anticoagulants with severe hemorrhage.

### Coagulopathy in zellweger spectrum disorders: a role for vitamin K [^112Xj12o]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Impaired hepatic synthesis is not the only cause of coagulopathy in ZSD patients. The many risk factors for developing vitamin K deficiency, including steatorrhea, poor oral intake of the vitamin and frequent antibiotic treatment. PIVKA-II is a functional indicator of vitamin K status. In our retrospective study, all patients had increased levels in the absence of vitamin K therapy, consistent with vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K supplementation orally decreased PIVKA-II levels by 38% but did not normalize them in most patients. The three patients with a rise in PIVKA-II levels after supplementation orally also had a decrease in FV and an increase in PT. This could be explained by further progression of the disease, since the time interval between both measurements varied from 6 to 10 years.

In the prospective study, we aimed to improve one of the causes of coagulopathy in ZSD patients, i.e. vitamin K status, by giving vitamin K IV. This had no effect on global coagulation parameters but did lower PIVKA-II levels by another 23%. This decrease was most apparent in patients with the highest levels before IV therapy. In one patient, PIVKA-II increased from 27 to 36 mAU/ml but remained within the normal range of 21–56 mAU/ml. Furthermore, thrombin generation was significantly improved, although it remains to be determined whether regular vitamin K supplementation IV will diminish bleeding complications in ZSD patients. Nevertheless, in clinical situations, including during bleeding episodes or before dental or surgical procedures, it seems to have an additional positive effect on coagulation. As ZSD patients have a high risk of bleeding, consultation with a hematologist before a surgical procedure or after trauma is important to discuss patient coagulation status and management. There is insufficient evidence, however, to give vitamin K IV on a regular basis, since it is a real burden for those children. However, it may be useful to measure PIVKA-II more often, as supportive care with vitamin K therapy orally could be improved or in some cases boosted with IV administration. More comprehensive research is indicated in larger populations to examine the clinical relevance of our laboratory findings.

In conclusion, both liver disease and vitamin K deficiency contribute to coagulopathy in ZSD patients, which particularly manifests as bleeding complications. Vitamin K deficiency is partly corrected by administering vitamin K therapy orally, and added IV administration improves vitamin K status, as shown by further decrease of PIVKA-II and improved thrombin generation.

Pediatric acute liver failure — coagulopathy and bleeding management states that both prothrombin time (PT) and the international normalized ratio (INR) are elevated in PALF, yet abnormalities in these synthetic markers do not equate with bleeding risk because both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins are reduced; clinically significant bleeding can occur. Initial management should look to improve the abnormality via administration of an age- and weight-appropriate dose of vitamin K therapy from 1 mg in infants to 10 mg in older adolescents. Oral vitamin K therapy should not be used to correct the INR in PALF; rather, subcutaneous administration should be used, while intramuscular and intravenous routes carry a Black Box warning for rare, but potentially serious side effects. Coagulopathy secondary to vitamin K deficiency should rapidly correct following repletion, and if coagulopathy persists, efforts to "correct" with fresh frozen plasma or other pro-coagulation products should generally be avoided because plasma transfusions transiently improve laboratory measures but have no proven benefit when given prophylactically and can instead contribute to volume overload; most centers will use plasma and/or platelet infusions before an invasive procedure or in the setting of life-threatening bleeding. Thromboelastography (TEG) is designed to incorporate all coagulation phases and has the promise to inform management decisions but requires additional study.

The management of coagulopathy in patients with acute and chronic liver disease has undergone little change in many years despite advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of this problem. In general, deficiency of clotting factors as a result of poor hepatic synthetic function accounts for most of the coagulopathy. However, other processes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hyperfibrinolysis, dysfibrinogenemia, hemolysis, and a decrease in number or function of platelets may be present and thus add to the complexity of the problem. Coexisting portal hypertension and the associated risks of volume expansion, renal failure, and endothelial dysfunction add even more difficulty to the management of these patients. The clinician's despair is only exacerbated by uncertainty regarding the significance of laboratory indices of coagulation and the lack of agreement between health care providers regarding how to use these indices. Simple, conventional interventions such as vitamin K or plasma administration often produce only limited amelioration, and the latter carries the potential disadvantage of volume overexpansion as well as the risk of infection and transfusion reactions. Into this complex and uncertain clinical situation has arrived the antihemophilic agent recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa). Its development has led to a fundamental re-evaluation of the classic understanding of the normal clotting cascade. Moreover, use of this product in liver disease patients is increasing despite the lack of definitive studies or literature to guide therapy. Herein we review the mechanism of action of this agent, report the clinical applications in patients with liver disease, address the limitations and risks associated with the drug, and discuss the issue of its cost-effectiveness.

### Phytonadione [^113XhACu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion aqueous colloidal solution of vitamin K for parenteral injection, possesses the same type and degree of activity as does naturally-occurring vitamin K, which is necessary for the production via the liver of active prothrombin (factor II), proconvertin (factor VII), plasma thromboplastin component (factor IX), and Stuart factor (factor X). Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the post-translational carboxylation of multiple, specific, peptide-bound glutamic acid residues in inactive hepatic precursors of factors II, VII, IX, and X. The resulting gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues convert the precursors into active coagulation factors that are subsequently secreted by liver cells into the blood.

In normal animals and humans, phytonadione is virtually devoid of activity. However, in animals and humans deficient in vitamin K, the pharmacological action of vitamin K is related to its normal physiological function, that is, to promote the hepatic biosynthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The action of the aqueous dispersion, when administered intravenously, is generally detectable within an hour or two and hemorrhage is usually controlled within 3 to 6 hours. A normal INR may often be obtained in 12 to 14 hours.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption:

Phytonadione is readily absorbed following intramuscular administration.

Distribution:

After absorption, phytonadione is initially concentrated in the liver, but the concentration declines rapidly. Very little vitamin K accumulates in tissues.

Elimination:

Little is known about the metabolic fate of vitamin K. Almost no free unmetabolized vitamin K appears in bile or urine.

### Risk of adverse events in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^115w8YPk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia worldwide and is associated with a significative increased risk of death and thromboembolic events. Oral anticoagulation (OAC), with vitamin K antagonists or non-vitamin K anticoagulants (NOACs), has been associated with a reduced risk of thrombotic events and death in patients with AF, but concerns have been raised in clinical contexts characterized by an increased hemorrhagic risk.

Both the risks of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events in patients with AF on OAC are associated with the presence of other comorbidities, including the components of the metabolic syndrome (ie, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity). The latter metabolic risk factors beyond their role in increasing the risk of adverse events in patients with AF have been associated with a proinflammatory state characterized by insulin resistance and triglycerides accumulation in hepatocytes that configure the so called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In Western countries, NAFLD represents the leading cause of liver disease and has been associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events and liver-related adverse events. However, no established strategies to address cardiovascular risk in NAFLD are available. Moreover, preclinical evidence and experimental models showed that NAFLD could affect liver-mediated drug metabolism raising possible concerns about OAC management.

The aim of this study was to assess the 1-year risk of cardiovascular events and bleeding in patients with AF-NAFLD treated by OAC, using a global federated dataset.

### Late-onset vitamin K deficiency presenting as haemorrhagic shock and severe multi-system organ failure [^115PSccz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Treatment

Within 2 hours of arrival, the infant received 1 mg intramuscular vitamin K empirically for profound coagulopathy of yet unclear aetiology. Once the initial INR resulted, an additional 4 mg intramuscular vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma 10 mL/kg were administered due to potential for ongoing bleeding apparent on imaging. The decision to give the additional vitamin K was extrapolated from dosing recommendations in biliary atresia and was made in consultation with paediatric pharmacy and paediatric haematology. The infant received packed red blood cells of 15 mL/kg divided into aliquots of 5 mL/kg, each administered over 3 hours, to mitigate risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload.

### Warfarin sodium [^113CQ5sD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.

10.2 Treatment

The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.

The use of vitamin K1reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage.

### Vitamin K for improved anticoagulation control in patients receiving warfarin [^111CPwot]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Effective use of warfarin involves keeping the international normalised ratio (INR) within a relatively narrow therapeutic range. However, patients respond widely to their dose of warfarin. Overcoagulation can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding, while undercoagulation can lead to increased clot formation. There is some evidence that patients with a variable response to warfarin may benefit from a concomitant low dose of vitamin K.

Objectives

To assess the effects of concomitant supplementation of low-dose oral vitamin K for anticoagulation control in patients being initiated on or taking a maintenance dose of warfarin.

Search Methods

To identify previous reviews, we searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2011). To identify primary studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014), Ovid MEDLINE (R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations database and Ovid MEDLINE (R) (OvidSP) (1946 to 25 February 2014), Embase (OvidSP) (1974 to week 8 of 2014), Science Citation Index Expanded™ & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science™) (1945 to 27 February 2014), and the NHS Economics Evaluations Database (NHS EED) (via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014). We did not apply any language or date restrictions. We used additional methods to identify grey literature and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of vitamin K versus placebo in patients initiating warfarin or already taking warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and extracted data from included studies. When disagreement arose, a third author helped reached a consensus. We also assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified two studies with a total of 100 participants for inclusion in the review. We found the overall risk of bias to be unclear in a number of domains. Neither study reported the time taken to the ﬁrst INR in range. Only one study (70 participants) reported the mean time in therapeutic range as a percentage. This study found that in the group of participants deemed to have poor INR control, the addition of 150 micrograms (mcg) oral vitamin K significantly improved anticoagulation control in those with unexplained instability of response to warfarin. The second study (30 participants) reported the effect of 175 mcg oral vitamin K versus placebo on participants with high variability in their INR levels. The study concluded that vitamin K supplementation did not significantly improve the stability of anticoagulation for participants on chronic anticoagulation therapy. However, the study was only available in abstract form, and communication with the lead author confirmed that there were no further publications. Therefore, we interpreted this conclusion with caution. Neither study reported any thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, or death from the addition of vitamin K supplementation.

Authors' Conclusions

Two included studies in this review compared whether the addition of a low dose (150 to 175 mcg) of vitamin K given to participants with a high-variability response to warfarin improved their INR control. One study demonstrated a significant improvement, while another smaller study (published in abstract only) suggested no overall benefit. Currently, there are insufficient data to suggest an overall benefit. Larger, higher quality trials are needed to examine if low-dose vitamin K improves INR control in those starting or already taking warfarin.

### Warfarin sodium (Jantoven) [^112djuBU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.

10.2 Treatment

The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of JANTOVEN anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing JANTOVEN therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.

The use of vitamin K1reduces response to subsequent JANTOVEN therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of JANTOVEN administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of JANTOVEN is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to JANTOVEN overdosage.

### Harmful and beneficial effects of anticoagulants in patients with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis [^114oSgTQ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) promote recanalization of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with cirrhosis. However, the benefit of PVT recanalization might be offset by major and minor bleeding associated with use of anticoagulants. We evaluated harmful and beneficial effects of VKA in patients with PVT and cirrhosis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 63 consecutive patients with cirrhosis given anticoagulants for the first detection of non-neoplastic PVT from 2003 to 2015 in Italy. We collected data on bleeding events in these patients and compared them with those from patients without cirrhosis with venous thromboembolism (VTE) (n = 160) for up to 4 years. Time in the therapeutic range, based on the international normalized ratio, was used to determine the quality of anticoagulation. We also collected data from 139 patients with cirrhosis who did not receive VKAs (controls), to analyze portal hypertension-related events. We performed survival analyses to determine the effects of VKA in patients with PVT vs controls.

Results

The group with VTE and the group with PVT were comparable in age, sex, and time in the therapeutic range, but patients with VTE received VKAs for a longer time period (31.1 ± 16.9 mo vs 23.3 ± 16.2 mo; p = 0.002). The incidence of major or minor bleeding was higher in patients with PVT than patients with VTE (major, 24% vs 7%; p = 0.012; minor, 29% vs 19%; p = 0.024). Patients with PVT had a higher rate of major bleeding from the upper-gastrointestinal tract than patients with VTE (P = 0.019), but there were no significant differences in other types of major bleeding (P = 0.376). Patients with PVT and controls had the same rate of upper-gastrointestinal bleeding. Complete recanalization in patients with PVT receiving VKA (n = 31) was independently associated with increased portal hypertension-related event-free and transplantation-free survival times.

Conclusions

In a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with cirrhosis given anticoagulants for PVT, we found VKA use to increase risk of minor bleeding, compared with patients without cirrhosis given VKA. However, this risk is offset by the ability of VKA to increase portal hypertension-related, event-free, and transplantation-free survival of patients with PVT recanalization. Portal hypertension, rather than anticoagulants, could account for the difference in risk of major bleeding between patients with PVT vs patients with VTE.

4.2 Comparison with other studies

Advanced liver diseases, such as acute or chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, or elevation of liver enzymes, are known to increase the risks of stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding events. As such, these patients should receive therapy with oral anticoagulants including NOACs or VKAs. One previous systematic review has evaluated the effectiveness and safety of NOACs in cirrhosis patients with venous thromboembolism, splanchnic vein thrombosis, or AF. 22 However, cirrhosis patients with AF were not analyzed separately in this descriptive analysis. 22 Although two prior meta‐analyses assessed the effect of NOACs compared with VKAs in AF patients with liver disease, they still had several defects, such as including the unadjusted data, 15, 23 or combining data of real‐world settings and randomized clinical trials, 15 which might influence the validity of findings. In addition, Chokesuwattanaskul et al 23 only included two studies for analysis. Caldeira et al 21 only included the randomized clinical trials, and focused on all patients with NOACs. In contrast, our current meta‐analysis only included adjusted data of real‐world studies to compare the effectiveness and safety of NOACs and VKAs in AF patients with liver disease, suggesting that NOACs had lower or similar rates of thromboembolic and bleeding events compared with VKAs. The subgroup analysis based on the NOAC type indicated similar results with the primary analysis.

Several studies have examined the hepatotoxic potential of NOACs, but their findings are inconsistent. 16, 18, 19, 28 Case reports and analyses of pharmacovigilance data have found an increased risk of liver injury during the use of NOACs, especially for rivaroxaban. 16, 28 For the data in the pharmacovigilance databases, there have many limitations such as under‐reporting of adverse outcomes, selective increased reporting for NOACs, and incomplete data. 29 Population‐based studies could provide more detail regarding the hepatic safety of NOACs. To date, two observational studies have assessed the risk of liver injury associated with the use of NOACs compared with VKAs. 18, 19 After pooling these two studies, we first found that the use of NOACs (regardless of the NOAC type) vs VKAs was associated with a reduced risk of liver injury in AF patients (Table 2).

PRETRANSPLANT COAGULOPATHY MANAGEMENT

Consensus guidelines have risk stratified procedures (Table S1) based on technical, anatomic, and patient‐related factors. Despite abnormal coagulation parameters in patients with varying phenotypes of liver disease, these parameters do not correlate with procedural bleeding risk. Current guidelines are therefore best balanced and individualized according to each clinical scenario, and details of the specific management are beyond the scope of this review, although our general approach to coagulation management and supporting data to guide these decisions are summarized in Table 3.

TABLE 3
Hemostasis patterns and management recommendations in pre‐LT patients

Use of anticoagulation in the listed patient

In patients with compensated cirrhosis requiring anticoagulation, clinical studies demonstrate low rates of bleeding complications, including with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and vitamin‐K antagonists (VKAs). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are emerging as a therapy for anticoagulation, and although data remain limited, clinical studies in patients with compensated cirrhosis support the safety of these agents.

Current societal guidelines suggest the use of anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis with indications for therapy. Patients with cirrhosis demonstrate increased risks of thromboembolic disease, with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) occurring in up to 20% of patients. Improved outcomes in recanalization have been reported in those patients anticoagulated at 1 year, especially those patients with risk of evolution of thrombus or extensive mesenteric thrombosis, which may preclude LT if not addressed in a timely manner. The presence of nontumoral PVT can also be seen in patients with HCC, a rising indication for LT, and may portend worse survival and increased risk of systemic venous thromboembolism (VTE). In a meta‐analysis of patients with cirrhosis and PVT, anticoagulation significantly increased the rate of recanalization (71%) compared with untreated patients (42%). There was no significant difference in the rate of any major or minor bleeding events between the groups. In addition, a single‐center study of patients with Child‐Turcotte‐Pugh Grades B and C showed that a 12‐month course of enoxaparin prevented PVT and delayed hepatic decompensation compared with controls.

Patients listed for LT could be considered for portal vein reconstruction–transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt while on the waiting list to decrease the risk of clot progression; these patients have chronic rather than acute thrombus, and routine anticoagulation is not indicated afterward unless there is a known underlying thrombotic disorder or high‐risk feature such as complete portal vein obliteration or thrombus extending to the superior mesenteric vein.

### Comparing clinical outcomes of vitamin K antagonists vs non-vitamin K antagonists in anticoagulant therapy for mesenteric venous thrombosis [^113w6yD5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Individuals treated with anticoagulation therapy using vitamin K antagonists or NOACs had complete resolution in 30 of 42 cases (71%). Of the 30 patients, 17 (85%) were assigned to group 1, whereas the remaining 13 (59%) were assigned to group 2. According to other studies, the use of NOACs has demonstrated approximately 75% to 85% complete or partial resolution. In our study, the NOAC group showed a complete resolution rate of 59%, but when considering partial resolution, it exhibited a resolution rate of approximately 92%, which is consistent with the findings of other studies. In the no-change group, three of the four patients were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, whereas one patient had essential thrombocytosis and polycythemia vera. In the partial resolution group, eight patients had a history of deep vein thrombosis, intra-abdominal infection, and abdominal surgery. Additionally, one patient had unprovoked and liver cirrhosis. Despite being poorly recanalized, patients with liver cirrhosis experienced no symptom recurrence and showed clinical improvement during the follow-up period. In this study, five patients were considered to have developed MVT as a result of liver cirrhosis, and the possible explanation for incomplete resolution in four of them seems to be related to the disrupted balance of hemostasis in patients with liver cirrhosis. This rebalanced hemostasis is fragile and constantly transforming, with prothrombotic effects resulting from endothelial failure, bacterial translocation, or bleeding from bacterial infections or sepsis. Rebalanced hemostasis explains why portal vein thrombosis (PVT), deep vein thrombosis, and thromboembolic events occur more frequently in patients with cirrhosis. In addition, according to various studies, the rate of symptomatic recurrence when using NOACs ranged from 2.1% to 7.6%. Scheiner et al reported that in patients with unchanged cavernous formation of PVT treated with NOACs, stable PVT was 80%. Additionally, we valuated the presence of cavernous formations on follow-up CT. Twenty-two patients developed a cavernous formation. There were 11 patients in Groups 1 and 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.746). However, we did not categorize them under a specific thrombus resolution category solely based on the presence of cavernous formation. Instead, even if cavernous formation occurred, if thrombus persisted, we categorized it as partial thrombus resolution. Furthermore, in our study, we did not observe any symptomatic recurrence or new onset of symptoms, thus demonstrating results that are consistent with those of previous studies.

Management of bleeding risk for invasive procedures

Complex changes occur to haemostatic systems in patients with cirrhosis, with both prothrombotic and anticoagulant arms of the clotting pathways affected. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT) and platelet count do not predict bleeding outcomes in most patients with cirrhosis, including those undergoing invasive procedures. People with cirrhosis are at increased risk of thrombosis, and bleeding risk tends to be related to other factors, primarily PHTN and vessel injury.

Both the American Gastroenterological Association and the European Association for the Study of the Liver have guidelines on managing clotting in people with cirrhosis undergoing invasive procedures. There are also recent British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on liver biopsy which include management of coagulation. There is broad consensus on the basic principles as follows.

There is no indication for blood products in order to prevent spontaneous bleeding, and no indication for vitamin K to correct PT, although it may be used in the context of cholestatic liver disease (eg, before endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)), to reverse warfarin, or where vitamin K deficiency in suspected (eg, severe malnourishment).

In patients with stable cirrhosis undergoing common, lower-risk procedures (bleeding risk < 1.5%) there is no indication to check or correct clotting or platelet count prior to the procedure. See table 3 for procedures with low/high bleeding risk.

Table 3
Procedural bleeding risk in patients with cirrhosis

In patients undergoing procedures with a higher bleeding risk (> 1.5%), laboratory assessment of haemostasis may be useful as a baseline to guide treatment if postprocedural bleeding occurs. Vasoelastic tests may be used to identify subgroups of patients with significantly increased bleeding risk and guide blood product use.

### Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in cirrhosis of the liver: are low-dose non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants a reasonable alternative to warfarin? [^115h3iWq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

A number of limitations to this analysis are worthwhile mentioning, particularly as they may represent opportunities for future research. The findings of this data set cannot necessarily be extrapolated to non‐Asian populations for reasons discussed above. In the absence of Child‐Pugh scores, it is not known how many patients had Child‐Pugh B or C liver disease, although 19% of patients on NOAC therapy had "advanced" liver disease in the form of complications. It is also of paramount importance to note that the vast majority of individuals in the NOAC group (> 90%) were taking low‐dose NOAC therapy; thus, any conclusions regarding the safety of standard‐dose therapy cannot be drawn. Moreover, further studies should ideally follow up patients for a longer period. Although the authors state that only some of the NOACs had risk reductions that were individually significant for bleeding end points, and other subpopulations (eg, type and severity of cirrhosis) had NOAC benefits on differing bleeding end points, the CIs were overlapping and interaction tests that were presented were nonsignificant, precluding conclusion on any true subgroup differences. Several factors relevant to the risk of both thromboembolic and bleeding complications were also not able to be assessed in this data set. The time spent in the therapeutic range for patients on warfarin was not available; it may be possible that benefits from NOACs are diminished with higher time in therapeutic range on warfarin. Other factors including blood pressure, renal function, and concomitant use of other medications were also not reported; these may increase bleeding risk and thus would be relevant to addressing this issue in the clinical setting. Study definitions were dependent on coding data, which may be subject to inaccuracies or differ from those used elsewhere, preventing between‐study comparison. Finally, even though the present data may represent the best available evidence on NOACs in AF patients with cirrhosis, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding in the absence of randomization, acknowledging that it is unlikely a large trial in this setting will be undertaken in the near future.

### Treatment response and bleeding events associated with anticoagulant therapy of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhotic patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111vKCCd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is defined as a clot within the portal vein trunk and/or its intrahepatic branches, the mesenteric vein, the hepatic veins and the splenic veins. PVT can be completely or partially occlusive and can be a life-threatening event if it extends into the superior mesenteric vein. Although the impact of PVT on the natural history of patients with cirrhosis is not well established, some evidence suggests that PVT may contribute to a poor prognosis in patients undergoing liver transplantation.

The natural course of untreated PVT is not known. Several studies have shown spontaneous resolution and/or no change in 30–75% of cases, and worsening in most of the remainder. Evidence suggests that a majority of these patients will benefit from some form of anticoagulation. Robust data on the optimal management of PVT in patients with cirrhosis are lacking and current guidelines do not propose definitive evidence-based treatment strategies. The best choice of anticoagulation is unknown in cirrhotic patients with PVT.

The classes of anticoagulant therapy for PVT in cirrhosis are vitamin K antagonists (VKA), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and, to a lesser extent, direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). DOAC in this context have been used in an "off-label" manner and current evidence is limited on its use in the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted this meta-analysis to update our knowledge of the use of anticoagulation in PVT patients with cirrhosis, focusing particularly on evidence concerning the use of DOAC.

### Safety and effectiveness of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and anemia: a retrospective cohort study [^116z6fz1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is frequently observed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and it may be associated with an increased risk of new‐onset AF. 1, 2 AF increases the risks of ischemic stroke (IS) and systemic embolism (SE). Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risks of IS/SE in AF but also increase the risk of bleeding, especially in patients with anemia. 3, 4, 5 In anticoagulated patients with AF, anemic patients have a higher prevalence of comorbidities, greater CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VAS C (Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 Years [doubled], Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack, or Thromboembolism [doubled], Vascular Disease, Age 65–74 Years, Sex Category) and HAS‐BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal Renal/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile International Normalized Ratio, Elderly, Drugs/Alcohol Concomitantly) scores, and increased risks of major bleeding, mortality, and anticoagulant discontinuation than those without anemia. 1, 6 Physicians are, thus, faced with a treatment dilemma when choosing anticoagulant therapies in patients with AF and anemia.

### Vascular liver disorders, portal vein thrombosis, and procedural bleeding in patients with liver disease: 2020 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113vpUtB]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis — Patients with cirrhosis were excluded from clinical trials comparing DOACs versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or atrial fibrillation, and in vitro studies using plasma from decompensated cirrhosis show differences in anticoagulant potency by thrombin generation assay that have not been validated in vivo studies. Clinical experience remains sparse and generally limited to highly select cohorts with well-compensated cirrhosis; overall, DOACs appear to have a similar safety profile in patients with compensated cirrhosis compared to patients without cirrhosis, and their use is expanding to atrial fibrillation, VTE, and PVT, with successful use of idarucizumab for reversal of dabigatran in a patient undergoing LT reported. Two studies have directly compared DOACs to VKAs in cirrhosis with PVT, with one involving 80 patients with recent PVT after elective splenectomy and the other involving 50 patients converted to oral therapy after 2 weeks of injectable LMWH therapy in a nonrandomized fashion; acknowledging the low level of evidence, bleeding rates were not significantly higher in patients treated with DOACs.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

In a pharmacokinetic study, compared to healthy adult subjects with normal liver function, AUC increases of 127% were observed in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B).

The safety or PK of XARELTO in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) has not been evaluated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment or with any hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy.

No clinical data are available in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment.

### Vitamin K-S (II) in liver disease… [^112YXFaX]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The patient with chronic liver disease leads a precarious existence. Metabolic function becomes impaired, and many complications arise which pose hazards to useful activity and even to life itself. Among these is the tendency to develop a hemorrhagic disorder. Since many blood clotting factors are produced in the liver, defects in its structure and function may play havoc with the hemostatic mechanism. Often such patients succumb to bleeding lesions which would not have been lethal if the blood clotting mechanism had been normal. Several excellent reviews on coagulation defects in patients with liver disease have appeared recently. 1–3 The clotting defects are usually multiple. Deficiencies of platelets, prothrombin, Factor V, Factor VII, Factor X, Factor IX, and fibrinogen have been observed. Fibrinolysis has been demonstrated in approximately 20% of patients with cirrhosis.

### Control of prothrombin deficiency in obstructive jaundice… [^114eiuLm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Abundant experimental and clinical evidence obtained in the past four years shows that a fat-soluble substance, called by Dam vitamin K, 1 conditions the formation of prothrombin by the liver. 2 In obstructive jaundice at least two factors tending to depress plasma prothrombin are at work, one being damage to the liver and disturbance in its synthetic function and the other the diminished absorption of vitamin K from the intestinal tract. Bile salts have been shown to be necessary for the absorption of fat-soluble substances from the intestinal canal, 3 and in obstructive jaundice the bile delivered into the duodenum may be deficient in bile salts as well as in total volume. Another factor of importance in lowering plasma prothrombin in patients with obstructive jaundice is loss of appetite with inadequate intake of foods containing vitamin K. The data presented in this report were obtained in the management of cases STEWART JD, ROURKE GM.

### Acerca de los sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K… [^114cjPEj]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Puntos clave
- Los sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K se producen cuando los bebés no pueden dejar de sangrar porque no tienen suficiente vitamina K.
- Los bebés están en mayor riesgo de presentar sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K hasta que empiecen a comer alimentos regulares.
- A menudo los sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K no producen signos de advertencia.
- Los sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K se pueden prevenir con una sola inyección de vitamina K. Lo que es La vitamina K es una sustancia que el cuerpo necesita para formar coágulos y para detener los sangrados. La vitamina K se obtiene de los alimentos que se consumen. Las bacterias buenas que viven en los intestinos de las personas también producen algo de vitamina K. Los bebés nacen con cantidades muy pequeñas de vitamina K almacenadas en el cuerpo, lo cual puede provocar problemas graves de sangrado si no se suplementan.

deficiencia vitamínica" o " deficiencia de vitaminas". Los sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K se producen cuando los bebés no pueden dejar de sangrar porque no tienen suficiente vitamina K en la sangre para que se forme un coágulo. Los sangrados pueden ocurrir en cualquier parte interna o externa del cuerpo. Cuando suceden adentro del cuerpo, pueden ser difíciles de notar. Es común que los bebés con sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K tengan sangrado en los intestinos o en el cerebro, lo cual puede provocar daño cerebral e incluso la muerte. Los bebés que no reciben la inyección de vitamina K al nacer pueden tener sangrados en cualquier momento hasta los 6 meses de edad.
- Heces con sangre, que son negras u oscuras y pegajosas, o vómitos con sangre.
- Irritabilidad, convulsiones, sueño excesivo o muchos vómitos.
- Los bebés con enfermedad del hígado, que a menudo no pueden usar la vitamina K que su cuerpo almacena.
- Los bebés con diarrea, enfermedad celíaca o fibrosis quística, que frecuentemente tienen dificultad para absorber las vitaminas, como la vitamina K, de los alimentos que consumen.

### Preguntas frecuentes acerca de los sangrados por… [^1139SrdV]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

R: El cuerpo usa la vitamina K para formar coágulos y para detener los sangrados. Los bebés nacen con una cantidad muy pequeña de vitamina K almacenada en el cuerpo. Esto se conoce como deficiencia de vitamina K y significa que el bebé tiene bajos niveles de esta vitamina. Sin la suficiente cantidad de vitamina K, los bebés no pueden producir las sustancias que se usan para formar coágulos, llamadas factores de coagulación. R: Los bebés que no tienen suficiente vitamina K no pueden formar coágulos para detener los sangrados y pueden sangrar en cualquier parte del cuerpo. Los sangrados pueden producirse en el cerebro u otros órganos importantes y pueden suceder rápidamente. Si bien los casos de sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K no ocurren con frecuencia en los Estados Unidos, cuando sí ocurren, son devastadores. R: No. A principios de la década de 1990, un pequeño estudio en Inglaterra halló una "asociación" entre la inyección de vitamina K y el cáncer infantil.

Una asociación significa que dos cosas están sucediendo al mismo tiempo en la misma persona, pero no nos dice si una causa la otra. La inyección de vitamina K actúa de dos maneras para aumentar los niveles de esta vitamina. Primero, parte de la vitamina K pasa al torrente sanguíneo del bebé inmediatamente y aumenta la cantidad de esta vitamina en la sangre. Esto proporciona suficiente vitamina K para que. los niveles del bebé no se reduzcan peligrosamente en los primeros días de vida. Gran parte de esta vitamina K se almacena en el hígado y es usada por el sistema de coagulación. Segundo, el resto de la vitamina K se libera lentamente a lo largo de los próximos 2 a 3 meses, lo cual ofrece una fuente constante de vitamina K hasta que el bebé tenga otra fuente proveniente de su alimentación.

El principal beneficio de la inyección de vitamina K es que puede proteger a su bebé de los sangrados por deficiencia de esta vitamina, una condición médica peligrosa que puede causar una discapacidad a largo plazo o la muerte. Además, el diagnóstico y tratamiento de los sangrados por deficiencia de vitamina K con frecuencia incluye procedimientos múltiples, que a veces son dolorosos, como muestras de sangre, tomografías computarizadas, transfusiones de sangre, o anestesia y operaciones.
