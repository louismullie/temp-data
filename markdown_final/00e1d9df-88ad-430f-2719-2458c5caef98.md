## Question

A 29-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, presents at 18 weeks' gestation for routine prenatal care. Her first pregnancy ended in a spontaneous preterm birth at 30 weeks. She is currently carrying a singleton pregnancy and has been compliant with vaginal progesterone supplementation since 12 weeks' gestation. A transvaginal ultrasound today reveals a cervical length of 18 mm. She asks about additional measures to reduce her risk of another preterm birth. Separately, her friend, who is pregnant with twins and has no prior preterm births, asks if she should request a cerclage to prevent preterm labor.

Based on current ACOG guidelines, what is the appropriate use of cervical cerclage in these two scenarios? Justify your answer according to the recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate use of cervical cerclage in two scenarios: a singleton pregnancy with a prior preterm birth and a short cervix on vaginal progesterone, and a twin pregnancy with no prior preterm birth. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical risk profiles and how they map to guideline indications. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for cerclage in each scenario. Next, I will align recommendations with ACOG Practice Bulletin 234 and related guidance. Finally, I will consider timing, alternatives, and counseling points, and I will double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical details and risk stratification. In Scenario A, the patient is 18 weeks with a singleton, a prior spontaneous preterm birth at 30 weeks, and a current cervical length of 18 mm while already receiving vaginal progesterone. In Scenario B, the patient is pregnant with twins, has no prior preterm birth, and is asking about prophylactic cerclage. I need to ensure I anchor these to ACOG's risk categories and thresholds, particularly the < 25 mm cervical length threshold and the distinction between singleton and multiple gestations [^83d197ec] [^89deae99].

> Now, for Scenario A, I should confirm whether ultrasound-indicated cerclage is recommended. ACOG advises that patients with a singleton, prior spontaneous preterm birth, and a short cervix in the second trimester who are already on progesterone should be counseled that cerclage may be offered in addition to continuing progesterone, with shared decision-making emphasized given uncertainty about the best single approach [^83d197ec] [^58ff0aee]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit. Meta-analytic data show that in women with prior spontaneous preterm birth and cervical length < 25 mm before 24 weeks, cerclage reduces preterm birth before 35 weeks and composite neonatal morbidity, which supports offering the procedure in this context [^c52ba33c].

> Hold on, I should verify timing and thresholds. ACOG supports considering cerclage when cervical length is < 25 mm before 24 weeks, and this patient at 18 weeks with 18 mm meets that window. I initially thought the threshold might be 15 mm, but that 15 mm figure pertains to a different question about very short cervix in women without prior preterm birth, so I need to correct that and stick with the < 25 mm threshold for those with prior spontaneous preterm birth [^83d197ec] [^c52ba33c]. I should also confirm that cerclage is not recommended after 24 weeks; indeed, ACOG advises against cerclage beyond 24 weeks absent compelling indications, reinforcing the need to act now if chosen [^f41304c0].

> Next, I should review alternatives and the role of progesterone. Vaginal progesterone is already on board and should be continued, and there is no direct head-to-head trial versus cerclage in this exact population. Indirect comparisons suggest similar relative risk reductions for preterm birth before 35 weeks, supporting a shared decision-making approach rather than a mandated switch [^75b90105]. Let me consider whether adding a pessary helps; ACOG does not recommend a cervical pessary in singletons with short cervix and no prior preterm birth, and evidence is insufficient to add it here, so I should not propose a pessary in this scenario [^ef441179].

> For Scenario B, I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize from singleton data. ACOG explicitly recommends not offering cervical cerclage for the prevention of preterm birth based solely on multiple gestation, and routine prophylactic cerclage in unselected twins does not improve outcomes and may be harmful in some analyses [^ef122e3d] [^74363608]. Wait, let me verify whether any subgroup might benefit. Observational and pooled analyses suggest potential benefit only when cervical length is very short, around ≤ 15 mm, but this remains controversial and is not a routine recommendation in ACOG guidance, so I should not advise cerclage solely for twins without a compelling cervical indication [^738245ae] [^83d197ec].

> But wait, what if the twins have cervical dilation or a markedly short cervix? I should double-check the rescue cerclage exception. ACOG notes that in twin gestations with asymptomatic cervical dilation in the second trimester, limited randomized data suggest benefit from examination-indicated cerclage, though selection is critical and evidence is limited; this is not the same as prophylactic cerclage for a short cervix alone, and it should be framed as a conditional, individualized rescue strategy rather than routine care [^be5dafc5]. I need to ensure I distinguish this rescue scenario from the friend's current ask, which is about prophylactic cerclage without cervical change [^be5dafc5].

> I should confirm practical next steps and counseling. For Scenario A, I would discuss the potential benefits and risks of adding cerclage now, including procedure-related complications and the need for removal around 36–37 weeks if undelivered, while continuing vaginal progesterone. If the patient declines cerclage, I would continue close cervical surveillance given her risk profile [^83d197ec] [^60281cbf]. For Scenario B, I would advise against prophylactic cerclage, explain that routine cervical length screening in twins is not universally recommended, and reserve intervention for specific high-risk cervical findings such as marked shortening or dilation, ideally in a tertiary center with MFM input [^89deae99] [^46ce2804].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly. In the singleton with prior preterm birth and short cervix on progesterone, ACOG supports offering ultrasound-indicated cerclage in addition to continued progesterone, with shared decision-making and timing before 24 weeks, given demonstrated reductions in preterm birth and neonatal morbidity in this population [^83d197ec] [^c52ba33c]. In the twin pregnancy with no prior preterm birth, ACOG recommends against routine cerclage, and prophylactic cerclage should not be offered solely for multiple gestation; any consideration would be limited to exceptional scenarios like very short cervix or cervical dilation where evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized [^ef122e3d] [^74363608].

In a 29-year-old G2P1 at 18 weeks with a history of spontaneous preterm birth at 30 weeks and a current cervical length of 18 mm on vaginal progesterone, **ACOG recommends offering cerclage** [^83d197ec] because she has a singleton pregnancy, a prior spontaneous preterm birth, and a cervical length < 25 mm before 24 weeks [^c52ba33c]. This strategy reduces preterm birth and neonatal morbidity [^c52ba33c]. For a twin pregnancy with no prior preterm birth, **ACOG does not recommend routine cerclage** [^ef122e3d] because it does not reduce preterm birth or neonatal morbidity in unselected twins [^74363608]; cerclage may be considered only if the cervix is ≤ 15 mm or if there is cervical dilation, with individualized decision-making [^738245ae] [^1b024331].

---

## Patient scenario 1: singleton pregnancy with prior preterm birth and short cervix

### Clinical scenario

- **Patient**: 29-year-old G2P1 at 18 weeks' gestation.
- **History**: Prior spontaneous preterm birth at 30 weeks.
- **Current pregnancy**: Singleton, receiving vaginal progesterone since 12 weeks.
- **Findings**: Cervical length 18 mm on transvaginal ultrasound.

---

### ACOG recommendations

ACOG Practice Bulletin 234 recommends that patients with a singleton gestation, prior spontaneous preterm birth, and a short second-trimester cervix who are already receiving progesterone **may be offered cerclage** in addition to continued progesterone [^83d197ec]. This is supported by evidence that cerclage reduces preterm birth before 35 weeks and composite neonatal morbidity in this population [^c52ba33c].

---

### Evidence supporting cerclage in this scenario

Meta-analyses show that in singleton pregnancies with prior spontaneous preterm birth and cervical length < 25 mm before 24 weeks, **cerclage reduces preterm birth before 35 weeks** (28% vs 41%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55–0.89) and composite neonatal morbidity (15.6% vs 24.8%; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45–0.91) [^c52ba33c]. Benefits are greater when cervical length is < 15 mm [^c52ba33c].

---

### Timing and technique

Cerclage is typically performed between 12 and 24 weeks' gestation, ideally before 24 weeks [^4df847a0]. The McDonald or Shirodkar techniques are acceptable, with similar outcomes; the choice depends on surgeon preference and expertise [^e6d78df8].

---

### Counseling points

Counseling should cover potential benefits — reduced preterm birth and neonatal morbidity — versus risks, including cervical laceration, infection, and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) [^de4e7396]. Shared decision-making is essential, especially when cervical length is 15–25 mm, where absolute benefit is smaller [^notfound].

---

## Patient scenario 2: twin pregnancy with no prior preterm birth

### Clinical scenario

- **Patient**: Twin pregnancy, no prior preterm births.
- **Question**: Should she request cerclage to prevent preterm labor?

---

### ACOG recommendations

ACOG Practice Bulletin 234 states that **cerclage should not be offered** for the prevention of preterm birth based solely on multiple gestation [^ef122e3d]. Routine prophylactic cerclage in unselected twin pregnancies does not reduce preterm birth or neonatal morbidity and may increase risks [^74363608].

---

### Evidence regarding cerclage in twin pregnancies

Randomized and observational data show no benefit of routine cerclage in twin pregnancies with short cervix; some studies suggest harm, including increased preterm birth and neonatal morbidity [^74363608] [^738245ae]. A Cochrane review found no reduction in preterm birth or perinatal death with cerclage in twins [^74363608].

---

### Exceptions and individualized considerations

Cerclage may be considered in twin pregnancies with **very short cervical length (≤ 15 mm)** or with cervical dilation, where limited evidence suggests potential benefit [^738245ae] [^1b024331]. Decisions should be individualized, with careful counseling about uncertain benefits and potential risks [^46ce2804].

---

### Alternative strategies

For twin pregnancies, ACOG does not recommend routine cervical length screening or prophylactic interventions such as vaginal progesterone or cervical pessary, as evidence does not support their routine use in this population [^89deae99] [^66709cb4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Acog recommendation** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|-|
| Singleton pregnancy with prior preterm birth and short cervix (< 25 mm) | Offer cerclage in addition to progesterone | Cerclage reduces preterm birth and neonatal morbidity [^c52ba33c] |
| Twin pregnancy with no prior preterm birth | Do not offer routine cerclage | No benefit; possible harm [^74363608] [^738245ae] |
| Twin pregnancy with very short cervix (≤ 15 mm) or cervical dilation | Consider cerclage individually | Limited evidence; individualized decision-making [^738245ae] [^1b024331] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical advice

For the 29-year-old G2P1 with a prior preterm birth and cervical length 18 mm at 18 weeks, **ACOG supports offering cerclage** in addition to continued vaginal progesterone, with counseling on benefits and risks [^83d197ec]. For the twin pregnancy with no prior preterm birth, **ACOG does not recommend routine cerclage**; cerclage may be considered only if the cervix is very short or dilated, with individualized decision-making [^ef122e3d] [^738245ae].

### ACOG practice bulletin no.142: cerclage for the management of cervical insufficiency [^8b07dde2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The inability of the uterine cervix to retain a pregnancy in the second trimester is referred to as cervical insufficiency. Controversy exists in the medical literature pertaining to issues of pathophysiology, screening, diagnosis, and management of cervical insufficiency. The purpose of this document is to provide a review of current evidence of cervical insufficiency, including screening of asymptomatic at-risk women, and to offer guidelines on the use of cerclage for management. The diagnosis and management of other cervical issues during pregnancy, such as short cervical length, are discussed more in-depth in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

### Guidelines on cerclage placement: a comparative systematic review [^089a1761]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to systematically identify, summarize, and compare professional medical-society guidelines on cervical and abdominal cerclage.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus on May 15, 2024 following PRISMA guidelines. The search included English-language clinical practice guidelines published between 2011 and 2024 addressing cervical cerclage.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Guidelines were independently screened and selected by two reviewers. Quality was assessed using the AGREE II instrument. Data were extracted into a standardized form and synthesized narratively, focusing on comparing recommendations regarding indications, contraindications, timing, technique, and perioperative management of cerclage placement.

Results

Twenty guidelines from ten professional societies were included. Consensus existed on several key indications, including history-indicated cerclage for ≥ 3 second-trimester losses, ultrasound-indicated cerclage for cervical lengths under 10 mm, and abdominal cerclage in cases of prior transvaginal cerclage failure or insufficient cervical tissue. However, disagreements remain. For instance, ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) recommends considering cerclage after one loss, whereas most guidelines require three. There is also variation regarding the timing of physical examination cerclage beyond 24 weeks, with NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) extending the window to 28 weeks. Additionally, recommendations diverge on cerclage for prolapsed membranes, with some guidelines advising against the procedure due to a high risk of failure, while others support considering it.

Conclusions

Guidelines agree on history-indicated cerclage for ≥ 3 second-trimester losses, ultrasound-indicated cerclage for cervical lengths under 10 mm, and abdominal cerclage in cases of prior transvaginal cerclage failure or insufficient cervical tissue. While agreement exists on key indications and contraindications, notable divergences remain in certain recommendations. This review emphasizes the need for congruent recommendations to enhance consistency.

2 ASYMPTOMATIC WOMEN WITH A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF PRETERM BIRTH

History‐indicated cerclages have been shown to be beneficial in specific populations. A pre‐specified subgroup analysis of an international multicenter trial encompassing 1292 women indicated benefit from a cerclage, inserted prophylactically during the first trimester, in women who had undergone three or more previous preterm births and/or second‐trimester losses. The preterm birth rate before 33 weeks of gestation was halved in women who had undergone cerclage (15% vs 32%). This effect was not observed in women with two or fewer previous preterm deliveries. Where women had had one previous preterm birth, the rate of preterm birth before 33 weeks was 14% versus 17% in the expectant group. Where women had undergone two previous preterm deliveries, the rate of preterm birth was 12% in the cerclage group versus 14% in the expectant group.

Recommendation: A history ‐ indicated cerclage should be offered in women who have had three or more preterm deliveries and / or mid ‐ trimester losses.

### Vaginal progesterone for pregnancy prolongation after arrested preterm labor… [^85422465]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Is vaginal micronized progesterone at 200 mg twice a day effective for pregnancy prolongation after arrested preterm labor. Findings In this randomized clinical trial in 129 women with arrested preterm labor between 24 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 0 days' gestation, VMP did not prolong pregnancy or prevent spontaneous preterm delivery compared with no treatment. In a subgroup of 27 pairs of twins, VMP significantly prolonged pregnancy from a mean 26 to 44 days. Meaning These findings suggest that after arrested preterm labor, VMP in a dosage of 200 mg twice a day is not useful as a maintenance therapy in singleton pregnancies but warrants further investigation in twin pregnancies. Importance Women with arrested preterm labor are at very high risk for spontaneous preterm delivery, the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. To date, no maintenance therapy has been found to be effective for pregnancy prolongation.

A few clinical trials with considerable methodological limitations have demonstrated some efficacy for 400 mg vaginal micronized progesterone in women with APTL. Interventions Participants were randomly allocated to receive VMP 200 mg twice a day or no treatment until 36 weeks 6 days' gestation. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end points were mean number of days from study enrollment to delivery and the rate of SPTD prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Interestingly, 3 of 4 RCTs that used 400 mg vaginal progesterone demonstrated significant pregnancy prolongation in the vaginal progesterone group, 12, 17–19 yet those studies had considerable methodological limitations. In addition, the effect of vaginal micronized progesterone in twin pregnancies was not investigated. 15, 16 In the present study, we investigated the effect of daily 400 mg VMP for the prolongation of pregnancy after APTL in singleton and twin pregnancies.

Patients diagnosed with APTL were allocated to receive either VMP, 200 mg twice a day vs no treatment. Both participants and physicians were unmasked to group allocation. The first dose of the VMP was administered at least 24 hours after initial treatment with tocolytics and up to 3 days after completing the tocolytic treatment until 36 weeks 6 days' gestation or delivery. The primary end points were the mean number of days from enrollment to delivery and the rate of SPTD. Secondary end points included pregnancy prolongation until 37 weeks. We addressed this end point since it was the period when the participants received the study treatment and the most important time to prevent birth.

Additional secondary end points were the number of days from recruitment to repeated PTL episode or PPROM up to 37 weeks, pregnancy prolongation beyond 1 week, need for repeated tocolysis, number of hospitalizations and length of stay until 36 weeks 6 days' gestation, and the rate of SPTD. We chose the mean difference of 7 days based on previous studies of progesterone treatment following APTL that were summarized in a meta-analysis, 16 which demonstrated a mean difference of 9 days between the progesterone and control groups and an SD range of 10 to 35 days.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on cervical cerclage for prevention of preterm birth [^040ea26e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cervical cerclage is a commonly performed intervention in the care of women at risk of preterm birth and second‐trimester fetal loss. A suture is placed in the cervix to prevent preterm dilatation. There remains uncertainty surrounding the population of women who are most likely to benefit and the optimal surgical techniques to be used. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta‐analyses have been undertaken to help provide an evidence‐based approach to management.

1.1 Type of cerclage

Cerclages can be categorized by the indication for insertion:
History‐indicated, performed in asymptomatic women with risk factors in the obstetric or gynecologic history that increase the risk of preterm birth.
Ultrasound‐indicated, performed on asymptomatic women with cervical shortening.
Rescue cerclage, where the cervix is already open and the fetal membranes exposed.

Vaginal cerclage insertion, either ultrasound‐ or history‐indicated, is not associated with an increased risk of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, or cesarean section.

### Prediction and prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 234 [^99efd50d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Cervical cerclage — ultrasound-indicated cerclage for short cervix without prior preterm birth: Cerclage has been assessed in five randomized trials that enrolled patients with a short cervical length in the second trimester, and none of the patients received vaginal progesterone, with a meta-analysis using individual data from the 419 patients without a prior preterm birth. In patients with a cervical length less than 25 mm, cerclage did not decrease the risk of preterm birth before 37 0/7 weeks of gestation (36.3% versus 41.0%; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73–1.18) or preterm birth before 34 0/7 weeks of gestation (20.1% versus 25.1%; RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.63–1.27). However, in a planned subgroup analysis of the 126 patients with a cervical length of less than 10 mm, patients who received cerclage had a lower risk of delivery before 35 0/7 weeks of gestation (39.5% versus 58.0%; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47–0.98). Cervical cerclage is of uncertain effectiveness in patients with a short cervix and no history of preterm birth; however, there is evidence of potential benefit in patients with a very short cervical length.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 199: use of prophylactic antibiotics in labor and delivery [^24771586]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cervical cerclage — antibiotic prophylaxis: current evidence and selected trial outcomes. Because the complication rate after history-indicated cerclage is low (1–5%), evidence is insufficient to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for history-, ultrasonography-, or examination-indicated cervical cerclage. For cerclage later in pregnancy with dilatation/effacement, complications are more frequent and preexisting subclinical chorioamnionitis averages approximately 33%. In one randomized group of 53 women given indomethacin and antibiotics vs placebo, mean gestational latency did not differ, but latency greater than 28 days was more frequent with intervention (92.3% versus 62.5%, P = 0.01), and neither perinatal survival nor composite adverse neonatal outcome differed. Other randomized trials have not uniformly included prophylaxis, and the current evidence remains insufficient to recommend for or against antibiotic prophylaxis for any cerclage indication.

Discussion

Choosing the most appropriate course of action for the risk of preterm birth before or around viability is a challenge. Evidence-based guidelines aim to assist the obstetrician in decision-making in clinical practice. We investigated consensus and differences among international, national, and regional guidelines to obtain a better overview of current recommendations in the setting of increased risk for preterm birth. Most guidelines propose different therapeutic options for most situations and often a single definitive recommendation is missing, leaving the decision most often up to the clinician.

There is no general agreement, whether or not a pregnancy should be monitored by routine serial cervical measurements. While unnecessary interventions may emerge from routinely performed measurements on the one hand, early interventions may positively influence the outcome of the pregnancies on the other hand.

Overall, we face multiple options and significant differences between established guidelines. Things become even more complicated as there may be various definitions on basic terms such as cervical shortening. In fact, cut-off values for cervical shortening used by various guidelines ranged from 15 to 25 mm (Fig. 3).

Main findings

Most guidelines recommend progesterone (P) treatment for cervical shortening, for patients without a history of preterm birth. Those patients, who suffered from a previous preterm delivery, should be offered mainly a cervical cerclage (C). This result is supported by two recent meta-analyses. Romero et al. showed that vaginal progesterone decreased the risk of preterm birth in singleton pregnancies with a shortened cervix, when compared to placebo. Likewise, Berghella et al. demonstrated that a cerclage reduced preterm birth among singleton gestations with short cervical length, especially for those patients with a prior preterm birth.

The latest gestational week that may be suitable for the insertion of a cervical cerclage is still under debate. ACOG, AWMF, CNGOF, EAPM, KCE, SCOG, QL suggest that the cerclage should not be inserted later than 24 weeks of gestation (while NICE sees an indication for it up to 27 + 6 weeks of gestation).

Examination-indicated cerclage in twin gestation with asymptomatic cervical dilation — A 2020 randomized controlled trial of women with twin pregnancies and dilation 1–5 cm between 16 0/7 and 23 6/7 weeks reported lower preterm birth with cerclage versus no cerclage at multiple thresholds: before 34 weeks, 12/17 (70%) versus 13/13 (100%) (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.96); before 32 weeks, 11/17 (64.7%) versus 13/13 (100%) (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46–0.92); before 28 weeks, 7/17 (41%) versus 11/13 (84%) (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26–0.89); and before 24 weeks, 5/17 (30%) versus 11/13 (84%) (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.16–0.75). Based on these limited data, cervical cerclage may be of benefit for women with twin gestation and cervical dilation in the second trimester.

3 ASYMPTOMATIC WOMEN WITH A SHORT CERVIX

Where high‐risk women undergo ultrasound surveillance of cervical length and cervical shortening < 25 mm is identified, a cerclage has been found to be beneficial when inserted at gestations less than 24 weeks. A meta‐analysis including data from four RCTs indicated that an ultrasound‐indicated cerclage for a cervical length < 25 mm in women who had had one or more spontaneous mid‐trimester losses or preterm births reduced the incidence of birth before 35 weeks (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.33–0.99 in women who had a previous second‐trimester loss, and RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.4–0.92 in women with a previous preterm birth before 36 weeks of gestation).

Recommendation: An ultrasound ‐ indicated cerclage should be offered to women with a cervical length < 25 mm if they have had one or more spontaneous preterm birth and / or mid ‐ trimester loss.

### Cervical cerclage during periviability: can we stabilize a moving target? [^4df847a0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recently published consensus guidelines on periviable birth recommending that obstetric interventions (antenatal corticosteroids, tocolysis, magnesium sulfate, antibiotics for preterm premature rupture of membranes or group B streptococcus prophylaxis, and cesarean delivery for fetal indications) may be considered at 23 0/7 weeks of gestation and neonatal resuscitation at 22 0/7 weeks of gestation. Cervical cerclage significantly decreases preterm delivery and improves perinatal outcomes in women with a singleton pregnancy, prior spontaneous preterm birth, and transvaginal cervical length less than 25 mm before 24 0/7 weeks of gestation or in women who experience painless cervix dilation in the second trimester. Randomized trials assessing ultrasonogram-indicated and physical examination-indicated cerclage report a procedure-related complication rate of 0.3% and 0.9%, respectively. If previability is a requisite for receiving a cerclage, an increasing subset of women may not be afforded an intervention that has known benefit, because obstetric and neonatal interventions are likely to occur at earlier gestational ages. Given the low procedure-related complication rate demonstrated in randomized trials, appropriately selected women should continue to be offered the procedure up to 24 0/7 weeks of gestation. Based on current evidence, cerclage placed after 24 0/7 weeks of gestation cannot be recommended, and future inquiry in the form of a well-designed randomized trial after this gestational age should be considered. The goal of this commentary is to review the history of cerclage and discuss the indications, risks, benefits, and implications on future research of this procedure as it relates to gestational age during periviability.

Cerclage for prior preterm birth with short cervix — effect estimates and thresholds: A meta-analysis of four randomized trials found no overall benefit, but patient-level subanalysis showed decreased preterm birth before 35 weeks in singleton pregnancies with prior preterm birth (relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.92); in a randomized trial of 302 women with cervical length less than 25 mm there was no overall difference before 35 weeks, whereas a planned sub-analysis of those with cervical length less than 15 mm showed benefit before 35 0/7 weeks (odds ratio [OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.08–0.66; P = 0.006). A subsequent meta-analysis including five trials reported that in people with previous spontaneous preterm birth and cervical length less than 25 mm before 24 weeks, cerclage reduced preterm birth before 35 weeks (28% versus 41%; RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.89) and composite neonatal morbidity (15.6% versus 24.8%; RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45–0.91). In patients who receive a cerclage, further ultrasound monitoring of cervical length does not appear to be beneficial.

A meta-analysis that included a randomized controlled trial, two prospective cohort studies, and seven retrospective cohort studies found that cerclage was associated with prolongation of pregnancy (mean difference, 33.98 days; 95% CI, 17.88–50.08 days) and increased neonatal survival (71% versus 43%; RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.19–2.28) (129). Maternal and operative complications including cervical laceration, intraoperative rupture of membranes, and sepsis were reported inconsistently and variably in the included studies.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on cervical cerclage for prevention of preterm birth [^a61cac19]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cervical cerclage is an intervention which when given to the right women can prevent preterm birth and second‐trimester fetal losses. A history‐indicated cerclage should be offered to women who have had three or more preterm deliveries and/or mid‐trimester losses. An ultrasound‐indicated cerclage should be offered to women with a cervical length < 25 mm if they have had one or more spontaneous preterm birth and/or mid‐trimester loss. In high‐risk women who have not had a previous mid‐trimester loss or preterm birth, an ultrasound‐indicated cerclage does not have a clear benefit in women with a short cervix. However, for twins, the advantage seems more likely at shorter cervical lengths (< 15 mm). In women who present with exposed membranes prolapsing through the cervical os, a rescue cerclage can be considered on an individual case basis, taking into account the high risk of infective morbidity to mother and baby. An abdominal cerclage can be offered in women who have had a failed cerclage (delivery before 28 weeks after a history or ultrasound‐indicated [but not rescue] cerclage). If preterm birth has not occurred, removal is considered at 36–37 weeks in women anticipating a vaginal delivery.

Purpose

The purpose of this document is to review current methods for cervical ripening and to summarize the effectiveness of these approaches based on appropriately conducted outcomes-based research. This document focuses on cervical ripening in individuals with term, singleton, vertex pregnancies with membranes intact, because this is the population in whom most studies were conducted. For more information on recommended timing of delivery based on maternal, fetal, and obstetric conditions and on labor management, refer to: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion No. 831, Medically Indicated Late-Preterm and Early-Term Deliveries (1); Practice Bulletin No. 217, Prelabor Rupture of Membranes (2); Obstetric Care Consensus No. 10, Management of Stillbirth (3); Practice Bulletin No. 205, Vaginal Birth After Cesarean Delivery (4); and Clinical Practice Guideline No. 8, First and Second Stage Labor Management (5).

Target Population

Individuals with term, singleton, vertex pregnancies with membranes intact.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of two maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists and one specialist in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Obstetrics. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within the Cochrane Library, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, Ovid MEDLINE, and PubMed and searched for guidelines from ACOG and other organizations. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes an overview of cervical ripening indications, contraindications, and methods and provides recommendations for pharmacologic, mechanical, and combination method cervical ripening in individuals with term, singleton, vertex pregnancies with membranes intact. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality.

Twin pregnancy — prophylactic cervical cerclage (unselected twins): A Cochrane review found no benefit to cerclage with regard to delivery before 34 weeks of gestation (46.2% with cerclage versus 31.8% without; RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.44–3.06), perinatal death (19.2% versus 9.5%; RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.92–3.28), or serious neonatal morbidity (15.8% versus 13.6%; RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.13–7.10). Although the total number is limited, there is no evidence of benefit for prophylactic cerclage in unselected twin pregnancies, and Cervical cerclage is not recommended for prevention of preterm birth based solely on the indication of multiple gestation.

### Prelabor rupture of membranes: ACOG practice bulletin, number 217 [^fe0e458d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 217 — cervical cerclage in preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (preterm PROM): There are no complete prospective studies to guide care for women with preterm PROM who have a cervical cerclage, and one randomized trial terminated early failed to determine differences in outcomes between removal and retention. Retrospective reports generally have found that cerclage retention for more than 24 hours after preterm PROM is associated with pregnancy prolongation, but in some, retention has been associated with increased rates of neonatal mortality from sepsis, neonatal sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, and maternal chorioamnionitis. A firm recommendation regarding whether a cerclage should be removed after preterm PROM cannot be made, and either removal or retention is reasonable, and regardless, if a cerclage remains in place, prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis beyond 7 days is not recommended.

### Progesterone, cervical cerclage or cervical pessary to prevent preterm birth: a decision-making analysis of international guidelines [^daa6900d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A shortened cervix and or a history of preterm birth under 34 weeks of gestation is relevant in the decision-making process. In case of cervical shortening without a history of preterm birth, guidelines generally recommend the application of progesterone until 34–36 weeks of gestation. In case of cervical shortening in combination with a history of preterm birth a cervical cerclage is the most commonly recommended therapy. In case of cervical opening, a physical examination indicated cerclage should be considered in the absent of contractions or signs of tripe I. In case of unsuccessful vaginal cervical cerclage or after earlier cervical amputation, an abdominal cerclage is a therapeutic option. In general, the combination of two of the three therapeutic options (progesterone, cervical pessary and cervical cerclage) or the use of a cervical pessary is not recommended. In the setting of twin pregnancies, most guidelines recommend abstention from active treatment.

This editorial critically examines the definition of "cervical insufficiency". The definition, the clinical ascertainment, efforts to develop an objective method of diagnosis, as well as the nature of cervical disease leading to spontaneous mid-trimester spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery are reviewed. The value and limitations of cervical sonography as a risk assessment tool for spontaneous preterm delivery are appraised. The main focus is on the role of cervical cerclage to prevent an adverse pregnancy outcome. The value of assessing the presence or absence of endocervical inflammation in the outcome of cerclage placement is discussed.

6 ASYMPTOMATIC WOMEN WITH PREVIOUS UNSUCCESSFUL CERCLAGE

In high‐risk women who have previously undergone an unsuccessful cerclage, a transabdominal cerclage can be inserted in situations with adequate operative resources. The suture is inserted via the abdomen, more proximally. Its use is supported by evidence from a multicenter RCT of transabdominal cerclage versus a vaginally placed high or low cervical cerclage that rates of preterm birth < 32 weeks of gestation and fetal losses were lower (8% vs 33%; RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.07–0.76) in women who received transabdominal cerclage. There were also fewer fetal losses (3% vs 21%; RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.016–0.93). In this trial preterm birth rates < 32 weeks were similar in women receiving high or low vaginal cerclage (38% vs 33%). This can be placed either at laparotomy or laparoscopy. Pre‐conceptual insertion should be considered when possible due to reduced anesthetic risks and the technical advantages of operating on a non‐pregnant uterus. There is no evidence that pre‐conceptual placement has a detrimental effect on fertility or the management of early miscarriage. A link to a video of the procedure is given in Suff et al.

Recommendation: In women who have had a failed cerclage (delivery before 28 weeks after a history ‐ or ultrasound ‐ indicated [but not rescue] cerclage), an abdominal cerclage can be offered.

4 ASYMPTOMATIC WOMEN WITH OTHER RISK FACTORS OR MÜLLERIAN ABNORMALITIES

The role of history‐ or ultrasound‐indicated cerclage is less evident in other high‐risk groups such as women with Müllerian abnormalities or cervical surgery, as there have been only preliminary studies to inform practice. A meta‐analysis of 27 retrospective cohort studies showed an increased risk of preterm birth < 37 weeks of gestation when cold knife conization was compared with no treatment (14% vs 5%; RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.8–3.72) and LLETZ versus no treatment (11% vs 7%; RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.14–1.35. In women with a short cervix and history of cervical surgery, management should be individualized, but some clinicians consider cerclage with a cervical length < 25 mm. There is a lack of randomized controlled trials to support the use of either ultrasound‐ or history‐indicated cerclage in women with multiple pregnancieswithout additional risk factors. If cerclage is considered in a twin pregnancy, observational evidence suggests that benefit is more likely with a shorter cervix (< 15 mm). If a cervix is incidentally noted as short in a low‐risk population, no benefit appears to be conferred from an ultrasound‐indicated cerclage.,

Recommendation: In high ‐ risk women who have not had a previous mid ‐ trimester loss or preterm birth, an ultrasound ‐ indicated cerclage does not have a clear benefit in women with a short cervix but can be considered on an individual case basis. For twins, the advantage seems more likely at shorter cervical lengths (< 15 mm).

### Progesterone, cervical cerclage or cervical pessary to prevent preterm birth: a decision-making analysis of international guidelines [^5fa71ade]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

In case of cervical opening, all guidelines, mentioning this specific situation, agree on rescue cerclage (Fig. 3).

The majority of the guidelines advise against prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in twin pregnancies with or without a history of preterm birth (H0 and H1) and CL ≥ or < 25 mm. The other guidelines recommend P with or without Pess, cerclage in case of risk factors (S/T/A yes) or abstain from a recommendation.

There is consensus on the recommendation towards abdominal cerclage after failure of cervical cerclage or after cervical amputation. However, only four out of ten guidelines address this issue at all (Fig. 2).

Progesterone (P) and Cerclage (C) have been considered as treatment options in every guideline, however not always for the same conditions. Eight out of ten guidelines recommended only progesterone treatment and six out of ten guidelines saw specific indications for a cerclage as monotherapy. Seven out of ten guidelines left the decision to the physician to choose between C and P (Table 2). The option of combining a cervical pessary (Pess) with P was only mentioned in the AWMF guideline, and ACOG and the Japanese guideline were the only ones mentioning the possible combination of C and P represented as C&orP. ACOG and CNGOF used the history of cervical surgery/trauma or anatomical anomaly (S/T/A) as an indication for cerclage (Table 2).

Cervical length monitoring — patients with prior preterm birth: A short cervix in the second trimester is a strong predictor of preterm birth in patients with a prior preterm delivery, and the two risk factors are additive; therefore, serial endovaginal ultrasound monitoring of cervical length is recommended for all patients with a prior preterm birth, usually initiated at about 16 0/7 weeks and repeated every 1–4 weeks until 24 0/7 weeks, with options for intervention (cerclage or vaginal progesterone) if cervical length is 25 mm or less.

Key Points for Practice
- Preterm birth rates can be reduced by ceasing tobacco and alcohol use, increasing contraception access, and increasing interpregnancy intervals to at least 18 months.
- Daily vaginal progesterone starting between 20 and 24 weeks until 34 weeks' gestation can reduce preterm birth risk for patients with cervical shortening or a history of preterm birth.
- When a visually dilated cervix is identified, cervical cerclage therapy increases pregnancy duration and improves neonatal survival. From the AFP Editors. Preterm birth, or delivery occurring between 20 and 37 weeks' gestation, may be spontaneous or due to a maternal or fetal complication. Early preterm birth occurs up to 34 weeks' gestation, and late preterm birth occurs between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation. Preterm births account for one in 10 deliveries, and 3% of births are early preterm.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has new recommendations for predicting and preventing preterm birth. Risk Factors All pregnant patients are at risk for preterm birth, and one in 20 nulliparous patients will deliver preterm. Many risk factors for preterm birth are unmodifiable. Multiple pregnancies confer the highest risk, with preterm births occurring in 60% of twin pregnancies and 98% of triplet pregnancies. A history of preterm birth is a strong risk factor for subsequent preterm birth, although a term birth after the preterm birth reduces future risk. The risk for preterm birth in a subsequent single pregnancy is elevated even when the preterm birth was a twin delivery. A history of dilation and curettage increases the risk of preterm birth by approximately 30% for a single procedure and more for multiple procedures.

Although a short cervical length determined using ultrasonography is associated with increased preterm birth risk, having a shortened cervix due to surgical treatment of cervical dysplasia does not appear to increase risk. Some risk factors for preterm birth are modifiable. Tobacco and substance use increase the risk of preterm birth, and an interpregnancy interval of less than 18 months increases the risk of preterm birth and pregnancy complications. Although unintended pregnancies have an increased risk of preterm birth, increasing access to family planning and long-acting reversible contraception reduces preterm birth risk. Assessing Risk of Preterm Birth A cervical length less than 25 mm measured by endovaginal ultrasonography between 16 and 24 weeks' gestation demonstrates increased preterm birth risk. Endovaginal cervical length is measured with an empty bladder and the endovaginal probe placed in the anterior fornix.

Visualized intra-amniotic debris demonstrates further increased risk of preterm birth in patients with a short cervix, but funneling of the internal os, change with fundal pressure, and change with subsequent examinations do not demonstrate further increased risk. Although the absence of fetal fibronectin by vaginal swab is useful to demonstrate low risk for patients with symptoms of preterm labor, the positive predictive value is low, and the test is not useful for screening asymptomatic patients. SCREENING Although the cost-effectiveness of universal screening is uncertain, the cervix is often visualized on the fetal anatomy ultrasound scan routinely conducted between 18 and 23 weeks' gestation. If the cervical length measurement is 36 mm or less, an endovaginal measurement can be considered.

Twin pregnancy — ultrasound-indicated cerclage for short cervix: For cervical length 25 mm or less, there was no benefit to ultrasound-indicated cerclage with respect to spontaneous preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation (29/57 [50.9%] versus 53/83 [63.9%]; aOR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16–1.1). In those with a very short cervical length (15 mm or less), cerclage decreased preterm birth before 34 weeks (16/32 [50%] versus 31/39 [79.5%]; aOR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31–0.83) and decreased neonatal care unit admissions among liveborn neonates (38/58 [65.5%] versus 63/76 [82.9%]; aOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.81). A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts likewise indicated benefit for cervical length shorter than 15 mm with a reduction in preterm birth before 34 weeks (83/216 versus 114/206 in the control group; RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.90). However, three prospective randomized trials totaling only 49 patients with twins and an individual patient-level meta-analysis found no reduction in preterm birth before 34 weeks (62.5% with cerclage versus 24.0% without; aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.23–3.79), with increased birth weight less than 1,500 grams (52.1% versus 14.0%, aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.07–5.73) and increased respiratory distress syndrome (31.3% versus 6.0%; aOR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.09–21.03), and no difference for those with cervical length 15 mm or less (85.7% with cerclage versus 16.7% without; aOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.7–8.46).

### Efficacy of late cervical cerclage for preventing preterm birth in pregnancies complicated by cervical incompetence: retrospective cohort study [^bda4e551]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our retrospective cohort study involving 499 pregnancies that underwent prophylactic cervical cerclage demonstrated that performing prophylactic cervical cerclage in the late trimester of 16 to 19 weeks of gestation, is as safe and effective as conducting the procedure at the traditional gestational age of before 16 weeks of gestation. This study provides evidence for pregnancies whose placenta's edge covers the internal cervical ostium and concerns regarding the risk of sub-chorionic hematoma if the placenta covers the internal cervical os, vaginal bleeding, or the need for treatment of vaginal infections that exist during the gestational age of 11 to 15 weeks of gestation. In such cases, postponing cerclage surgery to a late gestational age may have comparable clinical effects to the early cerclage.

Cervical cerclage is a surgical procedure performed for pregnant women at risk of pregnancy loss due to cervical insufficiency but the utilization of cervical cerclage was controversial. On the one side, the efficacy of cervical cerclage is limited, with an estimated reduction in preterm birth of only 50 − 67% before 35 and 32 weeks of gestation, on the other side, The desire to avoid second-trimester loss pushed part of patients susceptive of CI asking for prophylactic cerclage. Although the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) recommended history indicated cerclage for pregnancies with 3 or more pregnancy losses, it was difficult for obstetricians to do cervical cerclage only for these women. ACOG in 2014 recommended that history-indicated cerclage could be considered for a patient with a history of unexplained second-trimester delivery in the absence of labor or abruptio placentae based on limited evidence. The traditional GA for prophylactic cervical cerclage among guidelines from different institutions are identical. 12 to 14 weeks of gestation are recommended as reasonable since the first-trimester ultrasound nuchal translucency screening would have been completed to exclude significant fetal malformations. With the development of pregnancy, the uterus is probably more sensitive to external force pulls and its blood supply is more abundant, which indicates a higher risk of blood loss during surgery and higher strength of uterus contraction after surgery, but the supporting evidence is limited. The recommended upper limit of GA for prophylactic cerclage is not exceeding 16 weeks of gestation, and the evidence for the safety of late cervical cerclage arose mostly from ultrasound-indicated cerclage which was usually performed between 14 and 24 weeks of gestation, and emergency cerclage which is indicated for painless cervical opening during GA lower than 28 weeks of gestation. Hagit Diamant et al. reported a case series of 29 patients (2 twins and 27 singletons) who underwent late cervical cerclage, among whom only 9 patients were history-indicated cerclages placed after 14 weeks due to late referral, the other 20 patients received cervical cerclage due to cervical dilation or shortening. The results implied the safety and effect of late cervical cerclage, but the evidence level is low.

A greater proportion of pregnancies were prolonged by at least 28 days among women who received indomethacin and perioperative antibiotics (24 [92.3%] versus 15 [62.5%]; P = 0.01), although gestational age at delivery and neonatal outcomes were statistically similar between groups.

### Progesterone, cervical cerclage or cervical pessary to prevent preterm birth: a decision-making analysis of international guidelines [^b03a3d3a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Although a twin pregnancy is a risk factor for preterm birth, most guidelines do not advise treatment, even if the cervix shortens. Based on a systematic review of randomized trials, a cerclage cannot currently be recommended for clinical use in twin pregnancies. In cases of cervical opening before 24 weeks of gestation, an emergency cerclage may be considered and discussed with the patient. A recent meta-analysis did not support the use of cervical pessary to prevent preterm birth or to improve perinatal outcomes in twin gestations with a short cervix. Nevertheless, a systematic review demonstrated that the administration of vaginal progesterone to asymptomatic women with a twin gestation and a sonographic short cervix in the mid-trimester reduced the risk of preterm birth significantly between 28 and 34 gestational weeks.

Most guidelines do not recommend the combination of more than two of the three therapeutic options (P, Pess and C). This is supported by a Cochrane review.

Interestingly, the only guideline mentioning total cervical occlusion (TCO) is the AWMF guideline and the only two guidelines mentioning cervical pessary are the AWMF and FIGO guidelines. These two options are not shown in our decision tree. Multiple randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been published in the last years on the use of cervical pessary during pregnancy. However, the results remain contradictory. A Cochrane meta-analysis did not show, that the use of a cervical pessary in early pregnancy prevented preterm delivery. Despite this, the cervical pessary remains popular in German speaking countries. For total cervical occlusion only small case series exist without a clear benefit. This might be the reason, why it is not included in other guidelines.

Regarding patient education for cervical insufficiency, more specifically with respect to general counseling, RCOG 2022 guidelines recommend to inform patients of the following before non-emergency cerclage:

- vaginal cerclage insertion is not associated with an increased risk of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, induction of labor or C-section

- the insertion of a cervical suture is not associated with an increased risk of preterm birth or second trimester loss

- cervical cerclage may be associated with a risk of cervical laceration/trauma if there is spontaneous labor with the suture in place.

### Prelabor rupture of membranes: ACOG practice bulletin, number 217 [^ace94d20]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) history — prevention and surveillance in future pregnancies: Patients with prior preterm PROM have an increased risk of recurrent PROM and preterm birth, and women with prior preterm births should be counseled that short interpregnancy intervals, particularly those shorter than 6 months, may negatively affect outcomes. Given potential benefit, women with a single gestation and a prior spontaneous preterm birth (due to either labor with intact membranes or preterm PROM) should be offered progesterone supplementation as clinically indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth. Although vaginal ultrasonographic cervical length measurement is safe and reliable, there have been no well-designed trials of cervical surveillance in women with a history of preterm PROM; thus, consideration can be given to transvaginal cervical length screening. Cerclage placement is associated with decreased preterm birth outcomes and may be considered when a current singleton pregnancy, a prior spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation, and a short cervical length (less than 25 mm) before 24 weeks of gestation are all present. There are no data on which to base a recommendation regarding the optimal gestational age for initiating surveillance or frequency of monitoring.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the antenatal management of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: a systematic review [^dcbe03fc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Preterm labour

Fifty-six recommendations (fourteen CPGs) specified views on screening and interventions for preterm labour (Supplementary File 8). There is no consensus across CPGs regarding the use of cervical length screening. Five guidelines recommended routine cervical length (CL) screening for twin pregnancies, however they differ in their definition of a short cervical length (20–25 mm). Four guidelines highlighted they do not advise routine cervical length screening. In women symptomatic of preterm labour one guideline recommended cervical length should not be used exclusively to direct the management.

One CPG recommended no intervention (CL, fetal fibronectin or any other rapid test) is appropriate for use in multiple pregnancy. Three CPGs agreed it is not appropriate to use fetal fibronectin testing alone to predict the risk of spontaneous preterm birth.

No CPG supports the untargeted administration of corticosteroids and seven CPGs specified appropriate gestation for corticosteroid administration (24–34 weeks), with FIGO also recommending they should also be administered if there is a planned caesarean section < 37 weeks. ACOG and FIGO differ in their recommendations for repeat corticosteroid courses; FIGO recommended it should be individualised rather than routine practice but ACOG specify a single repeat course should be considered in women < 34 weeks, at risk of delivery within the next 7 days, who had their initial course > 14 days ago.

CPGs agreed the use of prophylactic tocolysis is not routinely recommended, and two CPGs provided recommendations when a course of tocolysis may be considered. The use of progesterone, cervical pessary, cerclage and bed rest to prevent spontaneous preterm labour is not recommended in any included guideline. One guideline recommended the use of magnesium sulphate in the case of delivery prior to 32 weeks for fetal neuroprotection.

### Progesterone, cervical cerclage or cervical pessary to prevent preterm birth: a decision-making analysis of international guidelines [^1e4e9243]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate guidelines on preterm birth, analyze decision-criteria, and to identify consensus and discrepancies among these guidelines.

Design

Objective consensus analysis of guidelines.

Sample

Ten international guidelines on preterm birth.

Methods

Relevant decision criteria were singleton vs. twin pregnancy, history, cervical length, and cervical surgery / trauma or Mullerian anomaly. Eight treatment recommendations were extracted. For each decision-making criteria the most commonly recommended treatment was identified, and the level of consensus was evaluated.

Main Outcome Measures

Consensus and Discrepancies among recommendations.

Results

In a case of singleton pregnancies with no history of preterm birth and shortened cervix, most guidelines recommend progesterone. In singleton pregnancies with a positive history and shortened cervix, all guidelines recommend a cerclage as an option, alternative or conjunct to progesterone. The majority of the guidelines advise against treatment in twin pregnancies.

Conclusions

A shortened cervix and a history of preterm birth are relevant in singleton pregnancies. In twins, most guidelines recommend no active treatment. Among international guidelines a shortened cervix and a history of preterm birth are relevant in singleton pregnancies. With no history of preterm birth and with a shortened cervix most guidelines recommend progesterone treatment.

Results

The only full consensus was shown for singleton pregnancies with no history of preterm birth and long cervix (SP, H0, CL ≥ 25 mm), where all ten guidelines agree that no prophylactic therapy should be applied (Fig. 2).

Majority recommendations for combinations of pregnancy type (singleton vs. twin), history, cervical length and history of cervical surgery/trauma, no consensus – no single most common recommendation identified

In a case of a singleton pregnancy with H0 and short cervix (CL < 25 mm), most guidelines recommend progesterone therapy. The recommendations only vary by the cutoff of the cervical length (cutoff < 25, < 20 and < 15 mm, respectively) (Fig. 2).

In a singleton pregnancy with H1 and CL < 25 mm, all guidelines recommend a cerclage in some form or another. Nevertheless, in this situation, no single clear consensus could be demonstrated, as the guidelines leave it as an option, alternative or conjunct to progesterone therapy (Fig. 3).

### Evaluating vaginal progesterone in preventing recurrent preterm birth… [^114818ce]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Preterm birth and its complications are the leading causes of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1 Infants born preterm have a significantly higher likelihood of dying during the neonatal period than term infants. Getting the interventions right will inevitably save millions of infants and their families. Over the years, numerous studies have investigated the impact of vaginal progesterone in preventing recurrent preterm birth. However, there are still many shortcomings in our evaluation and understanding of its effectiveness. A recent study in JAMA Network Open by Nelson et al2 investigates the association between vaginal progesterone and prevention of recurrent spontaneous preterm births. This study suggests no overall reduction in recurrent preterm birth or when evaluating for both severity and frequency of prior preterm births among participants who took vaginal progesterone compared with controls.

They found recurrent preterm birth in cases as significantly higher than their 3 to 1 matched historical controls. Many important risk factors exist for preterm births. However, the ability of health care professionals to mitigate and prevent these risks has been traditionally challenged by the high rates of unplanned pregnancies in the US and limited access to preconception care, 3 most commonly among populations with historically higher risks for preterm births, which were mostly participants in Nelson et al.
2. Studies have shown the influence of serum progesterone on successful pregnancy outcomes as it plays a critical role in uterine contractility, cervical dilatation, and onset to the progression of labor.

4 The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists recommends that patients with prior spontaneous preterm birth and singleton pregnancy be offered progesterone supplementation to prevent recurrent preterm birth, 3 which is endorsed by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. In most cases, therapy is started around 16 to 20 weeks' gestation and continued until 36 weeks or until delivery. Although this is a current practice backed by ACOG, 3 some scientists have different opinions based on their research findings. 5, 6 Various studies have been conducted to evaluate this effectiveness in preterm birth prevention but with conflicting results and lack of consistent outcomes. Nelson et al2 suggest that vaginal progesterone was not associated with a reduction in risk of recurrent preterm birth; a notable feature of the study was the significantly higher rate of preterm births in those who use vaginal progesterone compared with historical controls.

A systematic review and meta-analysis also reported no convincing evidence for the effectiveness of vaginal progesterone in preventing recurrence in singleton pregnancies with prior spontaneous preterm births. 5 The authors also found no significant differences between vaginal progesterone and the placebo in other adverse perinatal outcomes. Nonetheless, other studies have reported the effectiveness of vaginal progesterone on preterm birth prevention. 7 A randomized clinical trial by Fonseca et al7 investigated prophylactic administration of progesterone by vaginal suppository and reported a significant association with preventing recurrent preterm birth in women who have a short cervix or other clinical characteristics. Therefore, the significantly positive impact of vaginal progesterone on preterm births seems to be very selective as this influence differs across obstetrics history or the reproductive status of the woman.

7 OTHER ISSUES REGARDING CERCLAGE

7.1 Surgical technique

The choice of cerclage material and specific technique of insertion should be at the discretion of the surgeon. There is currently insufficient evidence to support any particular technique. However, randomized comparisons of vaginal cerclage (Shirodkar versus McDonald) have shown similar outcomes. However, they should be placed as high as practically possible. Abdominal cerclage can be performed preconceptually or laparoscopically, although there is no evidence to support a specific technique or timing. Infertility is not affected by abdominal cerclage.

7.2 Perioperative considerations

Regional or general anesthesia is required for cerclage insertion (including abdominal cerclage). There is no evidence that a specific anesthetic has any advantage. Routine catheterization is not required and depends on the anesthetic and surgeons' discretion. Vaginal cerclage can usually be removed without additional anesthesia unless buried or high. Vaginal cerclage can be performed as a day case, but inpatient management may be required if sepsis is suspected following rescue cerclage. A retrospective survey of 226 women compared inpatient vs. outpatient management; there was no benefit in inpatient procedures with 48 h of admission.

7.3 Cerclage removal

If preterm birth has not occurred, removal is considered at 36–37 weeks in women anticipating a vaginal delivery. With preterm rupture of membranes, there is no evidence that the suture will improve outcomes, so removal is at the discretion of the clinician and patient taking into account the potential balance of prolonging the gestation with the potential risk of chorioamnionitis.

7.4 Adjuvant/alternative therapy

Several different therapies have been advocated before or at the time of cerclage. These include tocolysis (usually indomethacin), antibiotics, and amnioreduction. All these interventions lack high‐quality prospective evidence of benefit and can be considered on an individual case basis. Multiple studies have compared different agents (progesterone, pessaries, and cerclage) to prevent preterm birth. Several randomized controlled trials are in progress comparing the three treatments. There is also currently no evidence to support the use of these interventions simultaneously.

Relationship Between Adherence and Blood Levels in Patients at Both 24 and 32 Weeks as a Regression Analysis 17OHP-C indicates 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Question Is vaginal progesterone treatment associated with reduced risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth among patients with singleton pregnancies. Findings In this cohort study of 417 pregnant patients with previous preterm births, use of vaginal progesterone was not associated with a reduction in preterm birth when accounting for both frequency and severity of prior preterm births.

Meaning This study suggests that, for patients with prior preterm birth, vaginal progesterone treatment was not associated with a reduction in recurrence of preterm birth. Importance Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It has been suggested that vaginal progesterone treatment may reduce the recurrence of PTB. Objective To evaluate the association of VP treatment with prevention of recurrent PTB among patients with a singleton pregnancy. Design, Setting, and Participants. Exposure Patients received 90 mg of vaginal progesterone, 8%, nightly, initiated between 16 weeks and 0 days and 20 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy until 36 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy or delivery. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was overall rate of recurrent PTB at 35 weeks or less of patients given VP compared with the 3: 1 matched untreated historical controls.

Secondary outcomes included assessment of PTB according to adherence, duration of pregnancy relative to index gestational age, progesterone blood levels, and outcomes for those who declined VP. Progesterone blood levels for patients who were adherent compared with those who were nonadherent were not significantly different at either 24 or 32 weeks. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study of patients with a current singleton pregnancy suggests that VP was not associated with a reduction in recurrent PTB. a prior delivery at 35 weeks or less gestational age, treatment did not result in a reduction of recurrent PTB compared with a historical cohort of untreated patients with similar PTB profiles.

6 Thereafter, the postmarketing follow-up randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial also did not demonstrate efficacy of 17-OHPC among patients with a singleton pregnancy and prior spontaneous PTB.
9. For those with more than 1 pregnancy during the study period, the first pregnancy outcome was used for analysis. Because PTB risk differs by race and ethnicity, this information was obtained by research staff using patient self-report. Gestational age was based on the date of the last menstrual period with sonographic verification. Data on prior obstetric history was obtained from an obstetric database with maternal and infant outcomes for all deliveries. 12 Patients meeting inclusion criteria with prior spontaneous PTB at 35 weeks or less owing to either spontaneous labor or rupture of membranes during any prior pregnancy were offered VP.

The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend that transabdominal cerclage placement be offered to patients with a previous transvaginal cerclage placement (history or ultrasound indicated) and subsequent spontaneous singleton delivery before 28 weeks of gestation (GRADE 1B); (2) we recommend maternal-fetal medicine consultation for counseling patients who may be candidates for transabdominal cerclage and those who have undergone transabdominal cerclage (Best Practice); (3) we suggest that both laparoscopic transabdominal cerclage and open transabdominal cerclage are acceptable and the decision of approach may depend on gestational age, technical feasibility, available resources, and expertise (GRADE 2B); (4) we suggest that transabdominal cerclage can be performed before pregnancy or in the first trimester of pregnancy with similar fetal outcomes. If a patient with an indication for transabdominal cerclage presents after the first trimester of pregnancy, transabdominal cerclage can still be considered before 22 weeks of gestation (GRADE 2C); (5) we recommend that routine transvaginal cervical length screening not be performed for patients with a transabdominal cerclage in situ (GRADE 1C); (6) we suggest that for individuals at risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth, including those with a transabdominal cerclage in situ, a risk-benefit discussion of supplemental vaginal progesterone be undertaken with shared decision-making (GRADE 2C); (7) we suggest that pregnancy loss be managed with dilation and curettage or dilation and evacuation with a transabdominal cerclage in situ or via usual obstetrical management after laparoscopic removal of the transabdominal cerclage, depending on gestational age and resources available (GRADE 2C); and (8) we suggest cesarean delivery between 37 0/7 and 39 0/7 weeks of gestation for patients with a transabdominal cerclage in situ (GRADE 2C).

### Rationale and design of SuPPoRT: a multi-centre randomised controlled trial to compare three treatments: cervical cerclage, cervical pessary and vaginal progesterone, for the prevention of preterm birth in women who develop a short cervix [^f6f1714d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Vaginal progesterone is given as a potential therapy to sPTB in singleton pregnancies based on a Cochrane systematic review reporting that prophylactic progesterone (intramuscular and vaginal administration of varying doses) was associated with a significant reduction in preterm birth < 34 weeks (one study; 142 women; RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04–0.64) and preterm birth at less than 37 weeks (four studies; 1255 women; RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.70–0.92). A meta-analysis of vaginal progesterone treatment given to all women with a short cervix < 25 mm showed a reduction in preterm birth at < 33 weeks; [RR, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42 to 0.80), < 35 weeks (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88), and < 28 weeks (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.81) and neonatal composite morbidity and mortality (RR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.81). A recent large study suggested a lack of efficacy of vaginal progesterone and no long-term benefit at two years, adding to the uncertainty around progesterone use.

The plasma (and/or uterine) concentration of progesterone required to reduce sPTB is unknown, and the mechanism of action uncertain. It is, however, frequently used in clinical practice (usual dose 200–400 mg). The doses of vaginal progesterone used in completed trials are 100 mg (n = 142) or 200 mg (n = 250). Whilst vaginal progesterone use for the prevention of sPTB is unlicensed, it is commonly used in clinical practice in the UK and Europe and is also recommended for use in the USA by the Society for Maternal and Fetal Medicine. NICE recommends vaginal progesterone in women between 16 +0 and 24 +0 weeks with a cervical length < 25 mm and no history of late miscarriage or sPTB.

Progesterone or cerclage are advised by NICE for women with a history of late miscarriage or preterm birth. Currently cervical cerclage is the Royal College of Obstetricians (RCOG) recommended treatment for women with a short cervix < 25 mm and a history of 1 or more late miscarriages or preterm birth.

### Cervical cerclage for short cervix at 24 to 26 weeks of gestation: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using individual patient-level data [^2e9cf321]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether cervical cerclage for a transvaginal ultrasound-detected short cervical length after 24 weeks of gestation in singleton pregnancies reduces the risk for preterm birth.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using the following terms: "cerclage, cervical", "uterine cervical incompetence", "obstetrical surgical procedures", "cervix uteri", "randomized controlled trial", and "controlled clinical trial".

Study Eligibility Criteria

All randomized controlled trials comparing cerclage placement with no cerclage in singleton gestations with a transvaginal ultrasound-detected short cervical length ≤ 25 mm between 24+0/7 and 29+6/7 weeks of gestation were eligible for inclusion.

Methods

Individual patient-level data from each trial were collected. If an eligible trial included patients with both multiple and singleton gestations with a short cervical length detected either before or after 24+0/7 weeks of gestation, only singletons who presented at or after 24+0/7 weeks were included. The primary outcome was preterm birth < 37 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes included preterm birth < 34, < 32, and < 28 weeks' gestation, gestational age at delivery, latency, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and adverse neonatal outcomes. Individual patient-level data from each trial were analyzed using a 2-stage approach. Pooled relative risks or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated as appropriate.

Results

Data from the 4 eligible randomized controlled trials were included. A total of 131 singletons presented at 24+0/7 to 26+6/7 weeks of gestation and were further analyzed; there were no data on patients with a cerclage at 27+0/7 weeks' gestation or later. Of those included, 66 (50.4%) were in the cerclage group and 65 (49.6%) were in the no cerclage group. The rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks' gestation was similar between patients who were randomized to the cerclage group and those who were randomized to the no cerclage group (27.3% vs 38.5%; relative risk, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.37–1.28). Secondary outcomes including preterm birth < 34, < 32, and < 28 weeks' gestation, gestational age at delivery, time interval from randomization to delivery, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, and adverse neonatal outcomes such as low birthweight, very low birthweight, and perinatal death were similar between the 2 groups. Planned subgroup analyses revealed no statistically significant differences in the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks' gestation between the 2 groups when compared based on cervical length measurement (≤ 15 mm or ≤ 10 mm), gestational age at randomization (24+0/7 to 24+6/7 weeks or 25+0/7 to 26+6/7 weeks), or history of preterm birth.

Conclusion

Cervical cerclage did not reduce or increase the rate of preterm birth among singleton pregnancies with a short cervical length detected after 24 weeks of gestation. Because there was a 22% nonsignificant decrease in preterm birth associated with cerclage, which is a similar amount of risk reduction often associated with ultrasound-indicated cerclage before 24 weeks' gestation, further randomized controlled trials in this patient population are warranted.

### Identification of risk factors for incident cervical insufficiency in nulliparous and parous women: a population-based case-control study [^9e9f94fc]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Multi-fetal pregnancies are known to be at higher risk of spontaneous preterm birth, and there have been reports of a lack of response to treatment, compared to singleton pregnancies. Recent guidelines report that available data still indicate a risk of preterm birth following cerclage for short cervix (< 25mm) in twin pregnancies, but limited data providing evidence of an advantage for cervix < 15mm. Evidence from a recent clinical trial supports the use of cerclage in twin pregnancies with a dilated cervix. However, further studies of multi-fetal pregnancies are required, as there is a lack of consensus regarding screening protocols or the risks and benefits of cerclage and it is notable that current RCOG guidelines present key recommendations only for singleton pregnancies. This could be partly due to differences in parity as we found multi-fetal pregnancy to be a strong predictor of risk for nulliparous but not parous women. This might be explained by the myometrium and cervical tissues having been expanded and thus being more adaptable in a subsequent pregnancy. Evidence that would support this hypothesis comes from a meta-analysis of recurrent preterm birth that reported a 10% rate of preterm deliveries for singleton pregnancies following a preterm twin delivery and only 1.3% following a term twin delivery. Another important difference we found with respect to parity concerns the importance of miscarriage history in singleton and multi-fetal gestation: in nulliparous women a history of 2 or more miscarriages was associated with a 24-fold higher risk of ICI in singleton pregnancies and 67-fold higher risk in multifetal pregnancies, whereas for parous women, the elevated risk for miscarriage history was similar in singleton and multifetal pregnancies. Although the parous women cannot be compared directly with the nulliparous women, as they provide more information (i.e. from their previous deliveries) and use a different model, the findings have value in identifying the important, and different, contribution of these risk factors for ICI in the two groups.

### The use of progesterone to reduce preterm birth… [^358e15dc]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

The Use of Progesterone to Reduce Preterm BirthClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview A. Introduction Preterm birth occurs in 7–12% of all deliveries, but accounts for over 85% of all perinatal morbidity and mortality. 1 Despite many strategies for reducing the incidence of preterm birth none have been totally effective. One treatment that showed promise in earlier small trials was the prophylactic administration of progestational compounds. 2, 3 However, the reports of efficacy were mixed with some showing benefits4, 5 while others did not. 6, 7 More recently, two randomized clinical trials have shown great promise8, 9, and revealed a. significant decrease in preterm births among women who received 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate 8, or 100mg of progesterone delivered by vaginal suppository per week.

9 Indeed support by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and March of Dimes as well as others have made this treatment the standard of care in many areas of the country. The limitations of these studies are that they have small numbers as well as a higher than expected preterm delivery rate among placebo patients. Because of the previous controversy as to the effectiveness of progesterone noted in the 70's
- 80's it is incumbent upon other centers to carry out new investigational trials in an effort to confirm their results. Secondly, the studies were limited to singleton pregnancies who were "at risk" for preterm delivery thus not surveying three groups with the highest preterm delivery rate:

1.) Multifetal gestations and cervical insufficiency;
2.) Those who have preterm labor in the current pregnancy that have been tocolyzed; 3.) Women with preterm premature rupture of the membranes.

The purpose of the current study to confirm if possible, the findings of the most recent investigations8, 9 using the same patient population and in addition, we will study the effect of progesterone vs placebo in preventing early delivery among multifetal gestations in women who have been diagnosed with preterm labor in the current pregnancy. B. Specific Aim The aim of this study is to compare progesterone to ascertain if there is a reduction in preterm birth and subsequent neonatal morbidity among patients receiving the active drug. If weekly treatment with this agent can be shown to reduce the incidence of preterm delivery and its surrogate adverse outcomes in the neonate, it will have major impact upon patients and the health care delivery system. C. Rationale Progesterone as indicated in the Introduction has been shown in some, but not all, studies to reduce incidence of preterm delivery and the adverse effects of prematurity.

Progesterone has been shown to reduce the number of oxytocin receptors in the myometrium and be responsible in the near term pregnant women for blocking the onset of labor. Weekly use of this compound, if effective, would be much superior to the tocolytic agents currently available. D. Benefit to Risk Ratio There is no known harm to mother/fetus/infant of progesterone therapy. This compound has been used in early pregnancies at risk for abortion as well as later in pregnancy to reduce the incidence of prematurity as noted in the Introduction. On the beneficial side, if this treatment proves effective it could prolong pregnancy thus reduce significant neonatal morbidity as well as the emotional cost and expense of such pregnancies. Study Protocol Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will have the study explained to them, including benefits risks and alternative therapy.

### Clinical management of the short cervix [^73e69a79]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Cervical cerclage is associated with prolongation of gestation in singleton pregnancies with prior spontaneous preterm delivery and a short cervix on vaginal ultrasonography in the mid-trimester. Ultrasound screening of cervical length is not indicated in low-risk singleton pregnancies and in women with multiple gestations. 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone does not prevent preterm delivery in twin gestations with a short cervix. Cervical cerclage may cause detrimental effects in twin gestations. Vaginal pessary for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a short cervix is currently under active investigation.
