## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 65-year-old man with diabetes, severe hyperglycemia, and ketonuria, covering diagnosis, initial management, maintenance therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and whether this is DKA, HHS, or a mixed picture. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and what labs are missing. Next, I will outline immediate management priorities: fluids, insulin, electrolytes, and precipitating factors. After that, I need to plan for the 24-hour transition and maintenance pharmacotherapy, including lipid management and kidney protection. Finally, I will consider patient education and lifestyle interventions to prevent recurrence, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and the leading diagnosis. The patient is a 65-year-old with long-standing diabetes, medication nonadherence, marked hyperglycemia at 24.5 mmol/L, and significant ketonuria with severe dehydration, which strongly suggests diabetic ketoacidosis rather than isolated hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, although mixed features can occur in older adults with type 2 diabetes and insulin deficiency, so I should keep that in mind as I proceed [^113cR4vq] [^114srPLa].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria before I commit. Classic DKA requires hyperglycemia, ketonemia or ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis; I have hyperglycemia and ketonuria, but I still need to check pH, bicarbonate, and anion gap to confirm acidosis, and I should preferentially obtain serum β-hydroxybutyrate rather than rely on urine ketones for diagnosis and monitoring because β-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone and more reliable in acute DKA [^114srPLa] [^113KospR] [^111N7noh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about HHS just because the glucose is very high; HHS typically shows glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL, effective serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg, minimal ketonemia, and no significant acidosis, so I should calculate osmolality and check acid–base status to distinguish pure HHS from DKA or a mixed DKA–HHS presentation, especially in older adults where overlap is not rare [^112UAbax] [^113cR4vq].

> I will now examine precipitating factors and complications. Medication nonadherence is a common trigger for DKA in insulin-deficient diabetes, and I should actively screen for infection, cardiovascular events, or other acute illness that could have precipitated the crisis, while also assessing for acute kidney injury given severe dehydration and proteinuria, using KDIGO criteria and urinalysis to guide renal management and drug dosing adjustments [^1174Euhp] [^113gT6Kk] [^112LuMYS] [^111uSGTg].

> Next, I should review immediate management priorities. First-line therapy is aggressive isotonic crystalloid resuscitation; in adults without cardiac or renal compromise, starting 0.9% saline at 1.0 L/hour for the first 2–4 hours is reasonable, with subsequent rate adjustments based on hemodynamics, urine output, and sodium concentration, and I need to ensure I transition to dextrose-containing fluids once glucose falls below 250 mg/dL to allow continued insulin until ketonemia resolves [^112YtsdG] [^116vxCdp].

> Let me think about insulin next. Continuous intravenous regular insulin is standard in severe DKA, typically initiated as a bolus of 0.1 units/kg followed by an infusion of 0.1 units/kg/hour, with the understanding that insulin should continue until ketonemia clears even if glucose normalizes earlier; I should double-check that the infusion is running correctly and titrate to a glucose decline of about 50–75 mg/dL/hour while watching for hypoglycemia as dextrose is added [^113aX4rv].

> I need to ensure safe potassium management. Insulin drives potassium intracellularly, so despite total body potassium depletion, serum potassium can fall quickly; if potassium is 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, I should add 10–20 mmol potassium per liter of IV fluid, if it is < 3.5 mmol/L I should replace more aggressively, and if it is > 5.0 mmol/L I should delay potassium until insulin is started and reassess frequently, ideally checking potassium every 2–4 hours initially [^1135r4eb] [^1163TwTf].

> But wait, what if the patient has cardiac comorbidity or is at risk for fluid overload. In older adults or those with heart or kidney disease, I should use smaller fluid boluses, consider balanced crystalloids, and monitor closely for signs of pulmonary edema; if there is hemodynamic instability or concern for perfusion, I should involve critical care early and consider invasive monitoring as indicated [^112YtsdG] [^116vxCdp].

> Next, I should review the 24-hour laboratory trajectory and what it implies. The glucose drop to 13 mmol/L suggests insulin responsiveness, and the potassium stabilizing around 4 mmol/L indicates replacement is working; however, I should confirm resolution of ketonemia with β-hydroxybutyrate and ensure acid–base normalization before transitioning off IV insulin, because premature cessation risks rebound hyperglycemia and persistent ketosis [^113KospR] [^1163TwTf].

> I will now examine maintenance pharmacotherapy once DKA resolves. Given long-standing diabetes, poor control, and this severe hyperglycemic crisis, insulin is indicated even if the patient previously used oral agents; I should start basal insulin and overlap the IV infusion for 2–4 hours to prevent rebound, then layer prandial rapid-acting insulin if needed, and consider adding metformin once renal function is adequate and the patient is hemodynamically stable [^1163TwTf] [^116BSfW8].

> Let me verify lipid management. With LDL 4.5 mmol/L and established diabetes, high-intensity statin therapy is appropriate for secondary prevention unless contraindicated, and I should check for drug–drug interactions and plan follow-up lipids to ensure at least a 50% LDL reduction is achieved [^notfound].

> I should confirm kidney protection strategies. The presence of proteinuria suggests diabetic kidney disease in the absence of alternative causes; an ACE inhibitor or ARB is first-line to reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression, and I need to monitor potassium and creatinine within 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes, adjusting as needed [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether SGLT2 inhibition is appropriate now. After a recent DKA, SGLT2 inhibitors should generally be avoided initially; if considered later for cardiorenal benefit, it should be after careful risk–benefit discussion, education on euglycemic DKA, and clear sick-day rules, with temporary withholding during acute illness or low-carb states [^117FgVQm] [^1123UPzN] [^116iXXSU].

> Next, I should review structured education to prevent recurrence. Before discharge, the patient should receive training on recognition and sick-day management of DKA, including frequent glucose and ketone checks, never stopping basal insulin, early hydration, and when to seek urgent care; this education reduces readmissions and improves safety [^111e8adi].

> Let me consider lifestyle modifications that meaningfully impact outcomes. Weight reduction toward a BMI under 25 kg/m² improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, so I should set a realistic, gradual target and connect him with nutrition support; medical nutrition therapy emphasizing reduced caloric intake, lower refined carbohydrates, and adequate fiber is foundational [^notfound].

> I need to ensure a sustainable physical activity plan. At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, plus resistance training 2–3 times weekly, improves insulin sensitivity, lowers A1C, and supports weight loss; I should tailor the plan to comorbidities and provide a written prescription [^notfound].

> Next, I should review adherence strategies. Simplifying the regimen to once-daily basal insulin when feasible, using pill organizers, and arranging follow-up within 1–2 weeks can improve adherence; I should also screen for depression, cognitive impairment, and social barriers that undermine medication taking [^notfound].

> I will now examine alcohol and smoking. Alcohol can precipitate DKA and interacts with diabetes therapies, so intake should be minimized or avoided, and smoking cessation should be prioritized given its additive cardiovascular risk in diabetes; I should offer pharmacologic cessation aids and referrals [^notfound].

> Finally, I should double-check that the discharge plan is safe and complete. This includes confirming resolution of ketonemia, stable electrolytes, a written insulin protocol, supplies for home glucose and ketone testing, scheduled follow-up with endocrinology and primary care, and clear instructions to return immediately for vomiting, persistent hyperglycemia, or symptoms of infection, as these steps reduce the risk of early recurrence [^1163TwTf] [^111e8adi].

Mr. AA presents with **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** [^111itEwi] due to prolonged insulin omission in type 2 diabetes, with severe dehydration and likely acute kidney injury from osmotic diuresis and hypovolemia [^113cR4vq] [^114ALmcZ]. Immediate management is **IV fluids, insulin, and potassium** [^112YtsdG] to correct dehydration, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalance, with close monitoring of glucose, electrolytes, and renal function [^1117ZCKL]. After stabilization, transition to basal–bolus insulin [^1163TwTf] with metformin if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², add high-intensity statin for LDL ≥ 4.5 mmol/L, and initiate ACE inhibitor/ARB for proteinuria and cardiorenal protection. Lifestyle changes include dietary sodium restriction, weight loss, smoking cessation, and structured sick-day education to prevent recurrence [^111e8adi].

---

## Diagnosis

The most likely diagnosis is **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** [^111itEwi], characterized by hyperglycemia, ketonemia/ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis, precipitated by prolonged insulin omission in type 2 diabetes [^113cR4vq]. Severe dehydration and proteinuria indicate **acute kidney injury (AKI)** from osmotic diuresis and hypovolemia [^114ALmcZ].

---

## Initial management (first 24 hours)

### Fluid resuscitation

Start **isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)** at 1.0 L/hour for the first 2–4 hours [^112YtsdG], then adjust to correct the estimated fluid deficit over 24–48 hours [^112YtsdG]. Switch to **5% dextrose with 0.45% saline** when glucose falls below 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) to prevent hypoglycemia while continuing insulin until ketonemia resolves [^113aX4rv].

---

### Insulin therapy

Begin **regular insulin infusion** at 0.1 units/kg/hour after the initial fluid bolus; avoid insulin until potassium is ≥ 3.3 mmol/L [^1135r4eb]. Continue insulin until ketonemia resolves (β-hydroxybutyrate < 0.6 mmol/L), even if glucose normalizes earlier [^113aX4rv].

---

### Electrolyte management

- **Potassium**: Replace aggressively [^1135r4eb]; typical needs are 10–20 mmol/L of IV fluids, adjusted to serum potassium and renal function.

- **Sodium, chloride, phosphate**: Correct as indicated by serial electrolytes and acid–base status [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring

Check **capillary glucose every 1–2 hours** and serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and β-hydroxybutyrate every 4–6 hours [^notfound]. Use continuous or frequent vital sign monitoring in the ICU or high-acuity setting [^notfound].

---

## Maintenance pharmacological therapy (after 24 hours)

### Glycemic control

Transition to **basal–bolus subcutaneous insulin** (e.g. glargine once daily with rapid-acting insulin before meals) [^1163TwTf], overlapping and continuing IV insulin for 2–4 hours to prevent rebound hyperglycemia. Add **metformin** if eGFR is ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², considering the patient's reduced creatinine clearance and need for dose adjustment [^notfound].

---

### Cardiovascular risk management

Start **high-intensity statin therapy** (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily) to achieve LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L or a ≥ 50% reduction, given LDL 4.5 mmol/L and high cardiovascular risk [^notfound]. Initiate an **ACE inhibitor or ARB** (e.g. lisinopril 10–20 mg daily or losartan 50–100 mg daily) for proteinuria and cardiorenal protection, titrating to blood pressure and kidney function [^notfound].

---

### Renal protection

Monitor **eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio** at least annually, and more frequently if eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or if albuminuria progresses [^117HtG3X].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

### Dietary interventions

Implement **medical nutrition therapy** with reduced caloric intake (500–750 kcal/day deficit), lower refined carbohydrates, increased fiber, and sodium restriction to < 2 g/day for blood pressure control [^notfound]. Consider **weight loss** with a goal of 5–10% over 6–12 months to improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic parameters [^notfound].

---

### Physical activity

Encourage at least **150 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g. brisk walking) plus resistance training 2–3 times weekly to improve glycemic control and cardiovascular health [^notfound].

---

### Smoking cessation

Provide **counseling and pharmacotherapy** (e.g. varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine replacement) to reduce cardiovascular risk [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Provide **structured education** on recognition, prevention, and sick-day management of DKA, including ketone monitoring and when to seek care [^111e8adi]. Schedule **regular follow-up** every 3–6 months to monitor glycemic control, renal function, cardiovascular risk, and adherence, and adjust therapy accordingly [^notfound].

---

Mr. AA's presentation is **DKA with AKI** from insulin omission; prioritize fluids, insulin, and potassium with close monitoring, then transition to insulin-based therapy with cardiorenal protection and intensive lifestyle change to prevent recurrence.

Clinical Presentation

Diabetes can be asymptomatic in up to 50% of older people. However, when symptoms are present they are nonspecific and can be attributed to aging. Nonspecific symptoms, such as being generally unwell, fatigued, or lethargic, are common manifestations of diabetes in old age. Geriatric syndromes may be the first manifestation of diabetes, such as falls and urinary incontinence. Symptoms could also be atypical, such as anorexia, rather than the typical polyphagia. The classic osmotic symptoms of diabetes are usually less prominent due to the increased renal threshold for glucose (reducing the intensity of polyuria) and impairment of thirst sensation (reducing the intensity of polydipsia). Diabetes complications, such as non ketotic hyperosmolar coma, may be the presenting symptom or diabetes may be first diagnosed during an acute illness or a routine blood test.

### Two cases of diabetic ketoacidosis in HNF1A-MODY linked to severe dehydration: is it time to change the diagnostic criteria for MODY? [^113JQT3N]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes caused by heterozygous mutations in HNF1A. Currently, a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an exclusion criterion for genetic testing for MODY.

History and Examination

In this article, we describe two unrelated patients aged 17 and 24 years with severe DKA developed several years after the diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY.

Investigation

Both patients were treated with insulin, but their metabolic control was poor (HbA1c 15%, 140 mmol/mol and 13%, 119 mmol/mol, respectively) due to noncompliance and missed insulin injections. In both patients, DKA followed a course of recurrent vomiting with dehydration and prerenal acute kidney injury. Their glycemia, blood pH, and base excess at admission were 97 mmol/L [1,748 mg/dL], 6.80, and -33 mmol/L (patient 1) and 34 mmol/L [613 mg/dL], 7.03, and -14 mmol/L (patient 2).

Conclusions

This anecdotal observation supports the notion that a history of DKA does not exclude MODY.

Nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) is found mostly in type 2 diabetic patients with marked hyperglycemia. HHS is a metabolic emergency and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is characterized by extreme dehydration and neurologic symptoms, which are related directly to the degree of hyperosmolality. We describe a 65-year-old patient who was admitted because of impaired consciousness caused by HHS. The relevant clinical and laboratory findings are discussed, and a brief overview of the pathophysiology and therapeutic management is provided.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^116ZgiFF]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by a serum glucose level greater than 250 mg per dL, a pH less than 7.3, a serum bicarbonate level less than 18 mEq per L, an elevated serum ketone level, and dehydration. Insulin deficiency is the main precipitating factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur in persons of all ages, with 14 percent of cases occurring in persons older than 70 years, 23 percent in persons 51 to 70 years of age, 27 percent in persons 30 to 50 years of age, and 36 percent in persons younger than 30 years. The case fatality rate is 1 to 5 percent. About one-third of all cases are in persons without a history of diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms include polyuria with polydipsia (98 percent), weight loss (81 percent), fatigue (62 percent), dyspnea (57 percent), vomiting (46 percent), preceding febrile illness (40 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), and polyphagia (23 percent). Measurement of A1C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glucose, electrolytes, pH, and serum ketones; complete blood count; urinalysis; electrocardiography; and calculation of anion gap and osmolar gap can differentiate diabetic ketoacidosis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, gastroenteritis, starvation ketosis, and other metabolic syndromes, and can assist in diagnosing comorbid conditions. Appropriate treatment includes administering intravenous fluids and insulin, and monitoring glucose and electrolyte levels. Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication that occurs predominantly in children. Physicians should recognize the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis for prompt diagnosis, and identify early symptoms to prevent it. Patient education should include information on how to adjust insulin during times of illness and how to monitor glucose and ketone levels, as well as information on the importance of medication compliance.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^115W2W1J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

This study thus raises the question about what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible DKA in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia and then to determine whether this has resulted in a significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source and then to determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists, although acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases. In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~ 17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

### Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state: first presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus in an adolescent with complex medical needs [^114UmqCT]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

This is a case of hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) as first presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus in a 14-year-old girl with background complex medical needs. She presented with marked hyperglycaemia (56 mmol/L) without significant ketonaemia (2.6 mmol/L) and serum hyperosmolality (426 mOsm/kg). Managing her profound hypernatraemic (> 180 mmol/L) dehydration was challenging but resulted in good outcome. Paediatric patients with HHS will likely be treated with the diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) protocol because of perceived rarity of HHS leading to inadequate rehydration and risk of vascular collapse. Hence, emphasis on the differences in the management protocols of DKA and HHS is paramount. Prompt recognition and adequate management are crucial to avert complications. The undesirable rate of decline of hypernatraemia due to the use of hypotonic fluid was captured in this case. We describe the pivotal role of liberal fluid therapy with non-hypotonic fluids.

### Hyperglycemic crises in adults with diabetes: a consensus report [^112YtsdG]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer isotonic saline or balanced crystalloid solutions at an initial rate of 500–1,000 mL/h during the first 2–4 hours in adult patients with DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state without renal or cardiac compromise. Decide on the subsequent choice for fluid replacement after restoration of intravascular volume based on the state of hydration assessed by BP, HR, fluid input-output balance, and sodium concentration, correcting estimated fluid deficits within the first 24–48 hours. Use caution when rapidly replacing fluids in patients at high risk of fluid overload, including older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with heart or kidney disease or other serious comorbidities.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### First-time diabetic ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetics with COVID-19 infection: a novel case series [^1146Lddn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a novel coronavirus first diagnosed in U.S. hospitals in January 2020. Typical presenting symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia. However, several other symptoms have been reported, including fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. We have identified a series of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) likely precipitated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Case Series

We describe 5 patients with previously known type 2 diabetes and no history of DKA, who presented to the emergency department with new-onset DKA and COVID-19. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for poor outcomes in viral respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Infection may precipitate DKA in patients with type 2 diabetes. Aggressive management of these patients is recommended; however, management guidelines have not yet been put forth for this unique subset of patients.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically ocurring at the time of new diagnosis of untreated T1DM or due to inadequate insulin therapy, infection (such as pneumonia, UTI, sepsis), concomitant medications (corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics), illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiologic stress, or pregnancy.
- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hopsitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia, fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings in DKA include hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^116QpD9R]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) in children — presentation, dehydration pathophysiology, cerebral edema risk, and fluid management — shows overlap with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as HHS is distinct from DKA but patients may present with features of both conditions, and children with HHS are often treated with DKA protocols. The gradually increasing polyuria and polydipsia of HHS may go unrecognized; as a result, both dehydration and electrolyte loss are profound in HHS, with fluid losses in adults estimated to be twice those of DKA, and obesity and hyperosmolality can make assessment of dehydration unreliable. Despite severe electrolyte losses and total body volume depletion, hypertonicity preserves intravascular volume and signs of dehydration may be less evident; during therapy, declining serum osmolality moves water out of the intravascular space with a decline in intravascular volume, osmotic diuresis may persist for hours, and ongoing urinary fluid losses early in treatment may be considerable. Because of these factors, children with HHS require more aggressive replacement of intravascular volume during treatment than do children with DKA to avoid the vascular collapse that contributes to the high mortality rate. Patients are believed to be at risk for cerebral edema if the rate of decline in serum osmolality exceeds brain clearance of osmotically active particles; however, in one case report with severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality (435 mosm/Kg) and intracranial pressure monitoring during treatment, no increase in intracranial pressure occurred during fluid resuscitation.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: a current appraisal of pathophysiology and management [^114HVCSn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a frequent abnormal metabolic entity seen in high-dependency units such as critical care units and in the emergency department. Having an understanding of its pathophysiology, a consequence of absent to low insulin levels, delineates the clinical presentation. Most clinical features are caused by hyperglycemia and acidosis, including weight loss. The newer management modalities are discussed that include the need for intensive laboratory workup, meticulous monitoring of the insulin, and fluid management. Among the complications, cerebral edema (CE) is the most dreaded, albeit with low incidence. The new insights into its pathophysiology and management are outlined, and a timeline for management of DKA is proposed.

### An extremely high blood glucose level in a child with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state and type 1 diabetes [^116cjfGP]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is one of the most severe acute complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) characterized by severe hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality without significant ketosis and acidosis. What is new? Since HHS in the pediatric population is rare and potentially life-threatening, every reported case is very valuable for raising awareness among healthcare professionals.

Case Presentation

A 7-year-old boy with previously diagnosed Joubert syndrome was admitted due to vomiting, polydipsia and polyuria started several days earlier. He was severely dehydrated, and the initial blood glucose level was 115 mmol/L. Based on clinical manifestations and laboratory results, he was diagnosed with T1DM and HHS. The treatment with intravenous fluid was started and insulin administration began later. He was discharged after 10 days without any complications related to HHS.

Conclusions

Since HHS has a high mortality rate, early recognition, and proper management are necessary for a better outcome.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113cR4vq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis and classification — Type 2 diabetes phenotype — Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90–95% of all diabetes and encompasses individuals who generally have relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes and, when seen, usually arises with insulinopenia, missed or inadequate insulin doses, ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, intercurrent illness such as dehydration or infection, or in association with medications such as glucocorticoids, second-generation antipsychotics, or SGLT2 inhibitors. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is more typically associated with type 2 diabetes and is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis, and mixed DKA/HHS presentations can occur.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

### Factors associated with the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of diabetes in children and young adults: a systematic review [^112rL1JY]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common endocrine diseases in children. Worldwide, an estimated 65 000 children under 15 years old develop the disease each year, and the global incidence in children continues to increase at a rate of 3% a year. The current incidence in the UK is around 26/100 000 per year.

Between 10% and 70% of these diagnosed children present in diabetic ketoacidosis, a metabolic derangement characterised by the triad of hyperglycaemia, acidosis, and ketonuria. The current criteria for diagnosis published by the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes is blood glucose > 11 mmol/L, venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L, and ketonaemia and ketonuria. It carries a substantial risk of life threatening complications such as cerebral oedema and is the commonest cause of diabetes related death in children. The longer term clinical course of type 1 diabetes also seems to be influenced by it: children with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis have poorer glycaemic control, less residual β cell function up to two years after diagnosis, and a lower frequency of remission.

It is unclear why some children present in diabetic ketoacidosis whereas others do not and whether the development of diabetic ketoacidosis is a consequence of delayed diagnosis and treatment or whether it reflects a particularly aggressive form of diabetes. Understanding which factors are associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis and the relative importance of delayed diagnosis and treatment is, therefore, important. This potentially informs both our understanding of the disease as well as the development of patient, professional, and population based interventions to reduce the proportion of children presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Several individual factors from individual studies have been quoted in guidelines and consensus statements. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of all factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young adults.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major acute life‐threatening complication of diabetes, mostly seen in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and less commonly in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is usually defined as a metabolic state in which the individual has either a glucose concentration of more than 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) at presentation, or has been previously diagnosed with diabetes; they must have a plasma β‐hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3.0 mmol/L or higher, or urine ketones of more than 2+ on a standard urine ketone test‐stick; and a pH less than 7.3 or a serum bicarbonate of less than 15.0 mmol/L. Blood glucose levels may not always be elevated in DKA, a state referred to as euglycaemic ketoacidosis.

DKA results from a relative or absolute deficiency in circulating insulin associated with elevated glucagon. These, in turn, promote the uncontrolled release of free fatty acids that are converted to ketone bodies, resulting in an anion gap acidosis. Acetoacetate, the primary ketone body, is then converted enzymatically to β‐hydroxybutyrate, the predominant circulating ketone body, and non‐enzymatically to acetone, which is exhaled(Figure 1). The reduced peripheral uptake of glucose and increased endogenous glucose production results in marked hyperglycaemia and dehydration. The metabolic acidosis, hypovolaemia, electrolyte disturbance and hyperosmolar state stimulate a counter‐regulatory hormone response increasing insulin resistance and ketogenesis, further exacerbating the metabolic disturbance, resulting in a downward spiral. If left unaddressed this culminates in altered consciousness, cardiovascular collapse, coma and death.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^111LKW7A]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious metabolic complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). In the United States only, more than 130,000 cases with a primary diagnosis of DKA were reported in 2006, two-thirds of which in patients with type 1 DM (T1DM) and one third in patients with type 2 DM (T2DM). According to the American Diabetes Association the diagnostic criteria for DKA include blood glucose levels > 250 mg/dl, arterial pH < 7.3, anion gap > 12 mEq/L, HCO₃⁻ < 15 mEq/L and the presence of ketones in blood and urine. Metabolic ketoacidosis in diabetic patients can less commonly occur with only mild to moderate glucose elevation, thus called euglycemic DKA (euDKA). EuDKA was first described as a discrete entity by Munro et al. in 1973 who reported a series of 211 patients with DKA, 37 of which had a glucose concentration at presentation less than 16.7 mmol/L (300 mg/dL); all of these originally described patients were individuals with T1DM. Consequent and larger epidemiologic studies on euDKA during the 1980s and 1990s reported an incidence of euDKA between 1 and 3.2% of patients presenting with DKA, i.e. suggesting it was rather a rare condition.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: exciting implications for clinical practice [^116cdNdL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

2 CURRENT APPROACHES TO THE PREVENTION, RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment in which the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances to late presenters who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status and electrolyte abnormalities requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with a milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes that they are at an increased risk of DKA and to proactively initiate a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and thirst occur late, and hyperglycaemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Current available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

### Case report: insulin edema and acute renal failure [^115TceTR]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Generalized edema due to insulin is a rare phenomenon. We report a 35-year-old woman with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes who presented with generalized edema, serous effusions, and acute renal failure a few hours after starting insulin.

The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis after a 12-month history of polydipsia and polyuria. She had lost 2 kg over a 2-month period and weighed 47 kg, BMI 18 kg/m². Blood pressure was 131/84 mmHg. Clinical examination showed Kussmaul dyspnea, but was otherwise normal. Biological findings were consistent with severe diabetic ketoacidosis: pH 6.80, bicarbonate 1.4 mmol/L. Plasma glucose was 23 mmol/L and HbA 1c 13.3% (122 mmol/mol). Serum creatinine concentration was 90 μmol/L. The patient received a total of 15 L of intravenous fluids over a 96-h period. Insulin therapy was started at a rate of 8 units/h.

Subcutaneous insulin was initiated on the second day, total daily dose 30 units. From the second day on, serum creatinine concentration began to increase, up to 253 μmol/L; estimated glomerular filtration rate 18 mL/min, accompanied by generalized edema. A computed tomography scan, performed when serum creatinine concentration and body weight had already started to increase, showed bilateral pleural effusions and abundant peritoneal effusion. The morphology of the kidneys was normal, and there was no sign of obstruction. A sample of pleural fluid was obtained; protein concentration was 19 g/L. At day 5 the patient had gained 16 kg, the serum creatinine concentration was 260 μmol/L and serum albumin concentration was 22 g/L. Furosemide was started, 80 mg/day. Both body weight and serum creatinine concentration immediately started to decrease and returned to baseline within a couple of days. At day 30, body weight was 54 kg and serum creatinine 73 μmol/L.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis masquerading behind alkalemia an undiagnosed or missed variant of diabetic ketoacidosis [^116d5q2M]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common emergency in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients. But rarely, they may present with alkalemia instead of acidosis. Diabetic ketoalkalosis which has been reported in adults can also be present in children with type 1 DM. The usual factors causing alkalemia were not found in our patients. This entity may manifest in both newly diagnosed and treated patients.

Case Presentation

The first patient, an 8 year male presented with features of DKA, was diagnosed for the first time as type 1 DM, but was found to have alkalemia. The second patient, a 7 year female was a known case of Type 1 DM on insulin, who presented with dehydration and alkalemia. Both were treated with hydration and insulin and made complete recovery.

Conclusions

A normal or alkalotic pH does not essentially eliminate DKA and needs to be evaluated further to identify the underlying acid-base disturbance.

Dehydration from fluid loss secondary to glycosuria is the central pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Decreased oral intake and increased insensible water loss are also common in DKA. Severe dehydration should lead to hypovolemia and hypotension. We present a case of DKA with severe dehydration and hypertension in contrast to expected hypotension. The aim of this article was to increase awareness that pediatric DKA could present with hypertension, and this should be looked at and included in DKA management protocols.

Diagnosis

Urosepsis, dehydration, kidney stone disease, hyperparathyroidism, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

Management

Hydration, antibiotics, intravenous pamidronate for rapid control of hypercalcemia, parathyroidectomy, surgical removal of the large kidney stones, a low-protein and low-sodium diet, and initiation of treatment with a thiazide diuretic.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113gT6Kk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that presents commonly to the emergency department. Severe DKA has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is incumbent on the emergency clinician to be vigilant in the management of these critically ill patients.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of the adult patient with severe DKA.

Discussion

DKA is a condition found most commonly in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often due to nonadherence with diabetic medications or an inciting event, such as infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis present rather than absolute glucose level. The management of severe DKA involves assessing and treating the inciting event, fluid hydration, insulin, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent the complications that can occur.

Conclusions

DKA is a medical condition that has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

We report the unique coincidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. A 46-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes complained of polyuria with a daily output of 5 L. Although urinalysis demonstrated significant glucosuria, diabetes insipidus was suspected owing to a low urine specific gravity (1.008). The low specific gravity persisted during a water deprivation test. Ultimately, diabetes insipidus was confirmed when urine specific gravity and urine osmolality normalized following desmopressin administration. This case emphasizes the importance of accurately interpreting the urine specific gravity in patients with polyuria and diabetes mellitus to detect diabetes insipidus.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^111FNs5s]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Polyuria refers to the excessive production of urine, generally defined as > 2000 mL/m²/24h in the pediatric population. Polyuria is differentiated from urinary frequency, which is the increased need to urinate without excessive urine volume production. While urinary frequency is a relatively common phenomenon in children, often occurring in the setting of lower genito-urinary tract infections, the causes of polyuria in pediatric patients are less common and require prompt recognition and diagnosis. Polyuria frequently presents in the setting of underlying conditions that result in either a water diuresis or solute diuresis. The differential diagnosis for new-onset polyuria in the pediatric population includes diabetes mellitus, central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, in addition to other less common metabolic, endocrine, renal, and psychological causes (Table 1).

Special considerations/patients

In the setting of severely uncontrolled diabetes with catabolism, defined as fasting plasma glucose levels > 13.9 mmol/l (250 mg/dl), random glucose levels consistently above 16.7 mmol/l (300 mg/dl), A1C above 10%, or the presence of ketonuria, or as symptomatic diabetes with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss, insulin therapy in combination with lifestyle intervention is the treatment of choice. Some patients with these characteristics will have unrecognized type 1 diabetes; others will have type 2 diabetes with severe insulin deficiency. Insulin can be titrated rapidly and is associated with the greatest likelihood of returning glucose levels rapidly to target levels. After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels decreased, oral agents can often be added and it may be possible to withdraw insulin, if preferred.

### Hypoglycemia during hyperosmolar hyperglycemic crises is associated with long-term mortality [^117VHpAZ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperglycemic crises, such as a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), are severe acute complications of diabetes mellitus. HHS, which is typical but not exclusive of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is characterized by marked hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and severe dehydration. DKA, typical but not exclusive of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or insulin-deficient diabetes, is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis with elevated anion gap due to increased ketone body concentrations, and variable degrees of osmolality and dehydration. Both entities share common symptoms, such as weight loss, polydipsia, and polyuria, the latter being a major cause of dehydration. In addition, infectious symptoms can be common to both conditions, given that infections often act as precipitants of these crises. However, there are some differences in the symptom presentation of HHS and DKA. The course of HHS is generally slow and insidious, whereas that of DKA is typically abrupt. This is because the accumulation of ketones that occurs in DKA can produce acute symptoms characteristic of DKA: acetone breath, Kussmaul breathing, vomiting, and abdominal pain. This acute symptomatology can lead patients with DKA to seek medical attention quickly, so the polyuria of DKA usually has a short evolution time and produces only a state of mild hypovolemia. However, if the DKA is not treated in time, hyperglycemia and dehydration can progress, producing a hyperosmolar state similar to that of HHS, which can contribute to altered mental status. Therefore, cases can overlap between HHS and DKA.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Dapagliflozin (SGLT2-I) induced euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis [^114z2CxV]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-i) have become a popular therapeutic strategy in the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary site of action of SGLT2-i is at the proximal renal convoluted tubule. They work by blocking SGLT2 receptors, sodium-dependent glucose co-transport molecules, which in turn prevents glucose reabsorption, facilitating glucosuria, improving glycaemic control as well as a moderate degree of weight loss. We report the case of a 51-year-old woman admitted to the acute medical unit with abdominal pain and vomiting, who was diagnosed with euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to recent initiation of an SGLT2-i medication (dapagliflozin). Clinicians should be aware of this rare side effect of SGLT2-i, to circumvent delays in patient management.

### Canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Invokamet) [^116TbwtG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR.

Withhold INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume INVOKAMET or INVOKAMET XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

### New-onset diabetes in an obese adolescent: diagnostic dilemmas [^114wfjr5]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

A 14-year-old, obese, African American boy presented to his pediatrician with polyuria, polydipsia, and a significant unintentional weight loss. He was dehydrated, with high levels of blood sugar and urinary ketones. He had no history of previous illnesses and was not taking any medications. He had a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Investigations

Physical examination included assessing stigmata of insulin resistance, and measuring blood pressure, pulse, and BMI. Blood samples were obtained for measurement of venous blood pH, bicarbonate, serum glucose, electrolytes, HbA(1C), aminotransferases and lipids. Urine was sampled for measurement of ketones. Subsequently, measurements of fasting C-peptide and immunoassays for insulin autoantibodies (IAA), islet-cell autoantibodies (ICA-512) and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD-65) were performed.

Diagnosis

New-onset diabetes mellitus with diabetic ketoacidosis, initially diagnosed as type 2 diabetes mellitus, but later determined as type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Management

After treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis with hydration and insulin infusion, the patient was discharged on subcutaneous insulin. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and was transferred to oral insulin-sensitizing agents. He re-presented 18 months later with an insulin requirement during an asthma exacerbation treated with steroids. Due to the worsening of his diabetic symptoms, the patient was tested for islet autoantibodies and was found to be positive for GAD-65 and IAA, that is, diagnostic of type 1 diabetes mellitus. He has continued to require subcutaneous insulin.

### Controversies around the measurement of blood ketones to diagnose and manage diabetic ketoacidosis [^111aUKuC]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The measurement of blood ketones in preference to urine ketones has become a well-established tool in the diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, there remains considerable disparity between diabetes guidelines regarding if, how, and when this test should be used. While recent guidelines now mainly emphasize blood measurement, several issues nonetheless remain. Many laboratories still measure blood ketones using a semiquantitative test that does not measure the predominant ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), which may hinder patient management. Even when BOHB is measured, the evidence for cutoffs used in DKA diagnosis or exclusion is limited, while its use in gauging severity, treatment progress, and resolution is not fully clear. Lastly, although employing point-of-care meters instead of a laboratory for BOHB measurement brings undoubted benefits, this approach has its own challenges. This article provides a perspective on these topics to complement current recommendations and to suggest how future research may improve its use in the DKA context.

### Optimising the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 1 diabetes [^114F3ib3]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Consider Prescribing Dapagliflozin

People most suitable for dapagliflozin in T1DM are likely to be those with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2, established on stable optimised insulin therapy (i.e. not recently diagnosed) and with high insulin needs (i.e. > 0.5 units/kg of body weight/day).

One of the most important criteria for determining if someone is suitable for dapagliflozin treatment is normal blood ketone levels (< 0.6 mmol/l). Urine ketone monitoring is not advisable as it is not deemed to be as accurate as blood ketone testing, since urine test results are indicative of blood ketone levels in the past, and accuracy is also affected by hydration levels and kidney function. The willingness/ability to follow prescribed regimens for monitoring ketones and responding appropriately to elevated ketone levels must also be considered.

Additional criteria for which people with T1DM should be prescribed dapagliflozin include glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (as dapagliflozin efficacy is dependent on renal function) and age 18–74 years (as the DEPICT clinical trial programme was conducted in this age group).

### Diabetic ketoacidosis as a complication of methanol poisoning; a case report [^116e1FPA]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methanol intoxication is a toxicologic emergency which occurs due to ingestion of methanol-containing alcoholic beverages in countries where alcohol ingestion is prohibited. Since treatments should be initiated immediately in case of high suspicion, it is important to recognize methanol poisoning promptly. Any delay in initiation of treatment results in detrimental consequences including blindness and death. Symptoms include gastrointestinal and visual complications that can lead to critical involvement of the central nervous system and eventually to complete vision loss. Formation of formic acid is responsible for the high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA).

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most debilitating complications of diabetes presenting with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal pain, acetone breath, and Kussmaul breathing pattern. Diabetic ketoacidosis is also associated with HAGMA. It is imperative to differentiate DKA from other causes of metabolic acidosis. We present a case of methanol poisoning presenting with DKA.

### SGLT2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^115biWNT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The development of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) complicated by hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is a rare occurrence. HSS is most commonly observed in elderly patients with T2DM and is associated with a mortality rate 10 times higher than that of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Sodium-glucose cotransport 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a class of glucose-lowering agents, work by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules, thereby promoting glucosuria. Their diuretic effect is thought to result from mild osmotic diuresis and natriuresis. Emerging evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors also confer cardiorenal benefits, even in individuals without T2DM, by influencing salt and water homeostasis. However, the appropriateness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM who also have coexisting CDI remains unclear. This case highlights the potential challenges in diagnosing and managing CDI in the context of T2DM and HHS, particularly when SGLT2 inhibitors are used, as they may mask or exacerbate CDI symptoms. Further research is needed to clarify the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in this unique patient population.

Hypokalemia is common during the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); however, severe hypokalemia at presentation prior to insulin treatment is exceedingly uncommon. A previously healthy 8-yr-old female presented with new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe DKA (pH = 6.98), and profound hypokalemia (serum K = 1.3 mmol/L) accompanied by cardiac dysrhythmia. Insulin therapy was delayed for 9 h to allow replenishment of potassium to safe serum levels. Meticulous intensive care management resulted in complete recovery. This case highlights the importance of measuring serum potassium levels prior to initiating insulin therapy in DKA, judicious fluid and electrolyte management, as well as delaying and/or reducing insulin infusion rates in the setting of severe hypokalemia.

Child with suspected type 2 diabetes — diagnostic criteria and laboratory features include the following: diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, 2 hour post prandial glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl after glucose load of 1 gm/ kg (maximum dose: 75 gm), HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or random blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl in patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, and in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, result should be repeated. Simultaneous c-peptide level is elevated and undetectable pancreatic autoantibodies include islet cell antibodies (ICA), GAD-65, insulin antibodies, IA2A and ZnT8. Most commercial laboratories may have the assays to test for some/ most of the autoantibodies accurately. Should be done after discussion with the endocrinologist. Electrolyte abnormalities include pseudo-hyponatremia (secondary to blood glucose elevation), metabolic acidosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (secondary to dehydration), and liver function abnormality (secondary to Non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis [NASH]). Children with Type 2 diabetes can present in DKA and are also more likely to present with Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), both of which are medical emergencies.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^111nn3Px]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering medications which increase the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption and promote glucosuria. Treatment with these agents raises serum ketone levels, and cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during therapy have been reported. The duration of glucosuria and inpatient course of SGLT2i-related DKA, however, is not well-characterized. We report 11 inpatient cases of SGLT2i-related DKA, including a subset of patients who experienced prolonged glucosuria and relapse of DKA during their hospitalization.

### Diabetic coma… [^116bgrS7]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Diabetic coma is a life-threatening but reversible form of coma found in people with diabetes mellitus. Three different types of diabetic coma are identified:

1. Severe low blood sugar in a diabetic person
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis advanced enough to result in unconsciousness from a combination of a severely increased blood sugar level, dehydration and shock, and exhaustion 3. Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma in which an extremely high blood sugar level and dehydration alone are sufficient to cause unconsciousness. In most medical contexts, the term diabetic coma refers to the diagnostical dilemma posed when a physician is confronted with an unconscious patient about whom nothing is known except that they have diabetes. An example might be a physician working in an emergency department who receives an unconscious patient wearing a medical identification tag saying DIABETIC.

Paramedics may be called to rescue an unconscious person by friends who identify them as diabetic. Brief descriptions of the three major conditions are followed by a discussion of the diagnostic process used to distinguish among them, as well as a few other conditions which must be considered. An estimated 2 to 15 percent of people with diabetes will have at least one episode of diabetic coma in their lifetimes as a result of severe hypoglycemia. Types Severe hypoglycemia People with type 1 diabetes mellitus who must take insulin in full replacement doses are most vulnerable to episodes of hypoglycemia. This can occur if a person takes too much insulin or diabetic medication, does strenuous exercise without eating additional food, misses meals, consumes too much alcohol, or consumes alcohol without food.

It is usually mild enough to reverse by eating or drinking carbohydrates, but blood glucose occasionally can fall fast enough and low enough to produce unconsciousness before hypoglycemia can be recognized and reversed. Hypoglycemia can be severe enough to cause unconsciousness during sleep. Predisposing factors can include eating less than usual or prolonged exercise earlier in the day. Some people with diabetes can lose their ability to recognize the symptoms of early hypoglycemia. Unconsciousness due to hypoglycemia can occur within 20 minutes to an hour after early symptoms and is not usually preceded by other illness or symptoms. Twitching or convulsions may occur. A person unconscious from hypoglycemia is usually pale, has a rapid heart beat, and is soaked in sweat: all signs of the adrenaline response to hypoglycemia. The individual is not usually dehydrated and breathing is normal or shallow.

Their blood sugar level, measured by a glucose meter or laboratory measurement at the time of discovery, is usually low but not always severely, and in some cases may have already risen from the nadir that triggered the unconsciousness. Unconsciousness due to hypoglycemia is treated by raising the blood glucose with intravenous glucose or injected glucagon. Advanced diabetic ketoacidosis Diabetic ketoacidosis, most typically seen in those with type 1 diabetes, is triggered by the build-up of chemicals called ketones. These are strongly acidic and a build-up can cause the blood to become acidic. When these levels get too high it essentially poisons the body and causes DKA. If it progresses and worsens without treatment it can eventually cause unconsciousness, from a combination of a very high blood sugar level, dehydration and shock, and exhaustion. Coma only occurs at an advanced stage, usually after 36 hours or more of worsening vomiting and hyperventilation.

### Signs and symptoms… [^1169mCzy]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

DKA happens most often in those with type 1 diabetes but can also occur in those with other types of diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response, the body switches to burning fatty acids, which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH and keto acids in either the blood or urine. The primary treatment of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin may be given intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually, potassium is also needed to prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment, blood glucose and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Underlying causes for the DKA should be identified.

In those with severely low blood pH who are critically ill, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended. Furthermore, it can be triggered by severe acute illness, dehydration, extensive exercise, surgery, low-carbohydrate diets, or excessive alcohol intake. Proposed mechanisms for SGLT2-I induced "euglycemic DKA" include increased ketosis due to volume depletion combined with relative insulin deficiency and glucagon excess. SGLT2 inhibitors should be stopped before surgery and only recommenced when it is safe to do so. In various situations such as infection, insulin demands rise but are not matched by the failing pancreas. Blood sugars rise, dehydration ensues, and resistance to the normal effects of insulin increases further by way of a vicious circle.

As a result of the above mechanisms, the average adult with DKA has a total body water shortage of about 6 liters, in addition to substantial shortages in sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, magnesium and calcium. Glucose levels usually exceed 13. 8 mmol/L or 250 mg/dL. Likely factors in the development of cerebral edema are dehydration, acidosis and low carbon dioxide levels; in addition, the increased level of inflammation and coagulation may, together with these factors, lead to decreased blood flow to parts of the brain, which then swells up once fluid replacement has been commenced. The swelling of brain tissue leads to raised intracranial pressure ultimately leading to death. Diagnosis Investigations Diabetic ketoacidosis may be diagnosed when the combination of hyperglycemia, ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated.

In about 10% of cases the blood sugar is not significantly elevated. A pH measurement is performed to detect acidosis. Blood from a vein is adequate, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH; arterial samples are only required if there are concerns about oxygen levels. Ketones can be measured in the urine and blood. When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need for admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise. In addition to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine and electrolytes.

### Complications of diabetes… [^114MeSz8]. Wikipedia (2009). Low credibility.

Acute complications Diabetic ketoacidosis Diabetic ketoacidosis is one of the life-threatening severe complications of diabetes that demands immediate attention and intervention. It is considered a medical emergency and can affect both patients with T1D and T2D, but it is more common in T1D. DKA results from significantly low insulin levels due to various factors including undiagnosed diabetes, missed or delayed doses, insufficient insulin administration, or undergoing physiological stress. Due to insulin absence, it simply triggers the release of counter-regulatory hormones resulting in serious health complications. This release prompts excessive free fatty acids production as a result of the adipose tissue exhibiting heightened activity of hormone-sensitive lipase.

Subsequently, the liver turns fatty acid to ketone bodies for fuel, a process known as ketosis, which causes Ketonemia that decreases the blood's pH, leading to DKA. While periodic ketosis is normal, but can become a serious problem if sustained. These hormones can also induce hyperglycemia by stimulating gluconeogenesis thereby increasing the renal glucose output. In addition to the endogenous renal glucose produced by the kidneys. The condition of high circulating concentrations of ketone bodies and hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis, characterized by the excessive presence of glucose and ketones in the urine. Consequently, osmotic diuresis causes dehydration and electrolyte loss. Ketoacidosis can easily become severe enough to cause hypotension, shock, and death.

The DKA is diagnosed by the urine analysis which will reveal significant levels of ketone bodies. And also venous blood investigation for electrolytes, glucose, and acid-base status. The expected result of the treatment tackles the deeper causes; which are dehydration, acidosis, and hyperglycemia, and initiates a reversal of the ketosis process. While replacing fluid and electrolyte loss, insulin, and acid-placed balance are the aim of this treatment. proper treatment usually results in full recovery, though death can result from inadequate or delayed treatment, or from complications. Preventing DKA is attainable by following some precautions. While feeling unwell, Start with regular monitoring of blood glucose levels. In addition to measuring blood or urine ketone concentrations twice a day and more.

In case there are ketones, insulin doses should be increased. Patients are also advised to focus on dehydration and go to the hospital in case of frequent vomiting. Hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state hyperosmolar non-ketotic state or Hyperglycemia hyperosmolar state is an acute complication sharing many symptoms with DKA, but an entirely different origin and different treatment. Oppositely, the prevalence of HHS is common in individuals with T2D. Furthermore, it showcases approximately ten times greater mortality rate than the observed in DKA. Both DKA and HHS occur when insulin becomes less effective, either due to a shortage of insulin secretion, or lack of proper insulin action. For a person with very high blood glucose levels, that will result in osmotic diuresis, water is osmotically drawn out of cells into the blood and the kidneys eventually begin to dump glucose into the urine.

### Nephrotic syndrome… [^1136Azff]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms due to kidney damage. This includes protein in the urine, low blood albumin levels, high blood lipids, and significant swelling. Other symptoms may include weight gain, feeling tired, and foamy urine. Complications may include blood clots, infections, and high blood pressure. Causes include a number of kidney diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and minimal change disease. It may also occur as a complication of diabetes, lupus, or amyloidosis. The underlying mechanism typically involves damage to the glomeruli of the kidney. Diagnosis is typically based on urine testing and sometimes a kidney biopsy. It differs from nephritic syndrome in that there are no red blood cells in the urine. Signs and symptoms Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by large amounts of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidaemia, and edema that begins in the face. Lipiduria can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. The main signs of nephrotic syndrome are:

- Proteinuria of greater than 3. 5 g /24 h /1. 73 m² or greater than 40 mg/h/m² in children. The ratio between urinary concentrations of albumin and creatinine can be used in the absence of a 24-hour urine test for total protein. This coefficient will be greater than 200–400 mg/mmol in nephrotic syndrome. This pronounced loss of proteins is due to an increase in glomerular permeability that allows proteins to pass into the urine instead of being retained in the blood.

Under normal conditions, a 24-hour urine sample should not exceed 80 milligrams or 10 milligrams per decilitre.
- Edema is thought to be caused by two mechanisms. The first being hypoalbuminemia, which lowers the oncotic pressure within vessels, resulting in hypovolemia and subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin system and thus retention of sodium and water. Additionally, it is thought that urinary proteases cause a direct effect by activating the epithelial sodium channel on the principal cell that leads to the reabsorption of sodium and water.
- Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but is very rarely found in adults.
- **Acute kidney failure due to hypovolemia**: the loss of vascular fluid into the tissues produces a decreased blood supply to the kidneys, which causes a loss of kidney function. Thus, it is a tricky task to get rid of excess fluid in the body while maintaining circulatory euvolemia.
- **Growth retardation**: This can occur in cases of relapse or resistance to therapy. Causes of growth retardation are protein deficiency from the loss of protein in urine, anorexia, and steroid therapy.
- Cushing's syndrome.
- **Diabetic nephropathy**: is a complication that occurs in some diabetics. Excess blood sugar accumulates in the kidneys, causing them to become inflamed and unable to carry out their normal function. This leads to the leakage of proteins into the urine.
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus**: this autoimmune disease can affect several organs, among them the kidney, due to the deposit of immunocomplexes that are typical of this disease.
