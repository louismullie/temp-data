## Question

causes of elevated lipase 104, increased alkaline phosphate to 132, normal CEA. 83 yo female hisotry of cholecystectomy and history of colon cancer. abdominal bloating and nausea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of elevated lipase (104) and alkaline phosphatase (132) with normal CEA in an 83-year-old woman with prior cholecystectomy, remote colon cancer, and new bloating/nausea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the laboratory pattern meets criteria for acute pancreatitis or instead suggests a biliary or pancreatic obstruction pattern. Then, I should verify patient-specific risk factors that might shift pretest probabilities, especially malignancy and post-cholecystectomy stones or strictures. Next, I will generate a prioritized differential focused on pancreatobiliary disease but not forgetting non-pancreatic lipase sources and medications. After that, I need to outline an evidence-based evaluation pathway: confirm key labs, review medications, and choose the right first-line imaging, escalating to MRCP or pancreas-protocol CT as indicated. Finally, I will consider red flags and immediate actions, and I should also plan contingencies if the initial workup is unrevealing, including the possibility of benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia with longitudinal follow-up [^113hMxVS].

> Let me first confirm whether this qualifies as acute pancreatitis. Lipase of 104 U/L is either normal or only mildly elevated depending on the assay and clearly does not meet the ≥ 3× ULN threshold required by the revised Atlanta/ACG criteria, and I should not diagnose acute pancreatitis without two of: characteristic pain, enzyme elevation ≥ 3× ULN, or imaging evidence, which we do not have here, so I should avoid jumping to that conclusion [^113p99NM] [^1162wHBz].

> Wait, let me verify the meaning of the cholestatic signal. An alkaline phosphatase of 132 U/L is a mild cholestatic rise that nudges me toward biliary obstruction or infiltrative hepatobiliary disease, and when paired with even a small lipase bump in an older adult with upper abdominal symptoms, I should think about processes that can involve both the bile duct and pancreatic duct near the ampulla, such as choledocholithiasis, a periampullary lesion, or a pancreatic head mass compressing ducts, so I need imaging to interrogate the biliary tree first line with ultrasound per guidelines [^113yP4DT] [^113UkjmJ].

> I need to consider patient-specific risk factors carefully. Age over 80 elevates the baseline risk of pancreatic and biliary malignancy, prior cholecystectomy does not exclude de novo common bile duct stones or postoperative biliary strictures, and a remote history of colon cancer means I should not rely on a normal CEA to rule out recurrence or metastasis when new symptoms appear; this profile raises my threshold for observation and lowers my threshold for early cross-sectional imaging if ultrasound is unrevealing [^115apfLq] [^112NYjCw].

> Now, I will prioritize the differential while keeping myself honest. Choledocholithiasis or benign biliary stricture remains high on the list given the ALP pattern and post-cholecystectomy status, and biliary pancreatitis can present with cholestatic labs and pancreatic enzyme perturbations, so I should screen for ductal dilation or stones on ultrasound first, with escalation as needed per EASL and WSES recommendations [^113yP4DT] [^113UkjmJ]. But hold on, I should also keep pancreatic head or ampullary neoplasm in view because painless or oligosymptomatic cholestasis with subtle enzyme changes can be an initial clue; if suspicion persists, a pancreas-protocol contrast-enhanced CT is recommended by AAFP for suspected pancreatic cancer [^112NYjCw]. Chronic pancreatitis with biliary stricture can mimic this, and bloating could reflect exocrine insufficiency, so I should watch for weight loss, steatorrhea, and consider fecal elastase testing if suggested by the clinical course [^117VBczg] [^114LQU8z]. I should not forget hepatic metastases or cholangiocarcinoma as causes of cholestatic labs in an older adult, and although less likely, non-pancreatic lipase elevations can occur with colitis or other GI inflammation, so a discordant clinical picture should prompt me to double-check for non-pancreatic sources before anchoring on pancreatitis [^114eFvfL].

> Let me think about medication and other non-pancreatobiliary contributors before I get anchored. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide can raise lipase and have postmarketing pancreatitis signals, and several oncologic or immunologic agents list pancreatic enzyme elevations and pancreatitis among adverse events; I need to review the medication list and timelines to avoid missing a drug effect, while recognizing that lipase elevations on these agents can be clinically silent and nonspecific without other pancreatitis features [^113RBwX2] [^113xtr3n] [^111P8qgG] [^113xTHQV] [^113cCiFF]. If enzymes remain modestly elevated chronically with a negative workup, benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia becomes a consideration, but that is a diagnosis of exclusion after prolonged follow-up, so I should not jump there prematurely [^113hMxVS].

> Next, I should review and confirm the laboratory strategy. Initially, I almost said to routinely add amylase, but wait, I should correct myself: guidelines support lipase alone for suspected pancreatitis, and amylase adds little; however, if I specifically suspect a macroenzyme phenomenon or discordant enzyme pattern, then adding amylase can be justified, so I will tailor it rather than reflexively ordering both [^1162wHBz] [^114sBgs7]. I need a full liver panel including direct bilirubin and GGT to characterize cholestasis, basic metabolic panel to assess renal function because reduced clearance can nudge lipase upward, and I should consider CA 19–9 acknowledging its limitations, especially if imaging suggests a pancreaticobiliary mass, while not delaying imaging for tumor markers [^112NYjCw].

> I will now examine the imaging pathway and sequence. Per high-quality guidelines, the first-line test in suspected biliary disease is right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ductal dilation, stones, and liver lesions, and if the ultrasound is negative yet clinical suspicion remains, I should proceed to MRCP or a pancreas-protocol contrast-enhanced CT to better define the ducts and pancreatic head, with WSES noting the value of repeat ultrasound in idiopathic settings and AAFP recommending pancreas-protocol CT when a pancreatic neoplasm is suspected [^113UkjmJ] [^114qDJQD] [^112NYjCw]. Hold on, I should verify that ERCP is therapeutic rather than diagnostic; unless there is cholangitis or clear obstructive pathology requiring intervention, noninvasive imaging should come first to avoid procedure-related pancreatitis risks [^115apfLq].

> But wait, what if imaging shows specific actionable findings. If there is CBD stone or obstructing papillary pathology, I should arrange therapeutic ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction per bile duct stone guidelines; if there is a pancreatic head mass or ampullary lesion, I should obtain pancreas-protocol CT followed by EUS-guided tissue diagnosis as appropriate, while monitoring for biliary obstruction complications and considering biliary drainage if cholestasis is significant, keeping in mind that older patients may decompensate quickly with obstructive processes [^115apfLq] [^112NYjCw]. If chronic pancreatitis features or symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency emerge, I should confirm with fecal elastase and consider enzyme replacement per AGA practice updates, as this can also mitigate bloating and nausea if maldigestion is present [^117VBczg].

> I should double-check for red flags that warrant escalation now. New jaundice, acholic stools, dark urine, persistent vomiting, progressive weight loss, or systemic toxicity should prompt expedited imaging and specialist referral, and although CEA is normal, I need to ensure we are not falsely reassured given her malignancy risk profile and age, so the threshold for pancreas-protocol CT and MRCP remains low in this context [^112NYjCw] [^113UkjmJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure a contingency if the initial evaluation is unrevealing. If the ultrasound, MRCP/CT, and labs do not disclose a cause and symptoms are mild with stable labs, I can repeat enzymes to exclude assay variability, review medications once more, and if pancreatic enzymes persistently drift without structural disease over serial imaging, I can consider benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia with longitudinal follow-up up to 24 months, while remembering WSES guidance that repeating ultrasound can improve detection of biliary etiologies that were initially missed, which helps avoid prematurely labeling the case as idiopathic [^113hMxVS] [^114qDJQD].

In an 83-year-old woman with prior cholecystectomy and colon cancer, **mildly elevated lipase (104 U/L) and ALP (132 U/L) with normal CEA** [^111wfzKF] most likely reflect **biliary obstruction from choledocholithiasis or biliary strictures** [^113yP4DT]. Other considerations include **pancreaticobiliary malignancy** (pancreatic or cholangiocarcinoma) [^112NYjCw], **medication-induced enzyme elevation** [^113RBwX2], or **benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia** [^113hMxVS]. The next step is to obtain **abdominal ultrasound or MRCP** [^113UkjmJ] to assess for biliary obstruction, stones, or masses, and to check CA 19–9 and liver function tests; if imaging is inconclusive, proceed to EUS or ERCP.

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Biliary obstruction or strictures

Choledocholithiasis or biliary strictures [^113yP4DT] can cause **obstruction** despite prior cholecystectomy [^115nbJYv], resulting in elevated ALP and mild lipase elevation due to increased pancreatic duct pressure. Post-cholecystectomy **sphincter of Oddi dysfunction** may also cause intermittent obstruction with concurrent ALP and lipase elevations.

---

### Pancreaticobiliary malignancy

Pancreatic cancer may present with **mild lipase elevation** and cholestatic liver tests; a normal CEA does not exclude malignancy. Cholangiocarcinoma can likewise cause **biliary obstruction** with elevated ALP and mild lipase elevation.

---

### Medication-induced enzyme elevation

Common medications in older adults can cause **mild lipase elevation** with cholestatic liver test abnormalities. Agents include **GLP-1 agonists** [^113RBwX2] [^113xtr3n], thiazides, ACE inhibitors, and statins.

---

### Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia

Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia presents with **persistent mild lipase elevation** without pancreatitis or structural disease [^113hMxVS]. It is a recognized phenomenon in older adults and may warrant observation rather than intervention if no other cause is identified [^113hMxVS].

---

### Other considerations

Chronic pancreatitis is less likely without **characteristic pain or imaging changes** [^112y4V1D], although it can present with mild enzyme elevation. Infectious or inflammatory conditions are also less likely in the absence of **systemic signs**.

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

Given the patient's history and current findings, a **structured evaluation is warranted**:

| **Diagnostic test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Abdominal ultrasound | First-line to detect biliary obstruction, stones, or ductal dilation [^113yP4DT] [^113UkjmJ] |
| MRCP | Noninvasive assessment of biliary and pancreatic ducts for strictures, stones, or masses |
| CA 19–9 | Tumor marker for pancreaticobiliary malignancy |
| Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) | Assess extent of cholestasis and hepatocellular injury [^111MfEZb] |
| Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) | If imaging is inconclusive, to detect small lesions or subtle ductal abnormalities |
| ERCP | Diagnostic and therapeutic for confirmed biliary obstruction or strictures |

---

## Clinical significance and management implications

- **Biliary obstruction**: If confirmed, ERCP with stone extraction or stenting is indicated.

- **Pancreaticobiliary malignancy**: If suspected, prompt oncologic evaluation and management are required [^112NYjCw].

- **Medication-induced elevation**: Review and adjust medications as appropriate [^113xtr3n].

- **Benign hyperenzymemia**: If no structural disease is found, reassure and monitor [^113hMxVS].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely causes of mildly elevated lipase and ALP in this patient are biliary obstruction due to choledocholithiasis or strictures; pancreaticobiliary malignancy; medication effects; or benign hyperenzymemia. **Targeted imaging and laboratory testing** [^113UkjmJ] will clarify the diagnosis and guide management.

### Man with epigastric pain and persistently elevated serum lipase [^113hMxVS]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Serum lipase and amylase are commonly requested in individuals presenting with abdominal pain for the investigation of acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic hyperenzymemia is not specific to acute pancreatitis; it can occur in many other pancreatic and non-pancreatic conditions. When persistent elevation of serum lipase and amylase occurs without a diagnosed cause or evidence of laboratory assay interference, ongoing radiological assessment for pancreatic disease is required for 24 months before diagnosing benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia.

We report a case of a 71-year-old man with epigastric pain and elevated serum lipase levels. He was extensively investigated, but no pancreatic disease was detected. He is asymptomatic, but serum lipase levels remain elevated 18 months after his initial presentation.

### A patient with abdominal pain and markedly elevated transaminase levels after cholecystectomy [^115nbJYv]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old white female with a history of cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with intermittent severe abdominal pain radiating from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant, associated with nausea and emesis. Three weeks earlier, the patient had presented to the emergency department with similar abdominal pain. Laboratory investigations had revealed elevated bilirubin, transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. At that time, pain and liver chemistry test results improved, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. She denied a history of alcohol use, new medications, or the ingestion of other toxins.

- **Investigations**: History and physical examination, liver chemistry tests, viral hepatitis serology tests, autoimmune serology tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy, and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram.

- **Diagnosis**: Choledocholithiasis.

- **Management**: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram with sphincterotomy, removal of an 8 mm distal common bile duct stone, and pancreatic stent placement.

### Victoza [^113RBwX2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In one adult glycemic control trial involving patients with renal impairment, a mean increase of 33% for lipase and 15% for amylase from baseline was observed in Victoza-treated patients, while placebo-treated patients exhibited a mean decrease in lipase of 3% and a mean increase in amylase of 1%.

In the LEADER trial, serum lipase and amylase were routinely measured. Among adult Victoza-treated patients, 7.9% had a lipase value during treatment of greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal, compared with 4.5% of placebo-treated patients. Additionally, 1% of Victoza-treated patients had an amylase value of greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients.

The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with Victoza is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Vital signs**: Victoza did not have adverse effects on blood pressure. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute have been observed in adult patients treated with Victoza compared to placebo.

- **6.2 Postmarketing experience**: The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Victoza. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

	- **Gastrointestinal**: Acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis.

### Recurrent acute pancreatitis: International state-of-the-science conference with recommendations [^113vU3Jk]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) is a clinically significant problem globally. The etiology remains unclear in approximately 10% to 15% of patients despite a thorough workup. Data on the natural history and efficacy of treatments are limited. We aimed to establish criteria for diagnosis, evaluate the causative factors, and reach a consensus on the appropriate workup and management of patients with RAP.

The organizing committee was formed, and a set of questions was developed based on evidence, controversies, and topics that needed further research. After a vetting process, these topics were assigned to a group of experts from around the world with a special interest in RAP. Data were presented as part of a workshop on RAP organized as a part of the annual meeting of the American Pancreatic Association. Pretest and posttest questions were administered, and the responses were tabulated by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. The consensus guidelines were established in the format of a diagnostic algorithm.

Several deficiencies were identified with respect to the etiology, treatment efficacies, and areas that need immediate research at the time of writing.

### Paraduodenal pancreatitis as diagnostic challenge: Clinical and morphological features of patients with pancreatic pathology involving the pancreatic groove [^1162Rs9C]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

We retrospectively evaluated the clinical records of patients who were managed in the University Hospital of Erlangen (Germany) following a diagnosis of a new-onset pancreatic pathology involving the groove area on imaging. This was defined at the first imaging evaluation and re-evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the clinical data (MH and MW). We analyzed clinical, surgical, and radiological data, as well as hospital readmissions, using our prospective clinical database ("Soarian") (Siemens GmbH, Erlangen) from January 1, 2005, up to December 31, 2022.

The diagnosis of paraduodenal pancreatitis (PP) was based on imaging (computed tomography [CT] and/or magnetic resonance [MRI]) or histology. The primary aim was to define the diagnostic features of PP compared to similar conditions involving the groove area, namely acute pancreatitis (AP) with groove necrosis. Secondary aims were to compare clinical and radiological data and outcomes of conservative, interventional, and surgical therapies for pancreatitis involving the groove area. The diagnosis of PP was confirmed according to imaging and, where available, histopathology. The diagnosis of AP was made according to the revised Atlanta classification, and patients were assigned to the AP group a posteriori, taking into account their clinical course and medical history to exclude chronic pancreatitis.

Data collection

The following clinical parameters were collected: age at clinical onset; sex; alcohol consumption (none or > 20 g/day); cigarette smoking (none or > 10 pack years); jaundice; vomiting; weight loss (defined as a reduction by > 1 [truncated]).

### Serum amylase and lipase and urinary trypsinogen and amylase for diagnosis of acute pancreatitis [^117Bi8y8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of people with acute abdominal pain differs if they have acute pancreatitis. It is important to know the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, so that an informed decision can be made regarding whether the person with abdominal pain has acute pancreatitis. There is currently no Cochrane review of the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for this diagnosis.

- **Objectives**: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase, either alone or in combination, in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in people with an acute onset of persistent, severe epigastric pain or diffuse abdominal pain.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR HTA and DARE), and other databases until March 2017. We searched the references of the included studies to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies based on language, publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We also performed a 'related search' and 'citing reference' search in MEDLINE and Embase.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of serum amylase, serum lipase, urinary trypsinogen-2, and urinary amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. We excluded case-control studies because these studies are prone to bias in assessing diagnostic test accuracy.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^1132RVti]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Given the rising prevalence of cannabis use in youth, cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. A lipase level should be assessed when a patient presents with symptoms of acute pancreatitis, especially when there is no clear etiology from initial investigations. A comprehensive cannabis history should be obtained, including details about consumption patterns in the days and weeks prior to potential acute pancreatitis (AP) and the method of consumption.

### Zilbrysq [^113xTHQV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The adverse reactions associated with Zilbrysq have been discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:

- **Serious meningococcal infections**: Refer to the warnings and precautions (5.1).
- **Other infections**: Detailed in the warnings and precautions (5.3).
- **Pancreatitis and other pancreatic conditions**: See warnings and precautions (5.4).

- **Clinical trials experience**: Due to the varying conditions under which clinical trials are conducted, the rates of adverse reactions observed with Zilbrysq in clinical trials may differ and cannot be directly compared to rates observed in other clinical trials or in practice.

A total of 212 patients were treated with Zilbrysq at a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg in clinical studies for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Among these, 137 patients were exposed for at least 6 months, and 87 for at least 1 year.

In a placebo-controlled study (Study 1) involving patients with gMG, 86 patients received Zilbrysq at 0.3 mg/kg [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Of these participants, approximately 61% were female, 77% were White, 8% were Asian, and 8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The average age at the time of study entry was 52.6 years, with a range from 21 to 75 years.

Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of patients treated with Zilbrysq and more frequently than those receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients treated with Zilbrysq, included injection site reactions, upper respiratory tract infections, and diarrhea.

- **Pancreatic events**: In addition to the increases in amylase and lipase observed in Study 1, there were reports of pancreatic events, including pancreatitis.

An 82-year-old woman presented with a history of vomiting, an abdominal mass, and a significantly raised amylase, but no clinical evidence of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasound and CT scans showed an ovarian tumour and no evidence of pancreatitis, as is often associated with a raised amylase. The patient underwent bilateral ovariectomy and hysterectomy and made a good recovery.

### Rare presentation of acute pancreatitis in mild COVID-19 [^112oiavX]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Viral-induced pancreatitis has been well-defined; however, there are limited data regarding COVID-19 and pancreatitis. Most cases are commonly in conjunction with severe COVID-19 as well as lipase elevation. We describe a unique case of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in acute pancreatitis in the absence of lipase elevation.

A 39-year-old patient with no medical history presented with epigastric pain. Vital signs were unremarkable. The patient was positive for COVID-19. Liver function panel, calcium, triglyceride, and lipase levels were all unremarkable. A CT of the abdomen demonstrated acute pancreatitis without gallstones.

Our case may indicate that pancreatic injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection is due to a direct impact on the pancreas by the virus, given the absence of lipase elevation and mild presentation. This case highlights the importance of suspecting pancreatitis in mild COVID-19 that presents with atypical symptoms, such as epigastric pain, even without lipase elevation.

### Saxenda [^113xtr3n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Acute pancreatitis**: Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide. After initiating Saxenda, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting. If pancreatitis is suspected, Saxenda should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, Saxenda should not be restarted.

In Saxenda clinical trials in adults, acute pancreatitis was confirmed by adjudication in 9 (0.3%) of 3291 Saxenda-treated patients and 2 (0.1%) of 1843 placebo-treated patients. Additionally, there were 2 cases of acute pancreatitis in Saxenda-treated patients who prematurely withdrew from these clinical trials, occurring 74 and 124 days after the last dose. There were 2 additional cases in Saxenda-treated patients: 1 during an off-treatment follow-up period within 2 weeks of discontinuing Saxenda, and 1 that occurred in a patient who completed treatment and was off-treatment for 106 days.

In a Saxenda pediatric clinical trial, pancreatitis was not independently adjudicated. Pancreatitis was reported in 1 (0.8%) Saxenda-treated patient and resulted in treatment discontinuation.

Liraglutide has been studied in a limited number of adult patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for developing pancreatitis while being treated with liraglutide.

Regarding medical management for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, more specifically concerning the management of pancreatitis, ESGE 2020 guidelines recommend considering testing serum amylase and/or lipase 2–6 hours after ERCP in patients with postprocedural abdominal pain who are planned to be discharged on the day of ERCP. Patients with serum amylase and lipase values less than 1.5 and 4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), respectively, can be considered for discharge without concerns about the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis.

### Coeliac disease masquerading as macroamylasaemia [^112aCvYB]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A woman in her late 20s was admitted with a history of non-specific abdominal pain and persistent hyperamylasaemia. Her amylase level was 620 U (normal range: 35–120 U). She was referred to the gastroenterology service due to suspected acute pancreatitis. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she was not taking any medications. On admission, she reported intermittent heartburn and dyspepsia. She had postprandial, non-specific epigastric pain, which was not typical of pancreatitis and was not associated with any specific food. She had no vomiting, dysphagia, bloating, diarrhoea, or constipation. Additionally, she had no significant weight loss during the period of her ongoing symptoms. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Apart from hyperamylasaemia, all other laboratory results were normal, including serum lipase, triglyceride levels, C-reactive protein, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and thyroid function tests. Serum immunoglobulins were also within normal limits. The patient showed no symptoms or signs of cholelithiasis, hepatitis, biliary cholangitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen, including the liver and gallbladder, was normal. An abdominal CT with contrast yielded no pathological findings. Serology for coeliac disease was strongly positive, prompting an upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, which revealed normal examination till the second part of the duodenum. Histological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of coeliac disease, with findings consistent with the condition.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^113p99NM]. Canadian Journal of Surgery. Journal canadien de chirurgie (2016). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

- **Diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis include three primary components**: Abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back.

- **The second component involves significant enzyme elevation**: A significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal.

- **The third component is the identification of characteristic imaging findings**: These findings are indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy while allowing for appropriate treatment to be administered promptly.

### AGA clinical practice update on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: Expert review [^112MQHfb]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The AGA 2023 guidelines address medical management for chronic pancreatitis, particularly focusing on pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. They recommend initiating treatment with a minimum of 40,000 USP units of lipase to be taken with each meal for adult patients, and half of that dose for snacks. It is advised to adjust the subsequent dosage based on the meal size and fat content.

### Double trouble: Ten-year-old girl with chronic diarrhea and acute abdominal pain [^113Xdkk7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

It is important to distinguish that there are two related but distinct pathological conditions in our patient described above. Failure to realize this could yield an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis and a poor patient outcome. Therefore, it was important to generate two separate differential diagnoses in this case, one for acute abdominal pain and one for chronic secretory diarrhea.

- **Abdominal pain diagnosis**: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered less likely due to the patient's stable weight, normal ESR (of 3), normal albumin, normal hemoglobin, and absence of inflammatory cells in the stool. Transglutaminase IgA and IgG were both negative, reducing the likelihood of celiac disease. Appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and cholecystitis were ruled out with MRI on admission. Ovarian torsion was deemed unlikely as her ovaries appeared normal on the MRI. Urinalysis on admission was negative for hemoglobin, and microscopy showed only 5 to 10 RBCs, indicating nephrolithiasis was possible but less likely than other conditions. Although the urine culture grew 10,000 colonies of E. coli, the patient denied symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, or flank pain, making urinary tract infection (UTI) or pyelonephritis unlikely. An abdominal X-ray was negative for small bowel obstruction. Peptic ulcer disease was considered less likely due to the location and episodic nature of her abdominal pain, which was unrelated to meal timing. Malignancy was also deemed less likely because of the acute nature of the pain and lack of weight changes, fevers, or mass/lymphadenopathy on MRI. Lipase and MRI were negative for acute lesions.

### Association between time in range 70–180 mg/dl in early stage and severity within patients acute pancreatitis [^116zVvfE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) was diagnosed if two of the following three criteria were met clinically: (1) acute, sudden, continuous, and severe upper abdominal pain, which can radiate to the back; (2) serum amylase and/or lipase activities were at least three times higher than the upper limit of normal; (3) enhanced CT/MRI showed typical imaging changes of AP, such as pancreatic edema or peripancreatic effusion.

Individuals were divided into two groups according to the severity of pancreatitis at discharge diagnosis: (1) mild group: patients who met the diagnostic criteria for AP without organ failure and local or systemic complications during hospitalization; (2) severe group, including moderately severe acute pancreatitis (MSAP) and severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), accompanied by transient organ failure, which can be recovered within 48 hours, or accompanied by single or multiple organ failure continuously for more than 48 hours.

### Prevalence of imaging findings of acute pancreatitis in emergency department patients with elevated serum lipase [^112oLjL4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the association of imaging features of acute pancreatitis (AP) with the magnitude of lipase elevation in Emergency Department (ED) patients.

- **Methods**: This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study included 509 consecutive patients presenting from 9/1/13–8/31/15 to a large academic ED with serum lipase levels ≥ 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) (≥ 180 U/L). Patients were excluded if they did not have imaging (n = 131) or had a history of trauma, abdominal metastases, altered mental status, or transfer from an outside hospital (n = 190). The final study population was 188 patients. Imaging exams were retrospectively evaluated, and a consensus opinion of two subspecialty-trained abdominal radiologists was used to diagnose AP. The primary outcome was the presence of imaging features of AP stratified by lipase level (≥ 3×-10× ULN and > 10× ULN). The secondary outcome was the rate of discordant consensus evaluation compared to the original radiologist's report.

- **Results**: 25.0% of patients (47/188) had imaging features of AP. When lipase was > 10× ULN (n = 94), patients were more likely to have imaging features of AP (34%) compared to those with mild elevation (16%) (p = 0.0042). There was a moderately strong correlation between lipase level and presence of imaging features of AP (r = 0.48, p < 0.0001). Consensus review of CT and MRI images was discordant with the original report in 14.9% (28/188) of cases.

In conclusion, the prevalence of imaging signs of AP in an ED population with lipase ≥ 3× ULN undergoing imaging is low; however, the probability of imaging features of AP increases with higher lipase levels.

### An 18-year-old with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain [^112rYNYr]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation.

Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Management of acute pancreatitis [^116vydwn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) in this patient is straightforward. He presents with characteristic abdominal pain and a markedly elevated lipase level. A computed tomography (CT) scan is not needed in this patient, as it will neither assist in diagnosis nor predict severity, especially since most patients (80%) improve. CT should be reserved for patients with atypical symptoms and/or mild elevations of amylase/lipase, which could be nonspecific.

The etiology of AP in this patient is unclear. Identifying the etiology is crucial for potentially preventing recurrent pancreatitis. Biliary and alcohol factors are the most common causes of AP. Although ultrasound (US) is indicated as an initial evaluation of AP, a negative examination does not rule out a biliary etiology. A gallbladder stone may have passed to the common bile duct and be missed by the US, whether it has or has not passed to the duodenum. Even if the initial US is negative, given the prevalence of biliary pancreatitis, the examination should be repeated on an outpatient basis if no other etiology is found. While alcohol is a common cause of AP, it typically requires a relatively large amount of alcohol (50 g) consumption over multiple years to cause pancreatic disease. Could a medication, such as semaglutide, have caused the AP? It is unlikely, as there is little evidence that most medications cause AP. Although the triglyceride level is lower than 1,000 mg/dL, an outpatient repeat evaluation will be needed. Given the patient's age, there is a small but real risk of a tumor.

### Assessment of appropriate use of amylase and lipase testing in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis at an academic teaching hospital [^114sBgs7]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Despite evidence-based guidelines stating that lipase alone should be used in the diagnosis of suspected acute pancreatitis, health care providers continue to order amylase or both amylase and lipase together. The purpose of this study was to assess the utilization of appropriate laboratory testing related to the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

The study employed a retrospective cross-sectional design, spanning from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Data was collected through a retrospective chart review, which included patient-provider encounter notes, patient demographics, provider demographics, differential and final diagnoses, and laboratory test results. Data analysis involved the stratification of categorical variables and the calculation of cost savings.

For the 12-month period, this study found that 2567 (9.3%) of all amylase and lipase tests were unnecessary. Amylase tests (1881; 73.2%) constituted the majority of unnecessary tests, followed by lipase tests (686; 26.7%). An analysis of test-ordering behavior by providers revealed that 81.5% of all unnecessary tests were ordered by MDs. The study estimated a potential total cost savings of $128,350 if all unnecessary tests were eliminated.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that amylase and lipase tests have been overutilized in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

### Idiopathic acute pancreatitis [^111omrJ8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

After routine investigations, which include a thorough patient history, routine laboratory studies, and noninvasive imaging with transcutaneous ultrasonography, 10% to 25% of cases of acute pancreatitis have no readily identifiable cause and are termed idiopathic. However, modern medicine has made notable advances in uncovering various causes of acute pancreatitis. Several new diagnostic tools allow clinicians to approach the patient less invasively without sacrificing diagnostic yield. By being knowledgeable of these new advances and using them properly, clinicians can identify the cause more accurately and earlier. This improved management will not only enhance patient well-being but also minimize the number of cases classified as "true" idiopathic acute pancreatitis.

### Acute deterioration of a woman following acute pancreatitis with pseudocysts [^111UY7Qu]. Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

A 49-year-old white female with a history of acute pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts presented with severe, acute-onset abdominal pain lasting a few hours, accompanied by vomiting. Physical examination showed a soft abdomen with mild diffuse tenderness and positive bowel sounds. Initial blood work revealed a drop in her hematocrit and elevated but stable amylase and lipase levels. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm with extravasation of contrast medium into an adjacent pseudocyst.

- **Investigations**: Physical examination, blood analysis, and a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast medium.

- **Diagnosis**: Splenic artery pseudoaneurysm bleeding into an adjacent pseudocyst.

- **Management**: Embolization of the splenic artery across the neck of the pseudoaneurysm.

### A multidisciplinary approach to an unusual cause of hyperamylasaemia [^114Npcca]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical features, together with the elevation of pancreatic enzymes, are key diagnostic indicators of acute pancreatitis. We report a case of a woman in her 50s who presented with abdominal distension and serum amylase raised to more than 30 times the upper limit of normal. She was initially treated for acute pancreatitis; however, she was not symptomatic of this, and the pancreas appeared normal on a CT scan.

Further investigations revealed the patient had a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma with nodal metastatic spread. An amylase-secreting ovarian tumour was suspected, supported by elevated salivary-amylase isoenzymes, consistent with previous reports in the literature. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and surgery, during which her serum amylase and CA-125 initially fell significantly but eventually both increased, reflecting disease progression. This case serves as an important reminder to consider non-pancreatic causes of raised serum amylase to avoid misdiagnosis.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British Society of Gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^114LQU8z]. Gut (2018). High credibility.

- **Fat malabsorption**: Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency can lead to malabsorption (or more correctly, maldigestion) and diarrhoea due to impairment of pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate secretion. In adults, this is usually the result of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, or pancreatic surgery. Maldigestion of fat can result in steatorrhoea and weight loss but may not be clinically apparent. Steatorrhoea can be caused by small bowel malabsorption, and clinical assessment of steatorrhoea (e.g. by stool inspection) is unreliable. Symptoms of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency usually develop 10–15 years after the first symptoms of chronic pancreatitis, and when secretion of lipase and other pancreatic enzymes is reduced to less than 10% of normal values.

The diagnosis of advanced chronic pancreatitis in patients presenting with diarrhoea is often suggested by the clinical history and confirmed with imaging. A number of recent guidelines outline the strategies for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. There are international variations in practice depending on the availability of various modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and direct pancreatic function tests. However, there is broad agreement that invasive direct pancreatic function testing has become largely redundant in routine clinical practice, replaced by indirect pancreatic function testing and imaging. It is also recognized that there is currently no ideal test to diagnose chronic pancreatitis in early/mild disease.

### Acute pancreatitis patient registry to examine novel therapies in clinical experience (APPRENTICE): An international, multicenter consortium for the study of acute pancreatitis [^1162Hrrt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The development of APPRENTICE and participating centers emerged from discussions that took place during the AP working group at PancreasFest 2014 (July 2014, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). This was under the sponsorship of the Collaborative Alliance for Pancreatic Education and Research (CAPER). Since then, APPRENTICE members have maintained collaborative communications via e-mail, teleconferences (webinars), and face-to-face meetings at annual conferences of gastrointestinal societies. Expertise from APPRENTICE members, as well as founders of other pancreatitis multicenter research consortia such as NAPS2 and INSPPIRE, was sought.

The University of Pittsburgh has led this initiative and serves as the coordinating center. An analysis and publication committee of five members from four different continents has been established. This committee is responsible for collecting research ideas, setting deadlines, and deciding on the authorship of future publications. Additionally, a strategy has been devised to apply for grant funding in the near future.

To participate in APPRENTICE, the initial requirements for a center include a letter from their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee and a signed data-use agreement form, which is to be submitted to the University of Pittsburgh, acting as the "umbrella" IRB. At the time of writing, 20 tertiary referral centers with established expertise in pancreatic disorders from nine countries have joined the consortium.

### Abdominal cyst of unclear aetiology: Gastrointestinal stromal tumour or reactivation of abdominal tuberculosis [^115c89Jr]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis for an abdominal mass is broad and includes infection, malignancy, and other inflammatory processes. Given the elevated C-reactive protein level, an inflammatory process was high on the differential diagnosis. The mass on the initial CT scan was concerning for a pyogenic abscess, thus an infectious process was considered to be most likely.

Since the patient had a history of abdominal TB, reactivation of TB was of strong concern, prompting AFB smear and cultures to be obtained. The patient's risk factors for abdominal TB, combined with 4+ AFB on acid-fast smear, were strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of TB infection. Remarkably, the patient's symptoms did not improve with antituberculous therapy, and AFB cultures did not reveal Mycobacterium tuberculosis, prompting a biopsy of the mass.

Histopathology of the core needle biopsy strongly corroborated a diagnosis of GIST. However, a diagnosis of coinfection with M. tuberculosis was still under consideration due to the presence of AFB on smear. Repeat cultures revealed M. chelonae, explaining the presence of AFB on smear, and a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis was eliminated from the differential.

### A systematic review of the predictive factors for the recurrence of acute pancreatitis [^111MXoBq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is defined as an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas, with variable involvement of other regional tissues or remote organ systems. It is considered the most common pancreatic disease, with an incidence of 34 cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide, accounting for approximately 2.8 million new cases annually. Higher occurrences are reported in nations such as Japan, the United States, and Taiwan. Recent studies indicate an incidence of 40 cases per 100,000 in Europe, with an overall increasing trend.

AP can reach a mortality rate of 2% in Western countries and up to 7.5% in Asia.

According to the Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC), a diagnosis of AP can be made by recognizing at least two out of three characteristics: abdominal pain compatible with AP; serum lipase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal; and characteristic findings of AP on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or transabdominal ultrasonography (US).

The etiology of AP is most commonly alcoholic (AAP) or biliary (BAP), with variations based on geographical region or age group of the affected population.

The RAC classifies AP into three categories by disease severity:

- **Mild AP**: Defined by the lack of organ failure and typically has a short, self-resolving course.
- **Moderately severe AP**: Characterized by transient organ failure (lasting less than 48 hours) and/or local complications.
- **Severe AP**: Defined by persistent organ failure (lasting more than 48 hours), often with w.

### Recurrence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis after cholecystectomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114rPi9T]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The definition of idiopathic acute pancreatitis (IAP) varied widely among the included studies. None of the studies reported the use of standard diagnostic work-up as described in the International Association of Pancreatology/American Pancreatic Association guideline to determine the most likely etiology. Most notably, definitions of alcoholic and biliary etiology varied broadly between studies (see Table S2 in supporting information). Two studies excluded patients based on raised levels of liver enzymes. Although all studies considered cholelithiasis on imaging to be an exclusion criterion for IAP, four studies did not require ultrasonography in all patients or did not mention which imaging modality was used. One study included patients with raised ALT levels, and another study included patients with raised levels of liver enzymes, but only if MRCP was negative for CBD stones. Only five studies considered CBD dilatation or the presence of biliary sludge on imaging to be indicative of biliary etiology. One study reported explicitly on the presence of biliary sludge on transabdominal ultrasound imaging but chose to consider this as indicative of IAP. Repeat transabdominal ultrasonography was commonly employed; five studies used it in all included patients, and two studies used it in part of the cohort.

Eighteen of the 524 patients (3.4 percent) with 'original' IAP appeared to have a demonstrable etiology after the review of the results of the standard work-up; the disease was classified as 'presumed' IAP in the remaining 506 patients. Additional diagnostic…

### Causal evaluation of acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis in children: Consensus from the INSPPIRE group [^114SneZC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria for pediatric chronic pancreatitis (2018) is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the pediatric population. INSPPIRE stands for International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure. This scoring system is used to diagnose chronic pancreatitis in children, a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal or improve, worsens over time, and leads to permanent damage.

The clinical utility of the INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria is to provide a standardized method for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis in children, which can be challenging due to the variability in symptoms and the lack of specific diagnostic tests. The criteria take into account various factors, including abdominal pain, imaging findings, pancreatic function tests, and histology.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria. However, it is important to note that this scoring system is specifically designed for the pediatric population and may not be applicable or accurate in adults. Additionally, it should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and not as a standalone diagnostic tool.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria for pediatric chronic pancreatitis is a tool that assesses four key indicators to determine the likelihood of chronic pancreatitis in children. Each indicator is evaluated, and a score is generated based on its presence.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^113pQs91]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Cystic pancreatic lesions (CPLs) are frequently incidental findings in radiological examinations conducted for other reasons in patients with unrelated symptoms. Since they require different management based on their histological nature, differential diagnosis is essential. Radiologists play a key role in the diagnosis and management of these lesions, as imaging can accurately characterize most of them, thereby guiding appropriate management.

The first step in accurate characterization is to determine whether there is communication between the CPLs and the main pancreatic duct. It is crucial to evaluate the morphology of the lesions. Age, sex, and a history of previous pancreatic pathologies are important factors in the differential diagnosis. As some CPLs with different pathological backgrounds can exhibit similar morphological findings, differential diagnosis can be challenging. Consequently, the final diagnosis may necessitate other techniques, such as endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, and endoscopic ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. Multidisciplinary management is crucial for the appropriate management of these lesions.

In the ALTA study, amylase elevation was observed in 27% of patients in the 90 mg group and 39% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Lipase elevations were seen in 21% of patients in the 90 mg group and 45% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 amylase elevation was reported in 3.7% of patients in the 90 mg group and 2.7% of patients in the 90→180 mg group. Grade 3 or 4 lipase elevation occurred in 4.6% of patients in the 90 mg group and 5.5% of patients in the 90→180 mg group.

It is recommended to monitor lipase and amylase levels during treatment with Alunbrig. Should Grade 3 or 4 pancreatic enzyme elevation occur, Alunbrig should be withheld. Upon resolution or recovery to Grade 1 or baseline levels, Alunbrig may be resumed at the same or a reduced dose as specified in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Acute pancreatitis secondary to pancreatic carcinoma [^114G8CYt]. Pancreas (2000). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) has been recognized as a presentation in patients with pancreatic carcinoma (PC). However, the natural history of patients with PC who present with AP as the first manifestation is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the time between the presentation of AP and the diagnosis of PC and what factors should alert the clinician to suspect underlying PC in patients with AP.

Nineteen physicians completed the survey forms that encompassed 45 patients with a diagnosis of AP preceding the diagnosis of PC. Information included the patient's age, gender, race, conditions that could account for the AP, criteria for the diagnosis of AP, severity of AP, criteria for the diagnosis of PC, time between the diagnoses of AP and PC, pathology of the carcinoma, extension of the disease, treatment of PC, and survival after the diagnosis of PC.

The study population consisted of 45 patients: 27 (60%) men and 18 (40%) women, with an average age of 58 years (range, 32–89). Thirty-eight patients were Caucasian, five were Black, one was Japanese, and one was Arabian. The number of AP episodes before PC diagnosis ranged between one and 15 (mean ± 2 SD). AP was mild in 40 (89%) patients and severe in five (11%). The time between the onset of AP and the diagnosis of PC averaged 34 weeks (range, 1–52).

Symptoms on the presentation of AP included abdominal pain in all 45 (100%) patients, weight loss in 15 (33%), and jaundice in 3 (7%). CA 19–9 levels were available in 13 patients, eight of whom had levels > 100 at the time AP was diagnosed. Abnormal imaging suggestive of PC was detected by ultrasonography in 17 patients.

Exclusion criteria were letters, comments, case reports, reviews, conference abstracts, book chapters, studies not written in English, and studies published before 1980 due to discrepancies in diagnostic evaluations before 1980 compared with state-of-the-art work-ups.

Both reviewers read the full text of potentially eligible studies individually. The reference lists of included articles were screened for relevant publications not identified in the initial search. Disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved through joint re-evaluation by the two reviewers.

After selecting studies that met the inclusion criteria, all relevant data from these studies were extracted by two reviewers using a standard form. Relevant data included study characteristics (authors, years of inclusion, publication year, country, study design, number of patients, duration of follow-up); patient characteristics (sex, age, recurrence or first episode of pancreatitis, number of previous attacks, severity of pancreatitis, previous cholecystectomy); diagnostic evaluation (history, laboratory tests, imaging); interventions (cholecystectomy); and outcome measures.

### Definitions of pediatric pancreatitis and survey of present clinical practices [^114CFYBK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). High credibility.

The INSPPIRE (International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure) diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in pediatric patients. This scoring system is used to identify children who are likely to have acute pancreatitis based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The INSPPIRE criteria include abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized method for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in children, which can help guide treatment decisions and predict prognosis. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that it is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to be used in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate the likelihood of pediatric acute pancreatitis by assessing three specific clinical factors. These factors are:

- **Whether abdominal pain suggestive of or compatible with acute pancreatitis is present**: Characterized by acute onset, especially in the epigastric region.
- **Whether there is serum amylase and/or lipase activity at least more than three times the upper limit of normal**.

### Zilbrysq [^113cCiFF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Zilbrysq has been associated with pancreatitis and other pancreatic conditions. During open-label extension studies, seven patients (3.3%) experienced pancreatic events, with four patients (1.9%) developing pancreatitis and three patients (1.4%) developing pancreatic cysts.

In the 3-month, double-blind Study 1, adverse reactions involving increased lipase levels occurred in six patients (6.9%) treated with Zilbrysq, whereas none were observed in patients on placebo. Additionally, adverse reactions involving increased amylase levels were reported in four patients (4.7%) treated with Zilbrysq compared to one patient (1.1%) on placebo. Lipase levels exceeded three times the upper limit of normal in six patients (7%) after starting Zilbrysq, with no such occurrences in patients on placebo.

Patients should be informed of these risks prior to commencing treatment with Zilbrysq. It is essential to obtain baseline lipase and amylase levels before initiating Zilbrysq. The treatment should be discontinued in patients with suspected pancreatitis, and appropriate management should be initiated until pancreatitis is either ruled out or has resolved.

### Acute abdominal pain in a 15-year-old male patient [^1137px3N]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The patient presented with two of the three criteria from the revised Atlanta classification, including acute onset epigastric pain and elevated lipase, which led to a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) without a clear etiology. Given that the patient was previously well, the negative workup for common causes of AP, and the progressive history of cannabis use coinciding with the onset of symptoms, the likely cause for the patient's symptoms was ingestion of cannabis. He was diagnosed with cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) with a secondary upper gastrointestinal bleed resulting from a Mallory-Weiss tear.

### Recurrence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis after cholecystectomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ziUfj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Of 524 patients with 'original' idiopathic acute pancreatitis (IAP), 126 (24.0 percent) underwent cholecystectomy during follow-up. To create a subgroup of patients with 'true' IAP, several groups were excluded: those in whom an aetiology was established during either standard (18) or additional (165) work-up; those for whom it was not sufficiently reported whether biliary disease was present (195); and patients in whom the disease course during follow-up was unclear (2). In the subgroup of 144 patients with 'true' IAP, 36 cholecystectomies (25.0 percent) were performed.

One study also reported pathology results for the gallbladder, with microlithiasis observed on pathological examination in 23 of 39 gallbladders.

- **Complications of cholecystectomy**: One study reported one bile duct injury in 66 cholecystectomies, while two studies reported no complications in 13 and 39 cholecystectomies respectively. In total, there was one complication in 118 cholecystectomies (0.8 percent, 95 percent confidence interval: 0 to 2.5 percent). Cholecystectomy complication rates were not reported in the remaining studies.

### Pancreatic ascites: Update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ascites is a diagnostic challenge due to its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. A comprehensive diagnostic approach that includes a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis is crucial. Physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, a positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds, and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and, in severe cases, respiratory distress.

- **Laboratory tests**: Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactate, uric acid, and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites cases and is likely to be dilutional due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites.

On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood cell count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio, are usually normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates may also assist in the diagnostic process.

### Elevated liver enzymes: Emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more prevalent with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine-focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

- **Discussion**: The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

- **Conclusions**: By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management.

### Lopid [^111RmvoZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Lopid (gemfibrozil tablets, USP) is indicated as an adjunctive therapy to diet for the treatment of adult patients with very high elevations of serum triglyceride levels (Types IV and V hyperlipidemia) who present a risk of pancreatitis and do not respond adequately to dietary efforts to control them. Patients at such risk typically have serum triglycerides over 2000 mg/dL and exhibit elevations of VLDL-cholesterol as well as fasting chylomicrons (Type V hyperlipidemia). Subjects with total serum or plasma triglycerides consistently below 1000 mg/dL are unlikely to be at risk of pancreatitis. Lopid therapy may be considered for subjects with triglyceride levels between 1000 and 2000 mg/dL who have a history of pancreatitis or abdominal pain typical of pancreatitis.

It is recognized that some Type IV patients with triglycerides under 1000 mg/dL may, due to dietary or alcoholic indiscretion, convert to a Type V pattern with massive triglyceride elevations accompanying fasting chylomicronemia, but the influence of Lopid therapy on the risk of pancreatitis in such situations has not been adequately studied. Drug therapy is not indicated for patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but normal levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Inspection of plasma refrigerated for 14 hours is helpful in distinguishing Types I, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia. Reducing the risk of developing coronary heart disease is only applicable to Type IIb patients.

### Consider hereditary angioedema in the differential diagnosis for unexplained recurring abdominal pain [^1173vdMQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Episodic abdominal pain, small bowel obstruction without a surgical history and no clear etiology, or nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea with complete resolution between episodes warrant consideration of hereditary angioedema (HAE) as part of the differential diagnosis. Pertinent history may include episodes of cutaneous angioedema without pruritus and urticaria. Factors to consider in recognizing HAE in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms include:

- **Episodic nature**: Abdominal pain may vary in severity but typically occurs as severe intermittent episodes lasting 2 to 5 days if untreated, with normal asymptomatic periods between attacks.

- **Description of pain**: Abdominal pain in HAE is often described as cramping, colicky, tiring, or exhausting.

- **Associated symptoms**: During an attack, patients may experience abdominal distension, tenderness, and possibly ascites. Ascites was detected in 92% of HAE patients who underwent abdominal ultrasound during an attack.

- **Triggers and demographic factors**: Although most HAE attacks have no identifiable trigger, in females, these attacks may be brought on by normal hormonal fluctuations or the use of medications such as estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.

In our clinical experience, fever, peritoneal signs, or elevated white blood cell counts are not common during HAE attacks. These signs and symptoms would be more common with an acute abdominal pathology or familial Mediterranean fever. Elevated neutrophil counts (without increased bands), hypovolemia from fluid losses, and hemoconcentration have been reported in severe attacks.

### Duodeno-pancreatic and extrahepatic biliary tree trauma: WSES-AAST guidelines [^114Zpvfv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

For specific circumstances involving blunt abdominal trauma, particularly in patients with pancreatoduodenal injury, the AAST/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining repeated and combined measurements of serum amylase and lipase levels. These measurements should begin 3–6 hours after the initial injury to support the clinical evaluation in patients with suspected pancreatic injury.

### Elevated lipase without pancreatitis in infectious colitis [^114eFvfL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated lipase typically confirms the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Elevated lipase may be associated with other disorders, typically with some influence on the pancreas. The differential is more limited than elevated amylase due to the mostly unique production of lipase in pancreatic acinar cells. Elevated lipase has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease but not previously reported in infectious colitis.

- **Case report**: A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to her left flank, worsening over 2 days. She denied epigastric pain. She had occasional nausea and occasional nonbilious and nonbloody emesis, and also reported diarrhea and weight loss over the preceding months. Laboratory values were largely unremarkable except for a grossly elevated lipase level. A computed tomography scan of her abdomen was performed and revealed findings consistent with infectious colitis, without signs of pancreatic inflammation or other findings associated with pancreatitis. She was admitted to the hospital and treated for infectious colitis with antibiotics, and improved over 2 days. She was subsequently discharged for follow-up with her gastroenterologist.

This is the first reported case of elevated lipase without pancreatitis associated with infectious colitis. Emergency physicians should be aware of other potential causes of elevated lipase and not assume that all cases of elevated lipase are associated with pancreatitis.

### Alvesco [^117MLgor]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety data described below for adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older reflect exposure to Alvesco in doses ranging from 80 mcg to 640 mcg twice daily in five double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Studies with once daily dosing are omitted from the safety database because the doses studied are lower than the highest recommended twice-daily doses. The five studies spanned 12 to 16 weeks of treatment duration, one of which included a safety extension follow-up of one year. In these 12 to 16 week treatment studies, 720 patients (298 males and 422 females) aged 12 years and older were exposed to Alvesco. In the long-term safety trial, 197 patients (82 males and 115 females) with severe persistent asthma from one of the 12-week trials were re-randomized and treated for up to one year with Alvesco 320 mcg twice daily.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older**: Four of the five trials included a total of 624 patients aged 12 years and older (359 females and 265 males) with asthma of varying severity who were treated with Alvesco at doses of 80 mcg, 160 mcg, or 320 mcg twice daily for 12 to 16 weeks. These studies included patients previously using either controller therapy (predominantly inhaled corticosteroids) or reliever therapy (bronchodilator).

### Recurrence of idiopathic acute pancreatitis after cholecystectomy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117CfACL]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

This review was written in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42017055275).

Data were analyzed based on the definitions of idiopathic acute pancreatitis (IAP) as outlined in the original articles and according to guidelines that define IAP as acute pancreatitis where no etiology can be determined by standard diagnostic evaluation. This evaluation consists of a detailed history, laboratory serum tests (liver enzymes, calcium, and triglycerides), and imaging (transabdominal ultrasonography on admission and repeated after discharge).

Three types of IAP were defined for the purposes of this study. First, 'original' IAP was defined according to definitions used in the original articles. Second, 'presumed' IAP was defined by diagnosis after the standard evaluation. Third, 'true' IAP was defined as an acute pancreatitis episode that remained unexplained after both standard diagnostic work-up and additional diagnostic tests such as EUS and MRCP.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome was the recurrence rate of acute pancreatitis, calculated as the proportion of patients experiencing one or more episodes after an index episode of 'original', 'presumed', or 'true' IAP. Secondary outcomes included complications from cholecystectomy, severity of recurrences as defined by the revised Atlanta classification, and occurrence of biliary events before cholecystectomy.

- **Search strategy**: Guided by an experienced librarian, the PubMed and Embase databases were searched.

### Cross-sectional imaging of common and unusual complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^111rpH2N]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

In the vast majority of cases, clinical suspicion of early iatrogenic complications is based on a combination of intraprocedural findings such as difficult or repeated cannulation, as well as suspected or confirmed diagnostic pancreatogram (DP), symptoms, and physical signs (sudden or worsening abdominal pain, distension, fever, hemodynamic impairment). Laboratory data (decreasing hemoglobin, elevated leukocyte count, acute phase reactants, serum lipase or amylase) also play a role. CT imaging is crucial for investigating patients who become acutely ill hours or days after ERCP due to the limited value of physical examination. This limitation arises from the retroperitoneal location of most iatrogenic changes and the similar clinical and laboratory manifestations observed in most complications, particularly acute pancreatitis (AP) and diagnostic pancreatogram (DP).

Furthermore, the duration of ERCP may serve as a surrogate marker for challenging cannulation and/or operative maneuvers. These challenges can lead to papillary edema and compromise ductal outflow, thereby increasing the risk and severity of complications, particularly post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEAP). According to both the literature and personal experience, planned CT may be warranted in patients after prolonged ERCP procedures, especially when involving sphincterotomy or multiple cannulations.

A preliminary unenhanced CT acquisition without intravenous and peroral contrast medium (CM) is helpful to visualize extraluminal air, particularly using image review at the lung or bone window settings.

### Eosinophilic duodenitis misdiagnosed as acute pancreatitis in a child: a case report [^113Z4Jyg]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Serum amylase and lipase levels are rarely attributable to non-EoE EGIDs in children; hence, diagnostic errors are more likely to occur. Only a few cases of non-EoE EGIDs in adults accompanied by acute pancreatitis (AP), like this case, have been reported. Every case, including this pediatric one, exhibited a concomitant pancreatic reaction with elevated amylase and lipase values due to non-EoE EGIDs. All patients had no history of gallstones.

In our case, no apparent pancreatic and biliary duct obstructions were found on abdominal CT or MRCP. However, serum levels of pancreatic enzymes were increased when the symptoms were presenting, and alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin were within the normal range. This suggests that eosinophilic infiltration within the GI tract slightly injured the pancreatic duct. We suggested that inflammation in the pancreas is due to the obstruction of the pancreatic duct by an opening in the thickened and inflamed duodenal wall, rather than an extension of inflammation to the pancreas. Imaging findings showing a dilation in the pancreatic duct confirm this suggestion.

In addition, peripheral blood eosinophilia was initially ignored, leading to delayed diagnosis and therapy. Therefore, non-EoE EGIDs should be considered in the differential diagnosis when patients present with peripheral blood eosinophilia and abdominal discomfort. On this occasion, peripheral blood eosinophils and duodenal wall thickening on imaging studies could be used as indicators of non-EoE EGIDs. Parasitic infection was also considered in the differential diagnosis. Her two separate stool examinations revealed no evidence of ova or parasites.
