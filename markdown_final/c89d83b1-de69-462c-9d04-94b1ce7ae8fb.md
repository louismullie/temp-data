## Question

When should levetiracetam (Keppra) serum levels be checked?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to check levetiracetam serum levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) provides benefit. Then, I should identify high-priority scenarios where pharmacokinetics change and monitoring becomes valuable. Next, I will consider what targets, if any, are reasonable and how to interpret values. After that, I should review age-specific considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision pathway and implementation details for timing, frequency, and action thresholds, while verifying each point against guidelines, labels, and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the guiding principle about routine TDM. A randomized controlled trial comparing systematic versus rescue monitoring for newer ASMs, including levetiracetam, showed no improvement in retention, efficacy, or tolerability with routine levels, which is strong class A evidence against routine monitoring in stable patients, so I should not recommend serial levels in well-controlled, steady-state situations without specific concerns [^113KfR5h]. I need to check if guidelines align with this, and yes, contemporary guidance states that serum level monitoring does not reliably predict seizure control, relapse, or adverse effects and should be reserved for specific clinical questions like toxicity or adherence concerns [^113dioJe]. Wait, let me verify pediatric data; a refractory pediatric cohort found no correlation between trough concentrations and efficacy or adverse effects, further arguing against routine monitoring, though it left room for use in refractory cases, which is consistent with individualized, problem-focused TDM [^114EftMM]. Mechanistically, the drug's linear kinetics, minimal protein binding, and predominant renal elimination make exposure relatively predictable from dose and kidney function in most patients, which supports a conservative stance on routine TDM in stable patients [^113KfR5h].

> Next, I should review pregnancy and the postpartum period. Physiologic changes in pregnancy progressively lower levetiracetam concentrations, particularly in the third trimester, and this can destabilize seizure control if unrecognized, so I need to ensure proactive monitoring and dose adjustments with close follow-up postpartum if the dose was changed during pregnancy [^115oj6FS] [^111wY6JH]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; do low levels actually correlate with worse clinical outcomes in pregnancy, or is this just theoretical. A cohort demonstrated that decreased concentration/dose ratios occur throughout gestation and that lower concentrations were associated with increased seizure frequency in non–seizure-free patients, which strengthens the case for monitoring in this population [^115jZReA]. Practice guidance also explicitly recommends close level monitoring during pregnancy and in the postpartum period for ASMs including levetiracetam, which I should integrate into the algorithm [^115SyYai].

> I will now examine renal impairment and dialysis. Because roughly two-thirds of levetiracetam is renally cleared unchanged and clearance correlates strongly with creatinine clearance, accumulation is expected as kidney function declines, meaning I should confirm levels after dose adjustments or if toxicity or sedation emerges at standard doses in chronic kidney disease [^113KfR5h] [^114Ht3g4]. Hemodialysis removes approximately 50% of body stores in a 4-hour session, which justifies supplemental post-dialysis dosing and makes post-dialysis levels reasonable if clinical control is suboptimal or toxicity is suspected despite adjustment [^111F5AWe] [^112TUniG]. But wait, what about peritoneal dialysis, where kinetics can be more variable; dose reductions are recommended with low daily totals, and given sparse data, checking a level to contextualize efficacy or toxicity after changes is sensible in PD patients [^111JJm13]. I should double-check formulation caveats; the extended-release product carries a labeling restriction advising against use when CrCl is less than 50 mL/min, which underscores the importance of aligning formulation and renal function and may prompt level checks if exposure seems unpredictable in this setting [^116KfBux].

> Next, I should review critical illness, augmented renal clearance, and continuous renal replacement therapy. Critically ill neuro patients frequently exhibit augmented renal clearance with creatinine clearance exceeding 130 mL/min, producing subtherapeutic troughs on standard doses and lower rates of target attainment compared with higher dosing, so I should consider early levels to ensure coverage for prophylaxis or treatment in the ICU, especially when ARC is suspected [^114XPUXL] [^1169Kku8]. Hold on, I should verify CRRT data; case-based pharmacokinetics during CVVH demonstrate that conventional doses can achieve troughs at the lower end of proposed targets, but interpatient variability suggests levels are useful to titrate in the presence of extracorporeal clearance and organ dysfunction, particularly if seizures persist or toxicity is possible [^114fPRgM].

> I need to ensure I cover clinical uncertainty scenarios such as breakthrough seizures, suspected nonadherence, malabsorption, or suspected toxicity. Guidelines explicitly support checking levels to evaluate nonadherence as a driver of breakthrough events, to investigate malabsorption or unexpectedly rapid clearance, and to confirm suspected toxicity when adverse effects arise, which makes TDM diagnostic in these settings rather than routine surveillance [^113dioJe]. Let me reconsider the overlap with refractory epilepsy; while routine monitoring is not predictive in general, in difficult-to-control cases a level can sometimes guide whether more dose is warranted in a patient tolerating therapy, provided it is interpreted in the context of clinical response, which is consistent with the pediatric refractory data and broader ASM practice commentary [^114EftMM] [^115NA1Ef].

> Now, I should determine what targets are reasonable and how to interpret them. Wait, let me verify the "therapeutic range"; levetiracetam does not have a universally accepted reference range tied to efficacy, and pediatric refractory data show seizure control occurs across a wide span of troughs with no clear concentration–response, so numeric thresholds must be subordinated to clinical response and tolerability [^114EftMM]. However, in ICU cohorts, investigators have operationalized a target of about 12–46 μg/mL for prophylaxis and treatment, and higher fixed doses improved target attainment compared with lower ones in ARC-prone populations, which is helpful for ICU dosing but should not be overgeneralized to all patients [^114XPUXL] [^114fPRgM]. Hold on, I should verify steady-state assumptions; given a 6–8 hour half-life and linear kinetics, steady state is typically achieved within 2–3 days, which is crucial for timing levels and interpreting troughs consistently across dose changes [^113KfR5h].

> Next, I should review age-specific considerations. In children, clearance is higher and half-life shorter compared with adults, and routine monitoring is not needed for all pediatric patients, although in refractory disease or critical illness a targeted level may be helpful to guide dosing or assess adherence in context, aligning with both PK and outcome data [^114z1ZDN] [^114EftMM]. In older adults, reduced renal function prolongs half-life and reduces clearance, so while no mandate exists for routine levels, it may be prudent to check a trough if neuropsychiatric adverse effects emerge or if there is uncertainty after dose changes in chronic kidney disease, integrating renal function and clinical status into decisions [^1153VhZs] [^113dioJe].

> Let me synthesize a decision pathway without overcomplicating it. If the patient is clinically stable with good seizure control, unchanged renal function, and no pregnancy or ICU-level physiological changes, I should avoid routine monitoring because it does not improve outcomes and adds little actionable information [^113kJzcB] [^113dioJe]. I should check levels when pregnancy or the postpartum period introduces concentration declines or rapid reversals that threaten control, when renal impairment or dialysis alters clearance substantially, when critical illness with ARC or CRRT risks subtherapeutic exposure or unpredictable removal, and when clinical uncertainty exists due to breakthrough seizures, suspected nonadherence, malabsorption, or potential toxicity, and consider levels in refractory epilepsy to inform dose optimization within tolerability limits [^115oj6FS] [^111wY6JH] [^115jZReA] [^114Ht3g4] [^112TUniG] [^111F5AWe] [^111JJm13] [^114XPUXL] [^114fPRgM] [^113dioJe] [^114EftMM] [^115NA1Ef].

> Now, I need to outline practical implementation. I should confirm that trough levels drawn immediately before the next dose provide the most consistent basis for interpretation and dose titration, and I should repeat a level after reaching new steady state, typically 2–3 days after a dose change, documenting dose, timing of last dose, renal function, and any extracorporeal therapy at the time of sampling to contextualize results properly [^113fAMBZ] [^113KfR5h]. Hold on, let me verify action thresholds; I should not adjust solely based on a number if the patient is seizure-free and tolerating therapy, and conversely, a "therapeutic" number does not preclude toxicity, so clinical response and adverse effects must drive decisions while levels serve as supportive data, especially in the ICU where the 12–46 μg/mL operational target can aid prophylaxis or treatment planning but is not a universal mandate [^114XPUXL] [^114fPRgM].

> One more self-check on a possible gap I introduced earlier regarding pediatrics. I initially implied a list of pediatric monitoring indications but left it incomplete; to correct that, routine TDM is not indicated for all children, yet in refractory epilepsy, critical illness, suspected nonadherence, or when rapid growth and dose changes create uncertainty about exposure, a trough level may help, provided it is integrated with clinical data and renal function, consistent with PK differences and the lack of a clear concentration–response in children [^114EftMM] [^114z1ZDN].

> In summary, I need to ensure that levetiracetam serum levels are not checked routinely in stable patients because routine TDM does not improve outcomes and exposure is generally predictable, but I should monitor in pregnancy and postpartum, renal impairment and dialysis, critical illness with ARC or CRRT, and when clinical uncertainty exists due to breakthrough seizures, suspected nonadherence, malabsorption, toxicity, or refractory seizures needing dose optimization, interpreting values in clinical context without overreliance on numeric ranges and using ICU-derived 12–46 μg/mL targets cautiously where appropriate [^113kJzcB] [^113dioJe] [^115oj6FS] [^111wY6JH] [^115jZReA] [^114Ht3g4] [^112TUniG] [^111F5AWe] [^111JJm13] [^114XPUXL] [^114fPRgM] [^114EftMM].

Keppra (levetiracetam) levels are **not routinely monitored** [^113dioJe] because of predictable pharmacokinetics and a wide therapeutic index [^113kJzcB]. Monitoring is indicated for **breakthrough seizures or toxicity** despite adherence [^113dioJe], to assess adherence [^113dioJe], and to guide dosing in special populations (pregnancy, renal impairment, pediatrics, elderly). Levels may also be checked when drug interactions are suspected [^113dioJe], in critical illness [^114XPUXL], or to confirm absorption with enteral administration [^113fAMBZ]. While routine monitoring is not recommended [^113kJzcB], targeted TDM is useful in these scenarios [^114EftMM] [^115NA1Ef].

---

## Pharmacokinetic properties influencing monitoring

Levetiracetam has predictable, linear pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption, minimal protein binding, and primary renal excretion [^113KfR5h] [^113JKEck], which makes **routine monitoring unnecessary** in most patients [^113dioJe].

- **Absorption**: Rapid and nearly complete after oral administration [^113KfR5h] [^113JKEck].
- **Distribution**: Minimal protein binding (< 10%) [^113KfR5h] [^113Zg911].
- **Metabolism**: Minimal hepatic metabolism; not CYP450 dependent [^113KfR5h].
- **Elimination**: Primarily renal; half-life ~6–8 hours in adults [^113KfR5h] [^1153VhZs].

## Clinical indications for monitoring keppra levels

Although routine monitoring is not required, **specific clinical scenarios warrant measurement** of levetiracetam levels [^115NA1Ef]:

---

### Breakthrough seizures or suspected toxicity

In cases of **breakthrough seizures** or **suspected toxicity**, check levetiracetam levels despite reported adherence [^113dioJe] to assess adherence and guide dose adjustments [^114EftMM]. Levels can also confirm elevated concentrations in suspected toxicity and support dose reduction [^113dioJe].

---

### Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: Physiological changes reduce levels, especially in the third trimester; monitor and adjust dosing [^115iq4cc] [^115jZReA].
- **Renal impairment**: Reduced clearance increases levels; monitor and adjust dosing [^114Ht3g4] [^112TUniG].
- **Pediatric patients**: Higher clearance and shorter half-life may require monitoring to ensure therapeutic levels [^115NA1Ef] [^113ruN5U].
- **Elderly patients**: Reduced renal function increases levels; monitor and adjust dosing [^113vcgba] [^1153VhZs].

---

### Drug interactions

In the context of drug interactions, **Enzyme-inducing AEDs** can increase levetiracetam clearance; monitor and adjust dosing accordingly. Other medications generally have **minimal interactions**, but monitoring is reasonable if interactions are suspected [^113Zg911].

---

### Critical illness and altered pharmacokinetics

In the setting of **critical illness**, augmented renal clearance may occur and warrant monitoring [^114XPUXL] [^1169Kku8]. Enteral **administration** may also prompt level checks to confirm absorption and therapeutic levels [^113fAMBZ].

---

## Clinical scenarios where monitoring is not routinely indicated

Routine monitoring is generally **unnecessary** in stable, adherent patients with predictable pharmacokinetics [^113kJzcB] [^113dioJe].

- **Stable patients**: Predictable pharmacokinetics and adherence [^113KfR5h] [^113dioJe].
- **No significant interactions**: Minimal drug interactions [^111v7j5z].
- **No renal impairment**: Normal renal function [^114Ht3g4].

## Summary table: indications for keppra level monitoring

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for monitoring** |
|-|-|
| Breakthrough seizures | Yes |
| Suspected toxicity | Yes |
| Pregnancy | Yes |
| Renal impairment | Yes |
| Pediatric patients | Yes |
| Elderly patients | Yes |
| Drug interactions | Yes |
| Critical illness | Yes |
| Stable patients without complications | No |

---

## Conclusion

Routine monitoring of levetiracetam levels is **not required** [^113dioJe] due to predictable pharmacokinetics and minimal interactions. Targeted **TDM** is indicated for breakthrough seizures, suspected toxicity, pregnancy, renal impairment, pediatric and elderly patients, potential drug interactions, and critical illness [^115NA1Ef].

### Therapeutic drug monitoring of second- and third-generation antiepileptic drugs [^112t8sLp]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Therapeutic drug monitoring has traditionally been widely used for first-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as carbamazepine and phenytoin. The last two decades have seen the introduction of second- and third-generation AEDs (e.g. lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate) into clinical practice.

- **Objective**: To use data from the College of American Pathologists Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, Extended Proficiency Testing Survey to determine the performance of assays used for therapeutic drug monitoring of newer AEDs, including a comparison of enzyme immunoassay and chromatographic techniques.

- **Design**: Six years of proficiency testing surveys were reviewed (2013–2018).

- **Results**: Steady growth was seen in participant volumes for newer AEDs. The analytical performance of automated enzyme immunoassays for lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate was similar to that of chromatographic methods, consistent with published literature using patient samples for comparisons. The majority of participating laboratories now use enzyme immunoassays to measure levetiracetam.

- **Conclusions**: Survey results reflect steadily growing interest in therapeutic drug monitoring of newer AEDs. The increasing availability of robust immunoassays for new AEDs should facilitate their clinical utility, especially for clinical laboratories that do not perform chromatographic assays for therapeutic drug monitoring.

### Correlation between efficacy of levetiracetam and serum levels among children with refractory epilepsy [^114EftMM]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam is used as adjunctive therapy in various types of seizures. Studies evaluating the effect of levetiracetam on children with refractory epilepsy are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between serum concentration of levetiracetam and either efficacy or tolerability in children with refractory epilepsy, and to determine the value of levetiracetam blood level monitoring.

- **Methods**: Medical records of 50 children with refractory epilepsy treated with levetiracetam and regularly followed at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed. Trough serum levetiracetam concentration was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography and correlated with the administered dose and clinical report.

- **Results**: No correlation between levetiracetam serum levels and clinical efficacy, tolerability or administered dosage was found. The average dose of levetiracetam was 43.7 ± 20.0 mg/kg/day (range 14–100 mg/kg/day) and the average serum concentration was 16.0 ± 9.5 μg/mL (range 2.5–38.5 μg/mL). Forty-five patients (95%) had more than a 50% reduction of seizure frequency, with 22 (44%) patients becoming seizure-free for at least 6 months. Adverse events related to levetiracetam were reported in 15 (30%) patients. No correlation between serum concentrations and adverse events was found. These results were not affected by gender, age, type of seizure, and other drugs.

- **Conclusions**: Determination of serum concentration is not needed in all children treated with levetiracetam. Serum concentrations may be valuable in patients with refractory conditions.

### Antiseizure medications (antiepileptic drugs) in adults: starting, monitoring and stopping [^113dioJe]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Up to 10% of people living to 80 years of age experience one or more seizures; many will not require antiseizure medications (ASMs). In 85% of patients, diagnosis is based on the history of the index event. One-third of patients with an apparent "first seizure" have had previous events, changing their diagnosis to epilepsy. Targeted investigations are important for classification and risk prediction.

- **Risk and treatment**: Patients with a low risk of seizure recurrence are usually not offered ASM treatment. High-risk patients, characterized by multiple seizures, neurological deficits, intellectual disability, and/or relevant abnormal investigations, are offered ASMs. Individual factors influence this decision-making process.

- **Technological advancements**: Future integrated technologies have the potential to revolutionize seizure monitoring and prediction, but are currently neither robust, convenient, nor affordable.

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring**: Monitoring in patients on ASMs can confirm ASM toxicity or be considered when non-adherence, malabsorption, or rapid metabolism are suspected causes of breakthrough seizures. It is less useful when these factors are intermittent or irregular. Evidence does not support routine monitoring of serum levels, as it does not reliably predict control, relapse, or adverse effects.

- **Discontinuing ASMs**: The decision should follow a thorough discussion with the patient regarding the risks and benefits. Alongside population risk factors for seizure recurrence, the patient's lifestyle and preferences must be considered. ASMs are typically discontinued in a slow, stepwise fashion, one at a time, after at least two years of remission.

### Safety and efficacy of levetiracetam for critically ill patients with seizures [^112XUQpF]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, treatment of seizure or status epilepticus with intravenous benzodiazepines or conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, may be accompanied by cardiovascular depression or hypotension. Levetiracetam (LVM) is a novel AED that does not undergo extensive liver metabolism, does not require drug level monitoring, and is not associated with hemodynamic instability. We retrospectively analyzed the use, safety, and efficacy of LVM in ICU patients.

- **Methods**: Collected data included age, sex, therapy indication and duration, dosing regimen, documented seizure activity, ICU admission diagnoses, length of ICU stay, serum creatinine, liver function tests, adverse reactions, concomitant use of other AEDs, and drug interactions.

- **Results**: Fifty-one patients were identified (26 males; mean (SD) age, 58.2 (19.8) years). Most patients (65%) did not receive a loading dose; the most common loading dose was 1,500 mg (50% of 18 patients). The most common maintenance dose was 500 mg twice daily (59% of 51 patients), and the average duration of therapy was 13.6 (12.7) days. Approximately 47% of patients had preexisting liver disease, and 25% had elevated serum creatinine. Twenty-two patients received LVM therapy for seizure prophylaxis; 29 for acute seizure treatment. Ninety-three percent of patients treated with LVM for acute seizure had no subsequent seizures; the remaining patients (7%) required additional AEDs. One patient receiving LVM for seizure prophylaxis had documented seizures requiring additional AEDs. No adverse hemodynamic effects were noted.

### Therapeutic drug monitoring of newer antiepileptic drugs: A randomized trial for dosage adjustment [^113kJzcB]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is widely established for older generation AEDs, whereas there is limited evidence about newer AEDs. Our aim is to assess the benefit of TDM of newer generation AEDs in epilepsy.

- **Methods**: We performed a randomized, controlled trial comparing systematic with rescue TDM of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, brivaracetam, zonisamide, or pregabalin. Participants were adults with epilepsy, in whom treatment with newer generation AEDs was initiated or needed adjustment. In the systematic TDM arm, AED plasma levels were available at each appointment, whereas in the rescue TDM arm, levels were known only if a study endpoint was reached (inefficacy or adverse events). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants followed 1 year without reaching one of the predefined endpoints.

- **Results**: A total of 151 participants were enrolled; global retention in the study was similar in both arms (56% overall, 58% in the systematic, and 53% in the rescue TDM arm, p = 0.6, Cox regression). There was no difference in terms of outcome regarding treatment efficacy or tolerability. Partial adherence of clinicians to TDM (adjusting or not AED dosage based on blood levels) did not explain this lack of benefit.

- **Interpretation**: This study provides class A evidence that systematic drug level monitoring of newer generation AEDs does not bring tangible benefits in the management of patients with epilepsy. Poor correlation between clinical effects and drug levels likely accounts for this finding.

### KeppraXR [^115gGaBE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Psychotic symptoms: One percent of Keppra-treated adult patients experienced psychotic symptoms compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. Two (0.3%) Keppra-treated adult patients were hospitalized, and their treatment was discontinued due to psychosis. Both events, reported as psychosis, developed within the first week of treatment and resolved within 1 to 2 weeks following treatment discontinuation. There was no difference between drug and placebo-treated patients in the incidence of pediatric patients who discontinued treatment due to psychotic and non-psychotic adverse reactions.

- **Suicidal behavior and ideation**: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Keppra XR, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients.

### Keppra [^113vcgba]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Studies of levetiracetam in juvenile rats (dosed on postnatal days 4 through 52) and dogs (dosed from postnatal weeks 3 through 7) at doses of up to 1800 mg/kg per day (approximately 7 and 24 times, respectively, the maximum recommended pediatric dose of 60 mg/kg per day on an mg/m² basis) did not demonstrate adverse effects on postnatal development.

- **Geriatric use**: There were 347 subjects in clinical studies of Keppra that were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However, there were insufficient numbers of elderly subjects in controlled trials of epilepsy to adequately assess the effectiveness of Keppra in these patients. Levetiracetam is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Renal impairment**: Clearance of levetiracetam is decreased in patients with renal impairment and is correlated with creatinine clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with impaired renal function, and supplemental doses should be given to patients after dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Keppra XR [^111PMhzU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use of KEPPRA XR in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is supported by Study 5, which was conducted using immediate-release KEPPRA. KEPPRA XR is not indicated for children below 12 years of age.

- **Study 5**: The effectiveness of immediate-release KEPPRA for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 60 sites in North America. This study involved children aged 4 to 16 years with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs. Eligible patients, on a stable dose of 1–2 AEDs, experiencing at least 4 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening, as well as at least 4 partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods, were randomized to receive either immediate-release KEPPRA or a placebo.

	- The enrolled population included 198 patients (KEPPRA N = 101; placebo N = 97) with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization. Study 5 consisted of an 8-week baseline period and a 4-week titration period, followed by a 10-week evaluation period. Dosing was initiated at 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, the immediate-release KEPPRA doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments at 2-week intervals to a target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness in Study 5 was the between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to baseline.

### Keppra [^111F5AWe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of acute overdosage in humans**: The highest known dose of Keppra received in the clinical development program was 6000 mg/day. Other than drowsiness, there were no adverse reactions in the few known cases of overdose in clinical trials. However, cases of somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and coma were observed with Keppra overdoses in postmarketing use.

- **Management of overdose**: There is no specific antidote for overdose with Keppra. If indicated, the elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up-to-date information on the management of overdose with Keppra.

- **Hemodialysis**: Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of levetiracetam (approximately 50% in 4 hours) and should be considered in cases of overdose. Although hemodialysis has not been performed in the few known cases of overdose, it may be indicated by the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.

### Levetiracetam [^113ruN5U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric patients

- **Intravenous formulation**: A population pharmacokinetic analysis for the intravenous formulation was conducted in 49 pediatric patients (1 month to < 16 years of age) weighing 3 to 79 kg. Patients received levetiracetam as a 15-minute IV infusion at doses between 14 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day twice daily. Plasma concentrations and model-derived steady-state exposure AUC(0 to 12) were within the range of the exposure observed in pediatric patients receiving equivalent doses of the oral solution.

- **Oral formulations**: Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6 to 12 years) following a single oral dose (20 mg/kg) of the immediate-release formulation of levetiracetam. The body weight-adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults.

	- A repeat dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in pediatric patients (age 4 to 12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day of the immediate-release formulation of levetiracetam. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (ucb L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption of levetiracetam at all doses, with a Tmax of about 1 hour and a t1/2 of 5 hours across all dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in pediatric patients was linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated in these patients. Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

### Assessment of a dose-response relationship of levetiracetam [^115HTPcm]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between levetiracetam dose and both efficacy and safety in adult patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Dose-response relationships for levetiracetam efficacy were evaluated using pooled data from three trials, including adults with refractory partial epilepsy.

Two trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in which doses of 1000–3000 mg/day of levetiracetam were administered as adjunctive therapy. The third trial consisted of the two parts of a crossover randomized, double-blind study in which levetiracetam (1000 or 2000 mg/day) or placebo was added to ongoing therapy. Data from each part of the crossover trial were included as if it were an independent parallel-group study.

A fourth randomized double-blind trial was added for the safety evaluation. It included data from adults receiving placebo or 2000 mg/day of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial seizures. The combined analysis showed an increasing effect with increasing dose. The responder rates (≥ 50% reduction in seizures) for placebo and levetiracetam 1000, 2000, and 3000 mg/day were 13.1%, 28.5%, 34.3%, and 41.3%, respectively. The respective values for seizure freedom were 0.8%, 4.7%, 6.3%, and 8.6%.

There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship with regard to adverse events, including those (asthenia, dizziness, somnolence) most commonly associated with this antiepileptic drug. Patients who do not become seizure-free at the lowest recommended levetiracetam dose (1000 mg/day) should be titrated to 2000 mg/day.

### Epitol [^113ua4YY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.

- **Conversion of patients from oral Epitol® tablets to carbamazepine suspension**: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e. twice a day tablets to three times a day suspension).

- **Epilepsy**:

	- **Adults and children over 12 years of age**: Initial: 200 mg twice a day. Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a three times a day or four times a day regimen until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily in children 12 to 15 years of age, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances. Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 800 to 1200 mg daily.

	- **Children 6 to 12 years of age**: Initial: 100 mg twice a day. Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 100 mg/day using a three times a day or four times a day regimen until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily. Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 400 to 800 mg daily.

### KeppraXR [^116sLVBs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of immediate-release Keppra for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, referred to as Studies 2, 3, and 4. The tablet formulation was used in all three studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to receive either a placebo or Keppra at doses of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg per day. Patients enrolled in Study 2 or Study 3 had experienced refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Meanwhile, patients enrolled in Study 4 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least one year and had taken one AED. At the time of the study, patients were on a stable dose regimen of at least one AED and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients needed to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each four-week period.

- **Study 2**: Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States. It compared immediate-release Keppra at doses of 1000 mg per day (N = 97) and 3000 mg per day (N = 101) against a placebo group (N = 95), with dosing given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective 12-week baseline period, patients in Study 2 were randomized into one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a six-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed-dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED use was maintained.

### Levetiracetam dosing optimization in neurocritical care population: Neuro-ARC study [^1169Kku8]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam, a first-line antiseizure medication, is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, with approximately 66% renal elimination. Consequently, its pharmacokinetics are significantly influenced by kidney function. Augmented renal clearance (ARC), a condition characterized by renal hyperfiltration, is frequently observed in critical care settings and can profoundly impact the disposition of renally eliminated drugs such as levetiracetam. Our objectives were to characterize levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in neurocritical care patients, identify covariates significantly influencing drug clearance, and provide clinicians with optimal dosage recommendations in those with and without ARC.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study involving patients admitted to the participating centers with life-threatening neurological illnesses. Each participant had up to four plasma samples collected, and the samples were analyzed using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. The creatinine clearance (CL_CR) of enrolled participants was measured using the 8-hour urine collection method (measured CL_CR [mCL_CR]). Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using Monolix software. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to explore various dosage strategies and to suggest optimal levetiracetam regimens.

- **Results**: Our study included 50 patients, with 35 patients (70%) experiencing ARC. Trough levetiracetam levels were significantly lower in the ARC group compared with the no-ARC group (median [interquartile range] 4.4 [11.5] vs.

### SPL drug information for levetiracetam [^114nXYAA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of levetiracetam IV (also known as Keppra):

- **Anaphylaxis, angioedema**: Use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- **Behavioral or personality changes**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of behavioral changes, including aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, and personality disorder.
- **Exacerbation of seizures**: Do not discontinue abruptly because of the risk of withdrawal seizures and status epilepticus.
- **Hematologic abnormalities**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia.
- **Incoordination**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of coordination difficulties, including ataxia, abnormal gait, and incoordination.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: Use caution, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.
- **Somnolence**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as levetiracetam has been associated with an increased risk of somnolence and fatigue.

### KeppraXR [^114UYftu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing KeppraXR or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

- **Somnolence and fatigue**: KeppraXR may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on KeppraXR to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.

### Keppra [^112hhHLt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Keppra as adjunctive therapy in patients 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) experiencing myoclonic seizures was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 6), conducted at 37 sites in 14 countries. Eligible patients on a stable dose of one antiepileptic drug (AED) experiencing one or more myoclonic seizures per day for at least eight days during the prospective eight-week baseline period were randomized to either Keppra or placebo (Keppra N = 60, placebo N = 60). Patients were titrated over four weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day over 12 weeks (evaluation period). The study drug was given in two divided doses.

The primary measure of effectiveness was the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in the number of days per week with one or more myoclonic seizures during the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods) as compared to baseline. Of the 120 patients enrolled, 113 had a diagnosis of confirmed or suspected JME. Table 14 displays the results for the 113 patients with JME in this study.

### Levetiracetam [^113Zg911]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.

- **Distribution**: The equivalence of levetiracetam injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution and was infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at Tmax after an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 x 500 mg oral tablets. The time-independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following a 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC(0 to 12) at steady-state was equivalent to AUCinf following an equivalent single dose.

Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.

- **Metabolism**: Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose), and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring.

Pharmacokinetics

Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.

Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. The injection and tablets of levetiracetam are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. It is not significantly protein-bound (less than 10%) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water.

Sixty-six percent of the dose is excreted renally in unchanged form. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam, accounting for 24% of the dose, is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, and it is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are also renally excreted. The plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. This half-life is increased in the elderly, primarily due to impaired renal clearance, and in subjects with renal impairment.

### Levetiracetam [^112TUniG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30 to 50 mL/min), and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.

### A clinical trial of enteral levetiracetam for acute seizures in pediatric cerebral malaria [^113fAMBZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetics (PK) studies employed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine levetiracetam (LVT) levels. The PK data were analyzed using a mixed-effects population approach with the computer program NONMEM (ver. 7.2 Icon, Dublin) and the First Order Conditional Estimation (FOCE) method. Size was incorporated into the model using a standard allometric approach. Given the limited study sample size, exploratory analysis of potential covariates was restricted to age, liver function tests, and serum creatinine (SCr). A reduction in the PK model objective function of at least 7.88 (p < 0.005) was necessary for inclusion in the final PK model. A 1000 replicate bootstrap analysis of the final model was conducted using Wings v 7.4 to determine the parameter confidence interval. Monte Carlo simulations involving 15,000 virtual subjects of the final model and dosing were performed to ascertain the frequency of achieving trough concentrations of 6–20 g/mL.

Since adequate absorption of eLVT was a key concern in this population, LVT concentrations collected early in the dose interval (< 4 h after the prior dose) were compared to their individual predicted values. Early measured LVT concentrations that were less than 30% of predicted were defined as having slow absorption. Individual subject steady-state trough concentrations, area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), apparent clearance (CL/F), and half-life (t 1/2) were generated using a post hoc empirical Bayesian approach. In this analysis, doses defined as having slow absorption were modeled with an absorption lag time.

### Keppra [^115oj6FS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Increase in blood pressure**: In a randomized, placebo-controlled study involving patients aged 1 month to < 4 years, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the KEPPRA-treated patients (17%) compared to the placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the KEPPRA and placebo treatment groups was not observed in studies of older children or adults. It is recommended to monitor patients aged 1 month to < 4 years for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

- **Seizure control during pregnancy**: Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy and that close monitoring continues through the postpartum period, especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### Keppra [^111v7j5z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Keppra (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There was also no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, UCB L057.

- **Other antiepileptic drugs**: Potential drug interactions between Keppra and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and valproate) were assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo-controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs, and these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

- **Effect of AEDs in pediatric patients**: There was about a 22% increase in apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.

- **Oral contraceptives**: Keppra (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

### Levetiracetam add-on for drug-resistant localization related (partial) epilepsy [^116fut3s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). High credibility.

The majority of patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis, and their seizures are well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. However, up to 30% develop refractory seizures, particularly those with partial seizures. In this review, we summarize the evidence regarding a new antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of levetiracetam on seizures, side effects, quality of life, and cognition when used as an add-on treatment for patients with drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2000). In addition, we contacted UCB SA (makers of levetiracetam) and experts in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized placebo-controlled add-on trials of levetiracetam in patients with drug-resistant localization-related (partial) epilepsy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted relevant data. The following outcomes were assessed: (a) 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency; (b) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (c) side effects; (d) cognitive effects; and (e) quality of life. Primary analyses were intention to treat. Sensitivity, best, and worst-case analyses were also undertaken. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for each outcome.

### Keppra XR [^113JKEck]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The bioavailability of Keppra XR tablets is similar to that of the immediate-release Keppra tablets. The pharmacokinetics (AUC and Cmax) are dose-proportional following single-dose administration of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg extended-release levetiracetam. The plasma half-life of extended-release levetiracetam is approximately 7 hours.

Levetiracetam is almost fully absorbed after oral administration. Its pharmacokinetics are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (< 10% bound), and its volume of distribution is similar to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of the dose) involves enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, and it does not rely on liver cytochrome P450 pathways. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Across studies, the plasma half-life of levetiracetam is approximately 6–8 hours. This half-life is extended in the elderly, primarily due to impaired renal clearance, as well as in patients with renal impairment.

The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are consistent whether used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy in treating partial-onset seizures.

### Optimal dosing of levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis in critically ill patients: A prospective observational study [^114XPUXL]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Critically ill patients eliminate levetiracetam (LEV) more rapidly than healthy controls, yet low doses are commonly used for seizure prophylaxis in the ICU setting. We compared the rates of achievement of target serum levels and new-onset seizure (clinical and/or electrographic) among patients who received low (500 mg bid) versus high (750–1,000 mg bid) dose LEV.

- **Design**: Prospective, observational study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care, academic center.

- **Patients**: We included patients who received prophylactic LEV following traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, or supratentorial neurosurgery between 2019 and 2021. Patients with a history of seizure, antiseizure medication use, or renal failure requiring dialysis were excluded.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements**: LEV levels were obtained at steady state. The impact of low-dose versus high-dose LEV on the primary outcome of target LEV levels (12–46 μg/mL) and the secondary outcome of clinical and/or electrographic seizure were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, LEV loading dose, BMI, primary diagnosis, and creatinine clearance (CrCl).

- **Main results**: Of the 205 subjects included in analyses, n = 106 (52%) received LEV 500 mg bid (median 13 mg/kg/d), and n = 99 (48%) received LEV 750–1,000 mg bid (median 25 mg/kg/d). Overall, 111 of 205 patients (54%) achieved target levels: 48 (45%) from the low-dose group versus 63 (64%) from the high-dose group (odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1–3.7; p = 0.009). In multivariable analyses, high-dose LEV was associated with higher rates of achieving target serum levels.

Recommended dosage adjustments for adults with renal impairment are shown below. Information is unavailable for dosage adjustments in pediatric patients with renal impairment. To calculate the appropriate dose for adult patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be determined. An estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:

Study 4 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 47 centers in Europe. It compared immediate-release KEPPRA 3000 mg/day (N = 180) and placebo (N = 104) in patients with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, receiving only one concomitant AED. The study drug was administered in two divided doses. Following a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients in Study 4 were randomized into one of the two treatment groups described above.

The 16-week treatment period consisted of a 4-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed-dose evaluation period during which concomitant AED doses were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness in Study 4 was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate, defined as the incidence of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency.

The percentage of patients (y-axis) who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period) within the two treatment groups (x-axis) in Study 4 is presented in Figure 3.

### Keppra [^112XneJx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5–100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing KEPPRA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

### Keppra [^114z1ZDN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6–12 years) following a single dose of 20 mg/kg. The body weight-adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults.

A repeat dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in pediatric patients (age 4–12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (ucb L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption of levetiracetam at all doses with a Tmax of about 1 hour and a t1/2 of 5 hours across the three dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in children were linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated in these patients. Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, or lamotrigine. However, there was about a 22% increase in the apparent clearance of levetiracetam when co-administered with an enzyme-inducing AED (e.g. carbamazepine).

Following single dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to children with epilepsy (1 month to < 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed and peak plasma concentrations were observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetic results indicated that the half-life was shorter (5.3 h) than for adults (7.2 h) and apparent clearance was faster (1.5 mL/min/kg) than for adults (0.96 mL/min/kg).

### Therapeutic monitoring of antiepileptic drugs for epilepsy [^112rgEi7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of drug treatment for epilepsy is to prevent seizures without causing adverse effects. To achieve this, drug dosages need to be individualized. Measuring antiepileptic drug levels in body fluids, known as therapeutic drug monitoring, is frequently used to optimize drug dosage for individual patients.

- **Objectives**: To review the evidence regarding the effects of therapeutic drug monitoring upon outcomes in epilepsy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005), and EMBASE (1974 to May 2005). No language restrictions were imposed. We checked the reference lists of retrieved articles for additional reports of relevant studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing the outcomes of antiepileptic drug monotherapy guided by therapeutic drug monitoring with drug treatment without the aid of therapeutic drug monitoring.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We based this review on published aggregate data. The main outcomes measured were the proportions of patients achieving a 12-month remission from seizures, reporting adverse effects, and being withdrawn from the treatment they had been randomized to receive.

- **Main results**: Only one study met the inclusion criteria for the review. In this open study, 180 patients with newly-diagnosed, untreated epilepsy were randomized to treatment with the antiepileptic drug selected by their physician, either with or without therapeutic drug monitoring.

### KeppraXR [^112HLTSZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings of acute overdosage in humans**: The signs and symptoms of KEPPRA XR overdose are expected to be similar to those seen with immediate-release KEPPRA tablets. The highest known dose of oral immediate-release KEPPRA received in the clinical development program was 6000 mg/day. Other than drowsiness, there were no adverse reactions in the few known cases of overdose in clinical trials. However, cases of somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and coma were observed with immediate-release KEPPRA overdoses in postmarketing use.

- **Management of overdose**: There is no specific antidote for overdose with KEPPRA XR. If indicated, the elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. A certified poison control center should be contacted for up-to-date information on the management of overdose with KEPPRA XR.

- **Hemodialysis**: Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of levetiracetam (approximately 50% in 4 hours) and should be considered in cases of overdose. Although hemodialysis has not been performed in the few known cases of overdose, it may be indicated by the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.

### Association of levetiracetam concentration with seizure frequency in pregnant women with epilepsy [^115jZReA]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of epilepsy in pregnant women balances risks for both the mother and fetus. Levetiracetam (LEV) is considered safe during pregnancy due to its low teratogenic potential and lack of drug-drug interaction with other antiseizure medications (ASMs). Recent studies have indicated a decline in ASM concentrations during pregnancy due to physiologically based pharmacokinetic changes. In this study, we established a decrease in LEV concentration during pregnancy. We also aimed to investigate the effect of low LEV levels during pregnancy and to develop a target value for LEV levels during this period.

- **Methods**: Pregnant patients using levetiracetam were studied in this retrospective cohort study. Blood samples were collected monthly via venous puncture or the dried blood spot method. ASM serum concentrations were determined at least 6 months before conception and for each month of pregnancy. Seizure frequency and ASM dosages during pregnancy were obtained from patient records. Patients were divided into two groups: a seizure-free group and a non-seizure-free group, which included pregnancies where the mother had experienced an epileptic seizure more than 12 months and less than 12 months before pregnancy, respectively.

- **Results**: We found decreased concentration/dose ratios in 29 pregnancies throughout all months of pregnancy. In the non-seizure-free group, low LEV concentrations were associated with an increase in seizure frequency (p = 0.022).

### Levetiracetam pharmacokinetics during continuous venovenous hemofiltration and acute liver dysfunction [^114fPRgM]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Levetiracetam clearance is dependent on renal (major) and hepatic (minor) elimination pathways. In the setting of organ dysfunction, dose reductions are recommended to prevent accumulation. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been shown to eliminate levetiracetam, but the preferred dosing regimen when a patient is on CVVH and has concomitant acute liver dysfunction is unknown. The objective of this case is to describe levetiracetam dosing and pharmacokinetics in the setting of CVVH and acute liver dysfunction.

- **Methods**: This is a case report of a single patient.

- **Results**: A 59-year-old male was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute onset multiorgan dysfunction associated with a hematologic disorder. His hospital course was complicated by persistent liver dysfunction with a model for end-stage liver disease score of 47 and renal failure, which necessitated the initiation of CVVH. On hospital day two, the patient developed new-onset focal seizures secondary to metabolic abnormalities, resulting in the initiation of levetiracetam 1000 mg intravenously twice daily. The peak concentration at a steady state was 32.2 mcg/mL, and the trough concentration was 16.1 mcg/mL (goal 12–46 mcg/mL). The volume of distribution was 0.65 L/kg, and the elimination half-life was 11.4 hours.

- **Conclusion**: Levetiracetam pharmacokinetics observed in this case approximated those seen in a normal healthy patient, and a regimen of 1000 mg twice daily achieved serum trough concentrations at the lower limit of the target range. This case indicates that in a patient with acute liver dysfunction undergoing CVVH, levetiracetam can be dosed at 1000 mg twice daily to meet pharmacokinetic targets.

### A computer-based intervention for improving the appropriateness of antiepileptic drug level monitoring [^1174xmNQ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

We designed and implemented two automated, computerized screens for use at the time of antiepileptic drug (AED) test order entry. These screens aimed to improve appropriateness by reminding physicians when a potentially redundant test was ordered and providing common indications for monitoring and pharmacokinetics of the specific AED. All computerized orders for inpatient serum AED levels during two 3-month periods were included in the study.

During the 3-month period after implementation of the automated intervention, 13% of all AED tests ordered were canceled following computerized reminders. For orders appearing redundant, the cancellation rate was 27%. For nonredundant orders, 4% were canceled when information on specific AED monitoring and pharmacokinetics was provided. The cancellation rate was sustained after four years. There has been a 19.5% decrease in total AED testing volume since the implementation of this intervention, despite a 19.3% increase in overall chemistry test volume. Inappropriateness owing to repeated testing before pharmacologic steady state was reached decreased from 54% of all AED orders to 14.6%.

A simple, automated, activity-based intervention targeting a specific test-ordering behavior effectively reduced inappropriate laboratory testing. The sustained benefit supports the idea that computerized interventions may durably affect physician behavior. Computerized delivery of such evidence-based boundary guidelines can help narrow the gap between evidence and practice.

### A missed opportunity - consequences of unknown levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in a peritoneal dialysis patient [^113UDb4j]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Several guidelines list levetiracetam as the drug of first choice for adult patients with partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization, and as a second choice for patients in epileptic status. Levetiracetam, with a molecular weight of 170.2 Da, is rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion, boasting a bioavailability of nearly 100%. Peak concentrations are typically reached 1.3 hours post-ingestion. Notably, neither levetiracetam nor its primary metabolites bind to plasma proteins. Its volume of distribution rests between 0.5 to 0.7 l/kg, and its elimination half-life in adults is approximately 7 ± 1 hours.

About a quarter of the levetiracetam dose undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis in the blood. Its cumulative renal excretion rate is 66% within the first 48 hours, highlighting the necessity for careful dosing in patients with chronic kidney disease. It has been recommended to adjust the dosage proportionally to the decline in glomerular filtration rate. For patients undergoing dialysis, the package insert advises a dose of 500–1000 mg once daily, with an additional supplemental dose of 250–500 mg following dialysis due to the ease with which the small unbound molecule is removed by dialysis.

Despite levetiracetam's approval 13 years ago, data regarding its dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients remain unavailable. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the pharmacokinetic data of levetiracetam in a patient on peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of partial seizures.

### A prospective analysis of the outcome of levetiracetam in clinical practice [^116685oR]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

In this post-licensing surveillance study within a large unselected population, data were collected prospectively on all patients prescribed levetiracetam (LEV) at a regional epilepsy clinic over a two-year period. Two hundred forty-five patients (69.2%) remained on LEV, with 8.8% achieving remission and some improvement in seizure control observed in 49.3% of cases. Sedation emerged as the most common adverse effect (10.7%), yet mood disturbance was more likely to result in discontinuation (4.8%) of the medication. The cumulative probability of remaining on LEV at 12 months was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.79). Factors predictive of poorer retention included a greater number of previous antiepileptic drugs and a faster initial titration regimen.

### A framework proposal to follow-up on preclinical convulsive signals of a new molecular entity in first-in-human studies using electroencephalographic monitoring [^111dDaeA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Traditionally, in dose-escalating first-in-human (FiH) studies, a dose cap with a 10-fold safety margin to the no observed effect level in animals is implemented if convulsive events are observed in animals. However, the convulsive risk seen in animals does not generally translate to humans.

Several lines of evidence are summarized indicating that in a dose-escalating setting, electroencephalographic epileptiform abnormalities occur at lower doses than clinical convulsive events. Therefore, we propose to consider the occurrence of epileptiform abnormalities in toxicology studies as premonitory signals for convulsions in dose-escalating FiH studies. Compared with the traditional dose-cap approach, this may allow the exploration of higher doses in FiH and, subsequently, phase II studies without compromising human safety.

Similarly, the presence or absence of electroencephalographic epileptiform abnormalities may also aid the assessment of proconvulsive risk in situations of increased perpetrator burden as potentially present in pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions.

### Levetiracetam [^112idQeK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

All clinical studies supporting the efficacy of levetiracetam utilized oral formulations. The finding of efficacy of levetiracetam injection is based on the results of studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam and on the demonstration of comparable bioavailability between the oral and parenteral formulations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Partial-onset seizures: Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in adults**. The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to receive either a placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least one year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.

### Individualized dosing algorithms and therapeutic monitoring for antiepileptic drugs [^116ZisGP]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) models exist for most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Yet, their use in clinical practice to assess interindividual differences and derive individualized doses has been limited. Here, we show how model-based dosing algorithms can be used to ensure the attainment of target exposure and improve treatment response in patients. Using simulations, different treatment scenarios were explored for 11 commonly used AEDs. For each drug, five scenarios were considered:

1. All patients receive the same dose.
2. **Individual clearance (CL)**: As predicted by population PK models, is used to personalize treatment.
3–5. **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: Individual CL, obtained by TDM according to different sampling schemes, is used to personalize treatment.

Attainment of steady-state target exposure was used as the performance criterion to rank each scenario. In contrast to clinical guidelines, our results show that patient demographic and clinical characteristics should be used in conjunction with TDM to personalize the treatment of seizures.

### KeppraXR [^1153VhZs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug, which represents 66% of the administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg, and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated with creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

There are insufficient pharmacokinetic data to specifically address the use of extended-release levetiracetam in the elderly population. Pharmacokinetics of immediate-release levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61–88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.

An open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, two-arm study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Keppra XR in pediatric patients (13 to 16 years old) and in adults (18 to 55 years old) with epilep…

### Keppra [^114Ht3g4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50–80 mL/min), by 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30–50 mL/min), and by 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr < 30 mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.

In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high-affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase, or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes.

Levetiracetam is one ASM that fulfills the "easy to use" criterion. It is rapidly absorbed, unaffected by food, and peak concentrations are quickly achieved. It has linear kinetics, with minimal protein binding, negligible hepatic metabolism, and is renally excreted. Therefore, it neither has the propensity for clinically relevant drug interactions nor is its plasma concentration influenced by protein levels. Schedules for commencing treatment are straightforward in comparison to lamotrigine. One issue is that tablets are large and taste bitter in crushed form.

Levetiracetam is available in tablet, oral solution, and injectable forms and, therefore, suitable for various circumstances. Recent evidence from the SANAD II trials suggests that it is neither clinically nor cost-effective compared to valproate in generalized epilepsies and lamotrigine in focal epilepsies. Nevertheless, it is widely prescribed for various seizure types and epilepsies, except for absence seizures. There is persuasive evidence for its use as a second-line drug for convulsive status epilepticus. Its efficacy in terms of seizure termination is similar to phenytoin but with a quicker onset, probably related to the speed of its intravenous administration compared to phenytoin.

When used in monotherapy, levetiracetam is less teratogenic than other ASMs, making its use appealing in women in the reproductive age group. Therapeutic drug monitoring, although available, is not routinely required, apart from some situations, e.g. pregnancy, adherence check, critical illnesses, and extremes of age.

### Levetiracetam [^115iq4cc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Levetiracetam use during pregnancy requires careful monitoring due to physiological changes that may gradually decrease plasma levels throughout pregnancy. This decrease is especially pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored closely, with continued oversight through the postpartum period, particularly if dosage adjustments were made during pregnancy.
