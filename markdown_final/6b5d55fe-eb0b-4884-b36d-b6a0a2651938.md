## Question

What is the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy in pancolitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy in pancolitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with acute severe ulcerative colitis versus a moderate-to-severe outpatient flare. Then, I should verify the highest-quality guideline recommendations for intravenous steroids in acute severe disease and the time window for response. Next, I will review oral steroid duration for induction in moderate-to-severe disease and the tapering cadence. After that, I need to check definitions of steroid dependence and the principle of minimizing steroid exposure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and ensure it aligns with contemporary quality-of-care standards and pancolitis-specific risk considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because duration hinges on severity and setting. Pancolitis can present as acute severe ulcerative colitis requiring hospitalization and intravenous therapy, or as a moderate-to-severe outpatient flare where oral steroids are appropriate; I need to ensure I do not conflate these scenarios, as the time-to-response and rescue thresholds differ substantially [^1124wvxT] [^117N68rx].

> For acute severe ulcerative colitis, I should confirm the standard of care and the time window for response. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids are first-line, with methylprednisolone 60 mg daily or hydrocortisone 100 mg every 6 hours recommended, and response is typically assessed within 3–5 days; extending beyond 7–10 days without improvement does not add benefit and increases toxicity, so salvage therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine or colectomy should be considered if there is no adequate response by day 3–5 [^1124wvxT] [^1131n7k9] [^114F8gAX].

> Wait, let me verify the practical duration in severe disease before escalation. The optimal duration of IV steroids is generally up to 7–10 days, with reassessment at 72 hours; if there is no meaningful clinical and biochemical improvement, I should escalate to rescue therapy rather than prolong IV steroids, because additional days rarely change outcomes and increase adverse effects, and this approach is consistently endorsed in high-quality guidelines and consensus statements [^1124wvxT] [^1131n7k9] [^116sRKKA].

> Now, for moderate-to-severe outpatient pancolitis, I need to check the oral steroid starting dose and expected time to response. Typical prednisone dosing is 40–60 mg daily, with clinical response expected within about 5–7 days; if there is no improvement by about 2 weeks, I should reconsider the diagnosis or escalate therapy rather than persist with steroids alone, and I should avoid exceeding 3 continuous months of systemic steroids without introducing steroid-sparing agents [^117N68rx] [^111zuN8M] [^116cVbZn].

> Hold on, I should verify the tapering strategy because duration is driven by the taper as much as the initial course. A commonly used regimen is to taper prednisone by 5 mg per week once control is achieved, with the total course approximating 8–12 weeks; shorter tapers increase relapse risk, whereas longer continuous use increases toxicity, so I need to balance relapse prevention with harm minimization and individualize based on response and comorbidities [^114KX3au] [^116FUueC].

> I need to ensure I incorporate the principle of minimizing steroid exposure. Prolonged or repeated corticosteroid courses are associated with substantial toxicity, including infection, osteoporosis, metabolic effects, and increased fracture risk even at low doses; therefore, I should aim for the shortest effective course and transition to steroid-sparing maintenance promptly, ideally within 3 months, while monitoring for steroid dependence and escalating to thiopurines or biologics as indicated [^116cVbZn] [^114qW4dg].

> Let me consider pancolitis-specific risk, because extent influences prognosis and the threshold for early escalation. Pancolitis is associated with more severe disease, higher colectomy risk, and greater treatment requirements over time, so I should have a lower threshold to escalate early if steroid response is suboptimal and avoid prolonged steroid exposure that could worsen outcomes in this high-risk phenotype [^114KW9LJ] [^116LnnZ3] [^115iw5RW].

> But wait, what if the patient is already steroid dependent or refractory; I should double-check the definitions to guide duration decisions. Steroid dependence is generally defined as inability to taper below about 10 mg prednisolone within 3 months or relapse within 3 months of stopping, and steroid refractory is active disease despite up to 1 mg/kg/day for about 4 weeks; in either case, continuing steroids beyond these windows is inappropriate, and I should escalate to immunomodulators or biologics rather than prolonging steroids [^116cVbZn] [^111zuN8M].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the following durations while emphasizing that corticosteroids are for induction only, not maintenance. For acute severe pancolitis, limit intravenous steroids to about 7–10 days with reassessment at 72 hours and escalate promptly if no response; for moderate-to-severe outpatient pancolitis, use oral prednisone 40–60 mg daily with a taper over roughly 8–12 weeks once control is achieved, and avoid continuous use beyond 3 months without steroid-sparing therapy; throughout, I should monitor closely for dependence and toxicity and pivot early to maintenance strategies to achieve steroid-free remission [^1124wvxT] [^117N68rx] [^116cVbZn].

---

The optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy in pancolitis is **8–12 weeks** for induction, with a taper starting after clinical response and completing within 12 weeks to minimize steroid dependence and adverse effects [^114KX3au] [^117N68rx]. Prolonged use beyond 3 months is discouraged due to **steroid dependence** and significant toxicity [^116cVbZn]; if remission is not achieved by 8–12 weeks, escalate to immunomodulators or biologics [^notfound]. For acute severe UC, limit IV corticosteroids to 3–5 days and escalate to rescue therapy if no response by day 3 [^1124wvxT] [^1131n7k9].

---

## Indications for corticosteroid therapy in pancolitis

Corticosteroids are indicated for **induction of remission** in moderate-to-severe UC, including pancolitis, but are not recommended for maintenance due to lack of efficacy and significant adverse effects [^117N68rx] [^116cVbZn].

---

## Recommended duration of corticosteroid therapy

### Induction phase

- **Initial dose**: Prednisone 40–60 mg daily (or 1 mg/kg/day) is standard for induction of remission in moderate-to-severe UC [^117N68rx] [^114KX3au].

- **Duration**: Clinical response typically occurs within 5–7 days; continue at full dose until remission is achieved, usually within 2–4 weeks [^117N68rx].

- **Maximum duration**: Total corticosteroid therapy should not exceed 8–12 weeks to minimize risks of steroid dependence and adverse effects [^notfound].

---

### Tapering phase

Begin tapering only after **clinical remission** is achieved, typically reducing the dose by 5–10 mg every 1–2 weeks until discontinuation [^114kF4bm]. The **total duration**, including tapering, should not exceed 12 weeks [^114KX3au].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged corticosteroid therapy

Prolonged corticosteroid therapy (> 3 months) is associated with significant risks, including:

- **Steroid dependence**: Defined as inability to taper below 10 mg prednisolone within 3 months or relapse within 3 months of stopping steroids [^116cVbZn].

- **Adverse effects**: Increased risk of infections, osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension, weight gain, and psychiatric effects [^116cVbZn].

- **Increased mortality**: Prolonged corticosteroid use has been associated with increased mortality compared to anti-TNF therapy in IBD patients [^1119xZ2S].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

| **Duration of corticosteroid therapy** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|
| ≤ 8 weeks | - High likelihood of remission <br/> - Lower risk of steroid dependence <br/> - Reduced adverse effects [^notfound] |
| 8–12 weeks | - Acceptable remission rates <br/> - Moderate risk of steroid dependence <br/> - Manageable adverse effects [^notfound] |
| > 12 weeks | - Increased risk of steroid dependence <br/> - Higher incidence of adverse effects <br/> - Poorer long-term outcomes [^116cVbZn] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus consistently recommend **limiting corticosteroid therapy to 8–12 weeks** for induction of remission in pancolitis, with tapering initiated upon clinical response. Prolonged corticosteroid use beyond 3 months is strongly discouraged due to lack of efficacy in maintenance and significant adverse effects [^114KX3au] [^116cVbZn].

---

## Alternative therapies and strategies

To minimize corticosteroid exposure and associated risks, **alternative therapies and strategies** include:

- **Immunomodulators**: Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are effective maintenance therapies and steroid-sparing agents [^1177GTrt].

- **Biologic therapies**: Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab) and anti-integrin therapy (vedolizumab) are effective in inducing and maintaining remission in moderate-to-severe UC, including pancolitis [^116yRNVy].

- **Early escalation**: Early introduction of immunomodulators or biologics in patients with steroid-dependent or refractory disease is recommended to reduce corticosteroid exposure and improve long-term outcomes [^113Ueo4a].

---

## Special considerations in pancolitis

Pancolitis is associated with **more severe disease course**, higher risk of steroid dependence, and increased likelihood of colectomy. Therefore, careful monitoring and timely escalation to alternative therapies are crucial in managing patients with pancolitis [^114KW9LJ] [^116LnnZ3].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Induction**: 8–12 weeks of corticosteroid therapy, with tapering initiated upon clinical response.

- **Maximum duration**: Total corticosteroid therapy should not exceed 12 weeks.

- **Prolonged use**: Discouraged due to increased risk of steroid dependence and adverse effects.

- **Alternative therapies**: Immunomodulators and biologics should be considered for maintenance of remission and steroid-sparing strategies [^1177GTrt] [^112YZxAc].

---

The optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy in pancolitis is **8–12 weeks**, with tapering initiated upon clinical response. Prolonged corticosteroid use beyond 3 months is discouraged due to increased risk of steroid dependence and significant adverse effects. Alternative therapies, such as immunomodulators and biologics, should be considered for maintenance of remission and steroid-sparing strategies.

### Optimizing therapy in patients with pancolitis [^114KW9LJ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Pancolitis affects approximately 20% to 40% of the total ulcerative colitis population and remains a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Practitioners must focus on pancolitis when evaluating a patient for ulcerative colitis, because pancolitis is associated with more severe and fulminant disease and a higher rate of colorectal cancer and colectomy. It is imperative for clinicians to be knowledgeable in the clinical course, medications, and appropriate manner to induce and maintain clinical remission to prevent serious sequelae of the disease. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the treatment of pancolitis for general gastroenterologists, because medical management decisions have life-long effects for this subgroup of patients.

### Continuous infusion versus bolus administration of steroids in severe attacks of ulcerative colitis: a randomized, double-blind trial [^115hg2Kd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with severe attacks of ulcerative colitis (UC), IV steroids represent the first-line treatment, leading to clinical improvement in approximately 50–60% of patients.

Aim

The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the efficacy and safety of different modalities of steroid administration, and to evaluate predictors of failure to therapy.

Materials and Methods

In a single-center, double-blind trial, consecutive patients with a severe attack of UC received 1 mg/kg/day of 6-methyl-prednisolone administered randomly by either a bolus injection (group A) or continuous infusion (group B).

Results

Sixty-six patients were enrolled (35 men, mean age 38 ± 15, range 18–75 yr), 15 of them at their first attack of UC; in the remaining cases, the mean duration of disease was 4.5 ± 5 yr. At inclusion, forty patients (60%) had pancolitis and the remainder had left-sided colitis. Overall, thirty-three patients (50%) underwent clinical remission after 7 days of treatment: 16 of 32 in group A and 17 of 34 in group B. Thirty-one patients eventually underwent total colectomy (12 in group A and 9 in group B), which was carried out by the first month in 10 patients (5 in each group). Twenty-eight patients (15 in group A and 13 in group B) experienced steroid-related adverse reactions. All differences between groups were not statistically significant. Previous use of steroids (OR 13.6, CI 2–86) and active smoking (OR 11.6, CI 1.4–107) were independent predictors of nonresponse.

Conclusions

In severe attacks of UC, methyl-prednisolone given as a continuous infusion was no better than bolus administration in terms of efficacy and safety.

### The natural history of corticosteroid therapy for ulcerative colitis in children [^116Ezfo7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical outcome after corticosteroid therapy in children who are newly diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC).

Methods

Data were gathered prospectively from the Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative Research Group Registry database between January 2002 and March 2005. All children who were newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease younger than the age of 16 years were managed according to the dictates of their respective physicians. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at diagnosis, at 30 days, and then quarterly. Patients were classified as corticosteroid responsive, corticosteroid dependent, or refractory, and outcomes were determined at 3 months and at 1 year.

Results

Ninety-seven patients had a diagnosis of UC and a minimum of 1 year of follow-up evaluation; 77 (79%) received corticosteroids (62 within 30 days of diagnosis [early] and 15 between 31 days and 6 months [late]). At diagnosis, 81% of corticosteroid-treated patients (age, 11.3 ± 3.5 y) had moderate/severe disease, and 81% had pancolitis. For those treated early with corticosteroids, disease activity at 3 months was inactive in 60%, mild in 27%, and moderate/severe in 11%. At 1 year, 31 of 62 (50%) of the early corticosteroid-treated patients were considered corticosteroid responsive and 28 (45%) were corticosteroid dependent. A total of 4 patients receiving corticosteroids (5%) required colectomy in the first year. Immunomodulators were used in 61% of all corticosteroid-treated patients.

Conclusions

Although short-term clinical response to corticosteroids in children with newly diagnosed UC is excellent, even with the common use of immunomodulators corticosteroid dependence is seen in 45% of patients.

### An international consensus on appropriate management of corticosteroids in clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease [^1121earM]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Approval of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) requires rigorously designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Corticosteroids remain a cornerstone of IBD induction therapy and many patients in trials are enrolled while taking corticosteroids. Despite this, approaches to corticosteroid management in RCTs have been highly heterogeneous, often differing from clinical practice. This negatively impacts patients' willingness to participate due to prolonged corticosteroid exposure and may potentially bias outcomes in the clinical trial. Our aim is to provide comprehensive standardized recommendations on key aspects of corticosteroid use in IBD clinical trials through a multi-phase, international expert consensus, with a goal to help inform and standardize practice in future RCTs.

Methods

The consensus was informed by a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, which determined the corticosteroid management rules used in placebo-controlled trials of advanced therapies in IBD. International expert consensus recommendations for all aspects of corticosteroid management in RCTs were then developed using a modified Delphi process with two rounds of survey questions and a ratification meeting.

Results

These recommendations propose management of corticosteroids during screening, induction, and maintenance phases of pharmacologic trials in IBD, and define corticosteroid-related endpoints. We emphasize the need for minimizing corticosteroid exposure through expedited tapering and shorter fixed-dosing periods that more closely reflect clinical care, and provide recommendations for standardized definitions of corticosteroid-free remission.

Conclusions

These recommendations will serve to optimize trial design and facilitate appropriate, acceptable, and standardized RCT corticosteroid handling practices.

### International consensus for the treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis [^115i2t73]. Pancreatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for autoimmune pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to corticosteroid dosing, EPC/IAP 2017 guidelines recommend to consider tapering prednisone by 5–10 mg/day every 1–2 weeks until a daily dosage of 20 mg, followed by tapering by 5 mg every 2 weeks.

### Understanding patient journey in ulcerative colitis prior to biologic initiation: a 5-year exploration [^112ciw9u]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been a more pronounced shift toward earlier, more aggressive therapies in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to describe the pre-biologic treatment and health care experience, including co-morbidities and overall health care utilization, for UC patients who initiated biologic therapies, in the 5 years prior to the initiation of the first biologic agent.

Methods

UC patients who initiated a biologic agent approved for UC between 9/15/2005 and 1/30/2018 were identified from the IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, a large US database. The date of the first recorded UC biologic exposure was defined as the index date, and ≥ 5 years of pre-index records were required to evaluate patients' treatment, disease progression and overall health care utilization prior to initiating biologic agents.

Results

Among the 1891 eligible patients, treatment with oral corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylates, and other non-biologic immunomodulators, all increased progressively across the 5 years prior to the index. From within year-five to within year-one prior to the index, the median duration of oral corticosteroid treatment increased from 34 to 88 days per year and the proportion of patients who experienced more extensive/pancolitis disease increased from 16 to 59%. Overall, the frequency of all-cause health care visits also increased.

Conclusions

Patients with UC experienced increasing morbidity and treatment burden in the 5 years prior to initiating biologic therapy. To achieve reduced corticosteroids in UC management, better risk stratification is needed to help identify patients for more timely biologic treatment.

### Treatment of ulcerative colitis with steroids (in whom, how long, what dose, what form) [^1112p1FW]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids are a nonspecific immune modulator used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Topical and systemic forms of corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in induction of clinical remission and remain first-line therapy for acute severe ulcerative colitis. A large proportion of patients experience adverse effects, however, including some serious adverse effects, including infection and increased mortality. Newer formulations of gut selective corticosteroids have reduced adverse effects associated with steroids.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) — glucocorticoid duration position: The optimal duration of glucocorticoid therapy for PAN is not well established, and the duration of therapy should be guided by the patient's clinical condition, values, and preferences; examples include tapering off by 6 months or longer than 6 months.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^112wfe2y]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease — corticosteroids: We recommend oral corticosteroids for short-term induction of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Prednisone-equivalent dosing for active disease ranges from 40 to 60 mg/d, and the use of corticosteroids should not exceed 3 continuous months without attempting to introduce corticosteroid-sparing agents. Even short-term use may be accompanied by adverse events including venous thromboembolic events (5-fold increased risk). Despite effectiveness for symptom control, nearly 1 in 4 patients will have prolonged exposure to corticosteroids (greater than 6 months) with approximately 15% of patients becoming steroid-dependent.

### Increased mortality rates with prolonged corticosteroid therapy when compared with antitumor necrosis factor-α-directed therapy for inflammatory bowel disease [^1119xZ2S]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), affect nearly 1.5 million Americans and 3 million Europeans, with peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. These chronic diseases reduce quality of life and overall life expectancy.

Corticosteroids (CSs) and antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF) drugs are the main therapies used to rapidly control IBD symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy use is usually chronic, whereas CSs are typically used intermittently. However, recurrence of symptoms upon weaning CSs can result in prolonged or repeated CS therapy. Neither therapy is 100% effective for IBD.

Randomized trial data directly comparing a strategy of intermittent CS therapy vs. induction and maintenance anti-TNF therapy are limited. However, the evidence base for efficacy is greater for anti-TNF drugs and these drugs sometimes allow for CS discontinuation. Nonetheless, CSs, alone or in combination with other medications, remain commonly used to treat IBD, in part because of fear of adverse effects from anti-TNF drugs.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and management of autoimmune pancreatitis in childhood: consensus from INSPPIRE [^111qta4m]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pediatric pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (corticosteroids), INSPPIRE 2018 guidelines recommend to administer oral prednisone (1–1.5 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40–60 mg given in 1 or 2 divided daily doses for 2–4 weeks) as first-line therapy in patients with pediatric autoimmune pancreatitis. Taper prednisone subsequently.

### Prevalence and risk factors for therapy escalation in ulcerative colitis in the Swiss IBD cohort study [^116LnnZ3]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians traditionally treat ulcerative colitis (UC) using a step-up approach. Given the paucity of data, we aimed to assess the cumulative probability of UC-related need for step-up therapy and to identify escalation-associated risk factors.

Methods

Patients with UC enrolled into the Swiss IBD Cohort Study were analyzed. The following steps from the bottom to the top of the therapeutic pyramid were examined: (1) 5-aminosalicylic acid and/or rectal corticosteroids, (2) systemic corticosteroids, (3) immunomodulators (IM) (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), (4) TNF antagonists, (5) calcineurin inhibitors, and (6) colectomy.

Results

Data on 996 patients with UC with a median disease duration of 9 years were examined. The point estimates of cumulative use of different treatments at years 1, 5, 10, and 20 after UC diagnosis were 91%, 96%, 96%, and 97%, respectively, for 5-ASA and/or rectal corticosteroids, 63%, 69%, 72%, and 79%, respectively, for systemic corticosteroids, 43%, 57%, 59%, and 64%, respectively, for IM, 15%, 28%, and 35% (up to year 10 only), respectively, for TNF antagonists, 5%, 9%, 11%, and 12%, respectively, for calcineurin inhibitors, 1%, 5%, 9%, and 18%, respectively, for colectomy. The presence of extraintestinal manifestations and extended disease location (at least left-sided colitis) were identified as risk factors for step-up in therapy with systemic corticosteroids, IM, TNF antagonists, calcineurin inhibitors, and surgery. Cigarette smoking at diagnosis was protective against surgery.

Conclusions

The presence of extraintestinal manifestations, left-sided colitis, and extensive colitis/pancolitis at the time of diagnosis were associated with use of systemic corticosteroids, IM, TNF antagonists, calcineurin inhibitors, and colectomy during the disease course.

### Oral tacrolimus for steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis in children [^116zxAtR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate tacrolimus in 3 situations: for the induction of remission in children with severe steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis (UC); for steroid sparing in children with steroid-dependent UC in whom treatment with other immunosuppressants fails; and for the maintenance of remission in children with steroid-dependent and steroid-resistant UC.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 18 consecutive patients (13 with pancolitis) who were treated with oral tacrolimus at our institution from May 1999 to October 2005. Nine patients had steroid-resistant UC and 9 patients were steroid-dependent. We started patients initially on tacrolimus 0.2 mg/kg divided twice daily, with a goal plasma trough level of 10 to 15 ng/mL for the first 2 weeks, and then titrated doses to achieve plasma levels between 7 and 12 ng/mL after induction.

Results

Of the 18 patients in this study, 17 showed a positive response to tacrolimus therapy (ie, cessation of diarrhea and other symptoms) and 5 showed a prolonged response to tacrolimus. The mean time from initiation of tacrolimus therapy until response was 8.5 days. The mean duration of response was 260 days. Eleven of 18 patients required colectomy, including all of the patients with steroid-resistant UC, but only 2 of 9 who were steroid-dependent. The mean time from initiation of tacrolimus until colectomy was 392 days.

Conclusions

It is possible that tacrolimus may benefit selected patients with steroid-dependent UC, including those who are intolerant of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Conversely, patients with steroid-resistant UC are unlikely to sustain a prolonged clinical response to tacrolimus and seem to require colectomy eventually. Careful considerations of risk versus benefit, as well as close monitoring for adverse effects, are essential in all patients.

### Progress in corticosteroid use in the era of biologics with room for improvement [^112D9ZzH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

With the early success of their trials for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, corticosteroids gained popularity as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, when used chronically, corticosteroids are not effective in maintaining remission and associated with toxic effects. Steroid-free remission has become a major treatment goal. Prolonged corticosteroid use is currently a sign of suboptimal quality of care. Trends over the past 2 decades, spanning the emergence of biologic therapies for IBD, are explored here in the University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiologic Database.

### Conventional medical management of inflammatory bowel disease [^115VThLe]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conventional therapies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. A time-structured approach is required for appropriate management. Traditional step-up therapy has been partly replaced during the last decade by potent drugs and top-down therapies, with an accelerated step-up approach being the most appropriate in the majority of patients. When patients are diagnosed with CD or ulcerative colitis, physicians should consider the probable pattern of disease progression so that effective therapy is not delayed. This can be achieved by setting arbitrary time limits for administration of biological therapies, changing therapy from mesalamine in patients with active ulcerative colitis, or using rescue therapy for acute severe colitis. In this review, we provide algorithms with a time-structured approach for guidance of therapy. Common mistakes in conventional therapy include overprescription of mesalamine for CD; inappropriate use of steroids (for perianal CD, when there is sepsis, or for maintenance); delayed introduction or underdosing with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate; and failure to consider timely surgery. The paradox of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy is that although it too is used inappropriately (when patients have sepsis or fibrostenotic strictures) or too frequently (for diseases that would respond to less-potent therapy), it is also often introduced too late in disease progression. Conventional drugs are the mainstay of current therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases, but drug type, timing, and context must be optimized to manage individual patients effectively.

### Randomised controlled trial of long-term maintenance corticosteroid therapy in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis [^116KNpL2]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Corticosteroid has been established as the standard therapy for autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), but the requirement for maintenance corticosteroid therapy is controversial. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to clarify the efficacy of maintenance corticosteroid therapy in patients with AIP.

Design

We conducted a multicentre, tertiary setting, randomised controlled trial. After the induction of remission with the initial oral prednisolone (PSL) treatment, maintenance therapy with PSL at 5–7.5mg/day was continued for 3years or withdrawn at 26weeks. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival over 3years and the secondary endpoint was serious corticosteroid-related complications. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

Between April 2009 and March 2012, 49 patients with AIP were randomly assigned to the maintenance therapy group (n = 30) or the cessation group (n = 19). Baseline characteristics were not different between the two groups. Relapses occurred within 3years in 11 out of 19 (57.9%) patients assigned to the cessation group, and in 7 of 30 (23.3%) patients in the maintenance therapy group. The relapse rate over 3years was significantly lower in the maintenance therapy group than that in the cessation group (p = 0.011). The relapse-free survival was significantly longer in the maintenance therapy group than that in the cessation group (p = 0.007). No serious corticosteroid-related complications requiring discontinuation of PSL were observed.

Conclusions

Maintenance corticosteroid therapy for 3years may decrease relapses in patients with AIP compared with those who discontinued the therapy at 26weeks.

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^114KX3au]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Seven decades later, corticosteroids remain the cornerstone for inducing remission for patients presenting with moderate-to-severe active UC. Baron et al. established the initial dose for outpatient treatment at prednisolone 40 mg/day in 1962, finding comparable remission rates with doses of 60 mg/day, and superior rates compared with 20 mg/day. Subsequently, administering high-dose intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone for acute severe UC (ASUC) as defined by the Truelove and Witts criteria was established in 1974, with two-thirds achieving long-term remission. The landmark study by Travis et al. in 1996 further predicted the need for colectomy after 3 days of therapy, establishing the concept of steroid-refractory salvage therapy. Numerous tapering regimens have since been utilised, typified by protocol-specified regimens in modern clinical trials for treatment of moderate–severe UC. In general, a regimen comprising of an initial dose of prednisolone 40 mg/day, with a gradual taper over a period of 8 weeks or 3 months has been utilised, as relapse is associated with shorter courses, and smaller doses are ineffective at achieving remission.

### Early introduction of selective immunosuppressive therapy associated with favorable clinical outcomes in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis [^112gLN1N]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Current treatment guidelines recommend corticosteroid therapy as first-line therapy for IMC and that corticosteroids be continued for at least 4 to 6 weeks after resolution of IMC. This approach could expose patients to unnecessary immunosuppression and increases the risk of corticosteroid-associated morbidity. The introduction of SIT, such as infliximab and vedolizumab, is currently recommended only after failure of corticosteroids to induce resolution of symptoms. No data are available on the appropriate timing of SIT administration and the effect of early introduction of SIT before steroid failure. Moreover, recommendations regarding the optimal number of SIT infusions is lacking. These knowledge gaps have not been addressed and are an obstacle in the path of evidence-based recommendations for the management of IMC.

Previously, we published data regarding the utility of endoscopic and histologic evaluation in the management of IMC and the importance of prompt evaluation to guide early SIT initiation. We also found investigational laboratory tests to be useful in predicting the response to immunosuppressive therapy. Additionally, we reported the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab and infliximab in the treatment of IMC. These studies of the endoscopic, histologic, and therapeutic paradigms of IMC were inspired by the experience with the treatment approaches for IBD and yielded findings that are akin to IBD. The current study builds upon this foundation.

At a tertiary cancer center, we are frequently consulted for the treatment of IMC that is refractory to corticosteroid therapy. Delay in SIT introduction and inadequate number of SIT infusions have been shown to be associated with significant morbidity of uncontrolled IBD and serious sequelae, and our clinical observation suggests a similar trend with IMC patients. Therefore, we sought to define the impact of early introduction of SIT, number of SIT infusions, and the duration of steroids on the clinical outcomes of IMC, aiming to contribute to the body of evidence for the upcoming IMC treatment guidelines.

### Medical management of severe ulcerative colitis [^117UrVvc]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The medical management of patients with severe ulcerative colitis requires initial stabilization, careful and repeated evaluations to exclude confounding or coexisting diagnoses, and timely delivery of appropriate medications. Medical therapies for these patients are potent but may be toxic, and administration must be done by experienced medical professionals, with adequate access to appropriate laboratory, radiographic, endoscopic, and surgical facilities. Patients who fail to respond to high-dose intravenous corticosteroids in a timely basis should be evaluated for cyclosporin therapy, or proceed to surgery. The promise of newer, investigational therapies to induce and maintain remission must be borne out by large controlled trials.

Ulcerative colitis — systemic corticosteroids for induction states that for patients with UC who fail to respond to appropriate doses of oral 5-ASA therapy, oral corticosteroids can be used to achieve remission, with a meta-analysis showing corticosteroids more effective than placebo for induction of remission (RR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.45–0.93). Typical starting doses of oral prednisone are 40–60 mg daily, usually in a single dose, with clinical response expected within 5–7 days of treatment, and there were no observed differences when starting at doses higher than 60 mg/d.

### Hydrocortisone acetate (Cortifoam) [^116Z4WVg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The usual dose is one applicatorful once or twice daily for two or three weeks, and every second day thereafter, administered rectally. Directions for use, below and on the carton, describe how to use the aerosol container and applicator. Satisfactory response usually occurs within five to seven days marked by a decrease in symptoms. Symptomatic improvement in ulcerative proctitis should not be used as the sole criterion for evaluating efficacy. Sigmoidoscopy is also recommended to judge dosage adjustment, duration of therapy, and rate of improvement.

It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1124wvxT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) — intravenous corticosteroids (IVCs): Systemic IVCs are the mainstay of treatment; an open-label series administering prednisolone 60 mg per day to 49 hospitalized patients found at 5 days that 73% were in remission and 18% had no improvement or worsening, and on long-term follow-up 47% maintained clinical status and 18% required subsequent surgery; a systematic review of 32 studies including 1,948 adults reported a mean response rate of 67% and colectomy in 27% during index hospitalization; meta-regression showed no benefit to doses higher than 60 mg of methylprednisolone; IVCs can be given as single, divided, or continuous drip with no difference in efficacy; response is usually apparent within 3–5 days and additional response after 7 days is unlikely, so prolonged IVCs beyond this without rescue therapy cannot be recommended.

### Risk factors and long-term outcome of disease extent progression in Asian patients with ulcerative colitis: a retrospective cohort study [^115iw5RW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study has the largest sample size to present disease extent progression in Asian patients with UC. We have shown that in a Chinese cohort of UC cases, one in six UC patients experienced E1 to E2/E3 or E2 to E3 disease extension, and one in four patients with limited UC experienced disease extension to extensive colitis, after 7.5 years of follow-up. Only disease extent at diagnosis was identified as a clinical predictor for disease extension. Progression to extensive colitis resulted in a increased therapeutic requirements.

According to a recent retrospective study aiming to evaluate the natural disease course between pancolitis and non-pancolitis E3, pancolitis was associated with higher probabilities of cumulative relapse or hospitalization. In the present study, we further classified E3 lesion based on hepatic flexure as well and found that, of patients diagnosed with E3, patients with pancolitis were associated with increased treatment requirements. Specifically, 38(33.3%) initiated steroids and 14(12.3%) initiated immunosuppressive agents in the 114 patients with pancolitis during the follow-up, whereas 16 (26.7%) initiated steroids and 6(10%) initiated immunosuppressive agents in the 60 patients with non-pancolitis E3.

Previous estimates of disease extension have varied between one-fifth to one-third of patients with E1 or E2 showed disease extension to E3. According to a recent meta-analysis, approximately one quarter of patients with limited UC demonstrated disease extension over time with most extension occurring during the first 10 years. Disease extension may occur anytime after initial diagnosis with 31.1% within the first decade. In our study, 91 (17.6%) had disease extension during a median follow-up of 7.5 years. The median time for any progression of disease extent was 16.1 months (IQR: 8.3–42.2 months). The cumulative rate of disease extension was 9.9, 14.9, 19.6, 24.6 and 30.5% at 1–5 year post-diagnosis, which was comparable to that of previous studies.

### Methylprednisolone (Medrol) [^115eMZCu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.

Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (eg, patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (eg, dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the offsteroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

### Review of the disease course among adult ulcerative colitis population-based longitudinal cohorts [^111UcsGM]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) has a large impact on patients' lives. Clinical course studies of population-based cohorts contribute to our understanding of the disease as it progresses. We reviewed the clinical course of UC as reported in adult population-based longitudinal cohort studies.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search to identify all adult population-based studies published up to June 2010 with data on the clinical course of UC was performed. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed.

Results

Twenty-two studies reporting data from seven prospective longitudinal cohorts were identified. Extension from initial location varied from 10%-19% of the patients after 5 years of disease and from 11%-28% after 10 years in two of the cohorts. Disease activity appeared to improve over the disease course. The majority of patients had relapses in the first years of disease. The cumulative relapse rate varied from 67%-83% after 10 years of disease. From 1962–2004 a decreasing trend in the proportion of colectomies was observed. Most colectomies were performed during the first 2 years of disease and in patients with pancolitis. Salycilates were the most consumed medication followed by systemic steroids, immunosuppressors, and antitumor necrosis factors, with the latter two showing a substantial increased intake over time. Mortality increased with disease duration.

Conclusions

This review shows how the clinical course of UC has changed over time and alerts to the need for more prospective cohort studies to evaluate long-term outcomes especially to study the impact of biologic agents on UC.

### Remission and relapse of autoimmune pancreatitis: focusing on corticosteroid treatment [^115SoovZ]. Pancreas (2010). Low credibility.

Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a type of chronic pancreatitis characterized by swelling of the pancreas, narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, elevation of serum immunoglobulin G or G4 level or presence of several autoantibodies, or lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis in the pancreas. However, the pathogenesis of AIP remains unclear, and the natural history and long-term prognosis of AIP are little known. Oral corticosteroid therapy for AIP is recommended. The absolute indications for steroid therapy for AIP are bile duct stenosis and accompanying systemic disease such as retroperitoneal fibrosis and diabetes mellitus. The dosage for remission induction is 30 to 40 mg/d for 1 to 2 months. The remission maintenance is needed to prevent relapse, and 5 to 10 mg/d for at least 6 months is recommended in patients who do not have complete remission. When relapse occurs, the dose used at remission induction can be readministered. Herein, we discuss remission and relapse of AIP, focusing on corticosteroid treatment to help clinicians care for patients with AIP and to help make an ideal treatment protocol of AIP through a review of published data. We tried to define remission and relapse of AIP to help investigate the natural course of AIP.

Corticosteroid use — fracture risk, dose thresholds, and timing: Different studies report that 30%–50% of patients receiving corticosteroids develop fractures, and long-term therapy is associated with a 30%–50% increase in fracture risk. Low doses are implicated, as doses equivalent to prednisone 3–10 mg a day are associated with escalated fracture risk, with dose–response thresholds where doses of prednisone over 7.5 mg a day confer a fivefold higher risk of spine and hip fractures and doses as low as 2.5 mg a day are associated with a 1.55-fold risk of spinal fractures. Temporal dynamics include early harm noted to occur 3–6 months after initiation and improvement after cessation, decreased in frequency as early as 3 months after discontinuation with risk that returns to baseline within 1–2 years. Recent exposure parameters show that corticosteroid use within the past 12 months with treatment duration longer than 90 days was associated with decreased femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) and increased major fractures (5.4% vs 7.7%, RR, 1.25, 95% CI 1.07–1.45; P = 0.004) and hip fractures (1.1% vs 1.8% RR, 1.61, 95% CI 1.18–2.20; P = 0.003) independent of BMD values.

5.2.8.1 Overuse of corticosteroids

Statement 98. We recommend that prolonged corticosteroid therapy is harmful and should be minimised by specialist intervention and involvement with the multidisciplinary team to explore other treatment options (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Corticosteroids are effective agents at inducing clinical remission, but do not have a role in preventing relapse. Steroid dependency is generally defined as an inability to wean below 10 mg of prednisolone or 3 mg of budesonide within 3 months of starting, or disease flare within 3 months of stopping steroids; steroid refractory disease is active disease despite taking up to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisolone for 4 weeks. Steroid excess is considered to be two or more courses of steroid over 1 year. A recent audit found that 14.9% of IBD patients had steroid dependency or excess in the UK, more commonly in UC than Crohn's disease. Prolonged steroid use (often defined as continuous therapy for more than 3 months) is associated with numerous side effects including increased infection risk, osteoporosis, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, diabetes, weight gain and cardiovascular disease. There is evidence of increased mortality in IBD patients on long-term steroids, with a study in USA Medicare and Medicaid patients showing that prolonged steroid use (more than 3000 mg prednisolone equivalent in 1 year) carries greater mortality (significant for Crohn's, non-significant for UC) compared with patients starting anti-TNF therapy, with data from the TREAT registry also showing that prednisolone use was an independent risk factor for mortality. In an audit excessive steroid use was avoidable in nearly half of patients, was more likely to be avoided if patients attended a dedicated IBD clinic, and if there was a local multidisciplinary IBD team. Steroid use in the previous year is an important disutility included in the ICHOM dataset, and documenting assessment of alternative therapies and discussion with the patient is important for all patients on long-term steroids.

### Do we know how to use corticosteroids in acute severe ulcerative colitis? [^113BG8NG]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Options for the treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis have broadened with the use of ciclosporin and infliximab, but corticosteroids remain first-line treatment. However, an optimum regimen for drug, dose and duration has not been established in the 57years since Truelove and Witts first reported their value. In the absence of evidenced-based guidance this study sought to discover how gastroenterology units in the UK manage patients with acute severe colitis. In January 2010 a questionnaire was sent to all members of the inflammatory bowel disease section of the British Society of Gastroenterology enquiring about their use of corticosteroids in a typical patient with acute severe colitis. One hundred and two responses were obtained, representing more than 50% of the UK gastroenterology units. No consensus, and a wide variation in practice was found between these units. Over 70% of responders initially treat patients with intravenous hydrocortisone (400mg/day), although some units prefer methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. On transfer to oral treatment, all units use prednisolone, most starting with 40mg/day. There are no agreed national or international guidelines on the reducing regimen or duration of oral treatment-the area of greatest variation in our survey. Most units reduce prednisolone by 5mg/week, but because of variations in the timing and magnitude of dose reduction, total exposure to prednisolone varies by 2.6-fold. To minimise harm from undertreatment or overtreatment of acute severe colitis a controlled study of prednisolone dose and duration is needed.

### Length of hospital stay and associated hospital costs with infliximab versus cyclosporine in severe ulcerative colitis [^114F8gAX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclosporine and infliximab (IFX) seem equally effective as rescue therapy in hospitalized patients with severe ulcerative colitis (UC), although associated hospital stay and costs may differ.

Aim

The aim of this study was to compare the duration of hospital stay and associated costs from initiation of rescue therapy to time of discharge in hospitalized patients with corticosteroid-refractory UC receiving cyclosporine or IFX. Colectomy rates after 6 months were used as the outcome parameter for treatment success.

Patients and Methods

Hospital records of patients admitted between November 2003 and August 2012 at a tertiary referral center were analyzed.

Results

Forty-two patients were included (cyclosporine group: 26 patients; IFX group: 16 patients). Patient characteristics were comparable, with the exception that cyclosporine-treated patients more often had a pancolitis (89 vs. 63%, P = 0.046). The median length of hospital stay was 11.0 (interquartile range 7.75–13.25) versus 4.0 days (interquartile range 4.0–5.75) in the cyclosporine and IFX group (P < 0.01), respectively. The mean in-hospital costs were significantly higher in the cyclosporine-treated versus IFX-treated patients (6121 vs. 4853 euros, P < 0.05), whereas the total costs up to 3 months after initiation of rescue therapy were significantly higher in the IFX group (6787 vs. 9983 euros, P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in colectomy rates at 6 months (23 and 31% for cyclosporine and IFX, P = 0.50). More side-effects were observed during treatment with cyclosporine.

Conclusion

Length of hospital stay and in-hospital costs have been reduced significantly since the introduction of IFX as rescue therapy for severe UC instead of cyclosporine. However, the total treatment costs are higher in IFX-treated patients.

3.12.1 Corticosteroid therapy for ASUC

Statement 17. We recommend that patients with ASUC should be treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone 60 mg daily or hydrocortisone 100 mg 6-hourly (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence) and should receive prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Intravenous corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone 100 mg four times daily or methylprednisolone 60 mg every 24 hours are the cornerstone of treatment of ASUC. Methylprednisolone has less mineralocorticoid effect than hydrocortisone at these doses and so causes significantly less hypokalaemia. There is no real advantage from giving higher doses and a bolus injection is as effective as a continuous infusion. Although a meta-regression analysis failed to show a relationship between dose and colectomy rate above the equivalent of 60 mg methylprednisolone,400 mg hydrocortisone is equivalent to 80 mg methylprednisolone. In children and adolescents, a dose of 1–1.5 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 60 mg is recommended.

In the landmark study by Truelove and Witts, oral cortisone 100 mg daily was given to 213 patients with acute flares of varying severity. Clinical remission was achieved in 41% of steroid treated patients versus 16% on placebo. In a subsequent study, 49 patients with severe UC were treated with intravenous prednisolone 21-phosphate and a clinical remission rate of 73% was noted 5 days after treatment. Definitions and terms differed widely in these studies compared with outcome measures in use today. A systematic review of 32 trials of steroid therapy for ASUC involving 1991 patients reported an overall response to steroids of 67%, with 29% (95% CI 28% to 31%) having colectomy. Mortality was 1% (n = 22/1991; 95% CI 0.7% to 1.6%) and none of these outcomes changed between 1974 and 2006 (R 2 = 0.07, p = 0.8). In the CONSTRUCT cohort, after excluding those with infections or alternative diagnoses, response rate to intravenous steroids was 49%. Extending therapy beyond 7–10 days carries no additional benefit and increases toxicity. Patients should be assessed for a clinical and biochemical response after 3 days of intravenous steroid therapy to determine the need for salvage medical or surgical therapy.

More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high-dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, which is usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible, particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.
Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to alternate day therapy and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process, reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of alternate day therapy, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on alternate day therapy may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using alternate day therapy, it is important, as in all therapeutic situations, to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of alternate day therapy will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established, alternate day therapy may be reinstituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by alternate day therapy, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

AGA chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis — corticosteroids context: Improvement in symptoms of pouchitis is noted as a potential benefit of corticosteroids used as interim therapy to bridge to more advanced immunosuppressive therapies, but these benefits should be weighed against potential harms associated with repeated and/or prolonged courses of corticosteroid therapy, especially with systemic corticosteroids; evidence for efficacy is limited, with only 2 reported case series with 30 patients, and when initiating corticosteroids, careful discussion and planning for steroid-sparing therapy should be initiated because use of, and responsiveness to, corticosteroids is not mandatory before switching to advanced immunosuppressive therapies in patients with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis with objective evidence of inflammation.

### Optimization of conventional therapy in patients with IBD [^116xoKGc]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with IBD use conventional therapy (namely, aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents) for prolonged periods of time, to both induce and maintain remission. Treatment paradigms in IBD have evolved towards a rapid escalation of therapy to achieve stringent goals, including mucosal healing and a reduction in the need for hospital admission and surgery. In this context, the failure to optimize conventional therapy can lead to a potentially effective treatment being abandoned too early, which is undesirable when only a limited number of drugs are effective in the management of IBD, and could also lead to patients being unnecessarily exposed to potentially toxic and/or expensive biologic drugs. This Review provides an overview of the many ways in which conventional therapy can be optimized, and describes strategies to improve adherence to drug regimens, such as simplifying the dosing regimen, optimizing drug delivery and dose, and tailoring medication on the basis of metabolite levels.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^112jWCgx]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids

The majority of patients with moderate-to-severe UC achieve remission on treatment with oral steroids. However, steroid treatment is not advised for maintenance of remission. The dose of prednisone/prednisolone should be 1 mg/kg up to 40 mg once daily in most children. A single total dose in the morning is advisable to reduce potential harmful suppression of growth. There are no universally accepted steroid-tapering protocols, but the ECCO paediatric UC guideline provides a practical 10-week reduction scheme (table 3). Steroid dependency is defined as response or remission with corticosteroid treatment, but recurrence of symptoms when the dose is lowered or within 3 months following complete taper, or if steroids cannot be stopped within 14–16 weeks. Children with severe UC will need intravenous steroid treatment (see below). Steroid dependency can be avoided by escalating maintenance therapy. For distal disease, this typically means a 5-ASA rather than steroid enema, whereas for more extensive colitis, oral beclomethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid with topical action, can be considered.

### Clinical outcomes of patients with corticosteroid refractory immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced enterocolitis treated with infliximab [^115onnL1]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Given that CPI-induced enterocolitis is the most common cause of CPI treatment interruption, permanent discontinuation and treatment‐related death, it is important to define optimal management strategies. Gastroenterologyand Oncology societal guidancerecommend institution of corticosteroids as first-line anti-inflammatory therapy. In corticosteroid refractory disease, which occurs in over a third of patients, infliximab (IFX), an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody, is recommended. These guidelines are predominantly based on expert opinion, and to date, there is a paucity of data informing the appropriate institution of second-line therapies such as IFX. In a recent meta-analysis evaluating anti-inflammatory therapies in CPI-induced enterocolitis, data pooled from 17 studies across 333 patientsfound that IFX was effective in 81% (95% CI 73% to 87%). There was evidence that timely initiation of IFX within 10 days of onset of symptoms led to significantly fewer hospitalizations, fewer corticosteroid taper failures, shorter courses of corticosteroid treatment and shorter duration of symptoms. However, a key limitation of existing studies is a lack of standardization in how treatment response is defined, with the majority using 'soft' endpoints such as improvement to CTCAE grade 1 or less, or 'symptom improvement', and short or undefined follow-up periods. In conventional inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is recognized that harder endpoints such as clinical remission and corticosteroid-free remission are more reliable predictors of mucosal healing and sustained remission. Taken altogether, robust outcome data including longer follow-up would be welcome in advancing understanding of optimal therapeutic strategies for CPI-induced enterocolitis.

### Prognosis of patients with ulcerative colitis in sustained remission after thiopurines withdrawal [^111PFveh]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The ideal length of treatment with thiopurines in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in sustained remission remains unknown. It is widely accepted that the drug withdrawal is associated with a worse outcome. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome after this withdrawal and to identify predictors of relapse.

Methods

A multicenter and retrospective study was designed. A total of 102 patients with UC who discontinued thiopurines in a situation of sustained remission were included. All the patients were followed up until last revision or until relapse (understood as the occurrence of signs and symptoms of UC that required a rescue treatment).

Results

After thiopurines withdrawal, overall relapse was recorded in 32.35% of the patients: 18.88% in the first year, 36.48% in the third, and 43.04% in the fifth year after withdrawal. On multivariate analysis, predictors of relapse were the time from diagnosis of UC until the starting of thiopurines (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.02; P = 0.039), the number of relapses before the withdrawal (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.01–1.66; P = 0.029), pancolitis (HR, 5.01; 95% CI, 1.95–26.43; P = 0.028), the duration of treatment with thiopurines (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03–0.66; P = 0.013) and the situation of biological remission at withdrawal (HR, 0.004; 95% CI, 0.0001–0.14; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

The withdrawal of thiopurines in patients with UC, although in sustained remission, is related to a high relapse rate. Clinical variables such as the extent of the disease, the duration of treatment or time from diagnosis to the start of thiopurines should be considered before stopping these drugs.

### Everything old is new again? A fresh look at corticosteroids in ulcerative colitis [^114digAa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid therapy remains a mainstay in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. While useful in the induction of remission, corticosteroids should be avoided for maintenance therapy because of lack of efficacy and serious short- and long-term side effects. Bone fracture risk is increased with as little as 3 months of therapy so that safer corticosteroid therapies would have a significant impact. In this issue of American Journal of Gastroenterology, the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis with dexamethasone 21-P encapsulated erthryocytes (DEE), a novel method of corticosteroid drug delivery, is described. The results suggest similar efficacy as conventional oral corticosteroids with significantly decreased short-term corticosteroid-related side effects. This study was small and follow-up was limited, but the findings are intriguing. These results should prompt further study of this method of drug delivery to confirm efficacy, assess short-term and possibly long-term side effect, and determine whether this translates into better overall safety.

### Six-week oral prednisolone therapy for immune-related pneumonitis: a single-arm phase II study [^113vntFt]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, the treatment approach of irP depends on each physician, and thus, the dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy can vary widely among patients. For example, a retrospective cohort study in the United States and Australia reported that patients with irP received a median prednisone dose of 50 mg (range, 20–80 mg) for a median duration of 68 days (range, 20–154 days). Our retrospective cohort study in Japan reported a median prednisolone dose of 30 mg (range, 20–60 mg) and a median duration of 91 days (IQR, 49.5–180.5 days) for treating irP. Insufficient corticosteroid therapy has potential risk of treatment failure. Conversely, an overlong duration of corticosteroid therapy is potentially harmful by increasing adverse events and interruption of subsequent cancer treatment. Elucidation of optimal corticosteroid therapy for irP in a prospective clinical trial is needed.

We hypothesized that high-dose corticosteroid therapy, tapered over fixed duration, would be efficacious of irP. The aim of this single-arm phase 2 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 6-week tapering schedule of prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for patients with cancer with irP.

### Relapse rate and predictors of relapse after cessation of glucocorticoid maintenance therapy in type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis: a multicenter retrospective study [^112x1WGc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although type 1 AIP responds well to glucocorticoids, with the possibility of a high remission rate, complete consensus has not been reached on the duration of maintenance therapy, timing of glucocorticoid cessation, and causes of the high relapse rate after cessation. In this study of 94 patients with type 1 AIP on glucocorticoid maintenance therapy for at least 6 months, with a median follow-up period of 42 months, the relapse rate after glucocorticoid cessation was 45.7%. The cumulative relapse rates were also high. Similar to this study, a study by a South Korean research team, whose protocol included a short 6-month maintenance therapy period, reported a cumulative relapse rate of 10.9% at 1 year, 37.2% at 3 years, 44.8% at 5 years, 61.9% at 7 years, and a plateau of 70.2% at 8 years, after the initiation of treatment. In contrast, studies from two centers from the United States and Europe, where maintenance therapy were not included in their protocols, reported that > 50% of cases relapsed 3 months after glucocorticoid cessation. Although direct comparisons are difficult due to differences in the definition of relapse and number of cases, the findings suggest that glucocorticoid maintenance therapy, administered over a certain period of time, may be useful in curbing short-term relapses after cessation.

Dosing of corticosteroids for severe CAP — the 2017 SCCM/ESICM guideline recommended corticosteroids for 5–7 days at a daily dose < 400 mg IV hydrocortisone or equivalent, and the updated recommendation recognizes that multiple dosing strategies are acceptable for severe CAP and likely related to clinician discretion. Typical doses range from 40 to 80 mg/d IV methylprednisolone equivalent for a duration of 5–7 days, with one study including a prolonged taper over 20 days, and one guided by clinical criteria for 8 or 14 days; current evidence did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid duration and showed a possible subgroup interaction on mortality based on corticosteroid molecule.

4.4 Maintenance treatment in ileocolonic Crohn's disease

Statement 38. We recommend that systemic or locally acting corticosteroids should be avoided as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease due to toxicity and lack of efficacy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Irrespective of whether remission is induced surgically or medically, corticosteroids are not effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease compared with placebo (see Section 5.2.8.1: Overuse of corticosteroids). Systematic reviews and pooled trial data show that budesonide does not reduce relapse rates over a 12-month period. One systematic review did show a modest reduction in CDAI scores, but this was outweighed by a significant increase in adverse events and adrenocortical suppression compared with the placebo groups.

4.4.1 Immunomodulator therapy

Statement 39. We recommend that for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease responding to prednisolone, early introduction of maintenance therapy with thiopurines (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) or methotrexate (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) should be considered to minimise risk of flare as prednisolone is withdrawn (Agreement: 93.3%).

Relapse of Crohn's disease is common on corticosteroid withdrawal, particularly in moderate to severe disease, and early initiation of corticosteroid-sparing therapy is appropriate. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine, mercaptopurine or methotrexate are effective in the maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease.

4.4.1.1 Thiopurine therapy

Statement 40. We recommend that azathioprine or mercaptopurine can be used as monotherapy in the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Thiopurines should not be used for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. Thiopurines are more effective than placebo in maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease but the Cochrane analysis reports low quality evidence (NNT = 9). A systematic review and network meta-analysis also showed the benefit of azathioprine/mercaptopurine compared with placebo in remission maintenance (OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.6)), although anti-TNF therapy was significantly more effective than thiopurines.

### Risk factors for rate of relapse and effects of steroid maintenance therapy in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11323aCK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Risk for relapse after induction of remission with steroid therapy has been studied extensively in patients with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), but findings have been equivocal. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relapse rate of AIP after initial remission after steroid treatment and to identify factors associated with relapse.

Methods

Three reviewers searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE until July 2018 to identify studies on rate of relapse of AIP after induction of remission with steroid therapy. A pooled estimate was calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird method for a random-effects model. This study was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Results

Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The median follow-up time was 40.8 months. Fifty-two percent of patients were classified as having type 1 AIP. The pooled estimate of relapse rate was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%). A higher proportion of patients with type 1 AIP had a relapse compared with patients with type 2 AIP (37.5% vs 15.9%; P < .001). We found significant heterogeneity among studies (P < .01). Long-term maintenance therapy with steroids and study quality were associated independently with AIP relapse, after we adjusted for year of publication by multivariate meta-regression.

Conclusions

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that a large proportion of patients with AIP treated successfully with steroid induction therapy had a relapse (33%)-particularly patients with type 1 AIP (37%). Maintenance steroid therapy lasting longer than 1 year could reduce risk of relapse. However, the data characterizing relapse rates are of limited quality, indicating the need for randomized controlled trials and new immunosuppressive drugs.

### Increased mortality rates with prolonged corticosteroid therapy when compared with antitumor necrosis factor-α-directed therapy for inflammatory bowel disease [^113Sf55z]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

All statistical analyses were completed separately for CD and UC using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Medication exposure was unidirectional time updating in the primary analysis, such that patients who initially contributed follow-up time to the prolonged CS use group could later contribute follow-up time to the anti-TNF group if they initiated therapy with an anti-TNF drug. Patients could not contribute follow-up time to the CS group once they met the anti-TNF exposure definition (Figure 1). This approach tests the hypothesis that a strategy of trying anti-TNF therapy is associated with higher or lower mortality risk even if the anti-TNF therapy is ineffective and is discontinued. Alternative approaches were used in sensitivity analyses described further below.

The association between treatment and the outcomes of interest was estimated using marginal structural models with stabilized weights from inverse probability of treatment derived from propensity score models and models estimating the probability of being censored. Separate models were estimated for treatment at index date and for each subsequent 28 days of follow-up time. From the 57 covariates that were a priori selected as potential confounders, we excluded variables from the treatment and censoring models if any cell count for any model was < 10. The other covariates, 36 baseline and 46 time varying for CD and 25 baseline and 39 time varying for UC, were included in the treatment and censoring models (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Patients with very high or low probability of treatment with either CS or anti-TNF at cohort entry were excluded to improve balance in covariates. Specifically, we excluded those with a baseline propensity score for CS treatment > 0.98 for both CD (10.0%) and UC (19.8%) and < 0.30 (1.8%) for CD and < 0.40 (1.5%) for UC. Weights were truncated at the 2nd and 98th percentile to avoid excessive influence of patients with extremely low or high probability of receiving one of the treatments. Inverse probability treatment weights derived from the baseline model were used to estimate the balance of covariates between the treatment groups after applying the weights. Balance was assessed using standardized mean differences between the groups; standardized mean differences > 0.1 are considered to reflect meaningful imbalance. The same weights were applied to the numerator and denominator of computed incidence rates. The inverse probability treatment weights were applied to logistic regression models to compute weighted, pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) that approximate hazard ratios derived from Cox regression. Similar models were developed for the secondary outcomes. See Supplementary Methods for additional details.

### Prednisone (Deltasone) [^111rQiHE]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of alternate day therapy should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113Ueo4a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### RISE-MX, a real-world study of patients with moderate / severe inflammatory bowel disease returning for hospital follow-up in Mexico: baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, treatment and disease status [^116yRNVy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

For the medical treatment of UC, the First Latin American Consensus of PANCCO recommends a step-up approach. Mild/moderate cases are initially managed with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. The concomitant use of azathioprine works as a corticosteroid sparing agent. In moderate/severe UC, biologic therapies are recommended to induce and maintain remission in patients who do not respond to conventional treatments irrespective of whether the patient is dependent or refractory to corticosteroids. On the other hand, for CD, the treatment strategy is planned according to phenotype and risk factors. Mild/moderate cases are initially managed with corticosteroids as induction therapy. In patients with moderate/severe CD who do not respond to initial treatment, immunomodulators such as azathioprine and methotrexate are considered. Biologic therapies play an important role in inducing and maintaining remission in refractory or severe CD. In both UC and CD, treatment decisions are individualized based on disease severity, patient characteristics, and response to previous therapies. Regular monitoring and close follow-up are essential to assess treatment efficacy and adjust the therapeutic approach as needed, to achieve and maintain remission, improve the quality of life, and prevent disease complications and long-term adverse effects. The AGA guide for medical management in CD suggests the early use of biologic therapy with or without an immunomodulator rather than delaying their use until after the failure of 5-ASA. Indeed, systematic reviews showed no convincing benefits of 5-ASA over placebo either in the induction of remission or in the maintenance of medically induced remission in CD. In Mexico, clinical recommendations allow the use of 5-ASA for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission just for mild UC patients, and recently for mild CD patients. Our results showed that 5-ASA has been used in a great part of CD patients in Mexico, highlighting that treatment could be improved in this population as guidelines suggest. These statements are important to consider when making decisions relating to the clinical management of patients with CD to help optimize treatment outcomes and decrease disease burden.

### Increased mortality rates with prolonged corticosteroid therapy when compared with antitumor necrosis factor-α-directed therapy for inflammatory bowel disease [^114eykFG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

An additional model with all-cause mortality as the outcome censored all patients when they experienced any secondary outcome event to determine whether these events explained the association between treatment and all-cause mortality. Additional analyses examined for an interaction between treatment and age, treatment and comorbidities, and treatment and insurance type (the latter only in CD). Sensitivity analyses, also using marginal structural models, were conducted to assess the impact of the exposure definition on the observed associations. These included: (i) censoring follow-up for anti-TNF-treated patients who discontinued therapy and resumed treatment with CS; (ii) allowing patients to switch bidirectionally between the treatment arms, contributing follow-up time to the treatment that they had most recently received; and (iii) using the initial treatment to define the exposure category regardless of whether the patient changed treatment, adjusted for baseline covariates and with follow-up censored at 1 year. An additional sensitivity analysis considered only those patients who received at least 3 dispensings of infliximab or 2 dispensings of adalimumab or certolizumab pegol within the first 56 days of follow-up (referred to as having received an induction course) and compared these patients with prolonged CS users with follow-up starting at day 57 for both groups so as to avoid immortal time bias. Additional sensitivity analyses adjusted for the average daily dose of prednisone used in the 12 months before the index date and used a lower threshold, 2,000 mg of traditional CS, to define prolonged CS use (see Supplementary Methods for additional details).

Ethical considerations and patient involvement

The study was approved by the institutional review boards at University of Pennsylvania and University of Alabama at Birmingham. The study question was proposed and the study was designed, including the choice of outcome measures, and implemented by the investigators. Patient stakeholders provided feedback on the study design. Results of the study will be made available to the general population through the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) website.

Treatment regimens

A wide variety of steroid regimens were employed for induction and maintenance of remission. For the initial dose of steroids, all centres used either a weight-based strategy (0.6 mg/kg/day of prednisolone) or fixed-dose regimen (30–40 mg/day) that were roughly equivalent for treatment of a 70 kg individual. Tapering strategies ranged from 5–10 mg decrease every 1–2 weeks. All Asian centres (n = 10) used a maintenance strategy of low-dose (2.5–5 mg/day) prednisolone, which was continued for anywhere from 6 months to 3 years. In general, the European and North American groups tapered the steroids off within 3 months and did not provide maintenance doses of steroids. Multiple centres elected to use immunomodulator drugs instead of low-dose steroids for maintenance therapy (n = 5). In the four centres treating more than five subjects with this strategy, azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) was the preferred agent and was used for a variable duration of time (1–3 years).

Many patients initially underwent surgery either due to the absence of typical features of AIP or clinical presentation prior to the recognition of AIP as a disease entity. Surgeries were performed for resection of mass-forming lesions (ie, pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal splenectomy) or palliative bypass (ie, gastrojejunostomy) for those with an apparently unresectable cancer. Surgery was not intentionally performed as primary treatment for AIP. A number of patients were treated conservatively, without the use of steroids or surgery. Supportive care was provided for a variety of reasons including asymptomatic disease, severe comorbid disease (eg, metastatic cancer) or patient preference.

Statistical analyses

Continuous variables were compared using Student t test, χ 2 test and Fisher's exact t test (when one or more expected cell frequencies were < 5) were used for comparison of proportions. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Regarding medical management for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, tapering, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to follow an individualized corticosteroid tapering schedule, predicated to regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events. Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

3.9.1 Thiopurines

While studies vary in quality, meta-analyses consistently report a benefit of thiopurines over placebo for the maintenance of steroid-induced remission in UC but not for induction of remission. Meta-analysis of three randomised controlled thiopurine maintenance studies favours thiopurines over placebo (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.95). In a further meta-analysis, OR was 2.59 (95% CI 1.26 to 5.3), absolute risk reduction was 23% and the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent one recurrence was five. A recent Cochrane review included 232 patients from four maintenance studies of azathioprine versus placebo and showed a benefit of azathioprine over placebo (44% vs 65% failure, respectively, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86). The side effects of thiopurines, both short- and long-term, should be considered (see Section 5.2.2 on Drug management: thiopurines) in choice of therapy, and also in decisions about duration of therapy, particularly in older patients (see Section 5.2.7.1 Stopping thiopurines).

### Algorithm development for corticosteroid management in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis trial using consensus methodology [^1122XZUk]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The management of background corticosteroid therapy in rheumatology clinical trials poses a major challenge. We describe the consensus methodology used to design an algorithm to standardize changes in corticosteroid dosing during the Randomized Placebo Phase Study of Rilonacept in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Trial (RAPPORT).

Methods

The 20 RAPPORT site principal investigators (PIs) and 4 topic specialists constituted an expert panel that participated in the consensus process. The panel used a modified Delphi Method consisting of an on-line questionnaire, followed by a one day face-to-face consensus conference. Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% agreement. For items deemed essential but when consensus on critical values was not achieved, simple majority vote drove the final decision.

Results

The panel identified criteria for initiating or increasing corticosteroids. These included the presence or development of anemia, myocarditis, pericarditis, pleuritis, peritonitis, and either complete or incomplete macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). The panel also identified criteria for tapering corticosteroids which included absence of fever for ≥ 3days in the previous week, absence of poor physical functioning, and seven laboratory criteria. A tapering schedule was also defined.

Conclusion

The expert panel established consensus regarding corticosteroid management and an algorithm for steroid dosing that was well accepted and used by RAPPORT investigators. Developed specifically for the RAPPORT trial, further study of the algorithm is needed before recommendation for more general clinical use.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^117AwM9y]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

GI toxicities — colitis management for grade 2 diarrhea includes holding ICI, corticosteroids with taper, consideration of biologics, endoscopic evaluation, and criteria for resuming therapy. G2 (increase of 4–6 stools per day over baseline) management states: Hold ICI at least until recovery to G1, consider consult with gastroenterology for ≥ G2, and administer corticosteroids starting with initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent until symptoms improve to G1, then taper over 4–6 weeks. Consider adding anti-TNF (infliximab) or anti-integrin (vedolizumab) for corticosteroid-refractory disease (ie, no decrease by one grade in 72 hours) or dependent or with high-risk endoscopic features. When symptoms improve to ≤ G1, taper corticosteroids over 4–6 weeks; endoscopic evaluation with EGD or colonoscopy is highly recommended for cases grade ≥ 2. Resuming ICI therapy after symptoms improve to ≤ G1 may be considered when steroid taper is completed and/or if endoscopic and histologic remissions are achieved; fecal calprotectin ≤ 116 μg/g may be considered as a surrogate. Resuming PD-1/PD-L1 agent is associated with lower risk of flare-up; however, CTLA-4 inhibitor can still be considered in selected cases.

### Risk factors and long-term outcome of disease extent progression in Asian patients with ulcerative colitis: a retrospective cohort study [^113t6ASt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of Ulcerative colitis (UC) in Asia is increasing but reports on its long-term course are few. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors predictive of extent progression in Asian patients with UC and to evaluate the clinical outcome by longitudinal follow-up.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 518 UC patients without ascending colon involvement at diagnosis who were regularly followed and underwent colonoscopy between 2003 and 2016 in an Asian tertiary referral center. Proximal disease extension and associated risk factors were analyzed.

Results

A total of 91 (17.6%) patients experienced proximal disease extension followed for a median period of 7.5 years. The median time for extent extension was 16.1 months (interquartile range (IQR) 8.3–42.2). The cumulative rate of disease extension was 9.9, 14.9, 19.6, 24.6 and 30.5% at 1,2,3,4 and 5 years after diagnosis. 43 (12.0%) patients with E1/E2 progressed to E3, and 40 (21.9%) with E1 progressed to E2. Of patients diagnosed with E3 involvement limited to the hepatic flexure distally, 8 (13.3%) progressed to pancolitis. Cox regression analysis found that disease extent at diagnosis was the sole predictor of disease extension (odds ratio (OR),1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18–2.57, p = 0.01). Proximal disease extension was associated with disease relapse (p = 0.03) and increased use of steroids and immunosuppressive agents (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

UC is a dynamic disease and that the disease extension in Asians was comparable to that in Caucasians. Proximal disease extension increased the risk of disease flare and treatment intensification.

4.4.3.6 Choice of biological therapy after anti-TNF failure

Statement 48. We suggest that, where a switch from anti-TNF therapy to a different drug class is required in Crohn's disease, the choice to use vedolizumab or ustekinumab may be made on an individual basis. Factors to be included in the decision-making process should include patient preference, cost, likely adherence, safety data and speed of response to the drug. The potential for surgery as an alternative to further drug therapy should also be considered (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

To date there are no head-to-head studies comparing ustekinumab and vedolizumab in patients with IBD who have failed anti-TNF therapy, but indirect comparisons suggest no difference in efficacy in this relatively treatment-refractory group.

A consistent theme across multiple clinical trials in Crohn's disease is that response rates are generally lower in patients with a longer disease duration, or who have proven refractory to other therapies. Given the reduced likelihood of response to therapies in patients who have medically refractory but surgically tractable disease (eg, limited ileocaecal inflammation), surgical approaches should be actively considered to restore quality of life and reduce the risk of complications resulting either from prolonged uncontrolled inflammation or from the use of multiple drug therapies often interspersed with multiple courses of corticosteroid therapy.

4.2.1 Budesonide in ileocaecal Crohn's disease

Statement 32. We recommend that mild to moderate ileocaecal Crohn's disease can be treated with ileal-release budesonide 9 mg once daily for 8 weeks to induce remission (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In a randomised double-blind trial, ileal-release budesonide 9 mg once daily for 8 weeks was as effective as prednisolone (40 mg daily tapering to 5 mg at 8 weeks) at inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ileocaecal Crohn's disease with treatment efficacy (CDAI score < 150) of 51% on budesonide at 8 weeks compared with 52.5% for prednisolone, and significantly fewer side effects. Multiple meta-analyses have also demonstrated the efficacy of budesonide 9 mg/day over placebo in inducing remission. A once-daily 9 mg dose is as effective as 3 mg three times daily. In the context of more severe disease (CDAI > 300) budesonide is inferior to prednisolone (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). When remission has been achieved, budesonide should be tapered over 1–2 weeks.

4.2.2 Corticosteroids in colonic Crohn's disease

Statement 33. We recommend that active Crohn's colitis can be treated with an 8-week course of systemic corticosteroids to induce remission (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In mild, moderate and severe colonic Crohn's disease, systemic corticosteroids such as prednisolone are effective in inducing remission. A starting dose of 40 mg tapering by 5 mg weekly is often used, but should be tailored to disease severity and patient tolerance. Ileal-release budesonide does have benefit in Crohn's disease affecting the proximal colon, but there is no evidence of benefit in more distal colonic inflammation. There are no trials of colonic-release budesonide-MMX in Crohn's disease at present.

3.7.1 Failure of oral corticosteroids

There is variation in the definition of severe ulcerative colitis. The Mayo score or Disease Activity Indexdoes not include systemic symptoms (fever, anaemia or abnormal inflammatory markers), whereas the Truelove and Witts criteria for severe diseasespecify one or more of these. Patients with systemic symptoms of fever, severe pain, significant anaemia, or those who are generally unwell and not tolerating their symptoms should be admitted for inpatient management (see Section 3.12: on Acute severe ulcerative colitis). Prolonging treatment with high-dose oral corticosteroids has a diminishing chance of achieving remission, and of those who do respond, there will be many who become corticosteroid-dependent (22% at 1 year in a study from the pre-biologic era). There is however increasing risk of infective, metabolic and surgical complications for deteriorating patients who may require emergency admission and colectomy. There is no evidence from a meta-regression analysis that doses above 60 mg of methylprednisolone reduce colectomy rates in severe UC. Although there are few data on the time-course of response to oral corticosteroids, a study comparing oral prednisolone with prednisolone metasulphobenzoate showed that improvements in clinical and endoscopic disease activity may be seen within 2 weeks of treatment with oral prednisolone 40 mg/day, so patients not responding after 2 weeks should be considered for treatment escalation to biologics or admission to hospital, depending on how systemically unwell they are.

5.2.7.2 Stopping anti-TNF therapy

Statement 96. We suggest that anti-TNF therapy may be withdrawn in patients with prolonged corticosteroid-free remission and mucosal healing. Retreatment in the event of relapse is usually successful, but there is insufficient evidence about which clinical factors predict relapse after withdrawal and decisions should be individualised (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93.2%).

From studies assessing outcomes of stopping therapy after at least 12 months of anti-TNF therapy, the estimated relapse rate at 1 year was 39% for Crohn's and 35% for UC/IBD-U. The estimated relapse rates at 2 years were 54% for Crohn's disease and 42% for UC/IBD-U. Among patients relapsing and retreated with anti-TNF, the estimated chances of success were 88% for Crohn's disease and 76% for UC/IBD-U. Various models to predict chance of relapse have been proposed. The clinical factors associated with relapse, however, vary between studies. Younger age, smoking, longer disease duration, fistulising perianal Crohn's disease, anaemia, raised CRP and raised faecal calprotectin are linked with increased risk of relapse. Mucosal healing (and in some studies low serum drug levels) are associated with a lower risk of relapse. Patients receiving escalated dosages of anti-TNFs or for the indication of postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease had a > 75% risk of relapse on drug withdrawal. Persistent abnormalities on MRE in Crohn's disease patients in endoscopic remission also makes relapse more likely. Decisions regarding withdrawal should be taken in the context of the individual patient, their disease history and the consequences of relapse. Patient profiles favouring treatment withdrawal include: older patients without previous complications, surgery and with no evidence of active inflammation, those with comorbidities increasing their infection risk, those with undetectable trough drug levels and other practical reasons mitigating against continuing injections or infusions. There is no safe minimum period of corticosteroid-free remission, but at least 1–2 years seems reasonable. The concept of cyclical biologics use (stopping when deep remission is established and restarting in the event of pre-clinical relapse) has been introduced, but there is no evidence as yet that this is safe or cost-effective. All the published data so far come from prospective and retrospective cohort studies such as the STORI study. Data on outcomes after withdrawal of newer biologics are awaited.

### Duration of remission and long-term prognosis according to the extent of disease in patients with ulcerative colitis on continuous mesalamine treatment [^116qgF4m]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

To describe the long-term prognosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and to establish whether a correlation exists between the different anatomic locations of the disease and the risk of relapse in a homogeneous cohort of patients with UC in clinical remission, all treated with fixed doses of oral mesalamine from the date of enrollment to the appearance of the first relapse.

Method

We distinguished the patients with pancolitis and left-sided colitis from those with distal colitis. The follow-up lasted up to 5 and 6 years for the patients with pancolitis and left-sided colitis, respectively, and up to 9 years for the patients with distal colitis.

Results

One hundred and fifty patients satisfied the enrollment criteria. We registered 19 drop-outs. All the patients had relapsed within 9 years. In most cases relapses arose within 2–3 years. The patients with pancolitis had a shorter time to relapse (100% relapsed after 5 years) than the patients with left-sided colitis (100% after 6 years) or distal colitis (100% after 9 years). None of the enrolled patients developed a cancer. Extraintestinal complications were observed in 9% of cases and surgery was needed in five patients only.

Conclusion

The first 2–3 years after the enrollment of patients with UC in remission was the period at higher risk of relapse. No relationship was found between the different anatomic locations of the disease and the risk of relapse, even if distal colitis showed a slightly better course.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^1128HkQw]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA clinical practice guidelines — risk features and steroid use in mild–moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) note that certain disease features, even in patients who present initially with mild–moderate disease activity, may predict an aggressive disease course; these include age younger than 40 years at diagnosis, extensive disease, severe endoscopic activity (presence of deep ulcers), extra-intestinal manifestations, and elevated inflammatory markers. Clinicians should be aware of these high-risk features to identify patients who may benefit from more aggressive initial therapy or who might need more rapid intensification of therapy if symptoms are not adequately controlled. In addition, clinicians should avoid repeated courses of corticosteroids, even in those with mild–moderate disease, and consider escalation of therapy in patients who frequently need corticosteroids for disease control.

### Comparable efficacy of low-versus high-dose induction corticosteroid treatment in autoimmune pancreatitis [^111dQYy3]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare efficacy of high versus low doses of prednisone for induction of remission in autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP).

Methods

This is a retrospective, multicenter study including patients diagnosed with AIP between May 1992 and August 2011. Clinical, laboratory and imaging findings were assessed before treatment and at 1, 3, and 6 months after starting treatment.

Results

A total of 65 patients (57 males; median age, 63 years) were treated with an initial low dose (10–20 mg/d, n = 14), a medium dose (30 mg/d, n = 15), or a high dose (40–60 mg/d, n = 36) of prednisone. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment groups including age, presenting symptoms and laboratory results. During a follow-up period of 6 months, in nearly all patients, symptoms (jaundice, weight loss) resolved completely. After 6 months, treatment response with respect to symptomatic, radiological, and laboratory improvement was comparable for the different dosage groups.

Conclusions

Response to therapy was comparable for AIP patients treated with doses of prednisone in the range of 10 to 60 mg/d. A prospective trial should be conducted to confirm efficacy of lower-dose prednisone treatment.

Treatment algorithms

Treatment algorithms that feature the early use of vedolizumab are followed. A key premise is that the favourable safety profile of vedolizumab allows for its safe and effective use to treat patients who are in symptomatic remission but who have not attained endoscopic or histologic remission. Dose escalation of vedolizumab has been shown to help capture response in long-term and real-world studies. Patients are allocated to treatment algorithms according to their existing UC treatment regimen at screening (figures 2–4). Patients who are naïve to treatment at study entry (algorithm A; figure 2) initially receive a standard first-line therapy regimen comprising an oral 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) and/or immunosuppressive agent (ie, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate) in combination with an optional oral corticosteroid. Those receiving a non-biologic at study entry start intravenous vedolizumab therapy (algorithm B; figure 3), and those receiving a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α antagonist, tofacitinib or ustekinumab at study entry are switched to intravenous vedolizumab therapy (algorithm C; figure 4). Appropriate wash-out periods between biologic therapies were determined by the investigators according to their routine clinical practice. Treatment target achievement is assessed at weeks 16, 32 and 48 (figure 1). Corticosteroid-free is defined as not receiving oral corticosteroids at the time of treatment target assessment; any oral corticosteroids initiated at week 32 must be completely tapered at least 4 weeks before the week 48 assessment. Patients who achieve their assigned corticosteroid-free treatment target continue receiving the same treatment regimen. For patients who do not achieve their assigned treatment target due to the use of corticosteroids, these agents are tapered (see Concomitant therapies section for tapering regimen), and the remaining treatment regimen continues from week 16 or escalates from week 32. For patients who do not achieve their assigned treatment target due to a lack of remission (with or without corticosteroid use), therapy is escalated using vedolizumab to a maximum of 300 mg every 4 weeks according to the allocated algorithm. After week 48 and at the investigator's discretion, patients who achieve their treatment target while receiving intravenous vedolizumab every 8 weeks may switch to subcutaneous (SC) vedolizumab administered every 2 weeks, and patients who do not achieve their treatment target may be switched to a non-vedolizumab therapy. Investigators are asked about their adherence to the applicable algorithm and are to document the reason for any non-adherence.

### Effectiveness and safety of oral vancomycin for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis: a systematic review and pooled analysis [^113cWySb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disease that is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricture formation in the biliary tree.PSC is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. Currently, the only effective treatment for PSC is liver transplantation. About 70% of patients with PSC have underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Ulcerative colitis (UC) has been classically thought to be more common in PSC compared to Crohn's disease (CD). However, IBD associated with PSC (IBD-PSC) seems to represent a distinctive phenotype in comparison to UC and CD without PSC. IBD-PSC is more likely to be associated with rectal sparing, pancolitis with greater severity of inflammation in the right compared to the left colon and backwash ileitis. In addition, IBD-PSC is associated with a significantly higher rate of colorectal cancer compared with UC without PSC. The current treatment paradigm of IBD-PSC mirrors that of IBD without PSC starting with mesalamine for mild–moderate colonic disease and immunosuppressants/advanced therapies in moderate-to-severe or steroid-dependent disease which can be required in up to a one-third of IBD-PSC patients. Up to 50% of patients with IBD-PSC do not achieve endoscopic remission despite treatment with advanced therapies.

Mild–moderate ulcerative colitis — prednisone or budesonide MMX after optimized 5-ASA therapy: The AGA suggests adding either oral prednisone or budesonide MMX in patients with symptoms refractory to optimized 5-ASA therapy. In an RCT of patients with mild–moderate disease activity despite 5-ASA, adding budesonide MMX to 5-ASA had (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00) for induction of remission compared with placebo with 5-ASA, and no trials directly compared budesonide MMX with systemic corticosteroids such as prednisone. Across 3 trials of second-generation corticosteroids versus oral prednisone or prednisolone for induction, remission showed (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96–1.13) and steroid-related adverse events were lower (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.64); second-generation corticosteroids appear to have fewer side effects but are significantly more costly than oral prednisone. Patients who require repeated or prolonged corticosteroid courses should be considered for escalation to biologic therapies and/or immunomodulators.

### Prednisolone and budesonide for short-and long-term treatment of microscopic colitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Jef5N]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The incidence of microscopic colitis and its disease burden are increasing, yet there is limited systematic information addressing the use of conventional corticosteroids and budesonide in microscopic colitis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the short- and long-term efficacy of corticosteroids in treatment of microscopic colitis.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials that met predetermined selection criteria were included. Articles were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, proceedings of major gastroenterology meetings, and reference lists of trials and review articles.

Results

Eight randomized trials were identified. A total of 248 patients were randomized to corticosteroid versus placebo. The intervention was budesonide in 7 trials and prednisolone in 1 trial. Budesonide was significantly more effective than placebo for short-term clinical response (risk ratio [RR], 3.07; 95% confidence interval, 2.06–4.57) and long-term clinical response (RR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.05–9.89). Prednisolone was not superior to placebo for short-term clinical response (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.38–10.58). Histologic improvement was seen with both short- and long-term budesonide (RR, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.00–7.06, and RR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.25–4.98, respectively). Symptom relapse occurred in 46%-80% of patients within 6 months of treatment cessation. Withdrawal because of adverse effects occurred in 4.4% of patients, with no difference between study groups (P = 0.55).

Conclusions

Both short- and long-term treatment with budesonide is effective and well-tolerated for microscopic colitis. However, the rate of symptom relapse once budesonide is discontinued is high. Further studies are needed to determine optimal treatment duration, dose, and withdrawal procedure.

Justification and implementation considerations

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a mortality benefit with moderate certainty of evidence, multiple caveats prompted a conditional recommendation. There is substantial heterogeneity in the dosing, timing, and duration of corticosteroids in clinical trials in patients with ARDS, resulting in uncertainty about the optimal course of treatment. Data addressing the short- and long-term adverse effects of corticosteroids are also limited; infectious complications could not be systematically evaluated, and there is low- to very low-certainty evidence for other safety outcomes. Additionally, previous studies assessing the use of corticosteroids for varied indications have demonstrated the potential for harm even when used in short courses.

There are several factors to consider for implementation (Figure 2). Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer. As such, they have the potential to reach and benefit a substantial number of patients. With regard to corticosteroid dosing and administration, although the panel was not comfortable making recommendations for a specific agent and course of therapy, there are some considerations that may help guide clinicians when selecting a regimen. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (i.e. severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit from corticosteroids, with regimens that have been defined and evaluated in large RCTs. For other ARDS etiologies, any of several regimens used in clinical trials (Table E10 in the online supplement) could reasonably be chosen based on the individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. Although the duration of corticosteroid treatment has varied in clinical trials, corticosteroids were stopped at the time of extubation in a number of the included studies. Additionally, although the optimal timing of therapy is also unclear, it is important to note that the initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after the onset of ARDS may be associated with harm. Furthermore, the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in patient populations that may be at higher risks of harm, such as patients who are immunocompromised, have metabolic syndrome, or live in regions where infections such as tuberculosis and parasitic disease are endemic. Finally, although this recommendation is based on evidence from trials on intubated patients with ARDS and applies specifically to this group, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some groups of nonintubated patients with ARDS. For nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit from corticosteroid treatment (i.e. COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia). The role of steroids in nonintubated patients with ARDS of other etiologies remains uncertain.

### Short-term outcomes of corticosteroid monotherapy in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^1127Eej2]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

The time of administration of the first dose of IVIG or corticosteroids was considered the time of therapy initiation. Three groups were defined based on the initial therapy received: corticosteroids alone, IVIG alone, or IVIG plus corticosteroids. Initial therapy was considered IVIG plus corticosteroids when the administration of each medication occurred within 24 hours of one another for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) or within 48 hours for non-ICU patients.

Primary and secondary outcomes were used to evaluate treatment response. The primary outcome was failure of initial therapy, defined as a patient receiving additional treatment as documented in the medical record by the treating clinician for fever, worsening or lack of improvement of laboratory markers, worsening or lack of improvement of cardiac findings, and/or worsening or lack of improvement of noncardiac clinical findings, after 24 hours (ICU patients) or 48 hours (non-ICU patients) from the time of therapy initiation. This definition was intended to reflect current clinical practice at our centers, where clinicians determine therapy failure and addition of adjuvant immunosuppressants based on the aforementioned factors and base the timing of this determination on whether the patient's condition is considered critical (ICU status). Secondary outcomes included presence of complications, cardiovascular outcomes, fever duration, length of hospital and ICU stay, corticosteroid therapy duration, and readmission within 6 months of diagnosis. eTable 1 in the Supplement lists complete definitions used to delineate baseline characteristics (at the start of immunomodulatory treatment), medication-related variables, adverse events potentially related to medications, and primary and secondary outcomes.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) vaccine timing and opportunistic vaccination suggests that patients receive appropriate boosters or catch-up vaccines during any in-person clinic visit, with the most opportune times during transition of care to a new gastroenterology provider or during periods of remission at routine visits; whenever feasible, vaccines should be administered before the commencement of immune-modifying therapy, as certain agents may diminish the immune response to vaccines, however, vaccination should not delay the initiation of appropriate immune-modifying therapy; patients with IBD, on or off immune-modifying therapy, should receive vaccines at the earliest opportunity, and preferably off corticosteroids or at the lowest tolerable corticosteroid dose.

5.4.4 Preoperative corticosteroids

Statement 108. We recommend that prior to elective surgery for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, corticosteroids should be stopped or dose minimised wherever possible to reduce risk of postoperative complications (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 94.6%).

Patients undergoing IBD surgery while on corticosteroids have an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications and anastomotic leaks. There is some evidence that risks are greater for those taking high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisolone or more). A comparison of prednisolone doses greater than 20 mg versus 20 mg or less did not show a significant difference in risk of infections. Use of more than ≥ 15 mg oral corticosteroid in UC patients within 30 days of IPAA surgery, or more than ≥ 20 mg in the setting of proctocolectomy, is associated with increased risk of complications. IBD patients having elective surgery should have their corticosteroids stopped if possible, or brought to as low a dose that can be managed without deterioration.

Statement 109. We recommend that IBD patients who have been on oral corticosteroids for more than 4 weeks prior to surgery should receive an equivalent intravenous dose of hydrocortisone while nil by mouth in the perioperative period (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Patients who are on corticosteroids at the time of their IBD surgery should be given intravenous hydrocortisone in equivalent dosage until they can resume oral prednisolone. Prednisolone 5 mg is equivalent to hydrocortisone 20 mg or methylprednisolone 4 mg. There is no value increasing steroid dosage to cover stress in the perioperative period, as shown in a randomised trial in IBD surgeryand case series. Anaesthetists will generally give a single steroid dose prior to induction (such as dexamethasone 4 mg intravenous or intramuscular) for those taking more than 5 mg prednisolone. Patients who are on physiological corticosteroid replacement because of disorders of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (such as oral hydrocortisone 20 mg mane, 10 mg nocte) should receive supplementary doses in the perioperative period. For patients who have had complete resection of active disease, it is important to avoid inappropriate prolongation of steroids after surgery, and there is virtue in standardised steroid-taper protocols in the postoperative period, dependent on the dose and duration of steroids preoperatively (table 11).

5.4.5 Preoperative thiopurines

With one exception, the literature on the use of immunosuppressive therapy (thiopurines and methotrexate) leading up to surgery does not describe an association with an increased risk of postoperative complications.

### AGA reviews the use of corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and… [^116FUueC]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

For the initiation of remission, a prednisone dosage ranging from 40 to 60 mg per day or 1 mg per kg per day is effective. Induction of response can average seven to 14 days. Gradually tapering the dosage by 5 mg per week to a dose of 20 mg per day and then tapering the dosage again by 2. 5 to
5. 0 mg per week until the dosage is below 20 mg per day is recommended. If a patient does not respond to therapy with high doses of prednisone in seven to 14 days, parenteral corticosteroids are indicated; the dosage usually ranges from 40 to 60 mg per day of methylprednisolone or 200 to 300 mg per day of hydrocortisone. Because long-term corticosteroid use is undesirable, patients who have chronic, active, corticosteroid-dependent disease should be treated with 2 to 3 mg per kg per day of azathioprine or 1. 0 to

1. 5 mg per kg per day of 6-MP.

Another option would be to use infliximab or infliximab combined with antimetabolites. In an attempt to avoid future corticosteroid use, those patients who have a severe flare-up of IBD also should be considered for this treatment. Regardless of disease distribution, a dosage of 2 to 3 mg per kg per day of azathioprine or 1. 0 to

1. 5 mg per kg per day of 6-MP is effective in maintaining remission in persons with Crohn's disease and for corticosteroid dose reduction in persons with ulcerative colitis. This dosage may be effective in maintaining remission in those with ulcerative colitis; however, data are conflicting and not supported by larger well-controlled trials. RECOMMENDATIONS An initial dose of 5 mg per kg, given by intravenous infusion over two hours, with three doses at weeks 0, 2, and 6 is recommended. It should be followed by maintenance therapy every eight weeks in those persons who are responsive.

A health care practitioner should supervise treatment and observe the patient for approximately one hour after treatment. In patients with Crohn's disease who initially respond to treatment and then lose responsiveness, 10 mg per kg of infliximab may be tried.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for COPD exacerbations… [^112hVY8p]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are shorter courses of systemic corticosteroid therapy as safe and effective as conventional, longer courses for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Evidence-Based Answer Treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD with a shorter course of systemic corticosteroids is likely to be as effective and safe as treating with longer courses. There is no significant difference in adverse effects between shorter and longer courses.

1. Practice Pointers COPD is a chronic, progressive lung condition resulting in airflow limitations. Patients with COPD are at risk of acute exacerbations, which may present as dyspnea, increased cough, and sputum production. Systemic corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment, but the necessary duration of treatment is debated.

The authors of this review assessed whether a shorter course of systemic corticosteroids was as safe and effective as the more conventional 10- to 14-day course. Five studies used oral prednisolone, one study used intravenous methylprednisolone, and two studies used a combination of oral and intravenous corticosteroids. Shorter courses of corticosteroids ranged from three to seven days of treatment; longer courses ranged from 10 to 15 days. This review did not discuss whether three days of treatment is equivalent to other courses of up to seven days of treatment. The studies included only patients with severe to very severe COPD, although the criteria for this were not well-defined or consistent among studies. Three studies used pulmonary function testing diagnostic criteria, but even those criteria were not uniform. Primary outcomes included treatment failure, relapse after treatment, and adverse drug effects.

There was no difference in any primary outcomes between patients who were treated with systemic corticosteroids for seven or fewer days and those who were treated for more than seven days. The investigators rated the evidence for primary outcomes as moderate, with imprecision as a reported limiting factor. As noted, the studies did not specifically address outpatient therapy for COPD exacerbations and excluded patients with mild or moderate COPD. Current guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommend treating acute exacerbations of COPD with oral prednisone, 40 mg per day for five days in most patients. 2 The practice recommendations in this activity are available at http: //www. cochrane. org/CD006897.
