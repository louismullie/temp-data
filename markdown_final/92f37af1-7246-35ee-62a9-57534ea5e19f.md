## Question

how long should an acute pancetitis be npo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a patient with acute pancreatitis should be kept nothing by mouth (NPO). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about disease severity because nutrition strategy differs markedly between mild and severe disease. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about timing of oral feeding in mild disease. Next, I will examine the approach in severe disease, including when to start enteral nutrition and whether to continue NPO. After that, I should consider special scenarios like hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis and pediatrics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious algorithm and state exceptions and monitoring needs, anchoring to AGA 2018, ACG 2024, and WSES 2019 guidance.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: the duration of NPO is not one-size-fits-all and hinges on severity. Most cases are mild and self-limited, but about 15–25% evolve to moderately severe or severe disease with organ failure, which changes nutrition priorities and the role of NPO versus early enteral feeding [^3b96dcec] [^55ebc3b6].

> For mild acute pancreatitis, I should double-check the timing of oral feeding. Contemporary guidelines recommend early oral feeding as soon as tolerated, generally within 24 hours, rather than prolonged NPO. The AGA gives this a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence, and ACG suggests early oral feeding within 24–48 hours as tolerated, moving away from historic pancreatic "rest" paradigms [^7bfd3626] [^d28150fb] [^854ee900]. Wait, let me verify the rationale: delaying feeding is associated with more interventions for necrosis, whereas early feeding maintains gut integrity and may reduce complications, supporting the shift toward early refeeding when tolerated [^7bfd3626].

> I need to check whether starting with solids is acceptable. The ACG 2024 guideline suggests that in mild disease, starting with a low-fat solid diet is reasonable rather than a stepwise liquid-to-solid progression, though the evidence quality is low to very low; practically, many clinicians still advance cautiously if symptoms persist, but the direction is toward earlier, solid-food refeeding when tolerated [^d28150fb]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to patients without nausea, vomiting, or ileus; yes, tolerance remains the key safety gatekeeper [^d28150fb].

> For severe acute pancreatitis, I should confirm that NPO is not the default long-term strategy. Instead, guidelines recommend initiating enteral nutrition early, typically within 24–48 hours, using the enteral route preferentially over parenteral nutrition to reduce infectious complications and organ failure; nasogastric feeding is acceptable and not inferior to nasojejunal when gastric emptying is preserved [^eba5d250] [^55ebc3b6] [^f595f26e]. Let me reconsider the role of NPO here: NPO may be necessary transiently if there is severe ileus, intractable vomiting, or obstruction, but the goal is to transition to enteral nutrition as soon as feasible rather than maintaining prolonged NPO [^55ebc3b6].

> But wait, what if the etiology is hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis? I should verify whether NPO helps lower triglycerides and how quickly. Observational data show that NPO alone can reduce serum triglycerides by roughly 50% within about 30 hours, and conservative management with NPO and hydration can achieve substantial triglyceride declines within 48 hours without plasmapheresis in many cases, though insulin may be added if hyperglycemia is present [^bc409ec3] [^9162606f]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while NPO aids triglyceride clearance, the nutrition strategy still needs to balance this with the broader principle of early enteral feeding once the patient can tolerate it, especially if the clinical course is severe or prolonged [^55ebc3b6].

> Next, I should review pediatric data to ensure the adult guidance translates. Pediatric studies and guidelines support early oral feeding in mild disease, with patient-directed early feeding reducing NPO duration and length of stay without increasing complications; in more severe pediatric disease, early enteral nutrition is likewise favored when feasible [^7671402d] [^b7dcaae1]. I should confirm that pediatric-specific severity tools and comorbidity burdens influence NPO length; indeed, comorbidities and SIRS correlate with longer NPO and hospital stay, reinforcing individualized decisions rather than fixed NPO durations [^6b2db1c2].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For mild acute pancreatitis without ongoing nausea, vomiting, or ileus, start oral intake within 24–48 hours as tolerated, and consider beginning with a low-fat solid diet if the patient can handle it; if not, advance stepwise as symptoms improve, with the overarching goal of minimizing NPO time to preserve gut integrity and reduce complications [^7bfd3626] [^d28150fb]. For severe acute pancreatitis, avoid prolonged NPO; initiate enteral nutrition within 24–48 hours via the gastric route if tolerated, reserving parenteral nutrition for cases where the enteral route is not feasible or not tolerated, and reassess tolerance frequently [^eba5d250] [^55ebc3b6]. I should double-check that this aligns with major guidelines; yes, AGA, ACG, and WSES converge on early enteral nutrition and selective, time-limited NPO rather than routine prolonged fasting [^7bfd3626] [^d28150fb] [^b4555815].

> I will now examine exceptions and monitoring. Prolonged NPO may be necessary with severe ileus, gastric outlet or intestinal obstruction, intractable vomiting, or when interventions for complications are imminent; in these scenarios, reassess daily for the earliest safe opportunity to start enteral nutrition and avoid TPN when possible due to infection and metabolic risks [^55ebc3b6] [^b4555815]. Hold on, I should verify that we also monitor for evolving severity in the first 48–72 hours; indeed, guidelines emphasize vigilance for organ failure and dynamic risk reassessment, which can shift nutrition plans if the patient deteriorates [^64e50c89] [^3b96dcec].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: there is no fixed NPO duration for acute pancreatitis. For mild disease, keep NPO only until the patient can tolerate oral intake, ideally within 24–48 hours, and then feed early. For severe disease, do not rely on prolonged NPO; prioritize early enteral nutrition within 24–48 hours unless contraindicated, using NG or NJ routes as appropriate and escalating to TPN only when enteral feeding is not feasible. Tailor decisions to symptoms, severity, etiology, and response, and reassess frequently in the first 48–72 hours [^7bfd3626] [^d28150fb] [^eba5d250].

Patients with acute pancreatitis should **not be kept NPO for more than 24–48 hours** unless there is severe disease or ongoing symptoms [^7bfd3626] [^d28150fb]. Early oral feeding within 24–48 hours is safe in mild cases and reduces length of stay and complications [^7bfd3626] [^7671402d]. In severe or necrotizing pancreatitis, start enteral nutrition within 24–48 hours via nasogastric or nasojejunal routes; avoid TPN unless enteral feeding is not feasible [^eba5d250] [^55ebc3b6] [^b4555815]. Prolonged NPO increases infection and organ failure risk, so resume feeding as soon as tolerated [^55ebc3b6].

---

## Historical perspective and evolution of practice

Historically, patients with acute pancreatitis were kept NPO for 5–7 days to "rest the pancreas", but this has shifted to **early feeding** based on new evidence [^c48039f2]. Prolonged NPO can cause gut mucosal atrophy, bacterial translocation, and increased infection risk, especially in severe disease [^c48039f2].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Severity of pancreatitis** | **Recommended nutrition approach** | **Timing of nutrition initiation** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | Early oral feeding (low-fat solid diet) | Within 24–48 hours as tolerated [^7bfd3626] [^d28150fb] |
| Moderately severe | Enteral nutrition (NG or NJ) | Within 24–48 hours [^eba5d250] [^55ebc3b6] |
| Severe (necrotizing) | Enteral nutrition (NG or NJ) | Within 24–48 hours [^eba5d250] [^55ebc3b6] |

---

Early enteral nutrition is **superior to parenteral nutrition** because it preserves gut integrity, reduces infectious complications, and lowers mortality [^55ebc3b6] [^c48039f2]. TPN is reserved for patients who cannot tolerate enteral feeding [^a8e5d4ff].

---

## Risks associated with prolonged NPO status

Prolonged NPO status is associated with:

- **Increased risk of infections**: Including pancreatic necrosis and sepsis [^55ebc3b6].
- **Longer hospital stay**: Delayed feeding increases length of stay and healthcare costs [^7671402d].
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Prolonged fasting can cause malnutrition and delay recovery [^c48039f2].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting early feeding

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show that early enteral nutrition (within 24–48 hours) reduces infectious complications, organ failure, and length of stay without increasing adverse events [^55ebc3b6] [^c48039f2]. Early oral feeding in mild pancreatitis is safe and well tolerated, with no increase in pain or relapse [^7bfd3626] [^7a7e3fc2].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis**: NPO alone can reduce triglycerides by ~50% within 30 hours; consider plasmapheresis if levels remain > 10 mmol/L after 48–72 hours [^bc409ec3] [^9162606f].
- **Pediatric patients**: Early feeding is safe and associated with shorter hospital stay and fewer complications [^7671402d] [^b7dcaae1].
- **Pregnancy**: Manage similarly with early enteral nutrition when tolerated [^d400fc67].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Mild pancreatitis**: Start oral feeding within 24–48 hours as tolerated; avoid prolonged NPO [^7bfd3626] [^d28150fb].
- **Moderately severe or severe pancreatitis**: Initiate enteral nutrition within 24–48 hours; avoid TPN unless enteral feeding is not feasible [^eba5d250] [^55ebc3b6] [^b4555815].
- **Monitor tolerance**: Adjust feeding based on patient tolerance and clinical status [^eb721504].

---

Patients with acute pancreatitis should **not be kept NPO for more than 24–48 hours** unless there is severe disease or ongoing symptoms. Early feeding is safe, reduces complications, and should be implemented as soon as tolerated [^7bfd3626] [^d28150fb].

Acute management of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis — priorities, NPO effect, and fluids: Acute treatment priorities include reducing TG levels, maintaining hydration and circulatory support, managing associated metabolic disturbances, and pain control. Initiating NPO status alone results in a 50% reduction in serum TG within 30 hours. Goal-directed fluid resuscitation should be initiated early to maintain hemodynamic stability, typically using lactated Ringer's solution, which is preferred over normal saline.

Adequate fluid therapy (Bolus fluid infusion with 10–20 cc/kg normal saline or lactate ringer and intravenous fluid therapy with 1.5–2 times maintenance in the first 24–48 h of disease are recommended according to guidelines.) and early onset of oral nutrition play important roles in reducing the length of hospitalization and the need for ICU admission and decreasing the likelihood of disease progression into its severe form. Only 18% of patients in the current study received bolus intravenous fluid therapy, and only half of the patients obtained more fluid than the maintenance requirement in the first 48 h of disease; therefore, fluid therapy should be emphasized in clinical education due to its great importance in these patients.

Moreover, one-quarter of patients remained NPO after the first 24 h, which also increased the need for further training of physicians. Almost half of the patients in this study were treated with antibiotics, and according to the hospital records, only one-third of them had indications for antibiotic treatment. According to the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition Pancreas Committee guidelines, administration of antibiotics for acute pancreatitis is only necessary in the case of infectious necrosis or disease progression into necrotic pancreatitis. Besides, the inappropriate use of antibiotics, along with the side effects of medications, increases the likelihood of antibiotic resistance. In this study, only one child with cerebral palsy expired, with signs of sepsis, seizures, and acute pancreatitis. According to previous studies, the mortality rate of acute pancreatitis in children is less than 5%, which is consistent with our study.

### The benefits of early oral nutrition in mild acute pancreatitis [^7671402d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether early patient-directed oral nutrition in children with mild acute pancreatitis decreases the length of hospitalization without increasing complications.

Study Design

Hospitalized patients aged 2–21 years of age who met the criteria for acute pancreatitis based on the Revised Atlanta Classification were enrolled prospectively and allowed to eat by mouth at their discretion (patient-directed nutrition [PDN]). These patients were compared with a retrospective cohort of children who were allowed to eat based on traditional practices (treatment team-directed nutrition [TTDN]). Outcomes included length of hospitalization, time nil per os (NPO), and complications within 30 days of discharge.

Results

The study included 30 patients in the PDN group and 92 patients in the TTDN group. Patients in the PDN group had a median length of stay of 48.5 hours (IQR 37–70 hours) compared with 93 hours (IQR 52–145 hours) in the TTDN group (P < .0001). Patients were NPO for a median of 14 hours (IQR 7–19.5 hours) in the PDN group compared with 34 hours (IQR 19.3–55 hours) in the TTDN group (P < .0001). No patients in the PDN group developed complications within 30 days of discharge.

Conclusion

Early patient-directed oral nutrition in mild acute pancreatitis was well tolerated and resulted in decreased length of NPO status and hospitalization with no obvious complications.

Management

All patients were hospitalized with acute admission. Apart from conservative management (ie, nasogastric tube, nil by mouth [NPO]/gut rest, intravenous fluid support, and analgesia), 53% of patients received intravenous antibiotics. The proposed drugs of choice here with good penetration to pancreatic tissue such as imipenem, clindamycin, piperacillin, fluoroquinolones, and metronidazole were prescribed in 29 of 42 cases (69%), whereas another 13 patients had other antimicrobial agents. The average pathological "third space" fluid losses were, on average, 27.7 mL/kg, with patients who later developed complications requiring more frequent fluid boluses during the first 48 hours of hospital admission versus those without complications; however, these differences were not statistically significant (33.4 vs 25.5 mL/kg, P = 0.36). Most patients (95%) had mild-grade acute pancreatitis, and the NPO time here was approximately 4 days (IQR, 2–8 days). Patients who developed pancreatitis-related complications had a longer NPO time (8 vs 3 days; P = 0.01) and hospital LOS (24 vs 12 days; P = 0.04).

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) acute pancreatitis during pregnancy — management considerations: Management of acute pancreatitis during pregnancy in a patient with FCS should adhere to general principles as outlined below. Many women with FCS have suffered fetal losses close to term and stillbirth due to pancreatitis complications and prolonged hospitalizations. In rare severe scenarios, maintaining nil per os (NPO) status with intermittent total parenteral nutrition has been utilized in the third trimester until delivery was induced closer to term, and in other cases, TPE has been utilized during attacks of acute pancreatitis with favorable outcomes.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^55ebc3b6]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — enteral nutrition (EN) timing, route, and formula: Acute pancreatitis is the third most common gastrointestinal (GI) diagnosis at hospital discharge; approximately 80%–90% of cases are mild/moderate with overall mortality < 5%, while mortality rises to 25% in severe necrotizing disease. Earlier guidelines endorsed nutrition support only for severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and the use of EN over parenteral nutrition (PN), based on high-level evidence that has not changed; evidence indicated increased risks when using PN in SAP, particularly hyperglycemia and sepsis, whereas early EN (vs delayed EN) is associated with decreased infectious and organ failure complications. Current data indicate early EN (within 48 h) compared with delayed oral nutrition or EN appears to be beneficial and newer data support safe oral feeding within 24 h of admission; in SAP there is no longer a role for prescribing nothing by mouth (NPO). For route, current evidence suggests nasogastric (NG) feeds can be tolerated and does not support superiority of the nasojejunal (NJ) route; jejunal feeding is primarily indicated when NG feeding is not tolerated. Regarding formulations, there is no evidence that semi-elemental formula should be used instead of a more cost-effective polymeric formula, and immunonutrition cannot be endorsed without more supportive evidence from higher-quality trials.

### Acute pancreatitis in childhood: a 10-year experience from A Thai university surgical center [^3f7430dc]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

Most cases of acute pediatric pancreatitis are reportedly mild and resolve without complications. These factors therefore question the real benefit (if any) of using adult-defined acute pancreatitis scoring systems in the pediatric population. Lautz et alreported multiorgan dysfunction or shock in greater than 2.8% of their patient population. In the current study, we noted a slightly higher "organ failure" rate of 5.1% during the first 24 hours of hospital admission, with more than half of our patients later making a recovery from illness within 48 hours without consequence. Common complications after acute pancreatitis such as pseudocyst formation have been widely reported in 10% to 23% index cases and necrotizing pancreatitis in ≤ 1% of patients. Complicated illness accounts for prolonged NPO time and LOS within this cadre of patients. However, in our current study, we could not identify any predictive factors for patients acquiring pancreatitis-related complications. Fortunately, most complications can be safely managed conservatively. Spontaneous resolution of pancreatic pseudocyst has been reported in 29% of cases. However, in certain conditions such as with infection, persistent abdominal pain, or hemorrhage, surgical drainage of the pseudocyst may be indicated. Although necrotizing pancreatitis is associated with a high rate of mortality, it is mainly managed with aggressive supportive medical therapy including deployment of parenteral antibiotics. Standard surgical treatments with such disease course may include open pancreatic necrosectomy, with minimally invasive alternatives also proposed.

Prophylactic antibiotics are usually not indicated in mild illness because the incidence of infectious complications and mortality rates are considered low. Nevertheless, infectious sequelae are responsible for up to 80% of deaths in patients developing an illness. The health care medical team in our study had a lower threshold of prescribing antibiotic therapies in patients with associated comorbidities deemed prone to systemic infections and in those with malignancy, with autoimmune disease, or requiring immunosuppressive agents. We found in the present study that 21.4% of patients receiving antibiotics during hospital admission developed pancreatitis-related complication(s) and 38.1% of cases in this cohort died. Acute pancreatitis can feature as one of the crucial manifestations in systemic illness disorders and/or sepsis. The moribund state acquired in severe systemic illness can prolong starvation (nil po) and fasting and the tendency to deploy antibiotics with a higher risk of death in this vulnerable patient group. A 28% mortality occurred in our study cohort, but no deaths were directly attributable to acute pancreatitis.

Acute pancreatitis is the leading cause of hospitalization for gastrointestinal disorders in the United States. As rates of hospitalization for acute pancreatitis continue to increase, so does demand for effective management. We review approaches to best manage patients with acute pancreatitis, covering diagnosis, risk and prognostic factors, treatment, and complications, considering recommendations from current practice guidelines.

### Initial management of acute pancreatitis: critical issues during the first 72 hours [^c6443557]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis have a mild course, almost a quarter of patients will develop complications. It has become clear that the early management of patients with acute pancreatitis will likely affect outcome. Too often patients are admitted to the hospital with what appears to be mild disease only later to deteriorate with severe disease. This review will focus on the early management of patients with acute pancreatitis in an attempt to prevent severe disease, complications, and death.

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis? [^87d38268]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a leading cause of hospitalization for gastrointestinal disorders. Because of a substantially high mortality of up to 20–30% in severe cases, early identification of patients who might require transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) is essential.

### Comparison of clinical course and outcome of acute pancreatitis according to the two main etiologies: alcohol and gallstone [^3baa8914]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

Between January 2011 and January 2013, a total of 153 patients were diagnosed as AP with a first attack, and, among these patients, 126 patients with AP induced by two major causes, alcohol or gallstone, were included in this study. Extensive demographic, radiographic, and laboratory data of these consecutive patients were prospectively collected and analyzed retrospectively. Patients with AP on pre-existing chronic pancreatitis and previous history of AP were excluded from this study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Yeungnam University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

All patients diagnosed as AP were treated with supportive care, including NPO, fluid resuscitation, and analgesics. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was considered in patients with biliary pancreatitis, and the timing of ERCP was dependent upon severity and clinical course of the patients. ERCP was performed as soon as possible in patients with concomitant acute cholangitis. We awaited spontaneous improvement of biliary obstruction for 24–48 hrs in patients with no associated cholangitis. Oral feeding was permitted when abdominal pain subsided and patients felt hunger sensation. Patients who remained asymptomatic with oral intake were discharged or underwent cholecystectomy if indicated.

### Conservative management in hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis [^9162606f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride > 10 mmol L -1) is implicated in ~9% of acute pancreatitis cases. Certain guidelines list severe hypertriglyceridemia as an indication for plasmapheresis.

Objective

We assembled the natural trajectory of triglyceride levels in patients with acute pancreatitis due to severe hypertriglyceridemia who were managed conservatively without plasmapheresis to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on 22 hospital admissions for acute pancreatitis episodes considered to be caused by severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients were managed supportively, with cessation of oral intake (NPO) and intravenous hydration. Insulin infusion was used in 12 patients to manage concurrent hyperglycaemia.

Results

Triglyceride levels for the group were evaluated using a mixed-effects model. The average triglyceride level fell from 45.4 mmol L -1 on presentation to 13.3 mmol L -1 within 48 h, corresponding to a mean 69.8% decrease. Regression analysis showed a triglyceride half-life of 30.6 h. Findings were similar for NPO-only and insulin infusion subgroups.

Conclusion

Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis can be conservatively managed safely and effectively without plasmapheresis.

### Managing complicated pancreatitis with more knowledge and a bigger toolbox! [^604f32c8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a heterogeneous inflammation of the pancreas, most frequently attributable to gallstones or alcohol. AP accounts for an estimated 300 000 patients admitted each year in the USA, and an estimated US$2.6 billion/year in hospitalization costs. Disease severity is classified as mild, moderate, or severe, dependent on the presence or degree of concomitant organ failure. Locally, pancreatitis may be complicated by fluid collections, necrosis, infection, and hemorrhage. Infection of necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) is associated with a doubling of mortality risk. The modern management of AP is evolving. Recent data suggest a shift from normal saline to lactated Ringer's solution, and from aggressive to more judicious volume resuscitation. Similarly, while historical wisdom advocated keeping patients nothing by mouth to 'rest the pancreas', recent data convincingly show fewer complications and reduced mortality with early enteral nutrition, when tolerated by the patient. The use of antibiotics in NP is controversial. Current recommendations suggest reserving antibiotics for cases with highly suspected or confirmed infected necrosis, as well as in patients with biliary pancreatitis complicated by acute cholecystitis or cholangitis. Regarding the management of local complications, control of acute hemorrhage can be attained either endovascularly or via laparotomy. Abdominal compartment syndrome is associated with a mortality risk of 50%–75%. Routine monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure is recommended in patients at high risk. Pancreatic pseudocysts require intervention in symptomatic patients or those with infection or other complications. Endoscopic transmural drainage may be considered as the first step when technically feasible. Necrotizing pancreatitis without suspicion of infection is often managed medically, while the delay, drain, debride approach remains the standard of care for the vast majority of infected pancreatic necrosis. Robotic surgery, in appropriately selected patients, allows for a one-step approach, and merits further study to explore its initially promising results.

### Validation of lipase and systemic inflammatory response syndrome as prognostic indicators in pediatric acute pancreatitis: a retrospective analysis [^6b2db1c2]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is understudied in the pediatric population despite increasing incidence. Although many cases are mild and resolve with supportive care, severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is a lack of pediatric-specific predictive tools to help stratify risk of SAP in children.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of patients with AP or recurrent AP at Cohen Children's Medical Center between 2011 and 2016 was performed. Lipase level and the presence of pediatric systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) on admission were examined as potential predictors of SAP and length of stay (LOS). A multivariate logistic regression or analysis of covariance was used to conduct the multivariate analysis.

Results

Seventy-nine pediatric patients met inclusion criteria. Approximately 37% (29/79) had SIRS on admission, 22% (17/79) developed SAP, and there were no mortalities. In both the univariate and multivariate models, SIRS was a predictor of SAP. Mean (SD) LOS for patients with SIRS compared with without SIRS was 9.6 ± 8.3 compared with 6.3 ± 6.9 days (P < 0.05). The mean LOS of patients with one or more comorbidity (48%, 38/79) was 10.0 ± 9.5 compared with 5.2 ± 4.0 days (P < 0.01) for those patients without any comorbidities. Only the presence of comorbidities predicted length of time spent nil per os (NPO; P = 0.0022). Patients with comorbidities stayed an average of 5.6 ± 7.6 days NPO, whereas those without comorbidities spent 2.8 ± 2.4 days NPO. Lipase was not predictive of SAP, LOS, or length of time spent NPO.

Conclusions

These results support the use of SIRS as a simple screening tool on admission to identify children at risk for the development of SAP. The presence of any comorbidity was predictive of LOS and length of NPO in the multivariate model. This may reflect that comorbidities prolong pancreatitis or influence disposition planning.

### Comparison of clinical course and outcome of acute pancreatitis according to the two main etiologies: alcohol and gallstone [^336e2e93]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Definitions

AP was diagnosed if a patient had more than two of the three following findings: typical abdominal pain of AP (acute onset of a persistent and severe epigastric pain often radiating to the back), elevation of serum amylase and/or lipase levels above three times upper normal limit, and findings of imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), consistent with AP. Alcohol was considered a cause of AP when patients had a history of alcohol consumption within 48 h before symptom onset and other possible causes were ruled out. Biliary AP was defined when a gallstone or biliary sludge was observed on abdominal ultrasonography or CT. The etiology was considered idiopathic when causative factors could not be identified from a detailed clinical and drug history or after initial investigations.

Severity of AP was determined according to the most recently revised Atlanta Classification. Mild AP was defined by the absence of organ failure and the absence of local or systemic complications. Moderately severe AP was defined by the presence of transient organ failure, local complications such as acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFC) and acute necrotic collections (ANC), or exacerbation of co-morbid diseases. Severe AP was defined by persistent organ failure for more than 48 h. Organ failure was defined as a score of 2 or more for one of the three systems (respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal) using the modified Marshall scoring system.

Pancreatic pseudocyst was defined as an encapsulated fluid collection usually outside the pancreas with a well defined wall and homogeneous fluid density occurs more than 4 weeks after the onset of interstitial oedematous pancreatitis. Walled-off necrosis (WON) was defined as a mature and encapsulated collection of pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis with a well defined wall and heterogeneous with liquid and non-liquid density, with varying degrees of loculations, occurs more than 4 weeks after the onset of necrotizing pancreatitis.

Data collection

The following parameters were collected for each episode of AP: length of hospital stay, duration of NPO, in-hospital mortality, presence of organ failure, and local complications such as APFC, pseudocyst, ANC, and WON. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)-II and bedside index for severity in acute pancreatitis (BISAP) scores were calculated using data from the first 24 h after admission and the Ranson score using data from the first 48 h. CT severity index (CTSI) was calculated in patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) within 48 h after admission.

### Non-inferiority comparative clinical trial between early oral REFEEDING and usual oral REFEEDING in predicted mild acute biliary pancreatitis [^970f43be]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the result of an inflammatory process in the pancreas, and although the causes are varied, the pathophysiology and management are similar. AP is most commonly caused by bile stones, presents with different degrees of severity, and causes local and systemic complications, leading to high catabolic, hypermetabolic, and hyperdynamic stress states. The currently widely used severity assessment tool used is the revised Atlanta classification, wherein AP is classified as mild, moderate and severe. As no curative therapy is currently available for AP, early treatment consists of supportive care, which includes adequate fluid resuscitation, pain management and enteral nutrition. Nutrition therapy is an essential component of AP management. The published IAP/APA guidelines recommended that oral feeding in patients with predicted mild pancreatitis can be restarted once abdominal pain has decreased and the levels of inflammatory markers have improved (Recommendation G. Nutritional support 20-Grade 2B, strong agreement). This recommendation is reinforced by other authors with similar clinical results. Pancreatic rest by the nil per os (NPO) strategy has been considered necessary in patients with AP until the resolution of abdominal pain and decreases in the levels of pancreatic and inflammatory markers. This trend has changed; now, it is clear that early oral refeeding (OR) for mild PA not only provides adequate caloric intake but also may improve clinical outcomes. It has been hypothesized that the combination of disturbed intestinal motility, microbial overgrowth and increased permeability of the gut can lead to bacterial translocation, thus causing infection and pancreatic necrosis.

OR may reduce translocation by stimulating intestinal motility and reducing bacterial overgrowth, thereby maintaining mucosal gut integrity. Additionally, infection complications, organ failure and mortality are decreased in patients receiving early oral refeeding compared with those receiving routine total parenteral nutrition. In patients with predicted mild AP, numerous studies have shown that a normal oral diet can be resumed once the pain has started to decrease. However, it remains unclear what the optimal timing is for OR. There is still no consensus about the definition of "early" refeeding, the criteria for refeeding, the estimated daily energy intake and type intake.

The aim of the present study was to compare the early onset of OR (within the first 24 h after hospital admission) with usual OR (25–72 h after hospital admission) and determine whether the early introduction of OR influences the recurrence of pain or alters the blood levels of pancreatic enzymes in patients with mild acute pancreatitis.

### Position paper: timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^8621349a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations

The management of patients with acute pancreatitis depends on duration of the disease. The following guidelines are provided for specific time frames.

A. On admission

1. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is completed. Use CT-scan without contrast in case of diagnostic uncertainty.

2. Initiate fluid resuscitation with crystalloids for correction of hypovolemia with simultaneous monitoring of vital organ functions including IAP monitoring.

3. Assess severity based on clinical judgment and initiate prophylactic antibiotics in patients with probable severe pancreatitis.

4. If patient has any signs of organ dysfunction consider intensive care admission.

B. Within the first 48 hours from admission

1. Re-assess the severity daily and discontinue prophylactic antibiotics in patients with mild or moderate pancreatitis.

2. Continue monitoring of vital organ functions and IAP in accordance with fluid therapy. Optimize fluid therapy. Reduce the infusion of crystalloids, if a patient is hemodynamically stable and does not show signs of dehydration.

3. If the patient has signs of deteriorating organ functions consider intensive care admission in order to start invasive hemodynamic monitoring and critical care.

4. In patients with IAH, calculate APP and use conservative efforts to prevent development of ACS.

5. In case ACS develops or the patient has low APP, use all possible conservative efforts to reduce IAP and correct APP, but if not effective perform surgical decompression with midline laparostomy.

6. Take blood cultures and plain chest radiographs for detection of infections.

7. Initiate enteral nutrition.

C. Within the first week from disease onset

1. Same as B1 – B6.

2. Continue enteral nutrition, target for total caloric needs through enteral route.

3. Perform contrast enhanced CT-scan on days 5–7 after disease onset in patients with normal renal function. The amount and localization of necrosis may help in predicting the need of follow-up for late complications.

### Comparison of clinical course and outcome of acute pancreatitis according to the two main etiologies: alcohol and gallstone [^be5ee5d6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Lower proportion of severe AP in the biliary group can be explained in part by the fact that progression of AP was likely to be prevented owing to early treatment of bile duct stone by ERCP. In general, many patients with biliary AP experience spontaneous passage of stone and ERCP is not recommended in these patients, while endoscopic removal of bile duct stone with ERCP is recommended if it does not pass spontaneously. The severity, clinical course and prognosis of biliary AP could be associated with concomitant acute cholangitis and cholestasis. In patients with acute cholangitis and ongoing biliary obstruction, urgent ERCP to remove bile duct stones may lessen the severity of biliary AP. In our studies, 45 of 76 patients with biliary AP showed spontaneous improvement without ERCP, in whom spontaneous passage of CBD stone was suspected. Among 31 patients who underwent ERCP, 12 patients underwent elective ERCP after improvement of AP. Urgent (< 24 h) or early (< 72 h) ERCP was performed in 19 patients with poor response to medical therapy, and rapid improvement of pancreatitis was observed after endoscopic stone removal in these patients. Early recognition and removal of CBD stone by ERCP or spontaneous passage of the stones might have a beneficial influence on the clinical course of biliary AP. These timely interventions might contribute to change in clinical course and improvement of outcome in biliary AP, whereas patients with alcoholic AP could be treated only by supportive care such as NPO, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and close monitoring.

### Non-inferiority comparative clinical trial between early oral REFEEDING and usual oral REFEEDING in predicted mild acute biliary pancreatitis [^7a7e3fc2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

For decades, pancreatic rest by the nil per os (NPO) strategy was considered necessary for patients with AP until the abdominal pain resolved and the levels of pancreatic and inflammatory markers normalized. This trend has changed now; early enteral feeding is accepted in the treatment of AP, but there is still no consensus about the definition of early oral refeeding.

The concept of early oral refeeding includes the time between admission and the start of the diet and the presence of adverse events, including abdominal pain relapse and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting).

In this study, we found that EOR is safe within the first 24 h after hospital admission and that there is no difference in the presence of abdominal pain relapse, nausea or vomiting compared with standard oral refeeding in patients with predicted mild acute biliary pancreatitis. This study provide solid evidence for the oral intake should be started within 24 h.

The criteria for EOR are unclear. Eckerwall GE 2007 reported that his patients were "immediately allowed to drink", and the diet start time was 1 day. Teich N 2010 did not report a criterion; the onset time was determined by the randomization, and the start time for his patients was 2 days. Li J 2013 reported the "feeling of hunger" as the criterion for the start of OR, and the start time for his patients was 5 days. Larino-Noia 2014 reported "normal bowel sounds" as the criterion for starting OR, and the diet start time for his patients was 2 days. Our criteria were the objective measurement of symptoms, a pain score of 3–10 on the NAS, and the absence of symptoms such as nausea or vomiting. These criteria allowed OR to begin within the first 24 h, with a 95% success rate.

Results

Diagnosis

Questions:
Which are the criteria to establish the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis?
What is the appropriate imaging work-up in case of suspected severe acute pancreatitis? What is the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests?
Which laboratory parameters should be considered in the diagnostic process?
How do different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup?
Which scores are indicated for risk assessment?
What is the timing and the suitable test for early follow-up imaging?

Statements (severity grading)

Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal), and high mortality. Both new classification systems, Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity, are similar in establishing the diagnosis and severity of acute pancreatitis (1C).
Patients who have persistent organ failure with infected necrosis have the highest risk of death (1C).
Patients with organ failures should be admitted to an intensive care unit whenever possible (1C).

Discussion

Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents a disease characterized by acute inflammation of the pancreas and histologically acinar cell destruction. The diagnosis of AP requires at least the presence of two of the three following criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis (serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal), and (iii) characteristic findings from abdominal imaging.

Most patients (80–85%) will develop a mild disease course (self-limited, mortality < 1–3%), but around 20% will have a moderate or severe episode of AP, with a mortality rate from 13 to 35%. Thus, it is important to diagnose (or better predict) an episode of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and to identify the patients with high risk of developing complications.

There are 2 overlapping phases of AP, early and late; the early phase takes place in the first 2 weeks after disease onset, and the late phase can last weeks to months thereafter. Because of the focus on initial treatment of AP, questions on late complications (e.g., management of pancreatic fluid collections) are beyond the scope of this guideline, and it states it will not address diagnostic questions such as the use of laboratory tests or radiographic studies to establish the diagnosis of AP.

### Acute pancreatitis: risk of recurrence and late consequences of the disease [^26d3a4d6]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Research into the clinical management of acute pancreatitis has primarily focused on the immediate complications of the disease, whereas its late consequences have received less attention. These late sequelae of acute pancreatitis refer to complications that arise after the convalescence period, which lasts for 3–6 months after the initial episode. In patients who do not undergo necrosectomy that involves removal of the exocrine gland, pancreatic exocrine function usually improves rather than deteriorates during follow-up. By contrast, glucose intolerance is likely to worsen over time in all patients with acute pancreatitis. Despite the risk of late complications for patients with acute pancreatitis, their long-term quality of life is usually good. The number of pancreatitis episodes a patient has experienced is an important factor that determines the severity of late complications of acute pancreatitis. Risk factors for the recurrence of acute pancreatitis episodes have now been identified. This Review focuses on data from studies that investigated the risk factors for recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, and discusses the late consequences of this disease.

### Surgical intervention strategies of necrotizing pancreatitis with abdominal compartment syndrome [^576cfa20]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

The Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis (AP) was proposed in 1992 and has been widely adopted. Through this classification, clinicians are allowed to have a unified standard for clinical research and communication. Because of the increased awareness of the pathophysiology and prognosis of necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) as well as the advancement of diagnostic imaging, corrections of the Atlanta classification have been made to further accurately assess the severity and objectively describe the manifestations of local pancreatic complications. The revised Atlanta classification of AP was pronounced on August 29, 2012. Accordingly, AP can be classified into 3 categories by disease severity: mild, moderate, and severe (Fig. 1). Generally, it is a medical disease and patients can usually recover after conservative treatment. If it proceeds into severe AP, there may be some peripancreatic fluid collection and necrosis development. Severe AP is commonly defined by progression of pancreatic symptoms/signs and accompanied by organ failure lasting more than 48 hours, which needs intensive care for organ support. When more than 30% of the pancreas is affected by necrosis, we call it NP, which accounts for 5% to 10% of severe AP cases and is associated with a mortality rate as high as 25% in the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Comparison of clinical course and outcome of acute pancreatitis according to the two main etiologies: alcohol and gallstone [^359bb2f7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Studies concerning clinical course and outcome of acute pancreatitis (AP) according to etiologies were rare, especially after year 2000. This study was designed to investigate the difference between the clinical course of alcoholic and biliary AP.

Methods

Of the 153 patients diagnosed as AP with a first attack between January 2011 and January 2013, extensive clinical data of 50 patients with AP caused by alcohol and 76 patients with AP caused by gallstone were analyzed retrospectively. We compared the severity of AP defined by revised Atlanta classification in 2012, local complications, severity scores, and computed tomography severity index (CTSI) between alcoholic and biliary AP. We also evaluated the length of hospital stay, duration of NPO, and in-hospital mortality in each group.

Results

Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serum C-reactive protein level measured after admission for 24 h were significantly higher in the alcohol group than in the biliary group. Incidence of pseudocyst formation was significantly higher in the alcohol group than in the biliary group (20.0% vs. 6.6%, P = 0.023). Among prognostic scoring systems, only CTSI showed significant difference (P < 0.001) with a mean score of 3.0 ± 0.9 in the alcohol group and 1.7 ± 1.2 in the biliary group. Severe AP with organ failure persisting beyond 48 h was observed in 12 patients (24.0%) in the alcohol group and one patient (1.3%) in the biliary group (P < 0.001). There were 4 mortalities in the alcohol group only (P = 0.012).

Conclusion

More severe forms of AP and local complication, such as pseudocyst formation, are associated with alcoholic AP compared with biliary AP.

### Managing complicated pancreatitis with more knowledge and a bigger toolbox! [^e3d31337]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of severity of acute pancreatitis

The Atlanta classification of AP was revised in 2012. The working group identified two phases of the disease: early and late, and classified severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild AP, the most common form, is characterized by the absence of organ failure, local or systemic complications, and usually resolves within a week. Moderately severe AP is defined by the presence of transient organ failure (lasting < 48 hours) or local complications. Severe AP (SAP) is defined by persistent organ failure lasting > 48 hours. SAP is a systemic disease with two distinct phases. The first phase is sterile systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that may lead to early primary multiple organ failure and even death within the first 72 hours. The second phase is late secondary organ failure, driven by infection of necrotic tissue or fluid collections. Petrov et al reported that mortality rates for SAP can be as high as 43%. The natural history of AP ranges from complete recovery after a single episode to prolonged hospitalization, requiring multiple invasive interventions, to rapidly progressing multiple organ failure and sepsis leading to death. In some cases, it can progress to a chronic, debilitating condition that persists for decades. The unpredictable clinical course of AP presents challenges, as 80% of patients with mild pancreatitis typically require only a short hospital stay without the need for advanced resources. The remaining 20% with moderately severe to severe pancreatitis require early aggressive treatment, admission to the surgical intensive care unit, or referral to a tertiary center with a multidisciplinary team of specialists. This decision depends on the resources and capabilities of the hospital initially evaluating the patient, but it must also rely on the ability to accurately predict, at the time of admission, which patients with AP will progress. Accurate early predictions are crucial for initiating effective management. Patients with severe AP require intensive care unit monitoring and support for circulatory, pulmonary, renal, and hepatobiliary function to reduce the risk of organ failure sequelae. Those trained in the 1980s recall using Ranson's criteria to prognosticate AP. Since then, numerous prognostic models have been developed, incorporating patient-related risk factors, laboratory parameters, computed tomography (CT) imaging findings, and complex scoring systems to predict mortality, severity of illness, and organ failure. As with many areas of medicine where multiple options are still being studied, no single approach has emerged as definitively superior to others in large-scale comparisons. While there is no 'gold standard' prognostic score for predicting SAP, the Bedside Index of Severity of Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score is one of the more accurate. Due to its simplicity and the fact that it does not require data from 48 hours after admission, BISAP is particularly applicable in everyday clinical practice. Zhu et al recently published a meta-analysis that comprehensively assessed and compared the performance of Ranson's criteria and BISAP in predicting the severity and prognosis of AP, and found that both were comparable. Several biomarkers have also been studied in recent years. Measurement of serum cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, angiopoietin-2, and resistin have been reported as an accurate method for predicting SAP. Villasante et al recently published their work using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict severe pancreatitis at a very early stage of the disease without laboratory data or imaging.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis concludes that that both NG and NJ feeding are viable options in the early management of acute pancreatitis, with no significant difference in mortality and other major clinical outcomes. The choice of feeding route should be individualized, taking into consideration patient-specific factors and clinical contexts. Future research should aim to enhance study design uniformity and focus on exploring patient-centered outcomes to address existing knowledge gaps.

The treatment of acute cholangitis has shown dramatic improvement over the past decade with a current mortality of less than 30% (i.e. sepsis leading to multiorgan failure). Patients should receive general medical therapy including NPO, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and analgesia. In addition to critical care, various techniques for biliary decompression are also mandated. Approaches include endoscopic, percutaneous and/or operative approaches based on the etiology of the cholangitis and patient physiology. Medical treatment may be sufficient in selected cases of grade I, but biliary drainage should be considered for all non-responders. This scenario often incorporates postoperative patients. Patients with grade II disease require early endoscopic, percutaneous or emergent operative (T-tube) biliary drainage. These drainage procedures may be definitive for patients with gallstone-associated cholangitis. Although it remains controversial if patients with cancer should undergo a definitive resection concurrent to their emergent decompression procedure, this is generally not recommended due to a lack of complete staging, higher postoperative complications, and known hospital volume-outcome relationships. Patients with cancer should be stabilized, undergo emergency drainage, and be referred for definitive treatment to a high volume HPB center. In the most critically ill patients, a multidisciplinary team of endoscopists, intensive care physicians and sometimes HPB surgeons should participate with the ACS in the management of these patients. The type of biliary drainage selected by the surgeon is particularly important. Patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma most often benefit from a percutaneous technique (percutaneous transhepatic catheter (PTC) as opposed to endoscopic). ERCP-based attempts at drainage of hilar cholangiocarcinoma are notorious for failing to achieve adequate drainage within the proximal liver and subsequently often develop significant cholangitis due to instrumentation of the biliary system during this attempt. These patients must also receive high fidelity cholangiographic information either prior to (MRCP), or concurrent to the insertion of the PTC (i.e. via the PTC itself) to define resectability and reconstruction options. Patients with any periampullary malignancy should undergo ERCP-based stenting as the initial choice.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^da4872eb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP), defined as acute inflammation of the pancreas, is one of the most common diseases of the gastrointestinal tract leading to hospital admission in the United States. It is important for clinicians to appreciate that AP is heterogenous, progressing differently among patients and is often unpredictable. While most patients experience symptoms lasting a few days, almost one-fifth of patients will go on to experience complications, including pancreatic necrosis and/or organ failure, at times requiring prolonged hospitalization, intensive care, and radiologic, surgical, and/or endoscopic intervention. Early management is essential to identify and treat patients with AP to prevent complications. Patients with biliary pancreatitis typically will require surgery to prevent recurrent disease and may need early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography if the disease is complicated by cholangitis. Nutrition plays an important role in treating patients with AP. The safety of early refeeding and importance in preventing complications from AP are addressed. This guideline will provide an evidence-based practical approach to the management of patients with AP.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: a scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^4b9afdf3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Further, there were no recommendations highlighted in the palliation domain across the different CPGs. Although AP is often considered a self-limiting condition, patients with severe or necrotising disease may experience a high symptom burden, prolonged hospital stays, and significant morbidity. In such cases, a palliative approach that is focussed on symptom management, quality of life, and supportive care may be needed. For instance, pain management remains a cornerstone of treatment, particularly in patients with persistent abdominal pain despite resolution of the acute episode. In addition to opioids and adjunctive analgesics, multimodal pain relief strategies, including regional anaesthesia and non-pharmacological interventions, should be considered. Nutritional support also plays a role in palliation, especially for patients who develop pancreatic insufficiency or experience recurrent AP episodes that impact their nutritional status. Early enteral feeding is recommended in severe cases, but in patients with long-term complications, dietary modifications and enzyme supplementation may be required to maintain nutritional balance and prevent weight loss. In rare cases where acute pancreatitis progresses to multisystem organ failure, discussions regarding goals of care and end-of-life decision-making may be necessary. For patients with refractory AP or those at high risk of mortality, palliative care services can provide holistic support, addressing not only symptom relief but also psychological and family-centred concerns. While palliation is not a primary focus of AP management, incorporating symptom-based supportive care principles in severe or chronic cases may improve overall patient well-being. Further research is needed to explore the role of palliative care in AP, particularly in patients with recurrent or treatment-resistant disease.

The majority of recommendations exist for in-hospital management or treatment. Despite this, historical shifts in recommendations for fluid resuscitation and antibiotic use offer a compelling case study illustrating guideline variability driven by evolving evidence. One of the most debated areas is early fluid resuscitation. Earlier guidelines often recommended aggressive fluid resuscitation to prevent hypoperfusion-related pancreatic necrosis; however, more recent evidence suggests that excessive fluid administration may contribute to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome and increased mortality. As a result, some recent guidelines advocate for a more conservative, goal-directed fluid resuscitation strategy. Similarly, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in AP remains controversial. Initial recommendations favoured broad antibiotic use to prevent infected pancreatic necrosis, but subsequent randomised controlled trials failed to demonstrate a mortality benefit. Consequently, more recent guidelines recommend selective antibiotic use based on clinical deterioration rather than routine prophylaxis. These changes highlight the importance of continuously updating guidelines to reflect the latest evidence, ensuring that recommendations are both safe and effective.

### Moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis: a systematic review of the outcomes in the USA and European union-5 [^c3141e9a]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

Early and accurate classification of the severity of AP is crucial for managing the disease and preventing its progression. Evidence shows that after the initial 48–72 hours, the progression of AP to SAP may be fully established and multisystem OF may be inevitable. Despite the advances in scoring systems to more accurately recognise AP severity, more than 15%–20% of patients with AP will develop SAP and up to 40% of this subgroup will die as a result. This and other aspects of the BOI associated with SAP, and to a lesser extent, MSAP highlight the limitations of current therapy, particularly the lack of approved interventions that target disease progression.

Conclusions

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from collaboration of a panel of experts. It contains 55 statements on diagnosis, management in the ICU, surgical and operative management, open abdomen, and antibiotic treatment. For some of the statements such as severity grading, imaging, use of prophylactic antibiotics and most aspect of the management in the ICU, the evidence is strong. For others, such as laboratory diagnostics and surgical strategies, for example, the evidence is quite weak requiring further studies. With accumulating knowledge, the statements need to be regularly updated.

### Current concepts in severe acute and necrotizing pancreatitis: an evidence-based approach [^876e235a]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis continues to rise, inducing substantial medical and social burden, with annual costs exceeding $2 billion in the United States alone. Although most patients develop mild pancreatitis, 20% develop severe and/or necrotizing pancreatitis, requiring advanced medical and interventional care. Morbidity resulting from local and systemic complications as well as invasive interventions result in mortality rates historically as high as 30%. There has been substantial evolution of strategies for interventions in recent years, from open surgery to minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic step-up approaches. In contrast to the advances in invasive procedures for complications, early management still lacks curative options and consists of adequate fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and monitoring. Many challenges remain, including comprehensive management of the entire spectrum of the disease, which requires close involvement of multiple disciplines at specialized centers.

In the past decade, a significant amount of active and enthusiastic research has changed the way we treat acute pancreatitis (AP) within the first 24 hours of presentation. We highlight the importance of rapid initiation of treatment to help prevent the considerable morbidity and mortality that can occur when interventions are delayed. We review recent data that validate simple and accurate tools for prognostication of AP to replace the older, more tedious methods that relied on numerous factors and required up to 48 hours to complete. Additionally, we aim to provide evidence-based guidelines and end points for fluid resuscitation. Finally, we hope to bring clarification to two previously controversial topics in AP treatment: the use of prophylactic antibiotics and early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

### Acute pancreatitis with an emphasis on infection [^3e752815]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease that is mild and self-limiting in about 80% of cases. However, severe necrotizing disease still has a mortality of up to 30%. Differentiated multimodal treatment concepts are needed for these patients, including a multidisciplinary team (intensivists, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, and surgeons). The primary therapy is supportive. Patients with infected pancreatic necrosis who are septic undergo interventional or surgical treatment, ideally not before the fourth week after onset of symptoms. This article reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms of acute pancreatitis and describes clinical pathways for diagnosis and management based on the current literature and guidelines.

Nutrition

Another past teaching was that patients with AP should remain nothing by mouth to 'rest the pancreas', based on the premise that feeding stimulates the release of cholecystokinin, leading to an increase in proteolytic enzyme secretion, auto-digestion, and further damage to the pancreas. However, several studies have now shown that the early initiation of oral and enteral nutrition actually leads to reduced complications, reduced length of hospitalization, lower mortality, and improved prognosis. Enteral nutrition reduces the inflammatory response, improves intestinal barrier integrity, stimulates intestinal motility, prevents bacterial overgrowth, increases splanchnic blood flow, and prevents malnutrition, ultimately reducing the risk of bacterial translocation. The evidence supporting the clinical benefits of early enteral feeding in patients with moderately severe and severe AP is now considered definitive and plays a vital role in managing AP. Despite this strong recommendation, debate has continued. Most patients with mild and moderate pancreatitis, after a short period of fasting, can generally begin with clear liquids, followed by a gradual progression to a low-fat solid diet, and therefore typically do not require nutritional support interventions. The multicenter PADI (Immediate Oral Refeeding in Patients With Mild and Moderate Acute Pancreatitis) trial found that initiating a low-fat solid diet immediately after hospital admission, compared with the conventional oral refeeding approach (where the oral diet is progressively restarted once clinical and laboratory parameters improve), was safe and resulted in a significantly shorter length of stay without causing adverse effects or complications. Of note from this study, the elevation of amylase or lipase levels should not curtail the advancement of these patient's diet. For those who are unable to be fed orally, and in the absence of contraindications (such as intestinal failure, bowel obstruction, prolonged paralytic ileus, high-output intestinal fistulae, mesenteric ischemia, abdominal compartment syndrome, or inability to access the gut), early enteral tube feeding (within 24–48 hours of admission) should be initiated. The best route for enteral feeding in AP has been clarified. Historically, nasojejunal tube feeding was considered the best practice in patients with AP, based on the rationale that postpyloric feeding reduced the stimulus for pancreatic secretion and the risk of aspiration. However, numerous studies have shown that the early use of postpyloric feeding, as opposed to gastric feeding, does not correlate with any significant clinical advantages in critically ill patients, unless there is evidence of impaired gastric emptying. The best enteral formula for patients with AP has been thought to be elemental or semi-elemental formulas, based on their superior absorption profile, decreased pancreatic stimulation, and better tolerance. Numerous studies have been published in an attempt to answer the question. Petrov et al, published a meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials comparing the use of polymeric versus semi-elemental formulas in AP. They found no significant difference in feeding intolerance (FI), infectious complications, or death, and also concluded that neither the supplementation of enteral nutrition with probiotics nor the use of immune-modulating formulas significantly improved clinical outcomes. A large multicenter blinded randomized controlled trial is still needed. The recommendation to initiate early feeding is well-supported, but the reality is that not all patients with AP tolerate feeding. FI occurs in 13%–16% of patients fed orally and in up to 26% of patients with moderate to severe AP when fed enterally. FI is clearly associated with more severe disease and poorer outcomes. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should only be considered when oral or enteral feeds are not feasible or tolerated. In patients requiring TPN, adherence to goal-directed fluid resuscitation, provision of trophic doses of TPN to meet 20%–25% of protein and/or calorie requirements during the acute phases of illness, use of less-inflammatory intravenous lipid emulsions, and close monitoring of electrolytes, triglyceride levels, and vigilance for signs of refeeding syndrome all contribute to optimizing outcomes.

### Interventions for necrotising pancreatitis [^574b6cbb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute necrotising pancreatitis carries significant mortality, morbidity, and resource use. There is considerable uncertainty as to how people with necrotising pancreatitis should be treated.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of different interventions in people with acute necrotising pancreatitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers to April 2015 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCT). We also searched the references of included trials to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered only RCTs performed in people with necrotising pancreatitis, irrespective of aetiology, presence of infection, language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Review Manager 5 based on an available-case analysis using fixed-effect and random-effects models. We planned a network meta-analysis using Bayesian methods, but due to sparse data and uncertainty about the transitivity assumption, performed only indirect comparisons and used Frequentist methods.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs with 311 participants in this review. After exclusion of five participants, we included 306 participants in one or more outcomes. Five trials (240 participants) investigated the three main treatments: open necrosectomy (121 participants), minimally invasive step-up approach (80 participants), and peritoneal lavage (39 participants) and were included in the network meta-analysis. Three trials (66 participants) investigated the variations in the main treatments: early open necrosectomy (25 participants), delayed open necrosectomy (11 participants), video-assisted minimally invasive step-up approach (12 participants), endoscopic minimally invasive step-up approach (10 participants), minimally invasive step-up approach (planned surgery) (four participants), and minimally invasive step-up approach (continued percutaneous drainage) (four participants). The trials included infected or sterile necrotising pancreatitis of varied aetiology. All the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence was low or very low for all the outcomes. Overall, short-term mortality was 30% and serious adverse events rate was 139 serious adverse events per 100 participants. The differences in short-term mortality and proportion of people with serious adverse events were imprecise in all the comparisons. The number of serious adverse events and adverse events were fewer in the minimally invasive step-up approach compared to open necrosectomy (serious adverse events: rate ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.68; 88 participants; 1 study; adverse events: rate ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.68; 88 participants; 1 study). The proportion of people with organ failure and the mean costs were lower in the minimally invasive step-up approach compared to open necrosectomy (organ failure: OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60; 88 participants; 1 study; mean difference in costs: USD -11,922; P value < 0.05; 88 participants; 1 studies). There were more adverse events with video-assisted minimally invasive step-up approach group compared to endoscopic-assisted minimally invasive step-up approach group (rate ratio 11.70, 95% CI 1.52 to 89.87; 22 participants; 1 study), but the number of interventions per participant was less with video-assisted minimally invasive step-up approach group compared to endoscopic minimally invasive step-up approach group (difference in medians: 2 procedures; P value < 0.05; 20 participants; 1 study). The differences in any of the other comparisons for number of serious adverse events, proportion of people with organ failure, number of adverse events, length of hospital stay, and intensive therapy unit stay were either imprecise or were not consistent. None of the trials reported long-term mortality, infected pancreatic necrosis (trials that included participants with sterile necrosis), health-related quality of life at any time frame, proportion of people with adverse events, requirement for additional invasive intervention, time to return to normal activity, and time to return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

Low to very low quality evidence suggested that the minimally invasive step-up approach resulted in fewer adverse events, serious adverse events, less organ failure, and lower costs compared to open necrosectomy. Very low quality evidence suggested that the endoscopic minimally invasive step-up approach resulted in fewer adverse events than the video-assisted minimally invasive step-up approach but increased the number of procedures required for treatment. There is currently no evidence to suggest that early open necrosectomy is superior or inferior to peritoneal lavage or delayed open necrosectomy. However, the CIs were wide and significant benefits or harms of different treatments cannot be ruled out. The TENSION trial currently underway in Netherlands is assessing the optimal way to perform the minimally invasive step-up approach (endoscopic drainage followed by endoscopic necrosectomy if necessary versus percutaneous drainage followed by video-assisted necrosectomy if necessary) and is assessing important clinical outcomes of interest for this review. Implications for further research on this topic will be determined after the results of this RCT are available.

Introduction

In the majority of patients acute pancreatitis is a mild self-limiting disease. About fifteen percent of the patients develop severe disease defined by development of persistent organ failure. The mortality in acute pancreatitis is mainly associated with multiple organ failure whereas the risk of dying is minimal in patients with no or transient organ dysfunction. In acute pancreatitis, multiple organ failure is a consequence of excessive activation of a systemic inflammatory response cascade. Inflammatory mediators induce end-organ endothelial cell activation leading to increased permeability. Leaking microvessels cause a loss of intravascular fluid and in conjunction with vasodilatation lead to hypotension and shock. Accumulation of inflammatory cells in tissues, increased interstitial fluid and activation of coagulation with microvascular thrombosis further impair oxygen supply of tissues. Clinical manifestation of all this is a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which develops early during the course of acute pancreatitis. Over half of the patients with severe pancreatitis have signs of organ dysfunction on hospital admission and most of the organ dysfunctions develop within the first four days after admission. Over half of the deaths occur within the first week from onset of the disease, and deaths usually occurred within a week after manifestation of MODS.

Diagnosis, definitions and treatments

Two or more of the following three characteristics were used as a basis to diagnose acute pancreatitis: (1) Acute onset of persistent epigastric pain, usually radiating backwards; (2) Amylase activity (or serum lipase activity) at least 3 times higher than the upper normal level; and (3) Typical signs of pancreatitis on abdominal imaging. The etiology and severity of AP were determined according to the 2012 revised Atlanta classification criteria.

Local complications including WON, ANC, PP and APFC were diagnosed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). NP is diagnosed on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging as the absence of pancreatic or peripancreatic enhancement. By contrast, normal pancreatic parenchyma demonstrated homogeneous enhancement with contrast administration. Patterns of necrosis in necrotizing pancreatitis may involve a combination of pancreatic and peripancreatic parenchyma, isolated peripancreatic necrosis, or, less commonly, isolated pancreatic necrosis. Local complications in NP include acute necrotic collections (ANCs) and walled-off necrosis (WON). An ANC is a pancreatic or peripancreatic collection with liquid and/or solid necrosis within the first 4 weeks from symptom onset. After 4 weeks, the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis matures to WON, after a well-defined wall of inflammatory reactive tissue has developed. OF was determined according to the modified Marshall scoring system, and the distinction between persistent and transient OF has been described before. Death was recorded either as death during hospitalization, or in patients who were automatically discharged due to critical condition. Specific definitions are listed in Additional file 1: Table 1. In addition, we also recorded patient characteristics (age, sex, BMI), previous history (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking), shock, operative treatment and hospitalization to assess risk factors in each group.

A key element in the early treatment of AP is fluid resuscitation. Continuous regional arterial infusion (CRAI) has been used to infuse fluids, protease inhibitors, and/or antibiotics, theoretically resulting in increased drug and fluid concentrations in the pancreatic tissue. Aggressive hydration, defined as 250–500 mL per hour of isotonic crystalloid solution should be provided to all patients, unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidities exist. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial in the first 12–24 h. Lactated Ringer's solution was the preferred isotonic crystalloid replacement fluid administered to the patients.

### Acute pancreatitis: international classification and nomenclature [^f40494d5]. Clinical Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasing and it is associated with a major healthcare concern. New insights in the pathophysiology, better imaging techniques, and novel treatment options for complicated AP prompted the update of the 1992 Atlanta Classification. Updated nomenclature for pancreatic collections based on imaging criteria is proposed. Adoption of the newly Revised Classification of Acute Pancreatitis 2012 by radiologists should help standardise reports and facilitate accurate conveyance of relevant findings to referring physicians involved in the care of patients with AP. This review will clarify the nomenclature of pancreatic collections in the setting of AP.
