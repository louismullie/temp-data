## Question

In what time frame does DBS (deep brain stimulation) cure melanoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether deep brain stimulation can cure melanoma and, if so, how long that would take. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what DBS actually treats and whether cancer is among its indications. Then, I should verify standard-of-care therapies for melanoma across stages, including brain metastases. Next, I will examine whether the question might be confusing DBS with stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases. After that, I need to check any known relationship between Parkinson's disease, DBS, and melanoma risk. Finally, I will consider realistic time frames for melanoma treatment responses and contrast them with the time course of benefits from DBS, so I can give a precise answer with proper references.

> Let me first confirm what DBS is and is not. Deep brain stimulation is a neurosurgical neuromodulation therapy that implants electrodes in nodes such as the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus internus to alleviate motor symptoms in movement disorders like Parkinson's disease, with demonstrated efficacy in randomized trials and mechanistic support from neurophysiology studies, but it is not an oncologic therapy and does not treat melanoma or any cancer directly [^113fDcXm] [^114mznpE] [^114uHGvf] [^1142tG37] [^113UD2cA] [^113W8FZb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what, then, treats melanoma. I need to verify standard melanoma care: for primary cutaneous melanoma, surgery with appropriate margins or, in select in situ lentigo maligna sites, Mohs/staged excision is recommended, whereas advanced or metastatic disease relies on systemic therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab) and targeted therapy for BRAF-mutated tumors (e.g., dabrafenib plus trametinib) per major guidelines and regulatory labels, none of which include DBS as a cancer treatment [^notfound] [^113JJRyX] [^113BcsLk] [^1133j88i] [^114z2R7w].

> Wait, let me verify a likely source of confusion: DBS versus stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a radiation technique used for intracranial metastases including melanoma, with guidance favoring early SRS when indicated and multidisciplinary coordination; meanwhile, for asymptomatic melanoma brain metastases, modern guidelines also support upfront systemic therapy such as ipilimumab plus nivolumab, sometimes without initial radiation, highlighting that SRS and systemic therapy — not DBS — are the relevant modalities in this space [^111vkmMG] [^113q7voB] [^114umwWC] [^1113ovos] [^112X2kyH].

> I should confirm whether DBS has any relationship to melanoma risk, just to be thorough. Epidemiologic data show patients with Parkinson's disease have a 2- to 6-fold increased melanoma risk, observed across cohorts including early-treated PD, and this risk is thought to relate to PD biology or dopaminergic therapies rather than the DBS device itself; thus, dermatologic surveillance is advised in PD populations, but this does not imply DBS treats melanoma in any way [^115Xa8DN] [^115JzxHK] [^11687kCX] [^114NzL95].

> Let me think about time frames now, because the user asked "how long to cure" with DBS. Since DBS is not a melanoma treatment, there is no DBS time frame to cure melanoma; instead, response kinetics depend on the actual oncologic therapy used: immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK targeted combinations can produce responses over weeks to months in metastatic melanoma, with durable remissions seen in a subset, as reflected in regulatory trial programs and contemporary guidance on sequencing local therapy for brain metastases [^1133j88i] [^114z2R7w] [^113q7voB].

> Hold on, I should also verify the DBS clinical time course to avoid conflating timelines. For Parkinson's disease, benefits from DBS typically emerge within weeks and are formally documented by about 6 months in randomized trials, with sustained motor improvements for years in many patients, though effect sizes can wane over the longer term; again, these timelines pertain to motor symptom control in PD, not melanoma treatment or cure [^113fDcXm] [^114mznpE] [^1142tG37] [^1124CcDj].

> But wait, what if the user really meant stereotactic radiosurgery instead of DBS. If the intent was SRS for melanoma brain metastases, I should emphasize that early SRS and close MRI surveillance are preferred when indicated within a multidisciplinary plan, and in selected asymptomatic patients, upfront ipilimumab plus nivolumab may be offered without immediate radiation, underscoring that the optimal sequence is individualized and evidence-based, whereas DBS has no role in melanoma control [^111vkmMG] [^113q7voB] [^114umwWC] [^1113ovos].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is crystal clear. Deep brain stimulation does not cure melanoma at any time frame because it is not an oncologic therapy; melanoma care relies on surgery, systemic immunotherapy or targeted therapy, and, for brain metastases, stereotactic radiosurgery and carefully selected systemic regimens, with treatment timing and expectations guided by disease stage, mutation status, symptoms, and multidisciplinary evaluation [^113BcsLk] [^111PtX8U] [^111vkmMG] [^113q7voB] [^1133j88i] [^114z2R7w].

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) **does not cure melanoma** [^111vkmMG] and is not used to treat it [^112X2kyH]. DBS is a neurosurgical therapy for neurological and psychiatric disorders [^113UD2cA], including Parkinson's disease [^113fDcXm], essential tremor, dystonia, and select psychiatric conditions [^113UD2cA]. There is **no evidence** or clinical rationale for DBS in melanoma [^111vkmMG]; it has no effect on tumor growth, metastasis, or survival. Melanoma is managed with **surgery, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation** — not DBS [^113JJRyX] [^1133j88i] [^113BcsLk] [^113q7voB] [^111vkmMG].

### Deep brain stimulation: Current challenges and future directions [^113UD2cA]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The clinical use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is among the most important advances in the clinical neurosciences in the past two decades. As a surgical tool, DBS can directly measure pathological brain activity and deliver adjustable stimulation for therapeutic effect in neurological and psychiatric disorders correlated with dysfunctional circuitry. The development of DBS has opened new opportunities to access and interrogate malfunctioning brain circuits and to test the therapeutic potential of regulating the output of these circuits in a broad range of disorders.

Despite the success and rapid adoption of DBS, crucial questions remain, including which brain areas should be targeted and in which patients. This review considers how DBS has facilitated advances in our understanding of how circuit malfunction can lead to brain disorders and outlines the key unmet challenges and future directions in the DBS field. Determining the next steps in DBS science will help to define the future role of this technology in the development of novel therapeutics for the most challenging disorders affecting the human brain.

### Case report: Adjuvant breast cancer radiation therapy in a patient with an implanted deep brain stimulation device [^116w5Nen]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to treat movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia. The system consists of one or more electrode leads implanted in the brain and a wire or extension connected to an implanted pulse generator (IPG). The IPG is a battery-powered neurostimulator placed subcutaneously, typically just inferior to the clavicle. Unlike pacemakers and defibrillators, there are few publications reporting the effects of irradiating DBS systems. The manufacturer's recommendation is to shield the device from direct radiation. However, this presents difficulty when the target to be treated is adjacent to the device. Borkenhagen et al. reported a case in which a patient received treatment to a target in the left lung that was within 3 mm of the device. Other authors have reported cases where the electrode leads received a full dose and the IPG received a low dose due to scatter. In this report, we present a case of a patient undergoing radiation therapy to her left chest wall and supraclavicular region with an implanted DBS within the target volume.

### The return of the lesion for localization and therapy [^116Gjyrx]. Brain (2023). Low credibility.

Historically, pathological brain lesions provided the foundation for the localization of symptoms, and therapeutic lesions were used as a treatment for brain diseases. New medications, functional neuroimaging, and deep brain stimulation have led to a decline in lesions in the past few decades. However, recent advances have improved our ability to localize lesion-induced symptoms, including localization to brain circuits rather than individual brain regions. Improved localization can lead to more precise treatment targets, which may mitigate the traditional advantages of deep brain stimulation over lesions, such as reversibility and tunability.

New tools for creating therapeutic brain lesions, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound, allow for lesions to be placed without a skin incision and are already in clinical use for tremor. Although there are limitations and caution is warranted, improvements in lesion-based localization are refining our therapeutic targets. Improved technology is providing new ways to create therapeutic lesions, which together may facilitate the return of the lesion.

### Update on treatments for Parkinson's disease motor fluctuations - An International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society evidence-based medicine review [^1142tG37]. Movement Disorders (2025). High credibility.

- **Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation efficacy conclusion**: High-quality evidence indicates that subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is efficacious in improving motor impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who experience motor fluctuations on oral levodopa therapy. Additionally, STN DBS effectively improves disability, as measured by activities of daily living in the off-medication state, and enhances health-related quality of life (HR-QoL).

- **Summary**: Eight RCTs evaluated the efficacy of STN DBS in treating motor fluctuations in patients with PD, comparing it to the best medical therapy (BMT) or delayed stimulation. Seven studies reported improvement in motor impairment, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) in the off-medication state, with an average improvement of 18.6 points in the STN DBS group. One sham (subtherapeutic stimulation) controlled trial showed a difference in the increase in ON-time without troublesome dyskinesia of 3.0 hours (P < 0.0001). Three studies reported the effect of DBS on the number of hours spent in the on-medication state, with an average difference between the STN DBS group and the control of 2.6 hours. Four studies assessed the effect of STN DBS on disability, as measured by activities of daily living in the off-medication state, showing moderate evidence for improvement ranging from 4.5 to 8.8 points on the UPDRS-II. Four studies evaluated the effect of STN DBS on quality of life, indicating that STN DBS improves quality of life, with improvement ranging between 6.5 and 10.0 points on the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) summary index. Considering the surgical nature of the intervention, the…

### Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation evokes resonant neural activity [^114iuKXB]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a rapidly expanding treatment for neurological and psychiatric conditions; however, a target-specific biomarker is required to optimize therapy. Here, we show that DBS evokes a large-amplitude resonant neural response focally in the subthalamic nucleus. This response is greatest in the dorsal region (the clinically optimal stimulation target for Parkinson's disease), coincides with improved clinical performance, is chronically recordable, and is present under general anesthesia. These features make it a readily utilizable electrophysiological signal that could potentially be used for guiding electrode implantation surgery and tailoring DBS therapy to improve patient outcomes.

### Report of whole-brain radiation therapy in a patient with an implanted deep brain stimulator: Important neurosurgical considerations and radiotherapy practice principles [^113YjpEM]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with implanted neuromodulation devices present potential challenges for radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery. Although guidelines exist regarding the irradiation of cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, fewer data and less clinical experience exist regarding the effects of radiation therapy on less frequently used devices, such as deep brain stimulators. A 79-year-old woman with a history of coarse tremors effectively managed with deep brain stimulation presented with multiple intracranial metastases from a newly diagnosed lung cancer and was referred for whole-brain radiation therapy. She was treated with a German helmet technique to a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions using 6 MV photons via opposed lateral fields, with the neurostimulator turned off prior to delivery of each fraction.

The patient tolerated the treatment well with no acute complications and no apparent change in the functionality of her neurostimulator device or effect on her underlying neuromuscular disorder. This represents the first reported case of the safe delivery of whole-brain radiation therapy in a patient with an implanted neurostimulator device. In cases such as this, neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists should have discussions with patients about the risks of brain injury, device malfunction, or failure of the device, and plans for rigorous testing of the device before and after radiation therapy.

### Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM): Decoding MRI data for a tissue magnetic biomarker [^111K16XK]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can improve visualization of the target in deep brain stimulation (DBS), which involves the surgical implementation of stimulating electrodes in the subthalamic nuclei (STN) or the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) for treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). The anatomical accuracy of electrode lead placement is critical for a successful surgical outcome. Intraoperative CT, typically used to guide DBS, has poor contrast for the basal ganglia structures. MRI provides better tissue contrast than CT; however, the visualization contrast for STN and GPi remains poor in standard T2-weighted imaging. High-field MRI using T2✱ weighted imaging has been sought for DBS. QSM can be used to remove the blurring present in T2✱ weighted imaging and improve the contrast-to-noise ratio for the visualization of the STN.

- **Figure 10**: Quantitative susceptibility mapping for visualizing deep brain stimulation targets. The globus pallidus interna (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), surgical targets for deep brain stimulation, are either invisible or inseparable from surrounding tissues on T2-weighted images (with zoom), but are clearly visualized on deep brain stimulation (QSM) (with zoom). Other basal ganglia structures well-defined on QSM include the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) and substantia nigra (SN). Source: Liu et al. Radiology, 2013; 269:216–23.

### Lodosyn [^115Xa8DN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Epidemiological studies have indicated that patients with Parkinson's disease have a 2- to 6-fold higher risk of developing melanoma compared to the general population. It remains uncertain whether this increased risk is attributable to Parkinson's disease itself or other factors, such as the drugs used for its treatment.

Given these considerations, it is advisable for both patients and healthcare providers to monitor for melanomas frequently when using Lodosyn tablets for Parkinson's disease. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be conducted by appropriately qualified individuals, such as dermatologists.

In February 2020, while still experiencing a positive response to intermittent dabrafenib dosing, the patient suffered a debilitating ischemic stroke unrelated to melanoma. After a period of partial recovery, dabrafenib was restarted, which allowed her to coexist with her disease and maintain a good quality of life. This was despite a gradual loss of disease control, with multiple metastases observed on imaging by February 2021. She ceased treatment completely in March 2021 and was admitted for end-of-life hospice care in July 2021.

### Evolving treatment options for melanoma brain metastases [^111CuAPY]. The Lancet Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Melanoma is a leading cause of lost productivity due to premature cancer mortality. It frequently spreads to the brain, leading to rapid deterioration in both quality and quantity of life. Until now, treatment options have been restricted to surgery and radiotherapy; however, neither modality has been well studied in clinical trials.

The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecularly targeted agents for the treatment of metastatic melanoma marks a significant advancement, as these are active against brain metastases and offer new opportunities to improve disease outcomes. Despite these advancements, new challenges arise, such as how to integrate or sequence multiple treatment modalities, and practices vary widely.

In this review, we summarize evidence for the treatment of melanoma brain metastases and discuss the rationale and evidence for combination modalities, highlighting areas for future research.

### Opdivo [^1133j88i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

CHECKMATE-067 (NCT01844505) was a multicenter, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind trial in 945 patients with previously untreated, unresectable, or metastatic melanoma. The patients were assigned to one of the following treatment arms: Opdivo and ipilimumab, Opdivo alone, or ipilimumab alone. Patients were required to have completed adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment at least 6 weeks prior to randomization and have no prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Additionally, they must have presented no evidence of active brain metastasis, ocular melanoma, autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression.

Patients were randomized to receive:

- **Opdivo and ipilimumab arm**: Opdivo 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by Opdivo as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks.

- **Opdivo arm**: Opdivo 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks.

- **Ipilimumab arm**: Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by a placebo every 2 weeks.

Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥ 5% vs. < 5% tumor cell membrane expression) as determined by a clinical trial assay, BRAF V600 mutation status, and M stage per the AJCC staging system (M0, M1a, M1b vs. M1c). Tumor assessments were conducted 12 weeks after randomization, then every 6 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy outcome measures included confirmed overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response.

### Neuropsychological changes following deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson's disease: Comparisons of treatment at pallidal and subthalamic targets versus best medical therapy [^116ReLV2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), but questions remain regarding neuropsychological decrements sometimes associated with this treatment, including rates of statistically and clinically meaningful change and whether there are differences in outcomes related to surgical targets.

- **Methods**: Neuropsychological functioning was assessed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) at baseline and after six months in a prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing best medical therapy (BMT, n = 116) and bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS, n = 164) at either the subthalamic nucleus (STN, n = 84) or globus pallidus interna (GPi, n = 80), using standardized neuropsychological tests. Measures of functional outcomes were also administered.

- **Results**: Comparison of the two DBS targets revealed few significant group differences. STN DBS was associated with greater mean reductions on some measures of processing speed, only one of which was statistically significant in comparison with stimulation of GPi. GPi DBS was associated with lower mean performance on one measure of learning and memory that requires mental control and cognitive flexibility. Compared to the group receiving BMT, the combined DBS group had significantly greater mean reductions at 6-month follow-up in performance on multiple measures of processing speed and working memory. After calculating thresholds for statistically reliable change from data obtained from the BMT group, the combined DBS group also displayed higher rates of decline in neuropsychological test performance.

### Overdiagnosis in malignant melanoma: A scoping review [^112JfGmf]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

We aimed to systematically identify and scrutinize published empirical evidence about overdiagnosis in malignant melanoma and examine how frequent overdiagnosis of melanoma is, and whether this is related to different types of interventions or diagnostic technologies.

- **Design and setting**: Empirical studies that discussed overdiagnosis in malignant melanoma were eligible, including qualitative and quantitative studies in any type of population, age group, and geographical location. Studies that did not include empirical data, studies that only mentioned 'overdiagnosis' without addressing it further, and studies that used the term overdiagnosis for cases of misdiagnosis or false positives were excluded. We developed the search strategy in cooperation with an information specialist. Five databases were searched on 21 April 2022: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. This scoping review adheres to The JBI methodology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts for inclusion and extracted data from the included studies. The data extracted include study characteristics, population details, research question, the context, and the study's main results.

- **Results**: Our search resulted in 1,134 potentially relevant studies. Thirty-five studies were included: 29 register studies, 3 cohort studies, 1 case-control study, 1 survey study, and 1 randomized controlled trial. Most register studies examined trends in melanoma incidence and/or mortality.

### Deep brain stimulation plus best medical therapy versus best medical therapy alone for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD SURG trial): a randomised, open-label trial [^113XkLUx]. The Lancet Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

In the medical therapy group, 12 patients had surgery between baseline and 1 year (figure 1), of whom three received surgery between 10 months and 12 months after random allocation but completed 1-year assessments before surgery. A total of 118 patients randomly allocated to medical therapy had surgery at or after 1 year.

The mean change between baseline and 1 year on the PDQ-39 summary index was −5.0 points in the surgery group and −0.3 points in the medical therapy group (difference −4.7 points, 95% CI −7.6 to −1.8, p = 0.001; table 2). The mean change in the PDQ-39 summary index between baseline and 1 year ranged from less than −30 to more than 30 (figure 2). The difference in mean change in score between baseline and 1 year was −8.9 for the PDQ-39 domain of mobility (95% CI −13.8 to −4.0; p = 0.0004), −12.4 for activities of daily living (−17.3 to −7.5; p < 0.0001), −7.5 for bodily discomfort (−12.6 to −2.4; p = 0.004), and −5.2 for stigma (−10.4 to 0.03; p = 0.05).

### Patient-reported outcome measures and validation data used in melanoma research and routine practice: A systematic review [^116QvKYP]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used in melanoma research and to guide clinical practice; however, the validation of these PROMs for use in melanoma populations is unknown.

- **Objective**: To conduct a systematic review and construct an evidence gap map to identify PROMs that have been used in melanoma research and clinical practice and related melanoma-specific validation data.

- **Evidence review**: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Index Medicus, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsychINFO were searched in January 2025, including any studies that used a PROM to evaluate outcomes of patients with melanoma published from January 1, 2010, onward to identify instruments relevant to the era of melanoma diagnosis and treatment.

- **Findings**: Of 30,895 abstracts screened, 136 articles detailing 124 studies were included in this review; a total of 32,784 participants were included. There were 52 cross-sectional studies (41%), 31 randomized clinical trials (25%), 23 longitudinal studies (19%), 8 pre-post studies (6%), 6 cohort studies (5%), 1 retrospective analysis (1%), 1 phase 4 trial (1%), 1 protocol (1%), and 1 quasi-experimental trial (1%). A total of 61 studies (49%) included a melanoma treatment, with immunotherapy being the most common (24 [39%]), followed by surgery (7 [11%]), and chemotherapy (7 [11%]). These 124 studies used 110 unique PROMs, with patient emotional/psychological well-being (28 [25%]), health-related quality of life (21 [19%]), and patient self-functioning, efficacy, and coping strategies (20).

### Malignant melanoma in early Parkinson's disease: The DATATOP trial [^11687kCX]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The available epidemiological data on the incidence of malignant melanoma in Parkinson's disease are contradictory. The role of levodopa therapy in this context has been debated. We identified all known cases of malignant melanoma (N = 5) in the DATATOP clinical trial cohort and compared them to published expected values (N = 1.5) for a standard healthy population. The standardized event ratio was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–7.8), indicating that the incidence of malignant melanoma was higher than expected. We found no association between levodopa therapy and the incidence of melanoma.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^113JJRyX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for cutaneous melanoma, specifically with respect to the management of melanoma in situ, the AAD 2019 guidelines recommend considering Mohs micrographic surgery or staged excision with paraffin-embedded permanent sections. This is particularly advised for patients with melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type, located on the face, ears, or scalp, as it allows for tissue-sparing excision and exhaustive histologic assessment of peripheral margins.

### Mohs micrographic surgery in a patient with a deep brain stimulator: A review of the literature on implantable electrical devices [^113DQJiK]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Implantable electrical devices are becoming increasingly common in the patient population presenting for Mohs micrographic surgery. In addition to understanding the potential intraoperative complications with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and pacemakers, the Mohs surgeon needs to be aware of the relatively new treatment of movement disorders using implanted deep brain stimulators.

- **Objective**: We present only the second reported case of Mohs surgery in a patient with a deep brain stimulator. In an attempt to help minimize adverse events during a procedure, we review the more commonly encountered electrical devices as well as the newer deep brain stimulators. We provide guidelines for the avoidance of electromagnetic interference during an electrosurgical procedure.

- **Methods**: This 76-year-old patient with Parkinson's disease and an implanted deep brain stimulator underwent Mohs surgery for excision of a squamous cell carcinoma on the ear. To minimize electromagnetic interference with his implanted device, hemostasis was obtained with the aid of a battery-operated heat-generating handheld electrocautery device.

- **Results**: The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications or reports of discomfort.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with implanted electrical devices are subject to electromagnetic interference during an electrosurgical procedure. Care must be taken in this expanding patient population during a Mohs surgical procedure.

### Development of the knee quality of life (KQoL-26) 26-item questionnaire: Data quality, reliability, validity and responsiveness [^117SeaKf]. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2008). High credibility.

The Knee Quality of Life (KQoL-26) is a 26-item questionnaire designed to assess the quality of life in patients with knee conditions. It serves as a clinical calculator for meniscal tears and anterior cruciate ligament injury. This tool is applicable to patients suffering from various knee disorders, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-traumatic knee injuries.

The KQoL-26 provides a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's physical function, mental health, social interaction, and general health status related to their knee condition. It is a valuable tool for clinicians to monitor disease progression, evaluate the effectiveness of treatment interventions, and guide decision-making in clinical practice. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it may not be suitable for patients with cognitive impairments or language barriers that prevent them from understanding or accurately completing the questionnaire.

The questionnaire assesses how knee-related issues affect an individual's day-to-day activities and emotional well-being. It comprises 26 items covering various physical tasks and emotional states, where respondents rate their experiences in dealing with their knee condition. Each of the 26 items follows a scoring system that translates responses into numerical scores, representing the impact level of knee issues for activities such as "lifting heavy objects", "running", and "walking on uneven surfaces".

### Reoperation for suboptimal outcomes after deep brain stimulation surgery [^115Viqq4]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine a case series of reoperations for deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads in which clinical scenarios revealed suboptimal outcomes from a previous operation. Suboptimally placed DBS leads are one potential reason for unsatisfactory results after surgery for Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor (ET), or dystonia. In a previous study of patients experiencing suboptimal results, 19 of 41 patients had misplaced leads. Similarly, another report commented that lead placement beyond a 2- to 3-mm window resulted in inadequate clinical benefit; in one patient, revision improved the outcome. The goal of the study was to perform an unblinded retrospective chart review of DBS patients with unsatisfactory outcomes who presented for reoperation.

Methods involved patients who had DBS lead replacements after reoperation, assessed through a retrospective review of an institutional review board-approved movement disorders database. Cases of reoperation for suboptimal clinical benefit were included, while cases of replacement of DBS leads caused by infection or hardware malfunction were excluded. Data points studied included age, disease duration, diagnosis, motor outcomes (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III in PD, Tremor Rating Scale in ET, and Unified Dystonia Rating Scale in dystonia), quality of life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 in PD), and the Clinician Global Impression scale. The data from before and after reoperation were examined to determine the estimated impact of repeat surgery.

Unfortunately, the results section seems to be truncated, beginning with "There were 11 patients with P", therefore further analysis is necessary to provide comprehensive results.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous melanoma, more specifically with respect to the management of advanced/metastatic disease and management of brain metastases, the CNS 2025 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend interstitial modalities. This includes interstitial chemotherapy or radiation (brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy) in patients with parenchymal brain metastases.

### The global burden of melanoma: Results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 [^113xC9Ak]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Regarding national melanoma treatment guidelines, a review article comparing the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand found that the Australian Cancer Network (ACN), responsible for guideline generation in Australia and New Zealand, produced the strictest follow-up recommendations for patients with melanoma of any stage, including the use of ultrasound in surveillance of lymph node recurrence. While the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) does not issue a consensus on routine melanoma screening, the ACN has recommended against population-based screening. The ACN and NCCN generally share recommendations regarding biopsy and excision guidelines.

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) relies on the premise that estimates based on high-quality analyses and prediction models, while imperfect, are better than no data at all. Estimations for areas lacking cancer data are dependent on covariate selection and regional patterns. This highlights the importance of a global effort to improve vital registration systems and cancer registries. There are a number of limitations to the use of the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) in regard to melanoma. Because the stage of diagnosis is not incorporated, melanoma DALYs may change with time, as increased early detection leads to a higher proportion of detected melanomas at an early stage. Similarly, with recent progress in advanced melanoma treatment and prognosis, the disability from melanoma is likely to change over time, making temporal DALY comparisons difficult.

### Comparison of direct cortical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation in brain tumor surgery: Systematic review and meta analyses [^1121bJ2R]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Brain malignancy and central nervous system malignancy present two of the most challenging problems in the field of oncology. Brain tumors located near or within eloquent areas pose additional challenges for neurosurgeons. Electrical stimulation, whether direct or through other methods, may be necessary for proper mapping of these eloquent areas, thus creating a proper resection guide. Minimal resection aims to preserve patient neurological function and ensure quality of life.

- **Methods**: This research is a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at comparing outcomes, primarily adverse event analysis, between direct cortical stimulation (DCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

- **Results**: Fourteen studies were identified from the 2010 to 2023 interval. While this number is adequate, most studies were neither randomized nor accompanied by blinding. The meta-analysis conducted as a hypothesis test demonstrated that TMS is not inferior to DCS regarding motoric and lingual outcomes, marked subjectively by diamond location and objectively through a p-value above 0.05.

- **Conclusion**: TMS is a noninvasive imaging method for evaluating eloquent brain areas and is not inferior to the invasive gold-standard imaging method (DCS). However, its role as an adjunct to DCS, and as an alternative when awake surgery is not available, must be emphasized.

### Neurophysiological mechanisms of deep brain stimulation across spatiotemporal resolutions [^113W8FZb]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Deep brain stimulation is a neuromodulatory treatment for managing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Electrodes are chronically implanted in disease-relevant brain regions, and pulsatile electrical stimulation delivery is intended to restore neurocircuit function. However, the widespread interest in the application and expansion of this clinical therapy has preceded an overarching understanding of the neurocircuit alterations invoked by deep brain stimulation. Over the years, various forms of neurophysiological evidence have emerged, demonstrating changes to brain activity across spatiotemporal resolutions; from single neuron, to local field potential, to brain-wide cortical network effects. Though fruitful, such studies have often led to debate about a singular putative mechanism.

In this update, we aim to produce an integrative account of complementary, instead of mutually exclusive, neurophysiological effects to derive a generalizable concept of the mechanisms of deep brain stimulation. In particular, we offer a critical review of the most common historical competing theories, an updated discussion on recent literature from animal and human neurophysiological studies, and a synthesis of synaptic and network effects of deep brain stimulation across scales of observation, including micro-, meso-, and macroscale circuit alterations.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease: Executive summary [^116XACqp]. Neurosurgery (2018). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Parkinson's disease, specifically deep brain stimulation, the AANS/CNS 2018 guidelines recommend considering globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation rather than subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation. This recommendation is particularly relevant if there is significant concern about cognitive decline, especially in relation to processing speed and working memory in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation, while taking other goals of surgery into consideration.

### Deep brain stimulation of the internal capsule enhances human cognitive control and prefrontal cortex function [^115NhqCK]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

A popular theory of DBS' mechanism of action suggests that this deep brain intervention acts primarily on the cortex by stimulating cortical projections to the implant site. Our results support this theory, finding oscillatory changes in multiple regions whose thalamic projections traverse the VCVS. The effect is only seen in task-related theta, suggesting that DBS specifically modulates functional ensembles that activate during effortful cognitive control. The correlation between that theta modulation and clinical outcomes suggests a potential physiologically informed approach to psychiatric DBS.

The present practice of adjusting stimulation based on patients' subjective report of immediate mood changes leads to clinician/patient frustration, adverse clinical outcomes, and missed clinical trial endpoints. In future studies, stimulation parameters might directly be titrated to change a theta biomarker, rather than relying on ad hoc clinician opinion. For instance, patients might continuously perform tasks requiring effortful cognitive control, with continuous monitoring of the trial-to-trial induced oscillations. Stimulation parameters such as intensity and location along the dorso-ventral axis of the internal capsule could then be adjusted, either manually by a programming clinician or under computer control.

Next-generation DBS hardware is already capable of self-titrating stimulation to achieve an electrophysiologic response, and we have described early examples of frameworks for this type of task-driven programming.

### Keytruda [^114z2R7w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The study population characteristics were as follows: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89); 60% male; 98% White; 66% had no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; 69% with an ECOG PS of 0; 80% had PD-L1 positive melanoma, 18% had PD-L1 negative melanoma, and 2% had unknown PD-L1 status using the IUO assay; 65% had M1c stage disease; 68% with normal LDH; 36% with reported BRAF mutation-positive melanoma; and 9% with a history of brain metastases. Among patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma, 139 (46%) were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor.

The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS for patients randomized to Keytruda compared to ipilimumab. Among the 91 patients randomized to Keytruda 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.4+ to 8.1+ months. Among the 94 patients randomized to Keytruda 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.4+ to 8.2 months.

### Evolving treatment landscape: 18 years of managing melanoma in a single patient [^11693rDb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Our case demonstrates how an individual patient diagnosed with melanoma was able to gain benefit from a series of new interventions that became available during the course of her 18-year illness. Alongside her treatment, she was able to maintain a good quality of life. Her own expressed wish was to become a grandmother, and she achieved and enjoyed this to the full. Her disease was managed through a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of specialists working to good effect. The MDT was able to take advantage of effective international research and clinical trials, as well as guidance from national regulators and commissioners who took bold decisions at the time to provide patients with significant unmet need access to high-cost drugs, based on sound health economic assessments confirming their cost-effectiveness.

- **Patient's perspective**: During my long and varied 'assault' on my disease, I always felt that every day of my survival was one day closer to the eventual discovery through constant research of a cure. I felt many times that I was living with a chronic disease when receiving a new drug or therapy and enjoyed a useful and good quality of life for much of the time. A minor but important point to my own well-being is that I have never worried about what tomorrow may or may not bring, and only put my energies into what challenges today presents.

- **Learning points**: The treatment landscape of melanoma has been radically transformed this century and particularly over the last decade. The impact of both new non-surgical therapies and surgical interventions has extended life significantly.

### A randomized trial of deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease [^113fDcXm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Neurostimulation of the subthalamic nucleus reduces levodopa-related motor complications in advanced Parkinson's disease. We compared this treatment plus medication with medical management.

- **Methods**: In this randomized-pairs trial, we enrolled 156 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and severe motor symptoms. The primary end points were the changes from baseline to six months in the quality of life, as assessed by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and the severity of symptoms without medication, according to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (UPDRS-III).

- **Results**: Pairwise comparisons showed that neurostimulation, as compared with medication alone, caused greater improvements from baseline to six months in the PDQ-39 (50 of 78 pairs, P = 0.02) and the UPDRS-III (55 of 78, P < 0.001), with mean improvements of 9.5 and 19.6 points, respectively. Neurostimulation resulted in improvements of 24 to 38 percent in the PDQ-39 subscales for mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, and bodily discomfort. Serious adverse events were more common with neurostimulation than with medication alone (13 percent vs. 4 percent, P < 0.04) and included a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage. The overall frequency of adverse events was higher in the medication group (64 percent vs. 50 percent, P = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: In this six-month study of patients under 75 years of age with severe motor complications of Parkinson's disease, neurostimulation of the subthalamic nucleus was more effective than medical management alone.

### Melanoma brain metastases: An unmet challenge in the era of active therapy [^113pZ4p6]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Metastatic disease to the brain is a frequent manifestation of melanoma and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and a poor prognosis. Surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery provide local control but less frequently affect the overall outcome of melanoma brain metastases (MBM). The role of systemic therapies for active brain lesions has been largely underinvestigated, and patients with active brain lesions are excluded from the vast majority of clinical trials. The advent of active systemic therapy has revolutionized the care of melanoma patients, but this benefit has not been systematically translated into intracranial activity.

This article reviews the biology and clinical outcomes of patients with MBM, as well as the evidence supporting the use of radiation, surgery, and systemic therapy in MBM. Prospective studies that included patients with active MBM have shown clinical intracranial activity that parallels systemic activity and support the inclusion of patients with active MBM in clinical trials involving novel agents and combination therapies.

### Integrating direct electrical brain stimulation with the human connectome [^1154RW4B]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

Recent methodological developments have allowed researchers to link lesions in different brain locations to a common neuroanatomical substrate using the human connectome, a detailed representation of how brain regions communicate with each other to form large-scale functional networks. In this report, we seek to integrate the largest direct electrical brain stimulation (DES) dataset ever collected in glioma patients with functional connectome mapping performed on a large normative population of 1,000 healthy individuals. This approach leverages network hubs to build a multivariate normative model capable of quantifying single-subject deviation from a reference population. By doing so, we aim to extend DES mapping toward the exploration of its network manifestation at the whole brain level and with single-subject resolution. This provides a viable solution to the need for causally driven brain maps for neuromodulation therapies and a wide spectrum of clinical and surgical applications.

### Spinal cord stimulation and deep brain stimulation for disorders of consciousness: A systematic review and individual patient data analysis of 608 cases [^112iQUrY]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

The application of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) for disorders of consciousness (DoC) has been increasingly reported. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine how effective and safe SCS and DBS are for DoC due to various methodological limitations. We conducted a systematic review to elucidate the safety and efficacy of SCS and DBS for DoC by systematically reviewing related literature by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Library.

Twenty eligible studies with 608 patients were included in this study.

- **Efficacy of SCS for DoC**: Ten studies with 508 patients reported the efficacy of SCS for DoC, and the estimated overall effectiveness rate was 37%. Five studies with 343 patients reported the efficacy of SCS for vegetative state (VS), with an estimated effectiveness rate of 30%. Three studies with 53 patients reported the efficacy of SCS for minimally conscious state (MCS), with an estimated effectiveness rate of 63%.

- **Efficacy of DBS for DoC**: Five studies with 92 patients reported the efficacy of DBS for DoC, and the estimated overall effectiveness rate was 40%. Four studies with 63 patients reported the efficacy of DBS for VS, with an estimated effectiveness rate of 26%. Three studies with 19 patients reported the efficacy of DBS for MCS, with an estimated effectiveness rate of 74%.

- **Adverse event rates**: The adverse event rate was 8.1% after SCS and 18.2% after DBS.

These results suggest that SCS and DBS can be considered reasonable treatments for DoC with considerable efficacy and safety.

### Selecting deep brain stimulation or infusion therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: An evidence-based review [^112aHv6e]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

For STN–DBS, strong evidence supports a favorable impact on mild to moderate depression and anxiety after 6 to 12 months, while weaker evidence suggests possible deleterious effects on apathy, psychosis, impulsivity, and emotional processing. Conflicting data exist regarding the effects of STN–DBS in patients with impulse control disorders or dopa dysregulation syndrome. Favorable outcomes may require withdrawal of dopaminergic medication. Ongoing psychotic or severe depressive episodes (with or without suicidal ideation) are DBS contraindications but may be treated and DBS performed after remission. Fewer reports exist of neuropsychiatric complications with GPi–DBS, possibly reflecting publication bias.

Based on limited evidence, apomorphine may improve mood and anxiety but is associated with a risk of psychosis, confusion, and disinhibited behavior. Clinical experience suggests caution in patients with impulse control disorders. The available data for DLI do not allow firm conclusions on neuropsychiatric safety, but open-label data suggest it may be best tolerated of all three options in patients with a history of psychosis. No evidence exists to comment on ongoing psychosis or impulse control disorders. It is recommended that neuropsychiatric assessment is carried out before any device-aided therapy and that patients with a previous psychiatric history receive post-treatment neuropsychiatric surveillance.

- **Medical co-morbidities**: Do any medical co-morbidities preclude a particular treatment? Little evidence relates to medical co-morbidities, mainly because studies excl

### Optimized, minimal specific absorption rate MRI for high-resolution imaging in patients with implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes [^111MMjbT]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). High credibility.

Obtaining high-resolution brain MR imaging in patients with a previously implanted deep brain stimulator has been challenging and avoided by many centers due to safety concerns relating to implantable devices. We present our experience with a practical clinical protocol at 1.5T by using two magnet systems capable of achieving presurgical quality imaging in patients undergoing bilateral, staged deep brain stimulator insertion.

- **Materials and methods**: Protocol optimization was performed to minimize the specific absorption rate while providing the image quality necessary for adequate surgical planning of the second electrode placement. We reviewed MR imaging studies performed with a minimal specific absorption rate protocol in patients with a deep brain stimulator in place at our institution between February 1, 2012, and August 1, 2015. Images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist and a functional neurosurgeon. Image quality was qualitatively graded, and the presence of artifacts was noted.

- **Results**: Twenty-nine patients (22 with Parkinson's disease, six with dystonia, one with essential tremor) were imaged with at least one neuromodulation implant in situ. All patients were imaged under general anesthesia. There were 25 subthalamic and four globus pallidus implants. Nineteen patients were preoperative for the second stage of bilateral deep brain stimulator placement; ten patients had bilateral electrodes in situ and were being imaged for other neurologic indications, including lead positioning. No adverse events occurred during or after imaging. Mild device-related local artifacts were observed.

### Reporting guidelines for protocols of randomised controlled trials of implantable neurostimulation devices: the SPIRIT-iNeurostim extension [^111mK9Sf]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

In the title and/or abstract, it is important to state the type of neurostimulation that will be investigated, as well as the neurological structure or nerve that will be stimulated.

- **Explanation**: Stating the key aspects of a trial, namely the type of neurostimulation and the neurological structure to be investigated, facilitates database indexing. Appropriate indexing of a trial protocol enables a publication to be identified via search strategies, improving its visibility to electronic database users. Ideally, authors should provide this information in the title. However, this may not be feasible if the journal imposes a word limit on the title.

- **Examples**:

### Malignant melanoma in early-treated Parkinson's disease: The NET-PD trial [^114NzL95]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The risk for malignant melanoma is higher than expected in Parkinson's disease (PD). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Exploratory Trials in PD (NET-PD) Long-term Study 1 (LS-1) trial is a contemporary phase 3 study of subjects with early, treated PD. The objective of this work was to assess the incidence of malignant melanoma in a PD cohort.

- **Methods**: Incident melanoma cases were identified from the adverse events log. The expected number of cases was calculated using the expected incidence rates and the number of person-years.

- **Results**: A total of 618 females and 1119 males were followed for 6452 person-years; 19 new melanoma cases were observed. The expected number was 5.29. The standardized event ratio compared to the general population was 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.2–5.6).

- **Conclusions**: The risk for developing melanoma was higher than expected in the NET-PD LS-1 cohort and was similar to the risk reported in earlier comparable clinical trial cohorts. Dermatologic screening may be useful in Parkinson's disease to identify melanoma at an early stage.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease: Executive summary [^112sJgge]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: Is bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) more, less, or as effective as bilateral globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation (GPi DBS) in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, as measured by improvements in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (UPDRS-III) scores?

	- **Recommendation**: Given that bilateral STN DBS is at least as effective as bilateral GPi DBS in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (as measured by improvements in UPDRS-III scores), consideration can be given to the selection of either target in patients undergoing surgery to treat motor symptoms. (Level I).

- **Question 2**: Is bilateral STN DBS more, less, or as effective as bilateral GPi DBS in allowing the reduction of dopaminergic medication in Parkinson's disease?

	- **Recommendation**: When the main goal of surgery is the reduction of dopaminergic medications in a patient with Parkinson's disease, then bilateral STN DBS should be performed instead of GPi DBS. (Level I).

- **Question 3**: Is bilateral STN DBS more, less, or as effective as bilateral GPi DBS in treating dyskinesias associated with Parkinson's disease?

	- **Recommendation**: There is insufficient evidence to make a generalizable recommendation regarding the target selection for the reduction of dyskinesias. However, when the reduction of medication is not anticipated and there is a goal to reduce the severity of "on" medication dyskinesias, the GPi should be targeted. (Level I).

- **Question 4**: Is bilateral STN DBS more, less, or as effective as bilateral GPi DBS in improving quality of life measures in Parkinson's disease?

### Long-term outcomes of deep brain stimulation in Parkinson disease [^1124CcDj]. Nature Reviews. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD) is well established for up to 1 or 2 years, but long-term outcome data are still limited. In this review, we critically discuss the evidence on the long-term outcomes of DBS and consider the clinical implications. Although many patients are lost to follow-up, the evidence indicates that subthalamic nucleus DBS improves motor function for up to 10 years, although the magnitude of improvement tends to decline over time. Functional scores recorded during on-medication periods worsen more quickly than those recorded in off periods, consistent with the degeneration of non-dopaminergic pathways. Dyskinesia, motor fluctuations, and activities of daily living in off periods remain improved at 5 years, but quality-of-life scores have usually fallen below preoperative levels. The incidence and severity of dementia among patients receiving DBS are comparable to those among patients who receive medical treatment. Severe adverse events are rare, but adverse events such as dysarthria are common and probably under-reported. Long-term data on the outcomes of globus pallidus interna DBS are limited and mostly confirm the efficacy for dyskinesia. A trend towards offering DBS in the earlier stages of PD creates a need to identify factors that predict long-term outcomes and to discuss realistic expectations with patients preoperatively.

### The return of the lesion for localization and therapy [^117VbSXj]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Historically, pathological brain lesions provided the foundation for the localization of symptoms, and therapeutic lesions were used as a treatment for brain diseases. New medications, functional neuroimaging, and deep brain stimulation have led to a decline in the use of lesions over the past few decades. However, recent advances have improved our ability to localize lesion-induced symptoms, including localization to brain circuits rather than individual brain regions. This improved localization can lead to more precise treatment targets, potentially mitigating traditional advantages of deep brain stimulation over lesions, such as reversibility and tunability.

New tools for creating therapeutic brain lesions, such as high-intensity focused ultrasound, allow for lesions to be placed without a skin incision and are already in clinical use for tremor. Although there are limitations and caution is warranted, improvements in lesion-based localization are refining our therapeutic targets. Improved technology is providing new ways to create therapeutic lesions, which together may facilitate the return of the lesion.

### Bilateral deep brain stimulation vs best medical therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson disease: a randomized controlled trial [^114mznpE]. JAMA (2009). High credibility.

Deep brain stimulation is an accepted treatment for advanced Parkinson disease (PD), although there are few randomized trials comparing treatments, and most studies exclude older patients. The objective of this study was to compare 6-month outcomes for patients with PD who received deep brain stimulation or best medical therapy.

This was a randomized controlled trial of patients who received either deep brain stimulation or best medical therapy, stratified by study site and patient age (≥ 70 years), conducted at 7 Veterans Affairs and 6 university hospitals between May 2002 and October 2005. A total of 255 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage ≥ 2 while not taking medications) were enrolled; 25% were aged 70 years or older. The final 6-month follow-up visit occurred in May 2006.

The intervention involved bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (n = 60) or globus pallidus (n = 61). Patients receiving best medical therapy (n = 134) were actively managed by movement disorder neurologists.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was time spent in the "on" state (good motor control with unimpeded motor function) without troubling dyskinesia, using motor diaries. Other outcomes included motor function, quality of life, neurocognitive function, and adverse events.

Patients who received deep brain stimulation gained a mean of 4.6 hours per day of on-time without troubling dyskinesia compared with 0 hours per day for patients who received best medical therapy (between group mean difference, 4.5 hours per day [95% CI, 3.7–5.4 hours per day]; P < .001). Motor function improved.

### Long-term effects of pallidal or subthalamic deep brain stimulation on quality of life in Parkinson's disease [^111PQTn2]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

We assessed the effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) or internal pallidum (GPi-DBS) on health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease participating in a previously reported multicenter trial. Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) questionnaires were available for analysis in a subgroup of n = 20/20 patients with GPi-DBS and n = 45/49 patients with STN-DBS at baseline, 6 months, and 36 months. The SIP provides a physical dimension and a psychosocial dimension sum score and 12 category scores: alertness/intellectual behavior (AIB), ambulation (A), body care and movement (BCM), communication (C), eating (E), emotional behavior (EB), home management (HM), mobility (M), recreation and pastimes (RP), sleep and rest (SR), social interaction (SI), and work (W).

Motor functioning was assessed by means of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and diaries. At 6 months, significant improvements in off-period motor symptoms and activities of daily living were paralleled by significant reductions in the total, physical, and psychosocial SIP score in both treatment groups. At 3 years, sustained improvements were observed in the physical dimension score, BCM, E, M, and RP after STN-DBS, and M and SI after GPi-DBS. All other SIP subscores approached baseline values but were still the same or better (except C), whereas motor functioning remained stable after 36 months. STN-DBS and GPi-DBS led to significant early improvements in HrQoL. Despite sustained motor improvements, many of these initial benefits were lost after 3 years.

### Evolving treatment landscape: 18 years of managing melanoma in a single patient [^113QaHwg]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

This case demonstrates the rapid pace at which the melanoma treatment landscape has advanced, particularly during the last decade. With 5-year and 10-year survival rates increasing, metastatic melanoma is becoming a chronic disease rather than a death sentence. Awareness of the increasing treatment options at our disposal is, therefore, all the more important.

When our patient was first diagnosed, surgery was the only treatment for melanoma known to improve survival. Adjuvant interferon was approved for use in the United States, but its benefits were uncertain and accompanied by significant toxicity. Dacarbazine was used to treat metastatic disease, offering only a modest response rate, and the median overall survival of patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma was around 8 months.

In the early 21st century, huge progress in our understanding of cancer at the molecular level led to a revolution of mechanism-driven anticancer therapies being developed. This approach has been particularly successful in melanoma, now with two major new forms of systemic therapy established as standard care: immune checkpoint inhibitor antibodies (e.g. pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab), as well as small molecule inhibitors of the BRAF-MEK signalling pathway (e.g. vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and trametinib) for those 50% of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma. Modern systemic therapy has extended the median overall survival of metastatic melanoma to beyond 3 years, with many patients entering long-term remission, some of whom may yet be considered cured.

With new treatments come new challenges, including how best to se

### Deep brain stimulation for obesity: Past, present, and future targets [^112cR9WV]. Neurosurgical Focus (2015). Low credibility.

This study reviews the history of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating obesity, describing targets within the brain and discussing potential DBS targets as well as nontraditional stimulation parameters that may enhance the effectiveness of DBS in ameliorating obesity. Deep brain stimulation for obesity has been performed in both animals and humans, yielding intriguing preliminary results. The brain is a promising target for addressing obesity, as modulating brain activity may influence both sides of the energy equation: caloric intake and energy expenditure.

### Deep brain stimulator electrodes used for lesioning: Proof of principle [^112tPnuK]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with chronically implanted deep brain stimulator (DBS) electrodes can encounter complications requiring hardware removal. We assessed the safety and efficacy of using implanted DBS electrodes to create a therapeutic lesion before their removal.

- **Methods**: Revision or removal of the DBS electrodes was required in two patients who had previously undergone DBS implantation. We conducted a series of in vitro experiments to confirm that the DBS electrodes could be used to generate radiofrequency lesions and to assess the relationship between radiofrequency parameters and lesion size. With this information, and with the approval of the hospital ethical review board, implanted electrodes were used to create incremental radiofrequency lesions in the thalamus in one patient and in the subthalamic nucleus in another. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia with contiguous contacts of the DBS lead connected to the active and reference sites of the RF generator to create a bipolar lesion.

- **Results**: A 51-year-old man with essential tremor and a thalamic DBS required repeated battery changes secondary to tolerance and high voltage demands. Rather than replacing the battery, a radiofrequency thalamotomy was performed by using the existing left DBS electrode. At the 6-month follow-up examination, successful lesioning provided near complete tremor control. A second patient, a 50-year-old man with Parkinson's disease who had undergone bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation, developed skin erosion over the DBS hardware. A subthalamic nucleus lesion was made.

### Deep brain stimulation: A mechanistic and clinical update [^113ZmnD4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS), the practice of placing electrodes deep into the brain to stimulate subcortical structures with electrical current, has been increasingly utilized as a neurosurgical procedure over the past 15 years. Originally a treatment for essential tremor, DBS is now used and under investigation across a wide spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In addition to applying electrical stimulation for clinical symptomatic relief, the electrodes implanted can also be used to record local electrical activity in the brain, making DBS a useful research tool. Human single-neuron recordings and local field potentials are now often recorded intraoperatively as electrodes are implanted. Thus, the increasing scope of DBS clinical applications is being matched by an increase in investigational use, leading to a rapidly evolving understanding of cortical and subcortical neurocircuitry.

In this review, the authors discuss recent innovations in the clinical use of DBS, both in approved indications as well as in indications under investigation. Deep brain stimulation as an investigational tool is also reviewed, paying special attention to evolving models of basal ganglia and cortical function in health and disease. Finally, the authors look to the future across several indications, highlighting gaps in knowledge and possible future directions of DBS treatment.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous melanoma, more specifically with respect to management of advanced/metastatic disease and management of brain metastases, CNS 2025 guidelines recommend considering the addition of immunotherapy to the treatment regimen. This addition aims to enhance CNS control and, to a lesser extent, improve survival in patients with brain metastases secondary to BRAF-altered melanoma for whom BRAF inhibitors are indicated, provided there are no contraindications from other underlying medical conditions.

### Neurophysiological mechanisms of deep brain stimulation across spatiotemporal resolutions [^113JSLFS]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Deep brain stimulation is a neuromodulatory treatment for managing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Electrodes are chronically implanted in disease-relevant brain regions, and pulsatile electrical stimulation is intended to restore neurocircuit function. However, the widespread interest in the application and expansion of this clinical therapy has preceded an overarching understanding of the neurocircuit alterations invoked by deep brain stimulation. Over the years, various forms of neurophysiological evidence have emerged which demonstrate changes to brain activity across spatiotemporal resolutions, from single neuron to local field potential to brain-wide cortical network effects. Though fruitful, such studies have often led to debate about a singular putative mechanism.

In this update, we aim to produce an integrative account of complementary instead of mutually exclusive neurophysiological effects to derive a generalizable concept of the mechanisms of deep brain stimulation. In particular, we offer a critical review of the most common historical competing theories, an updated discussion on recent literature from animal and human neurophysiological studies, and a synthesis of synaptic and network effects of deep brain stimulation across scales of observation, including micro-, meso-, and macroscale circuit alterations.

### Selecting deep brain stimulation or infusion therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: An evidence-based review [^112faU6Q]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Communicating this level of information is complex and requires the experience of a neurologist with a comprehensive understanding of all therapies. This includes the advantages, possible disadvantages, and practical problems associated with each, while considering the limited comparative evidence. Although this process can be time-consuming, it is crucial to enable patients and caregivers to make informed decisions regarding the most appropriate therapy to meet their specific requirements.

### The cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in combination with best medical therapy, versus best medical therapy alone, in advanced Parkinson's disease [^1164AR1X]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex progressive movement disorder leading to motor and non-motor symptoms that become increasingly debilitating as the disease advances, considerably reducing quality of life. Advanced treatment options include deep brain stimulation (DBS). While the clinical effectiveness of DBS has been demonstrated in a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), evidence on cost-effectiveness is limited. The cost-effectiveness of DBS combined with best medical therapy (BMT), versus BMT alone, was evaluated from a UK payer perspective. Individual patient-level data on the effect of DBS on PD symptom progression from a large 6-month RCT were used to develop a Markov model representing clinical progression, capturing treatment effect and costs. A 5-year time horizon was employed, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), with uncertainty assessed in deterministic sensitivity analyses.

The total discounted costs in the DBS and BMT groups over 5 years were £68,970 and £48,243, respectively, with QALYs of 2.21 and 1.21, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £20,678 per QALY gained. Utility weights in each health state and the costs of ongoing medication appear to be the key drivers of uncertainty in the model. The results suggest that DBS is a cost-effective intervention in patients with advanced PD who are eligible for surgery, providing good value for money to health care payers.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease: Executive summary [^112anG5x]. Neurosurgery (2018). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Parkinson's disease, particularly in the context of deep brain stimulation, the AANS/CNS 2018 guidelines recommend considering pallidal rather than subthalamic nucleus stimulation. This recommendation is advised if there is a significant concern about the risk of depression in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation, while still taking other surgical goals into consideration.

### Tasmar [^115JzxHK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk — approximately 2- to 6-fold higher — of developing melanoma than the general population. It remains unclear whether the increased risk is due to Parkinson's disease itself or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease.

For these reasons, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and regularly when using Tasmar for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals, such as dermatologists.

Mortality

The trial data reported that a total of four patients died during the 6-month follow-up period (three in the DBS group and one in the BMT group). Of the deaths in the DBS group, one was due to a cerebral hematoma, one patient committed suicide, and one died of pneumonia. In the BMT group, the single death was due to a car accident. With the exception of the cerebral hematoma, none of these deaths were considered related to the interventions received. Recent evidence has shown no association between DBS and an increased risk of suicide, so the remaining three deaths were excluded from the mortality calculations in the model.

To capture the effect of increased mortality risk for individuals with PD and the relationship between disease status and mortality, we used age-specific all-cause general population mortality rates from the UK. We applied relative risks within each H&Y stage to reflect increasing mortality risk with disease progression, using data from a community-based study.

Quality of life

To capture the effects of PD progression upon patients' QoL, we applied utility weights to each of the health states in the model. Although PDQ-39 data were collected at both visits within the key clinical study, there is currently no adequate tool for mapping these data to a generic measure of QoL suitable for use in decision-analytic modelling, such as EQ-5D. For this reason, we used utility data from two previous economic evaluations, which provided utility estimates covering all of the health states included in our model.
