## Question

Tsh < 0.1, free thyroxine 1.6, total t3 normal, work up?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to work up and manage a patient with TSH less than 0.1 mU/L, free T4 of 1.6 ng/dL, and normal total T3. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical abnormality and excluding transient causes. Then, I should classify the thyroid dysfunction pattern. Next, I will evaluate etiologies, including Graves' disease, nodular autonomy, thyroiditis, and rare central causes. After that, I need to assess risk stratification by age, cardiovascular status, bone health, and symptoms. Finally, I will outline management pathways for treatment versus observation, monitoring, and special populations like pregnancy, and I will double-check for assay interferences and medication effects that could mislead interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and avoid premature conclusions. I should repeat TSH, free T4, and total T3 in 3 to 6 months to document persistence, because transient TSH suppression from silent thyroiditis, acute illness, or assay variability occurs in a meaningful fraction of cases, and guidelines emphasize serial testing before labeling subclinical hyperthyroidism, especially when TSH is only mildly low rather than undetectable [^114Zketr] [^117EwFyN] [^115tmv2A].

> Wait, let me verify the pattern classification. With TSH less than 0.1 mU/L and free T4 and total T3 both normal, this fits severe subclinical hyperthyroidism, which carries higher risks of progression and adverse outcomes than milder TSH suppression, and I should explicitly distinguish this from overt hyperthyroidism where free T4 and/or total T3 are elevated, and from T3-toxicosis where TSH is suppressed with normal free T4 but elevated T3 [^115nFvNi] [^114fiaqB] [^112AZiH6].

> I need to check for etiologies next. The most common causes are endogenous Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma, so I should obtain TSH receptor antibodies to screen for Graves', and if positive, that essentially confirms the diagnosis, whereas a negative TRAb pushes me to consider nodular autonomy or thyroiditis. If a nodule is present, a radioiodine uptake scan helps distinguish diffuse Graves' uptake from focal autonomous nodules, and in nodular disease a suppressed TSH mandates imaging to assess for hyperfunctioning nodules that rarely harbor malignancy and do not require biopsy when hyperfunctioning [^115EuM3S] [^112fdxjj] [^116Dmdi7].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing central or assay-related causes. A TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma would present with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH alongside elevated free T4 and T3, which is the opposite of this pattern, and resistance to thyroid hormone typically shows elevated free T4 with nonsuppressed TSH, so those are not consistent here. However, I should still consider assay interference or exogenous factors like high-dose biotin, which can spuriously lower TSH in some platforms, and if results are discordant with the clinical picture, I should repeat testing on an alternate platform or after biotin washout and consider heterophile antibody assessment [^115N9GwJ] [^115tWPPB] [^114fiaqB].

> Next, I should review risk stratification because it drives treatment decisions. Age 65 or older, underlying cardiovascular disease or atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis or high fracture risk, and the presence of hyperthyroid symptoms are key factors that lower the threshold to treat, whereas younger, asymptomatic patients without cardiac or bone disease may be observed with close follow-up. I should also remember that progression to overt hyperthyroidism is more likely when TSH is fully suppressed than when it is only mildly low [^112mMkjF] [^1128JKhP] [^115tmv2A].

> Let me think about management when risk is high or TSH is persistently less than 0.1 mU/L. Definitive therapy options include radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs such as methimazole, or surgery depending on etiology and patient preference, and symptomatic patients can receive beta-blockers while awaiting definitive control. I should confirm that for Graves' disease, methimazole is generally preferred except in the first trimester of pregnancy, and that post-RAI or post-surgical monitoring relies on free T4 and total T3 rather than TSH early on because TSH can remain suppressed for months after biochemical euthyroidism is achieved [^114Zketr] [^116o1x3e] [^114xGMQD].

> But wait, what if the patient is low risk and asymptomatic? Observation is reasonable with repeat TSH and free T4 every 6 to 12 months, with counseling on bone and cardiovascular risks, and I should ensure we do not over-treat given limited randomized evidence of benefit and potential harms. If symptoms emerge or TSH remains severely suppressed, I should reconsider definitive therapy, and I should double-check that we are not attributing nonspecific symptoms to thyroid status without supportive biochemistry or clinical correlation [^114Zketr] [^111trvZ4] [^111kErfz].

> I should confirm special population nuances. In pregnancy, physiologic hCG-mediated TSH suppression in the first trimester is common, so I must interpret low TSH with trimester-specific total T4 or free T4 and total T3, and only treat true hyperthyroidism using the lowest effective antithyroid dose to keep maternal total T4 at or just above the pregnancy reference range. Outside pregnancy, I need to ensure that any decision to treat is anchored to persistent suppression and risk profile rather than a single abnormal value [^115PwoWF] [^1176gXbH] [^114rAP4D].

> Let me reconsider the immediate next steps for this patient. I should repeat TSH, free T4, and total T3 in 3 to 6 months to confirm persistence, obtain TSH receptor antibodies to screen for Graves' disease, perform a careful exam for goiter or nodules and, if present, obtain thyroid ultrasound and consider radioiodine uptake imaging to distinguish diffuse from focal autonomy, and concurrently assess cardiovascular and bone risk factors. If TSH remains less than 0.1 mU/L and the patient is 65 or older or has cardiac disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms, I should discuss definitive therapy, whereas if younger and asymptomatic, I would observe with periodic labs and clinical review, ensuring I have excluded assay interference and exogenous hormone use before committing to treatment [^114Zketr] [^112fdxjj] [^113C7Ax4].

The most likely diagnosis is **subclinical hyperthyroidism** (suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and total T3) [^114fiaqB]. The next steps are to **confirm persistence** by repeating TSH, free T4, and total T3 in 3–6 months [^117EwFyN], then **evaluate the cause** with TRAb, thyroid ultrasound, and a radioiodine uptake scan if indicated [^112fdxjj]. Management is guided by age and risk: treat if age ≥ 65, symptomatic, or with cardiac disease or osteoporosis; otherwise, monitor closely and treat only if TSH remains < 0.1 mU/L or symptoms develop [^112mMkjF] [^1111b4h5].

---

## Confirm persistence of biochemical abnormality

Repeat TSH, free T4, and total T3 in **3–6 months** to confirm persistent suppression and exclude transient causes (e.g. thyroiditis, recent illness, assay variability) [^117EwFyN] [^114bqgrE].

---

## Evaluate for underlying etiology

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAb)**: screen for Graves' disease [^116m4Kw3].
- **Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb)**: assess autoimmune thyroid disease [^112wUhU4].
- **Free T3**: if total T3 is normal but suspicion for T3 toxicosis remains [^notfound].

---

### Imaging studies

Ultrasound the thyroid to assess for nodules, goiter, or structural disease; if TSH is suppressed, obtain a **radioiodine uptake scan** to distinguish Graves' disease (diffuse uptake), toxic nodular disease (focal uptake), or thyroiditis (low uptake) [^112fdxjj].

---

## Clinical risk stratification

Risk is stratified by **age, symptoms, and comorbidities**:

| **Risk category** | **Clinical features** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| High risk | - Age ≥ 65 <br/> - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Osteoporosis <br/> - Symptomatic hyperthyroidism | Treat (antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery) [^112mMkjF] |
| Intermediate risk | - Age < 65 <br/> - Asymptomatic <br/> - No significant comorbidities | Consider treatment or close monitoring [^1111b4h5] |
| Low risk | - Young <br/> - Asymptomatic <br/> - No comorbidities | Monitor with periodic TSH and free T4 |

---

## Management strategies

### Observation

Observation entails **monitoring** with periodic TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months, with **lifestyle modifications** including avoiding excess iodine, caffeine, and stimulants.

---

### Medical therapy

- **Antithyroid drugs**: methimazole or propylthiouracil for Graves' disease or toxic nodular disease [^112MTEEc].
- **Beta-blockers**: for symptomatic relief (palpitations, tremor, anxiety) [^116m4Kw3].
- **Calcium and vitamin D**: for bone protection in postmenopausal women or those with osteoporosis [^112vewx1].

---

### Definitive therapy

Definitive options include **radioactive iodine ablation** for Graves' disease or toxic nodular disease and **thyroidectomy** for large goiters, suspicion of malignancy, or intolerance to antithyroid drugs [^112MTEEc].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

- **Cardiovascular**: atrial fibrillation, heart failure, increased mortality [^113C7Ax4].
- **Bone health**: osteoporosis, increased fracture risk [^113C7Ax4].
- **Cognitive**: possible cognitive decline in older adults [^113C7Ax4].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular monitoring** of TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months, with **clinical assessment** for new symptoms or signs of hyperthyroidism.

---

A suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and total T3 most likely reflects **subclinical hyperthyroidism**. Confirm persistence, determine the cause, and tailor management to age, symptoms, and comorbidities, favoring treatment in older or high-risk patients and observation in younger, low-risk patients.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

This paper marshals arguments in support of a narrower, optimal or true normal range for thyrotropin (TSH) of 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L, based on clinical results and recent information on the relatively stable and narrow range of values in patients without thyroid disease. The terminology used for TSH results is clarified in an attempt to help physicians interpret, explain, and respond to TSH test results for their patients.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).

Graves' disease postoperative thyroid hormone replacement (Recommendation 31) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.6 μg/kg), with elderly patients needing somewhat less, and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively; this is a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks add that if TSH was suppressed preoperatively, free T4 and TSH should be measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively, and once stable and normal, TSH should be measured annually or more frequently; dosing will vary with patient body mass index and the percentage of levothyroxine absorbed from the gut.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116e2Ezy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — overdiagnosis and natural history observations note that many persons labeled with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state over time and that this especially includes those with "subclinical" disease who have "mildly elevated" TSH levels of 4.5 to 10.0 mIU/L.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Unnecessary levothyroxine treatment of subclinical disease may lead to increased fractures and cardiac arrhythmias. 6 Discordant test results between thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels can lead to unnecessary follow-up, patient anxiety, and increased health care costs without clinical benefit. The US Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence for screening asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for thyroid disease. 7 Given the risks of unnecessary treatment and overtreatment, it is critical to use a patient-centered approach. When should thyroid function tests be performed, and when should they be avoided.

For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained. 1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. When treating primary hypothyroidism, levothyroxine dosing should be adjusted based on normalizing TSH and not free T 4 levels. Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is recommended if TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L or thyroid peroxidase antibody is elevated. 1 A previous American Family Physician article discusses dosing recommendations for hypothyroidism.

1. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels.

TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks. 9 Because hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and decreased bone mineral density, the American Thyroid Association recommends treating subclinical hyperthyroidism if TSH levels are less than 0. 1 mIU/L in two groups: adults 65 years and older and adults younger than 65 years who have heart disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic hyperthyroidism. 2, 9.

Thyroid hormone (TH) measurements complement TSH — Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and also the magnitude of primary thyroid disease, but T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval to classify disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options. TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in clinical situations such as pregnancy, intercurrent illness when TSH can be suppressed, and the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed after a change in thyroid status.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

Recommendation 59 — initial thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets after initial therapy: For high-risk thyroid cancer patients, initial TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For intermediate-risk patients, initial TSH suppression to 0.1–0.5 mU/L is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For low-risk patients after remnant ablation with undetectable serum thyroglobulin (Tg), TSH may be maintained at the lower end of the reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) while continuing surveillance for recurrence, with similar recommendations for those without remnant ablation and undetectable Tg (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). For low-risk patients after remnant ablation with low-level serum Tg, TSH may be maintained at or slightly below the lower limit of normal (0.1–0.5 mU/L) while surveillance continues, with similar recommendations for those without remnant ablation (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). For low-risk patients who have undergone lobectomy, TSH may be maintained in the mid to lower reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) while surveillance is continued, and thyroid hormone therapy may not be needed if patients can maintain serum TSH in this target range (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (treatment targets), AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend to target the normal range of a third-generation TSH assay in nonpregnant patients with hypothyroidism. Consider targeting an ULN of 4.12 mIU/L in iodine-sufficient areas if an ULN for a third-generation TSH assay is not available, and a LLN of 0.45 mIU/L if a LLN is not available.

### Approach to the patient with a suppressed TSH [^113C7Ax4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) is a laboratory diagnosis defined by a serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration below the reference range (< 0.4 mU/L in most assays), and a free thyroxine (FT4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine levels (FT3) in the reference range. Many patients diagnosed with SCH will be clinically euthyroid while others may present with manifestations characteristic of thyroid hormone excess, such as tachycardia, tremor, intolerance to heat, bone density loss, or weight loss. In addition to the laboratory abnormalities, patient factors such as age, symptoms, and underlying heart and bone disease are used to stratify patients for the risk of adverse outcomes and determine the appropriate treatment. Evaluation should include repeat thyroid function tests to document persistent TSH suppression, investigation of the underlying cause, as well as evaluation of the patient's risk of adverse outcomes in the setting of a subnormal TSH. Persistent SCH has been associated with an increased risk of a range of adverse events, including cardiovascular events such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bone loss and fracture, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Despite the consistent association of these adverse events with SCH, prospective studies showing improved outcomes with treatment remain limited. Management options include observation without active therapy, radioactive iodine ablation of the thyroid, antithyroid medication, thyroid surgery, or radiofrequency ablation, as appropriate for the patient and clinical setting. The choice of therapy should be guided by the underlying etiology of disease, patient factors, and the risks and benefits of each treatment option.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^116oKmie]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease after 131I therapy — follow-up and monitoring should include an assessment of free T4 and total T3 within the first 1–2 months, with biochemical monitoring continued at 4–6 week intervals if the patient remains thyrotoxic; most patients normalize thyroid function and symptoms within 4–8 weeks, hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks on but more commonly between 2 and 6 months, once euthyroidism is achieved lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended, and since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves they should be interpreted cautiously and only in concert with free T4 and T3 estimates.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^114Ub1fK]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116XK1nC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

Regarding medical management for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to management of subclinical hyperthyroidism, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism when TSH is persistently < 0.1 mU/L in the following clinical settings:

- patients ≥ 65 years of age

- patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis

- postmenopausal women who are not on estrogens or bisphosphonates

- patients with symptoms.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^116Dmdi7]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116Rq9QT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to measure serum free T4 and TSH for the evaluation of CeH. Consider confirming CeH in case of a free T4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease.

---

### The evidence for a narrower thyrotropin reference range is compelling [^112t6NpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Debate and controversy currently surround the recommendations of a recent consensus conference that considered issues related to the management of early, mild, or so-called subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Intimately related to the controversy is the definition of the normal reference range for TSH. It has become clear that previously accepted reference ranges are no longer valid as a result of both the development of more highly sensitive TSH assays and the appreciation that reference populations previously considered normal were contaminated with individuals with various degrees of thyroid dysfunction that served to increase mean TSH levels for the group. Recent laboratory guidelines from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry indicate that more than 95% of normal individuals have TSH levels below 2.5 mU/liter. The remainder with higher values are outliers, most of whom are likely to have underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis or other causes of elevated TSH. Importantly, data indicating that African-Americans with very low incidence of Hashimoto thyroiditis have a mean TSH level of 1.18 mU/liter strongly suggest that this value is the true normal mean for a normal population. Recognition and establishment of a more precise and true normal range for TSH have important implications for both screening and treatment of thyroid disease in general and subclinical thyroid disease in particular.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115pVsK9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central hypothyroidism — diagnostic testing and treatment triggers are: We recommend measuring serum fT4 and TSH to evaluate CH. An fT4 level below the laboratory reference range in conjunction with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^117NV6Ub]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, ETA 2018 guidelines recommend to suspect CeH in patients with low serum concentrations of free T4 and slightly elevated TSH (< 10 mU/L, or inappropriately lower than expected on the basis of the hypothyroid state).

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^117W8kM1]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Thyroid hormone testing — triiodothyronine (T3) measurement is positioned as follows: Many laboratories prefer total triiodothyronine (TT3) rather than free triiodothyronine (fT3) because of concerns about fT3 immunoassay reliability; in hypothyroidism, T3 can remain within the reference interval, so T3 measurement in suspected hypothyroidism or with increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is of limited clinical value; in hyperthyroidism, circulating T3 increases before T4 and T3 analysis can provide clinically relevant information in patients with suppressed TSH; in nonthyroidal illness, a T3 concentration below the reference interval is the hallmark and T3 measurement is unlikely to be diagnostically relevant; however, it can be useful in patients with low TSH and concomitant systemic or organ-specific disease to help distinguish hyperthyroidism from the nonthyroidal illness syndrome or identify coexistence of hyperthyroidism and intercurrent illness.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115tmv2A]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — prevalence and natural history show that in a representative U.S. sample without known thyroid disease, 0.7% had suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/L) and 1.8% had low TSH (< 0.4 mU/L). The natural history is variable, with annualized rates of 0.5%–7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5%–12% reversion to normal TSH levels. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism appears more likely when TSH is suppressed (< 0.01 mIU/L) rather than low but detectable (0.01–0.4 mIU/L).

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^114ubHJu]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma — diagnosis (Recommendation 121) states that diagnosis should be based on an inappropriately normal or elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3), generally with a pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and the absence of a family history or genetic testing consistent with resistance to thyroid hormone, with a strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Technical remarks note that elevated a-subunit levels are not useful in postmenopausal women and that the molar a-subunit/TSH ratio can be calculated by dividing a-subunit (ng/mL) by TSH (mU/L) and multiplying by 10, where a ratio greater than 1 favors a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. The guideline also cites rarity with an incidence of 0.15 per 1 million inhabitants and a prevalence of 2.8 cases per million.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^1143FMWs]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism in adults — therapeutic endpoints and TSH targets indicate that the most reliable therapeutic endpoint for primary hypothyroidism is the serum TSH value, since confirmatory total T4, free T4, and T3 lack sufficient specificity as stand-alone endpoints; when serum TSH is within the normal range, free T4 will also be normal, whereas T3 may be in the lower reference range and occasionally mildly subnormal. The normal TSH range with an upper limit of 4.12 mIU/L is largely based on NHANES III, but some propose an upper normal of 2.5 or 3.0 mIU/L because the distribution is skewed by values between 3.1 and 4.12 mIU/L and mean/median are approximately 1.5 mIU/L; however, measurements vary up to 50% above and below the mean, and setting 2.5 mIU/L as the upper normal could yield more than 10 million additional diagnoses per year in the United States without clear-cut benefit.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): an American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^115MVPFW]. Thyroid (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests (thyrotropin [TSH] and thyroid hormone [TH] measurement) is open to question and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) with its expertise support the endeavor of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing the recent literature to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement and to inform clinical care. Summary: This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of current routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization needs to be demonstrated through ongoing international efforts before results from different assays can be considered equivalent. Emerging technology (e.g., mass spectrometry) shows promise for improved analytical performance, but more evidence of its clinical utility and improved throughput is required before it can be considered for routine use. Close clinical-laboratory collaboration is encouraged to overcome and avoid the pitfalls in thyroid testing as well as resolve clinically discrepant results. The evidence base supporting the conclusions of this review is summarized in four detailed online technical supplements. Conclusions: Over the past five decades, testing for TSH, T4, and T3 has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays to nonisotopic multiplexed immunometric assays using highly automated equipment. Despite these technical advances, physicians and laboratorians performing these analyses must understand limitations of these methods to properly order tests and interpret results.

Laboratory evaluation for thyroid disease and nodules — The initial evaluation for all patients should include a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). If TSH is suppressed, a free T4 and total T3 should be obtained, and a thyroid uptake scan should be obtained to assess if the index nodule is hyperfunctioning; such nodules have a low risk of malignancy and do not require FNAB.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

Recommendation 63 — TSH-stimulated thyroglobulin (Tg) testing: In ATA low-risk and intermediate-risk patients who have had remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy and negative cervical ultrasound (US), serum Tg should be measured at 6–18 months on thyroxine therapy with a sensitive Tg assay (< 0.2 ng/mL), or after TSH stimulation to verify absence of disease (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Repeat TSH-stimulated Tg testing is not recommended for low- and intermediate-risk patients with an excellent response to therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent TSH-stimulated Tg testing may be considered in patients with an indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, or structural incomplete response following additional therapies or a spontaneous decline in Tg on thyroid hormone therapy over time in order to reassess response to therapy and disease status (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Subsequent stimulated testing is rarely needed for those with NED, and the use of sensitive Tg assays may obviate TSH stimulation when Tg on LT4 treatment is below 0.1–0.2 ng/mL.

In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

Laboratory Tests

Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

Methods to Detect Analytical Interference in Assays or Diagnose Entities

The ability to detect assay interference, and to estimate the true concentration of circulating THs or TSH, will depend on additional methods available in the clinical laboratory. Some additional tests can be undertaken in a general laboratory, whereas other measurements are best performed in a specialist reference laboratory. As even the simple methods described here cannot be used on every sample, interpreting results in conjunction with clinical context (eg, discordance between TFTs and clinical status of patient) or knowledge of laboratory systems (eg, an unexpected change in TFT pattern compared with previous measurements) can be very helpful. Grossly discordant, widely variable, or extremely deranged results usually raise suspicion of interference; unhelpfully, it is more subtle interference, causing plausible biochemical patterns, which can lead to diagnostic confusion and possibly unnecessary further investigation or intervention. Furthermore, in some situations, the presence of assay interference precludes accurate estimation of true TSH or TH values, requiring management of patients using clinical thyroid status rather than laboratory measurements.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^112vewx1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma — Principles of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression state that the use of levothyroxine to maintain low TSH levels is considered optimal for papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma, although data are lacking to permit precise specification of serum TSH levels. In general, patients with known structural residual carcinoma or at high risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained below 0.1 mU/L. Patients who are disease free and at low risk for recurrence should have TSH levels maintained at the normal range, and for patients at low risk for recurrence with biochemical evidence but no structural evidence of disease (eg, Tg positive, but imaging negative), maintain TSH levels at 0.1–0.5 mU/L. Patients who remain disease free for several years should have their TSH levels maintained within the reference range. Given the potential toxicities associated with TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine — including cardiac tachyarrhythmias (especially in the elderly) and bone demineralization (particularly in post-menopausal women) as well as frank symptoms of thyrotoxicosis — the risks and benefits of TSH-suppressive therapy must be balanced for each individual patient. Patients whose TSH levels are chronically suppressed should be counseled to ensure adequate daily intake of elemental calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^116jiqMd]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4? [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

Objective

To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We analyzed concurrent TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH < 0.3 or > 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect on case finding.

Pregnancy — management of maternal hypothyroidism and positive thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) patients: When a woman with hypothyroidism becomes pregnant, the dosage of L-thyroxine should be increased as soon as possible to ensure that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is < 2.5 mU/L and that serum total thyroxine (T4) is in the normal reference range for pregnancy; in TPOAb-positive pregnancies, serum TSH should be measured as soon as possible and if ≥ 2.5 mU/L, treatment should be initiated. Serum TSH and total T4 measurements should be monitored every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and at least once between 26 and 32 weeks gestation. Total T4 increases predictably in pregnancy, with the reference range ~1.5 fold that of the nonpregnant range; the upper limit of normal for the first trimester is generally < 2.5 mIU/L with respective upper normal values for the second and third trimesters approximately 3.0 and 3.5 mIU/L. Serum TSH levels decline in the first trimester and rise after 10–12 weeks gestation.

Abstract

Measurement of free thyroid hormones (THs) and thyrotropin (TSH) using automated immunoassays is central to the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction. Using illustrative cases, we describe a diagnostic approach to discordant thyroid function tests, focusing on entities causing elevated free thyroxine and/or free triiodothyronine measurements with nonsuppressed TSH levels. Different types of analytical interference (eg, abnormal thyroid hormone binding proteins, antibodies to iodothyronines or TSH, heterophile antibodies, biotin) or disorders (eg, resistance to thyroid hormone β or α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 or selenoprotein deficiency, TSH-secreting pituitary tumor) that can cause this biochemical pattern will be considered. We show that a structured approach, combining clinical assessment with additional laboratory investigations to exclude assay artifact, followed by genetic testing or specialized imaging, can establish a correct diagnosis, potentially preventing unnecessary investigation or inappropriate therapy.

Regarding specific circumstances for Graves' disease, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, antithyroid drugs, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to administer the lowest possible dose of antithyroid drug needed to keep the mother's thyroid hormone levels at or slightly above the reference range for total T4 and T3 values in pregnancy (1.5 times above nonpregnant reference ranges in the second and third trimesters), and the TSH below the reference range for pregnancy. Keep free T4 levels at or slightly above the upper limit of the pregnancy trimester reference range for the assay. Assess thyroid function at least monthly, and adjust the antithyroid drug dose, as required.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — natural history and treatment evidence indicates that subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 2% of the U.S. population, one quarter of persons revert to a euthyroid state without medical intervention over time, and an estimated 1% to 2% of persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU/L develop "overt" hyperthyroidism, whereas persons with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L are unlikely to progress; the USPSTF did not identify any studies evaluating benefits of treating subclinical hyperthyroidism on clinical health outcomes, and except for 1 small (n = 67) nonrandomized study of bone mineral density, no evidence was found on effects of treating "overt" hyperthyroidism.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^116z1K3j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Thyroid and aging [^113bqae9]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Review physiologic thyroid function changes with aging and emphasize careful interpretation of tests in the aging population.

Methods

Literature review.

Results

Using age-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference ranges should minimize or avoid the unnecessary diagnosis of thyroid disease in elderly patients. Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and abnormal TSH with normal thyroid levels may improve with time, so careful monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. Overt thyroid disease should always be treated.

Conclusion

Clinical judgement is always warranted to decide how and when to treat subclinical thyroid disease in the elderly.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114bqgrE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Genuinely Raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 With Nonsuppressed TSH

After excluding confounding causes (eg, measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities or drug therapies) outlined above, genuinely raised, circulating FT4 and T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are compatible with either a genetic (RTHβ) or acquired (TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma, TSHoma) condition. Over 900 families with RTHβ, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by different (∼230 known), heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), have been recorded worldwide. Greater detection of TSHomas likely mediates their higher prevalence (2.8 per million) than previously recorded. The age and gender of patients, and magnitude or pattern of elevation in free THs or TSH concentrations does not distinguish between these disorders. Although, in principle, a combination of genetic testing (for RTHβ) and pituitary imaging (for TSHoma) should readily differentiate these entities, a number of issues can cause diagnostic difficulties, as highlighted below.

Possibly due to sooner ascertainment, a greater proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas, with some pituitary lesions not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and being associated with a paucity or even absence of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can also be present in RTHβ and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

Although dynamic endocrine tests (rise in TSH in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone; inhibition of TSH following T3 administration) can differentiate between RTHβ and TSHoma, these investigations have limitations. For instance, thyrotropin-releasing hormone is not available in many countries. Moreover, although one case series confirmed that the TSH response is normal or exaggerated in RTHβ but blunted in TSHoma, with the authors specifying a greater than 5-fold TSH increase being a cut-off that differentiates these entities, there may be a "gray zone" (3- to 5-fold TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone) compatible with either diagnosis (Gurnell, unpublished observations). T3 administration is not advisable in elderly individuals or those with underlying cardiac disease or psychiatric disturbance; furthermore, although circulating TSH is higher in TSHoma than RTHβ cases following the T3 suppression test, there is an overlap in TSH values with no discrete cut-off that distinguishes between these entities.

Key Points

Screening for thyroid dysfunction with free T4 instead of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) improves efficiency in older adults in primary care.
Adjustment of the screening strategy will reduce costs, unnecessary follow-up and patient concerns.
An alternative strategy is to elevate the TSH cutoff value; this also led to improved positive predictive value (PPV) for clinical hypothyroidism

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^117EwFyN]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the performance of commonly used alternative diagnostic approaches to laboratory- and trimester-specific reference intervals. These alternatives include (1) use of a fixed upper limit for TSH, (2) employing a modified upper limit of TSH by subtracting from the nonpregnant upper limit of TSH, and (3) utilizing unadjusted nonpregnancy reference intervals for TSH and FT4 as a historical benchmark. We focused on discerning the impact of these alternatives on clinically consequential decisions such as indications or considerations for treatment as per prevailing international guidelines.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy — outcome evidence and degree of suppression: A meta-analysis supported efficacy of TSH suppression therapy in preventing major adverse clinical events with RR = 0.73 (CI 0.60–0.88), p < 0.05. A large RCT from Japan showed disease-free survival was equivalent with normal TSH (0.4–5 mU/L) compared with LT4 suppression therapy (TSH < 0.01 mU/L). Retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L may improve outcomes in high-risk patients, with no such evidence of benefit in low-risk patients, and higher degrees of suppression to < 0.03 mU/L may offer no additional benefit. In a prospective, nonrandomized cohort study of 2936 patients, overall survival improved significantly when TSH was suppressed to undetectable levels in NTCTCSG stage III or IV disease and to the subnormal to undetectable range in stage II disease; however, there was no incremental benefit from suppressing to undetectable levels in stage II and suppression of TSH was not beneficial in NTCTCSG stage I disease.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114fiaqB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

Key Clinical Points for Interpreting Thyroid Tests

Clinically relevant aspects of thyroid pathophysiology and the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-peripheral axis have recently been reviewed elsewhere. Generic abbreviations for thyroid hormones (THs), T4 and T3, are used in this text, if both total and free TH are meant. Total T4 (TT4) and total T3 (TT3) are used for total and free T4 (fT4) or free T3 (fT3) for free TH concentrations, respectively.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

Evaluation for potential hyperthyroidism

If the TSH levels are less than the normal range (< 0.4 mU/L), the TSH testing should be repeated within 4 weeks. Free T4 (normal range, 0.7–1.9 ng/dL), free T3 (normal range, 230–619 pg/dL), and TSH-receptor antibody levels (normal range, ≤ 1.75 IU/L) should also be assessed, with tests of free T4 and/or free T3 repeated every 4–6 weeks until levels return to normal, or treatment/referral to a specialist is indicated. Slightly low TSH levels (0.2–0.4 mU/L) with normal free T4 and free T3 levels are consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism, and TSH can be monitored. If the patient is symptomatic with palpitations or tremor or has tachycardia, treatment with a beta-blocker may be initiated immediately (while waiting for results). Often larger doses are required for treatment of hyperthyroidism (e.g. propranolol, 80 mg daily) than might be used for heart disease or hypertension.

Overt hyperthyroidism is suspected if TSH is suppressed with elevated free T4 and/or free T3 (Fig. 2). If the patient has a positive TSH-receptor antibody titer, then a diagnosis of Graves' disease is confirmed, whereas a negative result suggests a diagnosis of painless thyroiditis. An alternative method of distinguishing Graves' disease from painless thyroiditis is with a nuclear medicine thyroid radioiodine uptake test, although the use of TSH-receptor antibody in place of thyroid nuclear scans is recommended based on lower cost and a shorter turnaround time. Overt hyperthyroidism on the basis of Graves' disease should prompt a referral to an endocrinologist for management, which may include anti-thyroid medications, radioiodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Painless thyroiditis or subclinical hyperthyroidism may be followed by monthly TSH and free T4 monitoring until progression to overt hyperthyroidism and/or spontaneous normalization of results, whereupon resuming TSH testing every 3 months can continue.

Central hypothyroidism (CH) in hypopituitary patients — diagnostic considerations emphasize that low-normal free thyroxine (fT4) may suggest CH, but confirmation is difficult because there are no validated thyroid function measures in this population; studies have suggested that 10–18% of high-risk pituitary patients have unrecognized CH with low-normal fT4 levels, and suggested approaches for patients with low-normal fT4 levels include starting L-T4 if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels over time and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20%; serum T3 or free T3 (fT3) levels are generally not helpful, peripheral indices of thyroid hormone action lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity, and classifying CH based on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) responsiveness to exogenous TSH-releasing hormone has not proven useful in clinical practice.

### Thyroid (Armour thyroid) [^111GdnJb]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Laboratory Tests — Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except T3. When the total serum T4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T4 and T3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine.

Endocrine Society guideline — central hypothyroidism diagnosis and initial management: We recommend measuring serum free T4 (fT4) and TSH to evaluate central hypothyroidism, noting that an fT4 level below the laboratory reference range with a low, normal, or mildly elevated TSH in the setting of pituitary disease usually confirms a CH diagnosis. In patients with pituitary disease and low-normal fT4 levels suspected to have mild CH, we suggest starting levothyroxine (L-T4) if suggestive symptoms are present or following fT4 levels and starting treatment if the fT4 level decreases by 20% or more. We suggest against using dynamic TSH-secretion testing to diagnose CH.
