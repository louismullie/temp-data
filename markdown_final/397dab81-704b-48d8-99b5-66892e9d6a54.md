## Question

what is the historical significance of ping pong balls in the treatment of tuberculosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the historical significance of ping pong balls in the treatment of tuberculosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether ping pong balls were actually used medically for TB and in what context. Then, I should verify the historical rationale for that intervention and how it fit into pre-antibiotic collapse therapy. Next, I will examine outcomes, complications, and why the practice was abandoned. Finally, I will synthesize the historical significance and contrast it with modern TB therapy to avoid overgeneralization or misattribution.

> Let me first confirm the core claim: yes, ping pong balls were indeed used in the treatment of tuberculosis, but not as a drug or vaccine. They were used as inert space-occupying materials in extrapleural collapse therapy, specifically as a form of plombage to maintain lung collapse and rest diseased upper lobes, alongside other materials like paraffin, fat, oil, rubber balloons, and Lucite balls [^414f67a1] [^45eb8649].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism and rationale before I jump ahead. In the pre-antibiotic era, collapse therapy aimed to rest infected lung segments, close cavities, and reduce bacillary burden by mechanically compressing the diseased area; plombage materials were placed in the extrapleural space to hold the lung collapsed, theoretically improving healing and reducing transmission risk, although this was based on limited evidence and evolving surgical judgment of the time [^e8e94573] [^45eb8649].

> I should confirm the timing and scope. Plombage and related collapse procedures were most active from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century, peaking before effective chemotherapy, and ping pong balls appear among the diverse materials surgeons experimented with during that period; contemporary reports still document late complications from retained plombage, underscoring that this was a real, not merely anecdotal, practice [^45eb8649] [^2ff0709b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety or efficacy. I need to check complications and outcomes. Retained plombage materials, including Lucite balls, have been associated with migration, infection, empyema, bronchopleural fistula, and mass effect requiring extraction decades later; case series and reports describe surgical management of these sequelae, and some authors cautioned that rising drug resistance could theoretically revive interest in collapse techniques, though that has not translated into modern standard care [^2ff0709b] [^45eb8649].

> Let me consider the historical significance carefully. Ping pong balls are a striking emblem of the desperation and ingenuity of pre-antibiotic TB care, illustrating how clinicians resorted to mechanical, sometimes improvised solutions in the absence of effective drugs; their use signals the broader collapse-therapy epoch and its eventual obsolescence after streptomycin, isoniazid, and subsequent regimens transformed TB into a medically curable disease, rendering plombage and related procedures historical footnotes [^e8e94573] [^d44438f3].

> But wait, what if someone conflates this with other "ping-pong" medical entities? I should double-check that I'm not mixing terms. The phrase "ping-pong" also appears in cardiology for ball thrombus, which is unrelated to TB therapy, and in dermatology for sports-induced targetoid erythema; neither of those contexts involves tuberculosis treatment, so I need to ensure we keep the TB plombage usage distinct from these homonyms [^4f5e6b0f] [^b7a39803].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise: ping pong balls were used historically as inert plombage materials to maintain extrapleural lung collapse for TB, reflecting the pre-antibiotic era's mechanical approach to rest diseased lung; they were not pharmacologic therapy, carried risks of migration and infection, and were abandoned with the advent of modern chemotherapy, which now provides safe, effective, and shorter regimens for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB [^414f67a1] [^45eb8649] [^d44438f3] [^5fb5068b].

Ping-pong balls were used in **extrapleural plombage** for tuberculosis in the mid-20th century, serving as inert space-occupying materials to maintain lung collapse and rest diseased upper lobes [^45eb8649]. This was a **pre-antibiotic collapse therapy** aimed at improving healing, but it was abandoned due to frequent complications such as infection, migration, and erosion, and is now only of historical interest [^2ff0709b].

---

## Historical context and rationale

- **Pre-antibiotic era**: Before effective antituberculous drugs, collapse therapy (pneumothorax, thoracoplasty, plombage) was used to rest infected lung segments and promote healing [^e8e94573].

- **Plombage**: Creating an extrapleural cavity and filling it with inert material (paraffin, Lucite, ping-pong balls) maintained lung collapse and reduced bacillary burden [^45eb8649].

- **Ping-pong balls**: Lightweight, inert, and readily available, they were used in some centers as a plombage material to hold the lung collapsed [^414f67a1].

---

## Surgical technique

Surgeons created an extrapleural space beneath the upper chest wall and inserted multiple ping-pong balls to **collapse the upper lobe**; the goal was to isolate cavities, reduce ventilation, and improve healing. The balls were intended to remain in place indefinitely, though some were later removed due to complications [^2ff0709b].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Initially, plombage achieved short-term improvement in symptoms and radiographic appearance, but **long-term complications** were common:

- **Infection**: Empyema and chronic infections occurred in many patients [^2ff0709b].

- **Migration**: Balls could migrate, erode through tissues, or cause fistulas [^45eb8649].

- **Mechanical issues**: Ball rupture or displacement caused pain, mass effect, and respiratory symptoms [^notfound].

These complications often required **surgical removal** or additional procedures, limiting the therapy's acceptability [^2ff0709b].

---

## Decline and abandonment

With the advent of **effective antituberculous chemotherapy** in the late 1940s and 1950s (streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin), collapse therapies — including plombage with ping-pong balls — were gradually abandoned [^e8e94573]. Modern regimens are safer, more effective, and less invasive, rendering plombage obsolete [^d44438f3].

---

## Historical significance

Ping-pong balls in TB care illustrate the **ingenuity and desperation** of pre-antibiotic surgery, highlighting how far treatment has evolved. Their use is now a historical curiosity, reminding us of the risks of invasive, non-curative approaches superseded by pharmacologic cure [^917c6d92].

---

Ping-pong balls were used in **extrapleural plombage** to maintain lung collapse in TB before antibiotics; while initially helpful, they caused significant complications and were abandoned with modern chemotherapy, leaving only historical relevance.

### At the deathbed of consumptive art [^414f67a1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1882–1952)

At the end of the 19th century, romantic notions about tuberculosis were replaced by scientific ideas and products: vaccines and therapies, rest cures, tonics, lobectomies, pneumonectomies, thoracoplasties, "artificial" pneumothoracies, phrenic nerve crushings, plombage, pneumatic cabinet treatments, and antiseptic injections into the pleural spaces. Surgeons packed the pleural cavity with fat, paraffin, and even Ping-Pong balls. In contrast to the arts, science and medicine were unapologetically prosaic.

Over a 70-year span, tuberculosis literally transformed Western society. Tuberculosis patients were excluded from many occupations. Married patients had to sleep in separate beds from uninfected spouses and were counseled to avoid sex and especially to not have children. Public health nurses visited door to door, sanatoria were built by the hundreds, and hospitals added tuberculosis wings. Cold water hydrotherapy, alcohol massages, and brisk rubdowns with coarse towels were prescribed. Millions of spittoons and cuspidors were placed in homes and public places. Patients' bed linens were changed daily and were boiled and laundered separately. Handkerchiefs (for those who could afford them — cut-up pieces of muslin for the rest) were stuffed in pockets before leaving home, then disinfected or burned at night. Japanese "paper handkerchiefs" became popular, leading eventually to the modern "facial tissue". Tuberculous women had to forego corsets and brassieres in favor of loose-fitting clothes. Life insurance policies added clauses canceling benefits for the tubercular, and hotels and landlords refused to serve them. Compulsory registration, immigration bans, and even interstate travel restrictions were debated. Suicides in towns with sanatoria increased.

### Investments in tuberculosis research-what are the gaps? [^34c5ebcc]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The ancient scourge, tuberculosis, was the subject of the world's first randomized controlled trial reported in 1949, and since then numerous studies have generated robust evidence about effective interventions for tuberculosis control. Although highly effective treatment regimens have been around for many decades, in 2014, tuberculosis killed 1.5 million people, surpassing HIV to become the leading cause of death from an infectious disease globally. Tuberculosis evades control efforts for numerous reasons, including the lack of timely access to quality diagnostic and treatment services for vulnerable populations, which has contributed to the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis. At the current rate of decline in incidence – just over 1% per annum – it will take more than 150 years to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) targets of reducing tuberculosis deaths by 95% and incidence by 90% compared to rates in 2015.

Recognizing the need for major improvements in our progress on tuberculosis control, the Stop TB Partnership's Global Plan to End TB 2016–2020 calls for a paradigm shift. While an acknowledgement of the need for a change in approach is promising, the tuberculosis control community has been criticized for failing to act effectively on the basis of existing knowledge and for constantly looking for 'new' solutions. Through his analysis of responses to tuberculosis in the twentieth century, historian Christian McMillan highlights a pattern of 'repetition and rediscovery' among researchers and policymakers, owing to a tendency to ignore lessons that have been learnt, resulting in a squandering of resources on repeatedly addressing already answered research questions. This view is echoed in a review of numerous studies carried out by the British Medical Research Council's tuberculosis units between 1946 and 1986, which made the striking assertion: "[by the late 1980s] all of the measures necessary for successful programmes for the control of tuberculosis had been delineated ". On seeing the renewed calls for increased funding, some researchers have questioned whether we can justify being stewards of substantial funding for global health " if we cannot manage a disease as well known as tuberculosis ". While the barriers to managing tuberculosis are numerous, including its association with poverty and the generation of drug resistance owing to inadequacies in health systems, these challenges are well defined; the balance between generating new knowledge and identifying strategies to implement proven solutions is thus being questioned.

### Host-directed therapies for tackling multi-drug resistant tuberculosis: learning from the pasteur-bechamp debates [^16d7f439]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis remains a global emergency causing an estimated 1.5 million deaths annually. For several decades the major focus of tuberculosis treatment has been on antibiotic development targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The lengthy tuberculosis treatment duration and poor treatment outcomes associated with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are of major concern. The sparse new tuberculosis drug pipeline and widespread emergence of MDR-TB signal an urgent need for more innovative interventions to improve treatment outcomes. Building on the historical Pasteur-Bechamp debates on the role of the "microbe" vs the "host internal milieu" in disease causation, we make the case for parallel investments into host-directed therapies (HDTs). A range of potential HDTs are now available which require evaluation in randomized controlled clinical trials as adjunct therapies for shortening the duration of tuberculosis therapy and improving treatment outcomes for drug-susceptible tuberculosis and MDR-TB. Funder initiatives that may enable further research into HDTs are described.

The use of tuberculin for the therapy of tuberculosis was attempted more than 100 years ago and abandoned because of its adverse reactions. In this historical review we point out that some of the intensive efforts to avoid the reactions were based on the best scientific rationale available at that time. Balancing the dosage and intervals of tuberculin delivery with clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients achieved a limited success, with implications, toward current research in the field. The role of economical and social aspects at that time is also a lesson to be learned toward current approaches to tuberculosis control.

Background

Ball thrombus is defined as an unattached clot with its cross-sectional diameter greater than the orifice of the heart chamber where it exists. It is rare and may cause sudden death and embolism. Once diagnosed, removing thrombus and eliminating etiology is regarded as gold standard. We here present a woman with left atria (LA) ball thrombus, and was successfully managed through operation. Additionally, we performed a literature review to summarize the clinical features of this rare disease.

### Perspectives for personalized therapy for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^b26b9f83]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tuberculosis is the leading cause of death attributed to a single microbial pathogen worldwide. In addition to the large number of patients affected by tuberculosis, the emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug-resistance is complicating tuberculosis control in many high-burden countries. During the past 5 years, the global number of patients identified with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as bacillary resistance at least against rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most active drugs in a treatment regimen, has increased by more than 20% annually. Today we experience a historical peak in the number of patients affected by MDR-TB. The management of MDR-TB is characterized by delayed diagnosis, uncertainty of the extent of bacillary drug-resistance, imprecise standardized drug regimens and dosages, very long duration of therapy and high frequency of adverse events which all translate into a poor prognosis for many of the affected patients. Major scientific and technological advances in recent years provide new perspectives through treatment regimens tailor-made to individual needs. Where available, such personalized treatment has major implications on the treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB. The challenge now is to bring these adances to those patients that need them most.

### Comparing the efficacy of drug regimens for pulmonary tuberculosis: meta-analysis of endpoints in early-phase clinical trials [^587ab979]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Phillips on pages.)

First-line tuberculosis therapy has remained unchanged for 40 years. Whereas "short-course" treatment is effective in clinical trials, in practice the 6 months required for successful cure is burdensome for patients and tuberculosis programs. Identifying new and ultra-short regimens will require identification of suitable surrogate outcomes to facilitate progression of novel treatment regimens through phase 2 to phase 3 trials and de-risk drug development.

The current "gold standard" phase 3 endpoint is a composite of treatment failure and relapse up to 24 months following treatment completion. Use of this binary outcome, which is rare in the comparator arm (< 5% with standard short-course regimens), mandates large sample sizes to adequately power clinical trials. The prolonged follow-up that is required further adds to trial costs, making the definitive outcome unsuitable for extensive evaluation of drug combinations or dose-finding.

Numerous surrogate outcomes have been used for these purposes in phase 2 studies. Phase 2A studies of early bactericidal activity (EBA) based on quantitative sputum bacteriology enroll small patient numbers for up to 2 weeks. While the original rationale for such studies was dose-finding for single agents, more recent studies have evaluated drug combinations. This concept has been extended into larger phase 2B studies with combination therapy lasting up to 2 months. The most studied phase 2B outcome has been sputum culture conversion at fixed time-points, usually 2 months. This endpoint is supported by regulators for conditional approval of novel drugs, but there remains a lack of consensus among trialists as to the utility of EBA studies and of other approaches to intermediate bacteriological data such as time-to-event and regression modeling.

A complete understanding of the performance of tuberculosis treatment regimens in early-phase clinical trials is critical to understanding their usefulness in predicting phase 3 trial results and in calibrating preclinical models of treatment. Although the goals of historical phase 2A and 2B regimens are distinct, with the former focusing on proof-of-concept for individual drugs and the latter on identifying the best combinations of drugs, it seems important to understand whether this information can be transmitted rationally through these phases. We undertook a systematic review of early clinical outcomes in tuberculosis (within the first 2 months of treatment), focusing on the key drugs comprising modern and historical first-line treatment regimens, to determine the overall ranking of efficacy of drugs and combinations, to define the variability of these measures of effect on the different endpoints used, and to establish the relationships between them.

### Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: are we learning from history or repeating it? [^8a776de9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an enormous global public health problem. Cases of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) are being reported in increasing numbers across the globe. A large outbreak of XDR-TB associated with rapid and nearly universal mortality has been reported among patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection or acquired immunodeficiency disease in South Africa who have been receiving standard TB therapy and antiretrovirals. Epidemiologic features of this outbreak make it highly suspicious for health care-associated transmission. We urge the Infectious Diseases Society of America and its members to increase involvement in ongoing international TB prevention and treatment efforts and to develop a registry of experts in infection control and laboratory and disease management. We urge advocacy for increased funding for domestic and global TB control programs, including expanded access to sputum culture and drug susceptibility testing, as well as funding for TB clinical trials and research capacity. We believe that substandard TB diagnostic tests are not acceptable for TB control in resource-poor countries. We urge the development of shorter, less toxic TB treatment and prevention regimens. Funding of TB control and research should be reassessed to prevent budget cuts at a time when the disease is killing as many as 2 million people a year.

### Global tuberculosis control: lessons learnt and future prospects [^b465d51c]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease, but not a disease of the past. After disappearing from the world public health agenda in the 1960s and 1970s, TB returned in the early 1990s for several reasons, including the emergence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and increases in drug resistance. More than 100 years after the discovery of the tubercle bacillus by Robert Koch, what is the status of TB control worldwide? Here, we review the evolution of global TB control policies, including DOTS (directly observed therapy, short course) and the Stop TB Strategy, and assess whether the challenges and obstacles faced by the public health community worldwide in developing and implementing this strategy can aid future action towards the elimination of TB.

### Plombage rupture presenting as a subcutaneous tumor: unexpected differential diagnosis [^45eb8649]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During the tuberculosis epidemic after World War II and before effective antituberculosis agents were discovered, plombage was a common treatment strategy. This strategy was first used by Tuffier in 1891 to treat upper lobe tuberculosis of the lung. The procedure was conducted by forming a surgical cavity under the upper portion of the chest wall ribs and by filling the area with different dormant substances such as paraffin wax, fat, rubber balloons, oil, and Lucite balls to achieve an artificial lung collapse. This forced collapse was supposed to lead to infection isolation and healing process improvement. Normally, the plombage was advised to be extracted a few years later. Nonetheless, some patients missed a follow-up and therefore still carry it.

Several years later, as a result of unremoved plombage various complications were reported such as rupture of the plombage with bronchial, pleural, or pleurocutaneous fistula; oil aspiration; infection; abscess; migration; and tumors, especially with Lucite. Mycobacterial persistence in the material with reactivation of tuberculosis has also been reported. The treatment of these complications is challenging.

In the last few years, scant cases have been published, presumably because only a few patients with plombage reached aged 90 years. This rare report highlights the importance of knowing the old tuberculosis treatment strategy because late complications may occur. Furthermore, this case shows the significance of the biopsy in plombage leakage that may not be noticed or can even be falsely evaluated radiologically. Hence, dermatologists should be aware of these cutaneous complications caused by plombage rupture in elderly patients.

### Historical aspects of Pott's disease (spinal tuberculosis) management [^34c690d0]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Spinal tuberculosis has existed in human beings since the ascent of man on earth. Historically, the management has progressed from regional orthodox therapies to the current, more effective, drugs.

Materials and Methods

Historical perspectives regarding the management have been collated by going through the important publications during the past 6 decades. For convenience, the manuscript has been organized as "orthodox traditional" treatment, early "chemotherapy period", "post chemotherapy treatment", "middle-path" philosophy, and the current treatment with availability of modern imaging facilities.

Conclusions

Broad conclusions based upon the published data and personal observations (1959–2011) are summarized as follows: If diagnosis is made at predestructive stage and the patient is treated by standard drugs, the infection would heal in about 95% patients without significant deformities and complications. Neural complications are still encountered in general hospital outpatients. Diagnosis and treatment at early stages would resolve the neurology without operation in about 40% of cases. Nearly 60% of patients would require to be operatively decompressed without jeopardizing mechanical stability. However, despite current treatment approximately 8% of tuberculous paraplegics do not recover functionally. Immunocompromised state and multidrug resistance to standard drugs (8 to 10%) are the current (and future) challenges to the doctors and the society.

### Myths and misconceptions: the origin and evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [^f42fc645]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Much effort has been spent trying to work out the origin and history of tuberculosis. Understanding these concepts could have important consequences for the development of vaccines and therapies that are effective against all strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We discuss a series of misconceptions about the origin of both M. tuberculosis and the disease it causes that have arisen over the years, and identify a number of unanswered questions that could provide insight into both these areas.

### A perfect storm averted: flawed systems, a dropped ball, and cognitive biases delay a critical diagnosis [^9ee4fafa]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

This is the first case of Cancer Morbidity, Mortality, and Improvement Rounds, a series of articles intended to explore the unique safety risks experienced by oncology patients through the lens of quality improvement, systems and human factors engineering, and cognitive psychology. This case highlights how multiple overlapping factors contributed to a delay in diagnosing disseminated tuberculosis in a patient with lung cancer. The discussion focuses on the ways that cognitive biases contributed to the delayed diagnosis in a patient who, with the benefit of hindsight, exhibited several signs and symptoms suggesting tuberculosis. Cancer Morbidity, Mortality, and Improvement Rounds is a series of articles intended to explore the unique safety risks experienced by oncology patients through the lens of quality improvement, systems and human factors engineering, and cognitive psychology. For purposes of clarity, each case focuses on a single theme, although, as is true for all medical incidents, there are almost always multiple, overlapping, contributing factors. The quality improvement paradigm used here, which focuses on root cause analyses and opportunities to improve care delivery systems, was previously outlined in this journal. 1.

### Tuberculosis "Autoregression": a historical context [^9a45e1c7]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

I read with interest the case report of Walter et al. describing the apparent spontaneous regression of pleuro-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) over a period of 18 months in a woman unable to tolerate anti-TB chemotherapy. I believe several studies from the pre-chemotherapy era can help place this observation in context. The largest relevant case series of which I am aware, published by Alling and Bosworth in 1960, described long-term outcomes in 564 persons who were diagnosed with active pulmonary TB from 1938 to 1948 but did not receive modern chemotherapy. Outcomes depended on the radiographic extent of disease at diagnosis (Figure 1). Recovery was most likely in patients presenting with minimal lung disease; this outcome, described as "arrested" TB, required the absence of detectable Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum, the resolution of constitutional symptoms, the stabilization of radiographic abnormalities, and at least the partial recovery of exercise capacity. However, about 10% of patients who initially appeared to have recovered later relapsed, usually after an interval of 4 or more years. Death due to TB was increasingly likely as the initial radiographic extent of disease worsened.

Figure 1.
Long-term outcomes of pulmonary TB in the pre-chemotherapy era, according to the radiographic extent of disease at diagnosis. Relapses occurred when active disease recurred in previously arrested cases. Adapted from reference 2. TB = tuberculosis.

A similar literature describes the natural history of pleural TB. In 1955, Roper and Waring reported outcomes in 141 military recruits who had presented 10 years earlier with primary serofibrinous effusion. The series included only cases thought most likely to be due to M. tuberculosis and having at least 5 years of follow-up. Most patients had radiographic and symptomatic improvement following a period of bed rest but were left with some residual evidence of pleural disease. Recurrent TB occurred in 92 patients (65%), over an interval ranging from 9 months to 5 years (Figure 2). Nearly a third of relapse risk occurred after 18 months. Intrathoracic recurrence was most common, although ipsilateral and contralateral localizations were equally likely. Twenty-three instances of extrathoracic relapse occurred, involving nearly every bodily organ, including the eye, larynx, spine and large joints, gut, genitourinary tract, and brain. Some individuals had multiple relapse sites. The wide anatomic distribution of these recurrences is consistent with hematogenous dissemination as the underlying mechanism, occurring despite the apparent resolution of the original infection.

### New modality of collapse therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis sequels: tissue expander [^163fe3c5]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Classical collapse therapy with extrapleural Lucite balls placement used for tuberculosis sequelae is associated with long term complications, such as migration of the foreign body. We report a new modality of collapse therapy for tuberculosis cavitation which may avoid this complication and which uses percutaneous tissue expanders. Postoperative course was uneventful and mid term follow-up confirmed the functional improvement without recurrence of the infection. This new modality of post-tuberculosis collapse therapy may allow treatment with fewer physical and physiologic sequelae of the residual cavities, and should reduce long term complications such as migration.

### Human tuberculosis – an ancient disease, as elucidated by ancient microbial biomolecules [^ee5dbeac]. Microbes and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis is a major cause of death but infected people with effective immunity may remain healthy for years, suggesting long-term co-existence of host and pathogen. Direct detection and characterisation of ancient microbial DNA and lipid biomarkers confirms palaeopathological diagnoses. Archaeological Mycobacterium tuberculosis resembles extant lineages indicating the timescale for evolutionary changes is considerably longer than originally believed.

### "Ping-pong" in the heart: a case report and literature review [^ab273772]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The ball thrombus is considered to be a high risk of embolism. However, no guideline exists to direct the treatment strategy. Urgent thrombectomy possibly remains the best approach, with a survival rate of 90%. Mitral valve replacement is indicated to treat valvular stenosis, along with ligation of the LA appendage. Though there were few cases demonstrated disappearance of thrombus after anticoagulation therapy only, anticoagulation therapy should be considered as a treatment for free-floating ball thrombus only in extremely high-risk cases or for patients refusing surgery, due to the risk of superficial fragmentation and embolization. Anticoagulation therapy is required after surgery. In our case, the thrombus detached from the atrial wall before induction possibly due to the anticoagulation therapy before surgery.

The anesthetic management is challenging due to multiple risks such as embolization, obstruction of mitral valve, arrhythmias, and marked hemodynamic instability. Echocardiography plays an important role in intracardiac thrombus detection, and TEE is the gold-standard technique to detect LA appendage thrombi. In our case, the thrombus in LA appendage was not detected by TTE, but TEE discovered it after induction.

In conclusion, ball thrombus is rare in clinical settings. Urgent thrombectomy should be performed as soon as possible, and echocardiography can be used for real-time monitoring during surgery.

### Tuberculosis of the spine: a historical review [^6c0cb7a4]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Almost all ancient civilizations described tuberculous bacilli in their old scripts, and these bacteria have been found in prehistoric skeletal remains. The clinical availability of specific antitubercular drugs was the most important breakthrough in managing spinal tuberculosis. Any attempt at surgical excision of the disease prior to the antitubercular era met with serious complications, dissemination of disease and high mortality (nearly 50%). Antitubercular drugs markedly improved the results of management by operative treatment. Excellent healing of disease was also observed in those patients who were treated nonoperatively. However, it took many years (1950–1970) for clinicians to appreciate the efficacy of antitubercular drugs. Operations for spinal tuberculosis are now indicated less for control of disease (5–10% of all cases) than for complications, including nonresponding neural deficit (nearly 40% of neural complications), prevention or correction of severe kyphotic deformity, and for tissue diagnosis (approximately 5% of all cases). For a classic spondylodiscitis when surgery is required for débridement and decompression, an anterior approach through an extrapleural anterolateral route or through transpleural route is recommended. Healthy posterior elements should not be jeopardized by surgery. The real control of tuberculous disease requires a serious and sustained global effort to eliminate immunocompromised states, poverty, malnutrition, and overcrowding.

### Recently developed drugs for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis: a research and development case study [^58d5386b]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Globally, tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, despite being an infectious disease that can be both prevented and successfully treated. In 2018, there were approximately half a million new cases of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB), including multidrug-resistant TB, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid), yet only 186 772 of these individuals were diagnosed and even fewer started on appropriate treatment. Only 56% of the 156 071 people enrolled on treatment were treated successfully — a figure that has not changed significantly for decades.

It has been over 6 years since the WHO first recommended the novel drug bedaquiline (Bdq) for the treatment of some forms of RR/MDR-TB in adults in June 2013. In October 2014, the WHO recommended a second new antituberculosis agent, delamanid (Dlm), to treat RR/MDR-TB. These recommendations followed on accelerated and conditional approvals for Bdq from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in December 2012 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2014; Dlm was conditionally approved by the EMA in April 2014. Pretomanid, approved most recently by the FDA in 2019 for treatment of highly drug-resistant forms of TB, is limited to use within a three-drug regimen, including Bdq and linezolid (the BPaL regimen), and will not be discussed here. Given the historically poor rates of treatment success and the high frequency of toxicities from conventional RR/MDR-TB regimens, there has been optimism that WHO recommendations and subsequent access to these therapeutic agents will significantly improve treatment outcomes.

Despite the hope that accompanied regulatory approval, early access to Bdq and Dlm has until recently been slow and problematic in many countries. The reasons for poor uptake are multifactorial and include programmatic, logistic and regulatory barriers. More broadly, preapproval pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) trial design is mostly private sector driven and focused on rapid market authorisation, leaving gaps in evidence to inform clinical practice. Even when trial data are generated with public sector involvement, there is minimal recognition of these efforts in terms of collective decision-making for postapproval access and pricing. This paper aims to analyse these shortcomings through the lens of the current pharmaceutical R&D paradigm.

### Treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. An official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^1e3b0e78]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis — epidemiology, historical regimen, and outcomes: Monoresistance to isoniazid is frequent worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 8% (range, 5–11%) of TB cases, and treatment with first-line drugs has been associated with higher treatment failure (11% vs. 1%) and relapse (10% vs. 5%); standardized empirical treatment may contribute to higher rates of acquired drug resistance (8% vs. 0.3%). Prior ATS, CDC, and IDSA guidelines recommended treatment with a standard four-drug regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 6 months, with discontinuation of isoniazid after drug susceptibility testing (DST) confirmed isoniazid resistance.

Treatment

MCIL

One of the big questions about treating TB is that, because the mycobacterium is both a slow-growing organism, and also because it is relatively hardy to being killed by antimicrobials, it takes a long time to treat and effectively cure TB. For example, the standard therapy to deal with latent TB is 3 months of treatment, continuously. The standard treatment for drug-sensitive active TB is 6 months of treatment. These are drugs that have potential toxicities. That in itself is a problem because, again, if someone is feeling more unwell on the therapy, then there's a good chance that they may stop treatment.

PPJP

Unfortunately, we haven't seen any improvement in the treatment of drug-sensitive TB really for 30 or 40 years. Whilst those were very effective trials and the regimen works very well in trial settings – as we've seen in the history of the TB epidemic, the regimen is inadequate to control the disease. So we do need treatments; we need better treatments, safer treatments, shorter treatments that are easier for patients to take.

There have been a number of trials published in the last 2 years looking at 4-month treatments. The idea being that a shorter, 4-month regimen would be easier to take for patients and, if it could be shown to be as good as the current standard of care, then that would greatly improve outcomes in practice and make it easier for TB programs to roll out treatment for a larger number of patients. Unfortunately, those three large trials show that none of the 4-month regimens being evaluated were as good as the standard of care. So we're still looking for shorter treatments that can result in better outcomes for TB.

A lot of the work in trials at the moment is looking at how we can best identify the most promising regimens to take forward to large expensive trials. So some of the work that we've done, some of the research that's being presented in the BMC Medicine series, is looking at better ways of doing clinical trials to identify those regimens to take forward to large Phase III trials.

These series may not fully characterize anticipated risks in the patient described by Walter et al. who presented as an older woman with smear-negative pleuro-pulmonary disease in a later century. Nonetheless, they suggest that the risk of anatomically distant TB recurrence remains even years after the apparent resolution of the initial infection, particularly following pleural TB. Better appreciation of the potential seriousness of such recurrences may appropriately influence therapeutic decisions.

### Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: "there must be some kind of way out of here" [^94c9073c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Over the past 7 decades, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has developed resistance to virtually every new drug used to treat tuberculosis, resulting recently in the global emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. In an individual, treatment with a single new drug results in acquired drug resistance within weeks to months. On a population basis, the pattern is just as consistent. After a new drug is introduced, drug-resistant cases or case series are reported within months to years, typically leading to focused surveys, and within several years, dramatic outbreaks with extraordinary mortality occur. Invariably, such outbreaks prove to be the tip of the iceberg. Incomplete and delayed diagnoses, drug costs, and drug supplies are frequently implicated. With new drugs and new diagnostics on the horizon, we must develop new ways of incorporating them into public health practice, basing treatment on rapid drug-susceptibility tests, ensuring that effective drugs are always used in combination, and making these drug available to persons who need them.

### Respiratory isolation for tuberculosis: a historical perspective [^b7e43a23]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Although tuberculosis is an ancient disease, recognition of its airborne route of transmission, with implications for respiratory isolation, is relatively recent. Historically, the disease was believed to be hereditary or contracted by inhaling 'miasma', or corrupted air, and patients were not routinely isolated. The sanatorium initially served as a place of healing for patients with tuberculosis. Discovery of the tubercle bacillus and its mode of transmission via aerosol in the late 19th/early 20th century reinforced the important public health role of sanatoria and tuberculosis hospitals in preventing disease transmission through isolation. In recent decades, outpatients receiving treatment are required to remain in respiratory isolation at home until they are deemed noninfectious based on multiple sputum samples. This historical review demonstrates that despite changing medical knowledge, drug therapies, and social conditions over time, the role of isolation remains an important topic of debate in the treatment of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

### The global tuberculosis situation. progress and problems in the 20th century, prospects for the 21st century [^6dba530f]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been identified in prehistoric remains of humans. Despite references to TB by Hippocrates and Galen, humankind had limited understanding of and few tools to defend itself against TB until the later 19th century. Subsequently, landmark advances in the 20th century provided the means to control and prevent this disease. At the same time, epidemiological developments and fundamental problems related to human behavior, socioeconomic conditions, and political circumstances continue to thwart efforts to diminish the burden of suffering and death caused by TB. This article reviewed some of these issues including the global failure of TB control in the late 20th century, the worldwide emergence of drug-resistant TB, the extensive spread of HIV infection and its impact on TB incidence; and changing health care and political environments. The obstacles to TB control remain and will remain challenges in the coming years. Still, recent developments in immunology, biochemistry, and molecular biology suggest that new knowledge and tools are just around the corner. These will enhance the ability to conquer this microbe by the end of the current century.

### Pyrazinamide safety, efficacy, and dosing for treating drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis: a phase 3, randomized controlled clinical trial [^72f59b96]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, with 10.6 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths reported by the World Health Organization in 2022. Pyrazinamide plays a crucial role in the treatment of TB by killing nonreplicating persisters that other companion drugs fail to kill. The current pyrazinamide dose was determined from historic clinical trials, but the rationale behind it remains a subject of ongoing debate. Before 1970, high daily doses (3,000 mg) and prolonged use of pyrazinamide were believed to lead to hepatotoxicity, limiting its use as a first-line agent for TB treatment. Subsequent trials explored lower daily doses (1,000–2,000 mg or 16–34 mg/kg) in combination with rifampicin, shortening treatment duration to 6 months with acceptable toxicity. These findings led to the adoption of the standard 6-month treatment with pyrazinamide for the initial 2 months. Currently, the World Health Organization and U.S. treatment guidelines recommend a daily dose of 20–30 mg/kg for most persons, with a maximum of 2,000 mg for drug-susceptible TB.

### Comparing the efficacy of drug regimens for pulmonary tuberculosis: meta-analysis of endpoints in early-phase clinical trials [^ba5d212d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This review is the first to systematically appraise the performance of single drugs and combination regimens across early clinical endpoints in trials of treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Though we focussed only on the set of drugs most relevant to historical and modern first-line therapy, we identified 133 trials reporting phase 2A and 2B outcomes comprising > 37000 patients and 67 drug combinations. However, the diversity of treatment regimens represented in 14-day phase 2A studies was much lower, with only 9 drug combinations assessed on > 1 phase 2A endpoint and only 3 of these combinations assessed in both phase 2A and 2B trials. While these findings partly reflect the history, development, and differing goals of such trials, the narrowness of this evidence base is concerning and suggests a potentially serious gap in rational translation between these 2 critical phases of development. While rankings of the efficacy of treatment appeared reasonably consistent on different phase 2A endpoints, the existing dataset does not provide convincing support to current practices, and intertrial variability was high in many cases.

We selected 4 outcome measures for our review based on those most commonly reported in the included studies. However, there was large variation in reporting, particularly of EBA measures, with many unique to a single study. Overall the quality of reporting, particularly of phase 2A studies, made data extraction and synthesis challenging and imposes limitations in interpretation of the data. The striking feature of the available dataset is the variability of pooled estimates of effect for all the endpoints examined. For EBA 0–2 and 2-month culture conversion, this variability was particularly marked, with overlapping confidence intervals for the majority of regimens. Though there were appreciable differences between the best-performing regimens on these endpoints (H, HRZ, HRZE, and SHRZ) and the worst (Z, S, SH, and SHP), this suggests that such trials may lack the power to formally discriminate between regimens where differences in treatment effect are more modest but still clinically relevant. The reasons for this variability were difficult to explore using the data available, given the quality and consistency of reporting.

### Therapeutic pneumothorax and the nobel prize [^07110f66]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

At the turn of the 20th century, the epidemic proportions of tuberculosis puzzled great parts the scientific community. Thus it is not surprising that well-known scholars who worked on particularly promising solutions to fight the disease were nominated for the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, perhaps the most prestigious benchmark of scientific excellence. The authors have gathered files on the Italian phtisiologist Carlo Forlanini (1847 to 1918) at the Nobel Prize archive for Physiology or Medicine in Solna, Sweden. Drawing on these files and contemporary publications, the authors discuss the origin of artificial pneumothorax for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, show how it became an international gold standard operation, and trace why the Nobel committee finally chose not to award Forlanini. Twenty Nobel Prize nominations for Forlanini were submitted from 1912 to 1919 exclusively by Italian scholars. In 1913 and 1914, Forlanini was on the shortlist of the Nobel Committee and thus one of the prime candidates for the prestigious prize. Important aspects of the rise, fall, and revival of the artificial pneumothorax from 1815 to 2015 are highlighted along with its benefits and risks.

### "Ping-pong" in the heart: a case report and literature review [^1967ff0f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ball thrombus is rare and life-threatening. The correct diagnosis and timely management are key to improving patient prognosis. Here, we present a case report and literature review of ball thrombus.

Case Presentation

A 75-year-old woman presented to our outpatient clinic because of palpitations and chest distress for 8 months. She was diagnosed mitral stenosis, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a round mass attached to the left atrial (LA) wall. Before anesthesia induction, TTE found that the mass has dropped from the LA wall, and was spinning in the LA causing intermittent obstruction of the valve. Anesthesia induction was then carried out under TTE monitoring, and transesophageal echocardiograph found another mass in the LA appendage after intubation. She underwent LA mass removal and mitral valve replacement, and was discharged uneventfully. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of thrombus. Our literature review identified 19 cases of ball thrombus between 2015 and 2024. The average age was 54.8 (range 3–88) years. Heart failure was present as the initial symptom in 11 cases, and most patients had mitral valve disease or concomitant with atrial fibrillation. 12 cases received surgery, and 7 received medical treatment only. 2 deaths occurred, one due to the obstruction of left ventricular inflow tract and the other due to the worsening of heart failure.

Conclusion

Ball thrombus is rare in clinical settings. Urgent thrombectomy should be performed as soon as possible, and echocardiography can be used for real-time monitoring during surgery.

### Tuberculosis in sub-saharan Africa: opportunities, challenges, and change in the era of antiretroviral treatment [^567a5069]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Rapid scale-up of antiretroviral treatment programmes is happening in Africa, driven by international advocacy and policy directives and supported by unprecedented donor funding and technical assistance. This welcome development offers hope to millions of HIV-infected Africans, among whom tuberculosis is the major cause of serious illness and death. Little in the way of HIV diagnosis or care was previously offered to patients with tuberculosis, by either national tuberculosis or AIDS control programmes, with tuberculosis services focused exclusively on diagnosis and treatment of rising numbers of patients. Tuberculosis control in Africa has yet to adapt to the new climate of antiretroviral availability. Many barriers exist, from drug interactions to historic differences in the way that tuberculosis and HIV are perceived, but failure to successfully integrate HIV and tuberculosis control will threaten the viability of both programmes. Here, we review tuberculosis epidemiology in Africa and policy implications of HIV/AIDS treatment scale-up.

### Mycobacterium tuberculosis precursor rRNA as a measure of treatment-shortening activity of drugs and regimens [^4293b11d]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

There is urgent need for new drug regimens that more rapidly cure tuberculosis (TB). Existing TB drugs and regimens vary in treatment-shortening activity, but the molecular basis of these differences is unclear, and no existing assay directly quantifies the ability of a drug or regimen to shorten treatment. Here, we show that drugs historically classified as sterilizing and non-sterilizing have distinct impacts on a fundamental aspect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis physiology: ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. In culture, in mice, and in human studies, measurement of precursor rRNA reveals that sterilizing drugs and highly effective drug regimens profoundly suppress M. tuberculosis rRNA synthesis, whereas non-sterilizing drugs and weaker regimens do not. The rRNA synthesis ratio provides a readout of drug effect that is orthogonal to traditional measures of bacterial burden. We propose that this metric of drug activity may accelerate the development of shorter TB regimens.

### The continued threat of tuberculosis [^bbd9ea56]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Why would a journal that tracks and analyzes emerging infectious disease trends devote an entire issue to tuberculosis, a disease that emerged some 15,000 to 35,000 years ago? The disturbing answer is that tuberculosis is reappearing in many countries as a public health crisis. Thus, if not an emerging disease, it is an important reemerging disease, and though ancient, it is not a disease of the past. A staggering 1.9 million around the globe die of tuberculosis each year — another 1.9 billion are infected with M. tuberculosis and are at risk for active disease.

In the 20th century, the United States made impressive strides in tuberculosis control. From the early 1900s, when some areas began systematic reporting of death rates, tuberculosis rates steadily declined from approximately 200 deaths per 100,000 per year to less than 1 death per 100,000 in 1985. In 1953, a national surveillance system was established for reporting new cases of tuberculosis disease; that year, reported annual incidence was 53 cases per 100,000 population. From 1953 to 1984, tuberculosis disease incidence dropped steadily at an average rate of 5.8% per year to 9.4 cases per 100,000.

### Tuberculosis [^917c6d92]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Tuberculosis results in an estimated 1·7 million deaths each year and the worldwide number of new cases (more than 9 million) is higher than at any other time in history. 22 low-income and middle-income countries account for more than 80% of the active cases in the world. Due to the devastating effect of HIV on susceptibility to tuberculosis, sub-Saharan Africa has been disproportionately affected and accounts for four of every five cases of HIV-associated tuberculosis. In many regions highly endemic for tuberculosis, diagnosis continues to rely on century-old sputum microscopy; there is no vaccine with adequate effectiveness and tuberculosis treatment regimens are protracted and have a risk of toxic effects. Increasing rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis in eastern Europe, Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa now threaten to undermine the gains made by worldwide tuberculosis control programmes. Moreover, our fundamental understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease is inadequate. However, increased investment has allowed basic science and translational and applied research to produce new data, leading to promising progress in the development of improved tuberculosis diagnostics, biomarkers of disease activity, drugs, and vaccines. The growing scientific momentum must be accompanied by much greater investment and political commitment to meet this huge persisting challenge to public health. Our Seminar presents current perspectives on the scale of the epidemic, the pathogen and the host response, present and emerging methods for disease control (including diagnostics, drugs, biomarkers, and vaccines), and the ongoing challenge of tuberculosis control in adults in the 21st century.

### Tuberculosis prevention: current strategies and future directions [^09eac33f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

An estimated one fourth of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and 5–10% of those infected develop tuberculosis in their lifetime. Preventing tuberculosis is one of the most underutilized but essential components of curtailing the tuberculosis epidemic. Moreover, current evidence illustrates that tuberculosis manifestations occur along a dynamic spectrum from infection to disease rather than a binary state as historically conceptualized. Elucidating determinants of transition between these states is crucial to decreasing the tuberculosis burden and reaching the END-TB Strategy goals as defined by the WHO. Vaccination, detection of infection, and provision of preventive treatment are key elements of tuberculosis prevention.

Objectives

This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent evidence and state-of-the-art updates on advancements to prevent tuberculosis in various settings and high-risk populations.

Sources

We identified relevant studies in the literature and synthesized the findings to provide an overview of the current state of tuberculosis prevention strategies and latest research developments.

Content

We present the current knowledge and recommendations regarding tuberculosis prevention, with a focus on M. bovis Bacille-Calmette-Guérin vaccination and novel vaccine candidates, tests for latent infection with M. tuberculosis, regimens available for tuberculosis preventive treatment and recommendations in low- and high-burden settings.

Implications

Effective tuberculosis prevention worldwide requires a multipronged approach that addresses social determinants, and improves access to tuberculosis detection and to new short tuberculosis preventive treatment regimens. Robust collaboration and innovative research are needed to reduce the global burden of tuberculosis and develop new detection tools, vaccines, and preventive treatments that serve all populations and ages.

Figure 2.
Disease burdens of a simulated population over time. Patients whose infections exceed the "symptom threshold" (a mathematical benchmark) are tracked until death (when the bacillary burden exceeds a mathematical "death threshold", colored in red) or self-resolution (when the burden falls below the "symptom threshold", colored in green). Patients who continue to experience active tuberculosis (ie, without exceeding the death threshold or experiencing self-resolution) after 5 years are colored in blue. Patients who never develop symptomatic disease (ie, never surpass the symptom threshold) are plotted in grey. All disease burdens depicted were generated using the same model parameters and represent the population variability in progression/recovery rates as well as stochastic transitions between phases of infection. The disease burden of an arbitrary Patient A quantitatively depicts the progression of disease diagrammed graphically in Figure 1C; note that the rate (slope) of progression for Patient A is the same throughout her life (ie, both before and after recovery).

To identify those parameter values most consistent with observed population-level data, we assigned each cohort a pseudolikelihood, defined as the joint probability density of the simulated cohort's population-level characteristics according to estimated density functions for 3 key summary statistics of observed prechemotherapy era cohorts: 55% case-fatality ratio within 5 years of symptom onset, median symptom duration of 3 years, and spontaneous resolution of ≥ 10% of cases. (For further details, see Importance Resampling in the Supplementary Methods.) After assigning a pseudolikelihood to each simulated cohort, we resampled 2 million cohorts, with replacement, proportional to the pseudolikelihood. The resampled (posterior) distribution therefore represents — in weighted fashion — those cohorts (and their corresponding parameter values) with the best fit to historical data. We define 95% uncertainty ranges (UR) as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of each parameter's value, across the posterior distribution.

Tuberculosis

Another ancient microbial scourge that has reemerged in recent years is tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This infection is estimated to be prevalent in one third of the world's population. From this reservoir, 8 million new cases of TB develop worldwide each year that carry a death toll of > 2 million. TB is especially prevalent among persons infected with HIV. The only currently available TB vaccine, M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), offers some protection, but its effect diminishes with time. TB drug treatment is effective, but adherence to lengthy therapeutic regimens is difficult to maintain, and multidrug-resistant TB is on the rise in many countries.

Researchers are applying state-of-the-art genomic and postgenomic techniques to identify key molecular pathways that could be exploited to develop improved TB interventions and vaccines. In 2004, for the first time in 60 years, 2 new vaccines designed to prevent TB entered phase 1 clinical trials in the United States. Many promising new anti-TB drug candidates also are now entering the drug pipeline. Derivatives of known anti-TB drugs, such as thiolactomycin and ethambutol, are currently being screened for activity against M. tuberculosis. Preclinical development of a highly promising candidate, SQ109 is nearing completion.

### Classification of early tuberculosis States to guide research for improved care and prevention: an international Delphi consensus exercise [^eb3b39c2]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality for thousands of years. Despite the availability of a vaccine for over 100 years and drugs for over 75 years, TB remains the leading cause of death globally from an infectious disease. TB has a complex natural history and pathogenesis which is still incompletely understood. A minority of people exposed and considered infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) progress to disease. The incubation period is variable, with highly heterogeneous disease presentation and progression pathways. Faced with this complexity, a simplifying framework has value in helping to guide and communicate the public health approach, management, and scientific investigation of TB. Periodically, the nature of the framework inevitably must evolve reflecting new scientific understanding, tools for diagnosis and intervention, and public health priorities.

The development of curative antibiotic treatment from the late 1940s resulted in a radical change in the approach to managing TB and led to a shift in approach to disease classification. Prior to this period, TB was recognised as a dynamic process, with prognostic stratification by disease extent on chest X-ray (CXR) and the precise classification of current disease state (arrested, quiescent, active, etc.). This approach was abandoned and in its place, a simple binary paradigm of latent infection and active disease emerged. The diagnosis of disease increasingly focused on microbiological confirmation as a prerequisite for receiving curative treatment. Infection was inferred from evidence of immune sensitisation to Mtb antigens in the absence of features of disease, with therapy recommended in certain situations to prevent progression to disease. This binomial simplicity facilitated the development and improvement of programmatic management of TB during the 1990s particularly with the DOTS strategy, which emphasised case detection and standardised treatment of symptomatic people with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB. While this approach prevented millions of TB deaths, it had lesser impact on transmission and disease incidence, possibly because millions of individuals with TB do not present to health facilities or receive care.

### Drug-resistant tuberculosis: challenges and progress [^e82d22a1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a natural evolutionary process, which in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is based on spontaneous chromosomal mutations, meaning that well-designed combination drug regimens provided under supervised therapy will prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Unfortunately, limited resources, poverty, and neglect have led to the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis throughout the world. The international community has responded with financial and scientific support, leading to new rapid diagnostics, new drugs and regimens in advanced clinical development, and an increasingly sophisticated understanding of resistance mechanisms and their application to all aspects of TB control and treatment.

### Linking individual natural history to population outcomes in tuberculosis [^7a1c32d1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study sought to identify individual-level tuberculosis disease characteristics that were consistent with historical population-level clinical outcomes, using a simplified model. As our model is calibrated to clinical characteristics of symptomatic tuberculosis, it should be interpreted as representative of incipient and active tuberculosis (but not long-term latency). The simulated case-fatality (median 55%), duration of disease (median 129 weeks), and proportion of self-resolved cases (median 28%) indicate that this simplified structure can capture the basic dynamics of clinical tuberculosis progression in human populations. Our primary results suggest that, under physiological conditions in realistic populations, active tuberculosis may reasonably be represented as a slow rate of disease progression (median 84-day doubling time) and a low probability of transitioning from progression to recovery (16% per year).

This modeling approach deliberately utilized a minimal parameterization of complex disease processes, but many possible complex models may also be consistent with observed clinical characteristics of tuberculosis progression. Therefore, the results presented here must be interpreted in the context of this framework and the analytical approach utilized.

It may be useful to provide intuitive context for these results. For example, we fit our model to a review of prechemotherapy era studies suggesting that tuberculosis patients experienced symptoms for an average of 3 years before death or symptom resolution. Our estimated median doubling time of 84 days (Figure 5B, black posterior) would generate a net 10⁴ unit increase in disease burden (the minimum difference between the "symptom threshold" and "death threshold") in 3.1 years of continuous progression. Our estimated 16% yearly probability — equivalent to a 29% probability of transition in the first 2 years — likewise reflects the empirical estimate (to which our data were fit) that 28% of untreated tuberculosis patients experience spontaneous resolution.

### Latent tuberculosis: two centuries of confusion [^2e8d7615]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Latent TB Terminology: Origins, Evolution, and Pervasion/Pervasiveness

Since 1971, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has regularly issued TB treatment guidelines. In 1994, these guidelines issued recommendations for the treatment of TB disease and TB infection with no mention of the word "latent". In 1999, the ATS issued for the first time a separate guideline that specifically addressed "latent tuberculosis infection" Not only did the terminology for TB infection change to LTBI, the terminology for its treatment also changed — from "preventive treatment" to "treatment of LTBI". The recommended treatment for LTBI (isoniazid monotherapy) remained unchanged from that for its namesake (TB infection) in 1994. The 1999 guidelines offered neither an explanation for the new name nor a definition. Rather, the definition was in a separate document published contemporaneously that contained guidelines for the diagnosis of TB. Here, LTBI was defined as "a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test (TST), negative bacteriologic studies (if done), and no clinical, bacteriologic or radiologic evidence of active tuberculosis". In 2017, the updated guidelines modified the LTBI definition to "a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens with no evidence of clinically manifest active TB".

The influential role of the ATS guidelines is reflected by endorsements from key organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. It is not surprising then that their changed terminology for the exact same clinical condition — radiological evidence of inactive TB and/or TB immunoreactivity — had a profound influence on the field. Indeed, a PubMed search suggests this, showing a surge of papers using the term "latent tuberculosis" starting in 2000 (Figure 1). We did, however, find occasional indexed papers on latent TB as far back as 1894. Surely, the definition of latent TB in the 19th and early 20th century papers could not have been the same as the current one, given that the earliest articles predated tuberculin testing. What could latent TB have meant in the pretuberculin era? To understand this, we took our search back further, and identified the term "phthisie latent" (latent phthisis) in papers as early as 1819. Thus, the concept of latent TB predated not only tuberculin testing but also, by more than 60 years, the discovery of the tubercle bacillus.

### Tuberculosis (TB) [^2439612f]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis Fighting TB In the 1960s, another U. S. Public Health Service program transferred to CDC; this one focused on preventing tuberculosis. TB is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium that spreads from person to person through airborne droplets. Historically, patients with TB were sent to sanitariums for treatment, but the availability of antibiotics after WWII meant patients could receive outpatient therapy instead. When the TB program transferred to CDC, Public Health Advisors actively monitored their assigned neighborhoods for high-risk groups, such as older men, immigrants, and people experiencing homelessness. If a case was identified, the patient was treated to prevent transmission to others, and Public Health Advisors would watch their contacts to prevent TB transmission. Seen here are projector slides from the Neighborhood Disease Control Self-Help Kits used by the neighborhood Public Health Advisors to train local communities about TB.

The slides feature a series of images showing how TB is spread, diagnosed, and then treated. In the images, a red mist, representing the TB bacteria, is shown spreading through the air and being inhaled by others as people have contact with one another. Next a person is given a skin test, then a chest x-ray, and begins taking antibiotics. Today, CDC continues its work against TB by monitoring for new cases, providing funding to state and local programs, and providing laboratory diagnostics. Take a closer look:

- View the causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, under a microscope and through the lens of a scanning electron microscope.
- View an x-ray of a TB patient's chest and an example of a TB-positive skin test.
- Take a look at laboratorian Margaret M. Floyd in protective gear as she studies.

Then and now:

- Learn what poet William Ernest Henley and Nelson Mandela have in common and view the mural commissioned in Mandela's honor.
- Explore the history of World TB Day.
- Read 2019 MMR, "Global Epidemiology of Tuberculosis and Progress Toward Achieving Global Targets".

### Tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and infertility: what ailed george orwell? [^1079f728]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

In the last and most productive years of his life, George Orwell struggled with pulmonary tuberculosis, dying at the dawn of the era of chemotherapy. His case history illustrates clinical aspects of tuberculosis with contemporary relevance: the role of poverty in its spread, the limited efficacy of monotherapy, the potential toxicity of treatment, and the prominence of cachexia as a terminal symptom. Orwell's ordeals with collapse therapy may have influenced the portrayal of the tortures of Winston Smith in the novel 1984. I discuss unifying diagnoses for Orwell's respiratory problems and apparent infertility, including tuberculous epididymitis, Young syndrome, immotile cilia syndrome, and cystic fibrosis.

### The history of tuberculosis [^e8e94573]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis has claimed its victims throughout much of known human history. It reached epidemic proportions in Europe and North America during the 18th and 19th centuries, earning the sobriquet, "Captain Among these Men of Death". Then it began to decline. Understanding of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis began with the work of Théophile Laennec at the beginning of the 19th century and was further advanced by the demonstration of the transmissibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection by Jean-Antoine Villemin in 1865 and the identification of the tubercle bacillus as the etiologic agent by Robert Koch in 1882. Clemens von Pirquet developed the tuberculin skin test in 1907 and 3 years later used it to demonstrate latent tuberculous infection in asymptomatic children. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries sanatoria developed for the treatment of patients with tuberculosis. The rest provided there was supplemented with pulmonary collapse procedures designed to rest infected parts of lungs and to close cavities. Public Health measures to combat the spread of tuberculosis emerged following the discovery of its bacterial cause. BCG vaccination was widely employed following World War I. The modern era of tuberculosis treatment and control was heralded by the discovery of streptomycin in 1944 and isoniazid in 1952.

### Tuberculosis and its treatment: an overview [^58d651a9]. Mini Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pulmonary tuberculosis:

- **Definition**: Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria.
- **Pathophysiology**: Tuberculosis is caused by AFB Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of tuberculosis in the US is estimated at 2.8 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The early infiltration either regresses asymptomatically or spreads via bronchi as obstructive lobular pneumonia that develops into caseous pneumonia and fragments to produce cavities or becomes the focus of post-primary granulomas and fibrocaseous disease. The dissemination of tuberculosis can lead to extrapulmonary granulomas. Active pulmonary infection results in either transmission of infection to other humans via coughing or the host may die of illness.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) has a success rate of > 95%. Approximately 20% of cases of MDR-TB are classified as XDR-TB in some areas.

### Late complications of collapse therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis [^2ff0709b]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Collapse therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis involved placement of various materials to occupy space and keep the lung collapsed. Complications are encountered decades later.

Patients and Methods

Between 1980 and 1997, we treated 31 patients with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis in whom collapse therapy had been used and who later developed complications related to their treatment. Pyogenic empyema was present in 24 patients, pleural calcifications with bronchopleural fistula was present in 3 patients, pleural calcification with nonresolvable pneumothorax was present in 1 patient, and migration of a foreign body with formation of subcutaneous mass occurred in 3 patients. All patients with empyema were treated with antibiotics and tube drainage of pus. In addition, Lucite balls were extracted in 4 patients, lung decortication was performed in 6 patients, thoracoplasty was performed in 2 patients, and fenestration was performed in 16 patients. Bronchopleural fistulas were closed with sutures and reinforced with intercostal muscle flap in three patients; in one patient with pleural calcification and nonresolvable pneumothorax, tube drainage was attempted. In three patients with subcutaneous mass due to paraffin migration, paraffin was extracted.

Results

Pulmonary decortication (six patients) and thoracoplasty (two patients) resulted in elimination of empyema. Extraction of Lucite balls resulted in lung expansion and elimination of empyema in three of four patients; draining sinus remains in one patient. Fenestration resulted in elimination of empyema in 12 of 16 patients, with 3 patients with residual draining sinuses and 1 patient with remaining empyema. All bronchopleural fistulas closed with intercostal muscle flap remained closed. Following extraction of paraffin blocks, infection developed in one patient. During the follow-up period, three patients died, all of unrelated causes.

Conclusions

Delayed complications of collapse therapy for tuberculosis should be treated without delay. Pressure on adjacent structures or their erosion presents danger and mandates immediate extraction; however, there is no need for routine removal of every residual plombe. Further increase in the number of multiple-drug resistant strains may force the return of collapse therapy.

### Robert koch and the white death: from tuberculosis to tuberculin [^2d3bf441]. Microbes and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

The German medical bacteriologist Robert Koch is commonly considered one of the founding fathers of medical bacteriology. His investigations into the aetiology of tuberculosis uncovered the pathogen of this condition, the tubercle bacillus today known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in 1882. This work can be seen as a cornerstone of contemporary medical bacteriology, its technologies and methods. It has often been asked how such successful research connected to the tuberculin episode of 1890/91, when Koch produced a medicine for that disease, which spectacularly failed when applied in practice. The analysis concentrates on the path of mostly experimental investigations which Koch followed between 1882 and 1890. From Koch's laboratory notes it becomes clear that tuberculin therapy did in fact work in Koch's laboratory, even though it failed to do so almost anywhere else. The clue to this contradictory picture lies in the peculiar nature of Koch's understanding of tuberculosis as a disease e.g. his reliance an animal experiments, which essentially differed from what many of his contemporaries held as essentials of that condition.

### Potential effect of age of BCG vaccination on global paediatric tuberculosis mortality: a modelling study [^0b2fedb0]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses

Oracle Crystal Ball was used to generate 100 000 iterations of the model, simultaneously sampling from each parameter distribution (table 1). We report median values and a 95% uncertainty range (UR) from these iterations. Where underlying parameter distributions were not stated, log-normal distributions were generated from each point estimate and 95% range using the 2·5%, 50%, and 97·5% quantiles in the rriskDistributions package in the programme R, consistent with previous work. A summary of each parameter can be found in the appendix (p 5).

In the baseline scenario, a correlation coefficient of 1 (perfect correlation) was assumed between the number of tuberculosis deaths in children who had received tuberculosis treatment and those who were untreated, and also between the numbers of tuberculosis deaths in children aged 0–4 years and 5–14 years. These assumptions were explored in a sensitivity analysis, which assumed no correlation (coefficient = 0). A further sensitivity analysis explored the assumption of uniform risk of tuberculosis death in children aged 0–4 years, and considered the hypothetical situation where 100% of deaths in this age group occurred in children aged 0–2 years. In each case the model was re-run an additional 100 000 times.

Role of the funding source

WHO provided financial support to the London Schoold of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine TB Modelling Group to conduct this work, contributed to the development of the research question, and reviewed manuscript drafts. WHO had no role in data collection, data analysis, or data interpretation, and writing of this report. The corresponding author had full access to the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

### Purpura and erythema associated with cutaneous numbness and hyperesthesia [^b7a39803]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What other sport is likely to result in a similar appearance?
A. Running
B. Scuba diving
C. Ping-pong
D. Water polo
E. Wrestling

Answers:
A. Running – Incorrect. Running lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin diseases associated with running include jogger's nipples, jogger's toe, traction alopecia, runner's rump, piezogenic pedal papules, blisters, and tinea pedis.
B. Scuba diving – Incorrect. Scuba diving lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin disease associated with scuba diving includes scuba diver facial dermatitis from masks, diving suit dermatitis from the rubber suit, and purpura goggelorum from goggles.
C. Ping-pong - Correct. A similar phenomenon is seen in high-velocity ball sports such as ping-pong, squash, floorball, racquetball, and paintball. In these activities, a high-velocity ball strikes the skin, resulting in an erythematous ring surrounding central blanching with or without accompanying or the subsequent development of purpura, described by Cohen as the ball SITE (sports-induced targetoid erythema) sign. In diving, the high-velocity impact produces similar lesions briefly mentioned in rare articles as platform purpura.
D. Water polo – Incorrect. Although water poloists also spend time in the pool as our patient did, they do not hit the water with velocities comparable to competitive divers, making it unlikely for this sport to result in a rash like the one in our patient. Skin disease associated with water polo includes swimmer's shoulder caused by repeated rubbing of an unshaven beard against the shoulder, and bikini bottom, which is a deep bacterial folliculitis associated with damp and tight-fitting swimwear.
E. Wrestling – Incorrect. Wrestling lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin disease associated with wrestling includes mat burn as well as herpes gladiatorum, scabies, pediculosis, and impetigo from close skin-to-skin contact between athletes.

### Tuberculosis: from prehistory to Robert koch, as revealed by ancient DNA [^73fadd12]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

During the past 10 years palaeomicrobiology, a new scientific discipline, has developed. The study of ancient pathogens by direct detection of their DNA has answered several historical questions and shown changes to pathogens over time. However, ancient DNA (aDNA) continues to be controversial and great care is needed to provide valid data. Here we review the most successful application of the technology, which is the study of tuberculosis. This has provided direct support for the current theory of Mycobacterium tuberculosis evolution, and suggests areas of investigation for the interaction of M tuberculosis with its host.

### Insights gained from palaeomicrobiology into ancient and modern tuberculosis [^c7b97981]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

The direct detection of ancient Mycobacterium tuberculosis molecular biomarkers has profoundly changed our understanding of the disease in ancient and historical times. Initially, diagnosis was based on visual changes to skeletal human remains, supplemented by radiological examination. The introduction of biomolecular methods has enabled the specific identification of tuberculosis in human tissues, and has expanded our knowledge of the palaeopathological changes associated with the disease. We now realize that the incidence of past tuberculosis was greater than previously estimated, as M. tuberculosis biomarkers can be found in calcified and non-calcified tissues with non-specific or no visible pathological changes. Modern concepts of the origin and evolution of M. tuberculosis are informed by the detection of lineages of known location and date.

### Linking individual natural history to population outcomes in tuberculosis [^c6ca8542]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with an estimated 23% of the world's population infected and 1.4 million individuals dying of tuberculosis in 2015. The spectrum of disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis demonstrates marked heterogeneity in terms of pathological presentation, incubation period, infectiousness, treatment responses, and other key clinical characteristics. While experimental studies have described underpinning biological mechanisms, and epidemiological studies have identified risk factors for tuberculosis progression at the population level, integrating these distinct approaches remains a complex task.

Epidemiological models are often utilized to make inferences about dynamics of complex systems, such as transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis and population-level impacts of various interventions. In many such models, however, individual-level temporal dynamics and pathological processes (such as disease onset, progression, cure, and death) are simplified as population-level rates or probabilities. In contrast, within-host models can help disentangle individual-level dynamics of M. tuberculosis replication, host immune cell responses, cytokine signaling, pathology, and bacterial metapopulations. Most within-host models of tuberculosis have uncertain applicability to human epidemics, however, as they draw on biological observations of experimental animal infection that have important dissimilarities with key aspects of human disease — including long-term asymptomatic latency, spontaneous self-resolution, and heterogeneity in disease outcome. There is therefore a critical gap in our understanding, namely the linkage of individual-level pathological processes to population-level clinical outcomes. Filling this gap could help to better predict the population-level effects of interventions — from better treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis to earlier diagnosis and linkage to care — for which individual-level biological effects may be easier to measure.

In this study, we present a mathematical framework to address this knowledge gap using a simplified biological representation of tuberculosis progression across a population of individuals with incipient active tuberculosis. In developing this framework, we aimed to create the simplest possible representation of biological processes that could be compared against observed population-level clinical outcomes. We then calibrate this system to characteristics of the natural history of tuberculosis observed in empirical studies of patients in the prechemotherapy era. The primary objective of this study is to identify individual-level characteristics of tuberculosis disease progression which could — when simulated in a simplified system over large populations of immunocompetent individuals — successfully recapitulate clinical outcomes of untreated tuberculosis at the population level.

### Global treatment outcomes of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ea45b9d5]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Historically, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis has been notoriously difficult to treat with devasting outcomes. As we are coming to the end of an era where the 2006 extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis definitions and old treatment regimens are being replaced, we aimed to estimate the proportion of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients globally who achieved successful treatment outcomes.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase from January 1, 2005, through April 3, 2023. Included studies reported WHO treatment outcomes, or adaptions hereof, for pre-extensively and/or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients according to the 2006 WHO definition. Eligible studies included cohorts of at least 10 adults (aged > 18 years) that were not pregnant. Using a random-effects model, we calculated pooled proportions of treatment outcomes and performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022340961.

Results

Among 5056 studies reviewed, we identified 94 studies from 26 countries, involving 10,223 extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients. The pooled proportion of successful treatment outcomes was 44.2% (95%CI: 38.3–50.3). Sensitivity analyses consistently produced similar estimates. A slight improvement in treatment outcomes was observed after 2013. Furthermore, 25 studies reported outcomes for 3564 individuals with pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, of which 63.3% achieved successful treatment (95%CI: 43.1–72.5).

Conclusion

Globally, the success rate of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment is 44.2%, far below the WHO's target rate of 75%. These results may serve as a reference for future studies assessing extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment outcomes under the 2021 definition treated with better treatment regimens available. Comprehensive surveillance data of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis outcomes from the whole world are desirable to monitor treatment progress.

Tuberculosis infection — treatment selection and regimen duration: Anti-TB drugs kill or inhibit multiplication of M tuberculosis, and historically the dominant regimen was 6 to 9 months of isoniazid monotherapy by SAT, although other alternatives have emerged with similar efficacy. Factors to consider in regimen selection include age, formulation needs, urgency, concomitant hepatotoxic medications, concurrent HIV infection, and suspected drug-resistant M tuberculosis. If therapy is completed successfully, there is no need to perform additional tests or chest radiographs unless a new exposure is documented or the child develops a clinical illness consistent with TB, which is noted as extremely rare in North America.

### Official American Thoracic Society / centers for disease control and prevention / Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis [^521ada3a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis — mechanisms and risk factors are described as follows: Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are continually undergoing spontaneous mutations that create resistance to individual antituberculosis drugs; however, the frequency of these mutations is sufficiently low that with appropriate combination chemotherapy that is reliably ingested, clinically significant resistance is very unlikely to develop. Acquired drug resistance can occur when there is a large bacillary population, an inadequate drug regimen, a combined failure of both the patient and the provider to ensure that an adequate regimen is ingested, or malabsorption of one or more antituberculous drugs; during extended or repeated treatment, amplification of resistance to multiple agents may occur, and patients with acquired drug resistance may transmit their strains to others who, if they develop tuberculosis, will have primary drug resistance. Notable clinical and demographic risk factors include having a previous episode of tuberculosis treatment (in particular if the regimen was inadequate or adherence to the regimen was low), originating from or living for an extended period in a country with a high prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, and having a history of exposure to an index case with drug-resistant tuberculosis.

### Updates on the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis: an official ATS / CDC / ERS / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^5fb5068b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Successful treatment and cure of tuberculosis (TB) improves individual health and reduces Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. Historically, treatment of TB, particularly of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), has involved prolonged courses of multiple medications and frequent adverse reactions. Patients and clinicians prefer shorter, safer, and more effective regimens with fewer pills and injections for drug-susceptible (DS)-TB and DR-TB (Table 2). Recent clinical treatment trials of both DS- and DR-TB provided new evidence toward these objectives. On the basis of favorable study outcomes, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) updated DS- and DR-TB treatment recommendations in 2022.

Table 2.
Patient Perspective

This guideline update, written by a panel of American Thoracic Society (ATS), CDC, European Respiratory Society (ERS), and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) specialists, relied on recent reviews of clinical data conducted by the WHO Guideline Development Group (GDG).

### The ping-pong ball as a surgical aid in liver transplantation [^66cfbec8]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Liver transplantation using split adult segmental grafts in infants can be a technical challenge because the small abdominal cavity cannot comfortably accommodate the graft, leading to compression. This size mismatch can be a particularly difficult problem when the anteroposterior diameter of the graft is greater than the infant's available anteroposterior peritoneal space. We describe a simple and novel technique that may prevent this complication.

Methods and Results

Two infants with biliary atresia weighing 5 kg each and aged 6 and 5 months, received split adult liver left lateral segment transplants from deceased donors weighing 55 and 65 kg, respectively. Congestion of the graft and inadequate perfusion were prevented by placing a sterilized ping-pong ball in the retrohepatic space to elevate the graft off the native hepatic fossa. The bilateral subcostal incision was required to be extended vertically in the midline up to the xiphisternum in both patients to enlarge the abdominal cavity. Delayed closure of the wound was performed after 5 days using Surgisis (porcine small intestine submucosa, Cook Surgical Inc, Bloomington, IN) when it was possible to remove the ping-pong ball in one of the patients. Both patients have recovered well from the transplant. A follow-up of 1 year in the patient with the in situ ping-pong ball shows it to be well anchored and causing no symptoms.

Conclusions

In children undergoing large-for-size split liver grafts, delaying the closure of the abdominal wound along with elevation of the graft using a ping-pong ball can be a useful and simple adjunct to prevent the complications of graft compression.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, after decades of decline, the incidence of tuberculosis began to rise in New York city, reaching a peak of 3811 cases by 1992. The epidemic took root in a setting of inadequate treatment regimens, homelessness, a diminished public-health system, and the onset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In addition, a subepidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis occurred throughout New York city, most notably in a series of well documented nosocomial outbreaks. By 1994, using broadened initial treatment regimens, directly observed therapy, and improved US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for hospital control and disease prevention, New York city began to effectively halt the progression of the epidemic. By 2002, tuberculosis rates in New York city reached an historic low of 1084. However, given the presence of a large reservoir of latently infected individuals in the city and an ongoing tuberculosis pandemic, New York city continues to face significant challenges from this persistent pathogen.

Recommendation grading and interpretation — Recommendations were rated using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and the strength of a recommendation indicates the committee's certainty that the desirable consequences of the recommended course of action outweigh the undesirable consequences. A strong recommendation is one for which the subcommittee is certain, whereas a conditional recommendation is one for which the subcommittee is uncertain, and uncertainty may exist if the quality of evidence is poor, there is a fine balance between desirable and undesirable consequences, the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences depends upon the clinical context, or there is variation about how individuals value the outcomes. A strong recommendation should be interpreted as the right thing to do for the vast majority of patients; a weak recommendation should be interpreted as being the right thing to do for the majority of patients, but maybe not for a sizeable minority of patients.

### Intelligent management of intelligence agencies: beyond accountability ping-pong [^6850df89]. The American Psychologist (2011). Low credibility.

The intelligence community (IC) is asked to predict outcomes that may often be inherently unpredictable-and is blamed for the inevitable forecasting failures, be they false positives or false negatives. To move beyond blame games of accountability ping-pong that incentivize bureaucratic symbolism over substantive reform, it is necessary to reach bipartisan agreements on performance indicators that are transparent enough to reassure clashing elites (to whom the IC must answer) that estimates have not been politicized. Establishing such transideological credibility requires (a) developing accuracy metrics for decoupling probability and value judgments; (b) using the resulting metrics as criterion variables in validity tests of the IC's selection, training, and incentive systems; and (c) institutionalizing adversarial collaborations that conduct level-playing-field tests of clashing perspectives.

### A portable single-sided magnet system for remote NMR measurements of pulmonary function [^bfb1b6ee]. NMR in Biomedicine (2014). Low credibility.

In this work, we report initial results from a light-weight, low field magnetic resonance device designed to make relative pulmonary density measurements at the bedside. The development of this device necessarily involves special considerations for the magnet, RF and data acquisition schemes as well as a careful analysis of what is needed to provide useful information in the ICU. A homogeneous field region is created remotely from the surface of the magnet such that when the magnet is placed against the chest, an NMR signal is measured from a small volume in the lung. In order to achieve portability, one must trade off field strength and therefore spatial resolution. We report initial measurements from a ping-pong ball size region in the lung as a function of lung volume. As expected, we measured decreased signal at larger lung volumes since lung density decreases with increasing lung volume. Using a CPMG sequence with ΔTE = 3.5 ms and a 20 echo train, a signal to noise ratio ~1100 was obtained from an 8.8mT planar magnet after signal averaging for 43s. This is the first demonstration of NMR measurements made on a human lung with a light-weight planar NMR device. We argue that very low spatial resolution measurements of different lobar lung regions will provide useful diagnostic information for clinicians treating Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as clinicians want to avoid ventilator pressures that cause either lung over distension (too much pressure) or lung collapse (too little pressure).

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Tubersol) [^ec8ecdfd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of the Test

The skin test should be read by a trained health professional 48 to 72 hours after administration of TUBERSOL. Skin test sensitivity is indicated by induration only; redness should not be measured.

Measure the diameter of induration transversely to the long axis of the forearm and record the measurement in millimeters (including 0 mm). (7) The tip of a ballpoint pen, gently pushed at a 45° angle toward the site of injection, will stop at the edge of induration.

Also record presence and size (if present) of necrosis and edema, although these are not used in the interpretation of the test.

Positive Reactions

Tuberculin reactivity may indicate latent infection, prior infection and/or disease with M. tuberculosis and does not necessarily indicate the presence of active tuberculous disease. Persons showing positive tuberculin reactions should be considered positive by current public health guidelines and referred for further medical evaluation. (7)(9) The repeated testing of uninfected persons does not sensitize them to TUBERSOL. (6)(7)(9)

The significance of induration measurements in diagnosing latent TB infection must be considered in terms of the patient's history and the risk of developing active TB disease as indicated in Table 1. (9)

A TST conversion is defined as an increase of ≥ 10 mm of induration within a 2-year period, regardless of age. (9)

The possibility should be considered that the skin test sensitivity may also be due to a previous contact with atypical mycobacteria or previous BCG vaccination. (7)(9)

Negative Reactions

An individual who does not show a positive reaction to 5 TU on the first test, but is suspected of being TB positive, may be retested with 5 TU. (See Booster Effect and Two-Step Testing .) Any individual who does not show a positive reaction to an initial injection of 5 TU, or a second test with 5 TU may be considered as tuberculin negative.

False Positive Reactions

False positive tuberculin reactions can occur in individuals who have been infected with other mycobacteria, including vaccination with BCG. (7) However, a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection and the use of preventive therapy should be considered for any BCG-vaccinated person who has a positive TST reaction, especially if the person has been, or is, at increased risk of acquiring TB infection. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE .) (13)(14)

Smear-positive patients

None of the smear-positive patients in the PCT cohort who had a smear examination at the end of treatment had a positive smear result at the end of treatment, compared to two in the control cohort. This implies that differences in cure rate were driven by the presence of a smear result and the proportion of patients defaulting during treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome (cure) comparing the PCT (64.5%) cohort with the control cohort (60.9%; RR: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96–1.16; P = 0.136).

Smear-positive patients in the PCT cohort were more likely to have successful treatment (82.2%) than patients in the control cohort (69.7%; RR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.10–1.26; P < 0.001). This was because more patients in the PCT cohort, compared to the historical cohort, completed treatment and had a final smear examination performed at the end of treatment (necessary in order to confirm cure).

Significantly more smear-positive patients in the PCT cohort had a recorded smear conversion at 2 months (80.2%), than in the control cohort (74.6%; RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01–1.15; P = 0.021). This difference was driven by the fact that a larger proportion of patients in the control cohort (20.1%) died, transferred, defaulted or did not have a sputum smear performed compared to the PCT cohort (15.5%). Comparing the proportion of patients with smear conversion only for those patients who were present at month 2, and had had a smear examination, did not reveal statistically significant changes between the PCT cohort (93.4%) and the historic cohort (94.9%; P = 0.359).

All new patients

A comparison of the treatment outcomes for all new patients included in the two cohorts showed a similar finding of a higher success rate in the PCT cohort (79%) compared to the control cohort (71.6%); RR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05–1.15; P < 0.001).

An alternative explanation, largely absent from these papers, was the idea proposed by Vallée: that these were recently arrived bacteria that had simply not had the time to provoke full-blown tuberculous pathology. If true, the bacteria were in the process of inducing tuberculous pathology, as indicated by the nonspecific inflammatory pathology seen in many of the lymph nodes from which they were recovered. Furthermore, not all investigators accepted the new bacteria-centric definition. For instance, Eugene Opie referred to a host-centric process, writing in 1927: "Latent tuberculosis may be defined as tuberculous infection which is unaccompanied by significant symptoms evident to the patient or by physical signs discovered by the physician". Despite the paucity of data regarding latent bacilli, the new definition of latent TB to describe avirulent or dormant bacteria capable of long-term residence in the host without causing pathological changes stuck for the rest of the century.

Objectives and initiation of antituberculosis therapy — The objectives of tuberculosis therapy are to rapidly reduce actively growing bacilli to decrease disease severity, prevent death, and halt transmission; to eradicate persisting bacilli to achieve durable cure and prevent relapse after completion of therapy; and to prevent acquisition of drug resistance during therapy. The decision to initiate combination chemotherapy is based on clinical, radiographic, laboratory, patient, and public health factors, and in patients (children and adults) with a high likelihood of tuberculosis or who are seriously ill with a disorder suspicious for tuberculosis, empiric treatment with a 4-drug regimen should be initiated promptly even before the results of acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy, molecular tests, and mycobacterial culture are known. Sixty-five years of investigation have consistently supported the necessity of treating with multiple drugs, and studies have found an increased risk of relapse with more extensive disease and/or slower response marked by delayed culture conversion at 2–3 months.

Month-2 culture conversion and cavitation — among patients treated for 6 months, having both cavitation and a positive culture at completion of 2 months of therapy has been associated with relapse rates of approximately 20% compared with 2% among patients with neither factor; for patients with cavitation and positive cultures at 2 months, expert opinion is to extend the continuation phase with INH and RIF for an additional 3 months (ie, a continuation phase of 7 months in duration, corresponding to a total of 9 months of therapy); additional factors supporting prolonged therapy when only one of these is present include being > 10% below ideal body weight.

### A spotlight on the tuberculosis epidemic in South Africa [^1129a74c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

What are you currently most hopeful about?

As a "glass half full"-type optimist (a useful attribute for one working in this field!), I'm hopeful that safe and tolerable drug regimens that effect durable cure in two months or less will be developed within the next decade. I am also convinced that much greater attention will be paid to the detection and treatment of subclinical TB, and that this will have a major impact on the epidemic. I expect to see insights emerging from research at the nexus of human TB immunology and vaccinology, which will impact significantly on prevention research. Perhaps most importantly, I am inspired by the talent, passion and commitment of TB scientists with whom I work, and from whom I learn — especially the next generation of researchers. This makes me confident that scientists based in high-burden countries such as mine are poised to play an increasingly prominent role in setting the global agenda for TB research, and in the discovery, development, and implementation of new tools for controlling this age-old disease.

### The South African tuberculosis care cascade: estimated losses and methodological challenges [^c7b99e7b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The historical focus of the tuberculosis program on treatment success rates among new, smear-positive cases (which accounted for only one third of tuberculosis cases) has resulted in insufficient attention to outcomes for all cases. Although treatment success rates for new, smear positive cases exceed 80%, treatment success rates for all cases are substantially lower. One in every four patients initiating tuberculosis treatment did not successfully complete treatment, equivalent to the loss of 92761 individuals during treatment. It is likely that this figure is an underestimate because the method used in calculating treatment success assumes that all patients who move out of health facilities move in to facilities elsewhere. Net differences between these figures in several districts suggest that this not the case. The use of a unique patient identifier would enable improved monitoring and quantification of this loss.

Health system performance, including integration of tuberculosis and HIV services and strong district and facility leadership and management, are predictors of high treatment success rates. Poor patient knowledge, lack of empowerment among patients to engage appropriately with health providers, and high costs associated with attending daily for direct observed therapy have been found to contribute to nonadherence and need to be addressed. mHealth and other interventions to improve adherence to tuberculosis treatment need to be evaluated to reduce this significant gap.

Treatment outcomes were substantially poorer among RIF-R tuberculosis cases than among DS tuberculosis cases, with just over half the patients with RIF-R tuberculosis successfully treated. South Africa is pursuing new policy options for interventions that have been shown to improve MDR-TB treatment outcomes, including decentralized models of MDR-TB care and the shortened 9-month treatment regimen.

Although the outcome in the RIF-R tuberculosis care cascade was substantially worse than in the DS tuberculosis care cascade, the small number of cases results in minimal impact on the cascade for all tuberculosis cases. Despite the small numbers, RIF-R tuberculosis cases draw disproportionately on financial resources, with about 50% of national tuberculosis expenditures allocated to treat the 7% of patients with RIF-R tuberculosis in 2014. Unless efforts are made to reduce leakages in the RIF-R tuberculosis care cascade to help reduce the high levels of primary transmission, this situation could be exacerbated in the future.

### At the deathbed of consumptive art [^1ed7ec18]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Prevention efforts were put in place. National antituberculosis programs were led by U.S. presidents. Ubiquitous "ad campaigns" featured catchy tunes some called "jingles". Architects designed alcoves to hide concealed spittoons in middle-class homes. Babies were no longer allowed to play on the floor, and mothers were told not to kiss children on the mouth. Some churches abandoned the "common" communion cup. "TB" and "x-ray" became household words. Streets were watered down before sweeping to prevent aerosols. Long "trailing" dresses went out of fashion because they dragged on the ground and picked up potentially infectious dust. Store candies and bakery loaves had to be wrapped; public libraries and their books were regularly disinfected.

Modern Times (1952–2002)

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a truck cycled through neighborhoods to administer chest x-rays, and schools provided "tine tests". Patients sat in big sunrooms off hospital wards, semi-erect in lounge chairs, wrapped like mummies on an ocean cruise. Family members disappeared for long periods — off to sanatoria for "rest cures". People bought Christmas Seals, and spoke in a slight hush when they mentioned "TB". As a medical student in the 1960s, I remember the second patient I ever examined. Born in 1879, she had undergone a right phrenic nerve crush, sometime around 1910, surviving tuberculosis to the age of 90.

Values of key parameters consistent with observed cohort data. Model input values (prior distributions) were sampled uniformly on log-transformed or log-modulus-transformed scales between reasonable bounds selected on an a priori basis (denoted by vertical dashed lines). Histogram densities show the proportion of 2 million weighted parameter values that were most consistent with observed cohort data from the prechemotherapy era (posterior distributions). A, Distributions of probabilities of transition from progression phase to recovery phase on weekly and annualized scales. Simulations most consistent with observed data therefore primarily contain transition probabilities in the lower half of the initially sampled range (ie, left-hand portion of the graph). The median transition probability among these data-consistent simulations (16% per year) implies that 50% of patients transition within 4.2 years (0.5 = e^(−0.16 × 4.2)), provided they survive that long. B, Distributions of progression rates and recovery rates during the progression phase (gray) and the recovery phase (black). In this graph, a progression/recovery rate of zero implies no change in disease burden with time. Recovery rates less than zero are therefore also displayed as half-lives (ie, duration of time required for the disease burden to be cut in half), while progression rates are displayed as doubling times (ie, duration of time required for the disease burden to double).

Effect of chemotherapy on infectiousness — pulmonary tuberculosis: At the time of diagnosis, which averaged 1 to 10 weeks from the onset of symptoms, patients are usually very infectious. Chemotherapy rapidly reduces viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum, with reductions by more than 99% (100-fold) by Days 14–21 attributable primarily to rifampin and pyrazinamide. Patients who have received treatment for as few as 2 days with the standard regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) could be assumed to have an infective potential that averages 10% of that at diagnosis, and after 14 to 21 days of treatment, infectiousness averages less than 1% at the pretreatment level.

### CDC grand rounds: the TB / HIV syndemic [^38df2f53]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Since Robert Koch's 1882 discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, substantial progress has been made in tuberculosis (TB) control. Nevertheless, in the latter part of the 20th century, a long period of neglect of both quality program implementation and research led to persistently high TB incidence rates and failure to develop new tools to adequately address the problem. Today, most of the world continues to rely on the same diagnostic test invented by Koch approximately125 years ago and on drugs developed 40 years ago. The world now faces a situation in which approximately 160 persons die of TB each hour (1.45 million died in 2009), in which a quarter of all deaths in persons with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (PWHA) are caused by TB, and in which the evolution of the bacteria has outpaced the evolution of its treatment to such an extent that some forms of TB are now untreatable. More recently, renewed attention has been given to reducing the global burden of TB, but much remains to be done.

### Post-tuberculosis sequelae and the burden of "Long TB": continuing TB care after treatment completion [^893aa612]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the nearly 80 years since the publication of the landmark trial "Streptomycin Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis" (TB) — the first ever randomized clinical trial — TB research and care have been understandably focused on pathogen eradication and microbiologic cure. An inherent feature of this focus on microbiologic outcomes, which has been dutifully performed by TB programs built around administering directly observed therapy, is that TB care ends at the completion of a certain number of doses of antitubercular medications. In turn, TB cure rates and mortality rates from TB have steadily improved in recent decades, representing a major advance for global public health. This focus on microbiologic cure has, however, led to a myopic view of TB as a disease defined primarily by detection of the pathogen. Indeed, although there is an increasing recognition that the binary categorization of latent TB infection versus active TB disease is an oversimplification, the relatively recent conceptualization of TB as having a more nuanced microbiologic and clinical spectrum has yet to incorporate a post-treatment state into this continuum. Thus, the current approach to TB is analogous to a situation in which those suffering cerebrovascular accidents have their acute pathology addressed only to be discharged without follow-up care or regard for their long-term neurologic debility. The fact that TB is an infectious disease, with treatment centered on the pathogen, has seemingly led to a sense of fatalism regarding its sequelae, such that individuals with persistent lung damage after treatment completion are thought to simply have presented too late.

### Patients with previously treated tuberculosis no longer neglected [^35659c36]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, global and national tuberculosis (TB)-control programs, challenged with limited resources, have had to prioritize interventions to maximize impact. For this reason, patients with newly diagnosed cases of TB received more attention than did patients with a previous history of treatment. The recently launched STOP TB Strategy and Global Plan to STOP TB 2006–2015 now promote proper diagnosis and treatment of TB for all patients, without distinction of smear status, drug susceptibility, sex, or age, including all patients with a history of previous treatment. Previously treated patients are difficult to re-treat and represent an important source of disease transmission, as well as a serious threat to TB control worldwide, because of their higher rate of drug resistance.
