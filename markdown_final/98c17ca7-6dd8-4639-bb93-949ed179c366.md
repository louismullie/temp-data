## Question

work up for ulcerative colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step diagnostic workup for ulcerative colitis, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the mandatory infectious workup and its scope. Next, I will review baseline laboratory tests and biomarkers, including fecal calprotectin and CRP, and how to interpret them. After that, I need to check the endoscopic strategy, including when to use flexible sigmoidoscopy versus full colonoscopy and what biopsies to obtain. Then, I will examine histopathology features and the role of histology in differentiating UC from Crohn's disease. I should also consider when cross-sectional imaging is indicated. Finally, I will integrate disease extent and severity classification, special populations, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking areas where guidance is conditional or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the clinical presentation that should trigger suspicion for UC: bloody diarrhea with urgency and tenesmus, abdominal cramping, mucus, and nocturnal stools, with attention to extraintestinal manifestations such as arthralgia, skin changes, ocular symptoms, and hepatobiliary disease, and I should also ask about recent smoking cessation, NSAID use, and family history of IBD to refine pretest probability, since these features increase the likelihood of UC and shape downstream testing choices [^115AZoZK] [^111GRpsa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — before labeling this as UC, I need to ensure we exclude infections that can mimic or complicate UC, and I should double-check that guidelines uniformly recommend C. difficile testing in all suspected UC or IBD flares, which they do, with strong recommendations despite low-quality evidence, and I should also consider broader stool pathogen panels in the right epidemiologic context because enteric infections can both mimic and worsen UC, and CMV is particularly important in immunosuppressed or severe presentations [^115Ncp3E] [^115xWhPa] [^112WJgd2] [^111cWk74] [^111GRpsa].

> Next, I should review baseline laboratory tests to establish inflammatory burden and complications: CBC for anemia and leukocytosis, CMP for liver enzymes and renal function, ESR/CRP as acute phase reactants, and albumin as a marker of disease severity and nutritional status; I need to ensure I also plan for anemia workup when hemoglobin is low, including iron studies, B12/folate, and reticulocyte indices, because iron deficiency is common and impacts management decisions [^1176HT4Q] [^113o4F2T].

> I will now examine noninvasive inflammatory biomarkers, and I should confirm the role of fecal calprotectin and CRP; fecal calprotectin correlates with endoscopic and histologic activity and is recommended to assess response, evaluate suspected relapse, and during maintenance, but I need to remember assay variability and within-stool variation, so if results are borderline or unexpected, repeating FC or proceeding to endoscopy is reasonable, and in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms suggestive of flare, FC > 150 μg/g, elevated lactoferrin, or CRP > 5 mg/L can rule in active inflammation and may obviate routine endoscopy, whereas normal biomarkers lower the probability of active disease but do not fully exclude it, especially in mild symptoms [^111AE3ce] [^113Kg9s7] [^113sb1Na] [^111WKv7T] [^116hT2dp].

> Wait, let me verify the endoscopic strategy because this is where errors often occur; in severe or acute severe UC, a full colonoscopy increases perforation risk, so flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies is preferred, whereas in stable patients, ileocolonoscopy with intubation of the terminal ileum and systematic biopsies is the gold standard to confirm UC, define extent, and exclude Crohn's disease; I should obtain at least two biopsies from five sites including the ileum and rectum, and even if the rectum looks normal, I need a rectal biopsy because microscopic inflammation can be patchy, and I should avoid routine upper endoscopy or small-bowel imaging unless symptoms or findings suggest proximal disease or CD [^115AZoZK] [^11422gtz] [^115RndQZ].

> Let me consider histopathology carefully; no single feature is diagnostic of UC, but basal plasmacytosis, diffuse crypt distortion and atrophy, villous surface irregularity, and mucin depletion, in the right clinical context, support UC, and I should confirm that the distribution is continuous from the rectum proximally, while remembering that rectal sparing and patchiness can occur with prior topical therapy or in pediatrics, which is why clinicopathologic correlation and adequate sampling are critical to avoid misclassification [^11422gtz] [^116t61Ay].

> I need to check when cross-sectional imaging is actually indicated; routine CT or MR enterography is not required if the terminal ileum is normal on colonoscopy, but in acute severe presentations with abdominal pain, fever, or peritoneal signs, contrast-enhanced CT is appropriate to exclude perforation, toxic megacolon, abscess, or obstruction, and MR enterography is preferred over CT when available to assess strictures and disease activity without radiation, with intestinal ultrasound as an emerging bedside adjunct where available [^115RndQZ] [^116Jddu5] [^1172NYyL] [^111A9i8k] [^115UiyYR].

> Next, I should review disease extent and severity classification because treatment hinges on this; extent is categorized as proctitis, left-sided colitis, or extensive/pancolitis, and severity integrates patient-reported outcomes with endoscopic scores such as Mayo or UCEIS and inflammatory markers, with treat-to-target aiming for endoscopic improvement (Mayo 0 or 1) to improve steroid-free remission and reduce hospitalizations and surgery, and I should confirm that biomarker thresholds like FC > 150 μg/g align with clinically meaningful inflammation in symptomatic patients [^115AZoZK] [^112tiRnr] [^113p4Y7H] [^113sb1Na].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or pregnant; in pediatrics, I should follow the Porto criteria with ileocolonoscopy plus upper endoscopy and small-bowel imaging when UC is not definite, and I should remember that patchy histology and rectal sparing are more common, while in pregnancy, flexible sigmoidoscopy without sedation is generally safe when clinically indicated, and I should individualize decisions about colonoscopy and imaging based on gestational age and severity [^11676SDc] [^115RndQZ] [^1127DD1D].

> I should double-check the practical decision algorithm to ensure internal consistency: if symptoms suggest UC, I exclude infection first with C. difficile and targeted stool studies, then obtain baseline labs and biomarkers, and if FC or CRP are elevated in the setting of moderate-to-severe symptoms, I treat as active disease and escalate therapy accordingly, whereas if biomarkers are normal in mild symptoms, I favor endoscopic assessment rather than empiric escalation, and if biomarkers are elevated in remission, I consider endoscopy or repeat biomarkers in 3–6 months to avoid missing subclinical inflammation [^113sb1Na] [^112ir1zP] [^116fZ97G].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of serologies; pANCA may be present in up to 70% of UC but has poor sensitivity and is not recommended to establish or rule out UC or to prognosticate, so I should avoid ANCA/ASCA panels in the diagnostic workup and rely on endoscopic and histologic assessment instead [^113cm3zk] [^115Ncp3E].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal planning is addressed; once the diagnosis is secured, I should arrange surveillance for colorectal cancer risk beginning 6–8 years after disease onset or at diagnosis if PSC is present, using high-definition white-light colonoscopy or chromoendoscopy with appropriate biopsy strategies, and I should incorporate biomarker monitoring during maintenance to detect relapse early while recognizing that biomarkers complement, rather than replace, endoscopic assessment in UC care [^1174QAwQ] [^111vjxiQ] [^111Atyfh] [^113p4Y7H].

---

The workup for ulcerative colitis (UC) centers on **colonoscopy with biopsies** [^115AZoZK] to confirm the diagnosis and define extent, preceded by **stool studies to exclude infection** (notably C. difficile) [^115Ncp3E] and supported by labs (CBC, CRP/ESR, CMP) [^1176HT4Q] and fecal calprotectin to gauge inflammation [^111AE3ce]. Serologic markers (pANCA/ASCA) are not recommended for diagnosis or prognosis [^115Ncp3E]. Imaging (MRI/CT) is reserved for complications or when CD is suspected [^115RndQZ]. Disease severity is staged using clinical scores (Mayo, UCEIS) [^1117PcGs] and endoscopic grading (MES) [^112tiRnr] to guide therapy and monitoring [^113p4Y7H].

---

## Clinical presentation and initial assessment

UC typically presents with **bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, and abdominal pain** [^111GRpsa]; extraintestinal manifestations (arthralgia, erythema nodosum, uveitis, PSC) may occur [^114uPeDf]. Initial assessment should document symptom severity, frequency, nocturnal episodes, weight loss, and extraintestinal features [^114wdjSR].

---

## Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests help assess **inflammation**, exclude **alternative diagnoses**, and guide severity assessment:

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC | Hemoglobin, WBC, platelets | Anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis suggest inflammation [^notfound] |
| CRP/ESR | Inflammatory markers | Elevated in active disease; correlate with severity [^113sb1Na] |
| CMP | Liver enzymes, renal function, electrolytes | Identify extraintestinal involvement, electrolyte imbalance [^notfound] |
| Fecal calprotectin | Neutrophil-derived protein | Elevated in active inflammation; correlates with endoscopic activity [^113cm3zk] |
| Stool studies | Exclude infection | - C. difficile [^115Ncp3E] <br/> - Bacterial cultures <br/> - Ova/parasites [^notfound] |

---

Serologic markers (pANCA, ASCA) are **not recommended** for diagnosis or prognosis due to low specificity and sensitivity [^113cm3zk].

---

## Endoscopic evaluation

Colonoscopy with **biopsies** is the gold standard for diagnosing UC [^115AZoZK]:

- **Extent**: Proctitis, left-sided colitis, extensive colitis (pancolitis) [^115AZoZK].
- **Severity**: Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) or UC Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) [^112tiRnr].
- **Histology**: Basal plasmacytosis, crypt distortion, chronicity [^11422gtz].

In severe disease, **flexible sigmoidoscopy** is preferred to avoid perforation risk [^115RndQZ].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is not routine but is indicated for **complications** or when Crohn's disease is suspected:

- **MRI enterography**: Preferred for strictures, fistulas, and disease activity without radiation [^1172NYyL].
- **CT enterography**: Alternative when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated [^111A9i8k].
- **Intestinal ultrasound**: Emerging noninvasive tool for activity assessment [^115AZoZK].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Key mimics of UC that must be excluded include:

- **Infectious colitis**: C. difficile, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli, CMV [^111GRpsa] [^111cWk74].
- **Crohn's disease**: Segmental, transmural, skip lesions, granulomas [^notfound].
- **Ischemic colitis**: Older patients, vascular risk factors [^notfound].
- **Microscopic colitis**: Watery diarrhea, normal colonoscopy, biopsy required [^116DbDjv].

---

## Disease severity assessment

Severity is assessed using **clinical scores** and **endoscopic grading**:

| **Clinical score** | **Components** | **Severity categories** |
|-|-|-|
| Mayo score | - Stool frequency <br/> - Rectal bleeding <br/> - Physician global <br/> - Endoscopy | Remission, mild, moderate, severe [^notfound] |
| UCEIS | - Vascular pattern <br/> - Bleeding <br/> - Erosions/ulcers | 0–8 scale correlates with endoscopic severity [^notfound] |
| MES | Endoscopic appearance | 0–3 scale (normal to severe) [^notfound] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring combines **symptoms**, **biomarkers**, and **endoscopy** [^115AZoZK]:

- **Fecal calprotectin**: Assess response, detect relapse, guide therapy [^111AE3ce].
- **CRP**: Track inflammation; correlate with symptoms [^1176HT4Q].
- **Colonoscopy**: Surveillance for dysplasia, assess healing [^111vjxiQ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Growth assessment, nutritional status, age-appropriate endoscopy [^11676SDc].
- **Pregnancy**: Flexible sigmoidoscopy if necessary, avoid radiation [^notfound].
- **Elderly**: Higher risk of ischemia, malignancy, medication toxicity [^notfound].

---

The UC workup integrates **clinical assessment**, **labs**, **colonoscopy with biopsies**, and selective imaging to confirm the diagnosis, define extent and severity, exclude mimics, and guide therapy and surveillance [^115AZoZK].

### Ulcerative colitis: making the diagnosis [^116t61Ay]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory condition of the colon. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is based on clinical presentation, endoscopic evaluation, and histologic parameters in the absence of demonstrable alternate etiology. The differential diagnosis remains broad, and infection in particular must be considered and excluded. Although laboratory and radiographic findings can aid in the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, endoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. A correct diagnosis and disease staging are imperative because these factors affect treatment options and prognosis.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^115AZoZK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis — The diagnosis of UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of affected and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist, preferably one with expertise in gastrointestinal pathology. Categories of disease extent include proctitis within 18 cm of anal verge (distal to rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis extending from sigmoid to splenic flexure, and extensive colitis beyond splenic flexure including pancolitis; if the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless other symptoms or findings suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of Crohn's disease rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity are needed to guide treatment decisions and should be based on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers such as FC, CRP, and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity, and disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

### Diagnosis of colitis: making the initial diagnosis [^115Bca9e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with colitis of recent onset is a relatively common clinical challenge. The main considerations are infectious colitides, idiopathic IBD, ie, ulcerative and Crohn's colitis, and colonic ischemia. An initial risk assessment on the basis of such factors as concurrent symptoms in contacts, travel history, medications, and human immunodeficiency virus risk factors should be followed by a thorough clinical history, physical examination, stool studies, blood tests, and, in selected cases, endoscopic examination and serologic tests. Biopsies can be decisive in distinguishing among the different types of acute colitis and might help identify specific etiologies. The diagnostic yield of biopsies is maximized by appropriate sampling of the colonic mucosa and by sharing the clinical and endoscopic findings with the pathologist, eg, via a copy of the endoscopy report.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^114Yxu3v]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1117PcGs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) — key concepts include that UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of the ileum and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist. Categories of disease extent in UC consist of proctitis, left-sided colitis, or extensive colitis. If the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless there are other symptoms or findings to suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of CD rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity should be based on patient-reported outcomes, the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers of inflammation including fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS). Disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and periods of suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

3 Ulcerative colitis

3.1 Diagnosis

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by mucosal inflammation starting distally in the rectum, with continuous extension proximally for a variable distance, often with an abrupt demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa. Typically, patients with UC experience periods of relapse and remission. Up to 90% will have one or more relapses after the first attack, and early relapse or active disease in the first 2 years is associated with a worse disease course subsequently.

Statement 1. Where ulcerative colitis is diagnosed by sigmoidoscopy, we recommend a full ileocolonoscopy to delineate disease extent, severity of inflammation and to exclude Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In patients presenting with suspected UC, stool cultures and Clostridium difficile toxin assay should always be performed to rule out infective causes. While UC is often initially diagnosed at flexible (or rigid) sigmoidoscopy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis, extent and severity of disease by means of full ileocolonoscopy, usually within the first year, as this can more definitively confirm the diagnosis of UC versus Crohn's disease and give information that may help to predict future disease course, including potential and risk stratification for dysplasia, and thus will influence treatment choices. For histological assessment at least two biopsy specimens should be taken from five sites throughout the examined bowel, including the ileum and rectum, during the initial endoscopic evaluation.

Rectal sparing in UC has been described in up to > 3% of patients, but more frequently patchy inflammation of the rectum may be seen in those who have been given empirical topical therapy. The presence of a 'caecal patch', isolated peri-appendiceal inflammation and backwash ileitis can occur in UC, but if the histology and clinical pattern are not otherwise typical of UC, then small bowel evaluation is required to exclude Crohn's disease (see Section 4.1.3.1: Crohn's disease, Cross-sectional imaging: CT, MR and small bowel ultrasound). Backwash ileitis has been reported in up to 20% of patients with extensive colitis.

3.1.1 Histology

No histological feature is diagnostic of UC, but the combination of basal plasmacytosis, diffuse crypt atrophy and distortion, villous surface irregularity and mucus depletion are suggestive of a diagnosis of UC in the correct clinical context. Uneven distribution of inflammation within the colon or within biopsies can occur in patients with long-standing disease, or after treatment.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111GRpsa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) symptom evaluation and infection workup highlight that symptoms of bloody diarrhea, presence of mucus, bowel urgency, tenesmus, and abdominal cramping should trigger consideration of a diagnosis of UC, particularly in the absence of an alternate cause, and that history should assess extraintestinal manifestations including joint, skin, ocular, oral, and hepatobiliary involvement. Potential precipitants may include recent smoking cessation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and enteric infections. C. difficile infection (CDI) is recognized as complicating a significant proportion of patients with UC and is associated with increased risk of hospitalizations, colectomy, and mortality; among newly diagnosed or relapsing inflammatory bowel disease patients, CDI prevalence ranges from 5% to 47%, and concomitant CDI with UC has worse outcomes, including higher mortality. Testing for C. difficile is typically performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other enteric infections that could mimic UC include Escherichia coli (O157:H7), Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and parasitic infections like amoebiasis, so an infectious etiology should always be suspected and excluded at time of diagnosis and in the right clinical setting, with several institutions using comprehensive intestinal pathogen testing through PCR-based assays that may detect many bacterial and viral pathogens.

### Inflammatory bowel disease patient perceptions of diagnostic and monitoring tests and procedures [^114zsoCN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). These are chronic inflammatory illnesses of the gastrointestinal tract of unknown etiology. There is no cure, and the purpose of treatment is to control the symptoms and maintain remission. Canada ranks among the countries with the highest prevalence and incidence rates of IBD in the world. Furthermore, Canada has one of the highest IBD incidence rates among the under 16 age group and this rate increasing, especially among children under 5 years of age. One out of every 150 Canadians is afflicted with IBD. This burden generates a significant economic weight. In 2012, IBD-related costs were estimated at $2.8 billion, of which $1.2 were direct costs (hospitalization, medication and medical visits).

Diseases for which diagnosis, monitoring, and surveillance are appropriate are those that significantly impact a person's quality of life, are fatal, and are sufficiently widespread to justify investments in conditions for which early detection is beneficial and for which treatment exists. IBD meets all of these criteria. The management of IBD patients requires assessment both at the time of diagnosis and throughout the illness to determine the activity and severity of the inflammatory lesions, disease location, progression and complications. In chronic illness it has been reported that, due to time constraints on the part of the physician, patients do not receive the care they require and, as a result, their illness remains unmonitored. On the other hand, it has also been reported that patients undergo too many tests and procedures. Some authors have put forward the suggestion that this overuse of tests and procedures can be explained by the fact that physicians receive a bonus for each test requested or that they do more than less out of fear of lawsuits, which can lead to false positives or overdiagnoses.

### Assessing severity of disease in patients with ulcerative colitis [^113EhQqR]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that can present at various stages of disease activity and severity. Traditionally, severity scoring has focused on disease activity during a single moment with various tools, including patient-reported symptoms, as well as clinical, laboratory-based, endoscopic, histologic, and imaging variables. Optimal delivery of care depends on the accurate assessment of disease severity, which must take longitudinal variables into account. This article reviews the history of severity scoring in UC and provides a concise, clinically oriented approach to assessing disease severity.

### Endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^112kJVKo]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

With the heterogeneous clinical presentation of IBD, endoscopy plays an integral role in the initial diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although radiographic tests often are supplemental in the work-up of IBD, colonoscopy with biopsy is the test of choice if IBD is suspected and is more sensitive than radiographic tests. Endoscopic features can be helpful in differentiating ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Currently the only mode for detecting dysplasia and stratifying the risk of developing colorectal cancer is through complete colonoscopy with multiple biopsy specimens. Complications of IBD can be managed effectively with endoscopic therapy. The role of endoscopic ultrasound and future developments in endoscopic therapy need to be defined by future studies.

Inflammatory bowel disease — society recommendations for surveillance describe eligible ulcerative colitis (UC) patients as left-sided or extensive colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) involving at least 1/3 of colon; screening is for all patients at 8–10 y after symptom onset to reassess disease extent, with surveillance every 1–2 y, after 2 negative examinations recommended every 1–3 y until colitis has been present for 20 years, and after 20 years every 1–2 y. Random biopsy technique specifies that in extensive disease a minimum of 33 biopsies should be performed (4-quadrant biopsies every 10 cm throughout the colon), and in less extensive microscopic disease 4-quadrant biopsies should be taken from the proximal extent of disease and every 10 cm distally; particularly in UC, consider taking 4-quadrant biopsies every 5 cm in the lower sigmoid colon and rectum, and endorses the incorporation of chromoendoscopy into surveillance colonoscopy for appropriately trained endoscopists.

Ulcerative colitis — serum C-reactive protein (CRP) performance indicates that using an elevated CRP cutoff (generally > 5 mg/L) in a high pretest probability scenario yields an FP rate of approximately 3.4% and normal CRP (< 5 mg/L) has an FN rate of 31.4%, whereas in an intermediate pretest scenario the FP rate of elevated CRP is 11.5% and the FN rate of normal CRP is 18.5%; certainty ratings report moderate certainty of evidence supporting the use of elevated CRP to rule in moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation in a high pretest probability scenario, low certainty to rule in at intermediate probability, and very low certainty to use normal CRP to rule out due to unacceptably high FN and very serious inconsistency.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113Ueo4a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### World gastroenterology organization practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of IBD in 2010 [^1153k91A]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a group of idiopathic, chronic, inflammatory intestinal conditions. Its two main disease categories are: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which feature both overlapping and distinct clinical and pathological features. While these diseases have, in the past, been most evident in the developed world, their prevalence in the developing world has been gradually increasing in recent decades. This poses unique issues in diagnosis and management which have been scarcely addressed in the literature or in extant guidelines. Depending on the nature of the complaints, investigations to diagnose either form of IBD or to assess disease activity will vary and will also be influenced by geographic variations in other conditions that might mimic IBD. Similarly, therapy varies depending on the phenotype of the disease being treated and available resources. The World Gastroenterology Organization has, accordingly, developed guidelines for diagnosing and treating IBD using a cascade approach to account for variability in resources in countries around the world.

### Consensus conference: colorectal cancer screening and surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease [^1136Dnik]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis, are associated with an increased risk for developing colorectal cancer. To reduce colorectal cancer mortality in inflammatory bowel disease, most patients and their physicians choose to follow a program of surveillance colonoscopy in an attempt to detect early neoplastic lesions at a curable stage. Colectomy is typically reserved for patients whose biopsy findings are indicative of heightened cancer risk based on interpretation by pathologists. Despite the absence of prospective controlled clinical trials to formally evaluate the benefits, risks, and costs of this approach, enough circumstantial evidence has accrued to warrant its widespread adoption in practice. Nevertheless, no standardized guidelines have yet been set forth to guide the gastroenterologist in performing surveillance. A panel of international experts was assembled to develop consensus recommendations for the performance of surveillance. The findings are presented herein.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^115RndQZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) endoscopic evaluation, biopsies, and imaging — procedural guidance states: In individuals with severe disease, a complete colonoscopy may be associated with a greater risk of perforation and in this case a sigmoidoscopy with biopsies is sufficient. Therefore, biopsies should be obtained from the proximal endoscopically normal-appearing colon even if the endoscopically inflamed segment seems to be restricted to the distal colon, and even if the distal rectum seems endoscopically normal, separate biopsies from the rectum should be obtained because patchy histologic inflammation may be seen in 5%–30% of children with UC despite the absence of endoscopically visible inflammation. Routine upper endoscopic evaluation is not required in adults with a new diagnosis of UC and should be restricted to those who have symptoms of upper gastrointestinal disease; in the pediatric UC population, up to 8% of children with UC may have their diagnosis modified to CD based on these upper findings. Imaging the small bowel with a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging is also not routinely required in all patients with normal appearance of the terminal ileum on colonoscopy; however, in those with abdominal symptoms not explained by endoscopically active disease, those with suspicion of CD and those in whom the proximal extent of involvement cannot be evaluated because of severity of inflammation, small bowel imaging may be useful, and when considering surgery in those with UC, a small bowel evaluation may be reasonable to inform surgical management, with the utility of intestinal ultrasound in this specific scenario not yet defined.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^112Di3KC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the imperative for early initiation of therapy emerges as a pivotal strategy in optimizing UC management, facilitated by prompt diagnosis. Regrettably, many patients with UC face diagnostic delays postsymptom onset, posing a risk for adverse outcomes and significant bowel damage in IBD. Clinical evidence consistently underscores the superior response rates to drugs in patients with shorter disease duration. Thus, raising awareness of UC symptoms in primary care settings is crucial to ensure timely access to specialized care and appropriate treatment. Early disease identification enables patients to commence suitable medications promptly, with studies consistently linking timely access to immunosuppressants or biologics to improved outcomes.

Moreover, the expanding array of new therapeutic agents presents a challenge in selecting the most suitable drug for UC management. With numerous therapeutic options available for mild-to-moderate as well as moderate-to-severe forms of UC, choosing the right agent for each patient has become increasingly complex and personalized. The T2T strategy offers guidance in identifying the optimal treatment solution for individual patients in a tailored manner. Additionally, proper patient profiling is essential, involving the assessment of patient risk stratification and prognostication. Validated prognostic and predictive tools, such as biomarkers, have the potential to enable personalized therapy and facilitate the targeted use of treatments. This approach ensures that patients at lower risk receive less intensive medical therapy, while those at higher risk of disease progression are treated with more intensive strategies. However, a significant challenge lies in the time required to develop, validate, and commercialize biomarkers, highlighting the need for ongoing research and innovation in this area.

### Inflammatory bowel disease: recent developments [^116givFF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis, or just IBD?

The continuum of IBD has traditionally been separated into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with patients lying between being referred to as IBD unclassified. Features typifying Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis are largely related to disease location, and to a lesser extent histological appearances. Increasingly, the divide is arbitrary, with significant overlap in everything from therapies to genetic risk loci to disease location. Whether this is a paediatric phenomenon or not, the descriptive term IBD, better captures all disease phenotypes. This has the potential to drive management towards a risk stratification approach considering disease severity, disease location, disease behaviour, response to initial treatment and additional phenotypic factors such as concurrent illnesses. In the future, a personalised molecular diagnosis will help inform a more precise diagnosis for individuals, with the ability to produce a personalised prognosis and treatment.

### Inflammatory bowel disease in children and adolescents: recommendations for diagnosis – the porto criteria [^11676SDc]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease may present before the age of 20 years in 25% to 30% of all patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Reported incidence figures vary considerably depending on the collection of data. Multicenter, multinational collaboration is needed when studying pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The essential first step is uniformity in the work-up and criteria used for diagnosis. The Porto diagnostic criteria presented here provide the tool that is needed. These criteria are the result of consensus reached by the ESPGHAN inflammatory bowel disease working group. Diagnosis of Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, endoscopy and histology and radiology. Every child suspected of inflammatory bowel disease should undergo a complete diagnostic program consisting of colonoscopy with ileal intubation, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and (in all cases except in definite ulcerative colitis) radiologic contrast imaging of the small bowel. Multiple biopsies from all segments of the gastrointestinal tract are needed for a complete histologic evaluation. A diagnosis of indeterminate colitis cannot be made unless a full diagnostic program has been performed.

Radiographic imaging studies have an important role in the workup of patients with suspected IBD and in the differentiation of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Because of its ability to depict fine mucosal detail, the double-contrast barium study is a valuable technique for diagnosing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease even in patients with early disease. In contrast, cross-sectional imaging studies such as CT, MR, and ultrasound are useful for showing the effects of these conditions on the wall of the bowel and also for demonstrating intra-abdominal abscesses and other extraluminal findings in patients with more advanced disease. Thus, barium studies and cross-sectional imaging studies have complementary roles in the evaluation of these patients.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^116xahEj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Within the diagnostic label of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) is typically characterised by diffuse mucosal inflammation, limited to the colon, with confluent inflammation extending proximally from the rectum to varying severity and extent. In children, it is well recognised however, that UC typically affects all or most of the colon (extensive or pan-colitis), whereas adults more often present with localised distal disease (proctitis). Recently, the paediatric Porto criteria for the diagnosis of IBD have been revised to take account of diagnostic advances, for example, in imaging techniques, and also to help correctly assign patients to the differing IBD subgroups. In the paediatric age group, up to 10% of cases cannot be assigned to as either UC or Crohn's despite comprehensive assessment. These are classified as IBD unclassified, although in practice, currently, they are most commonly treated along the same lines as UC.

AGA evidence summary — biomarkers in symptomatic ulcerative colitis (UC): In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of flare, fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, and elevated CRP reliably suggest moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, obviating routine need for endoscopic assessment (very low to moderate certainty of evidence). In patients with UC who have mild symptoms, fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, and elevated CRP may not suggest moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation (very low certainty of evidence). In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of flare, fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin or normal CRP may suggest lack of inflammation (very low certainty of evidence).

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) — diagnostic accuracy and pretest probability impact: Across 15 studies evaluating serum CRP for detecting moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, reported single-cutoff performance spanned 1.2–73 mg/L with summary sensitivity 63% (95% CI, 50%–75%) and specificity 77% (95% CI, 67%–84%). In a low pretest probability setting (rectal bleeding score 0 and stool frequency score 0 or 1, 15% prevalence), using elevated CRP (generally > 5 mg/L) yields approximately 5.5% false negatives with normal CRP (< 5 mg/L) and false positives of 19.5%. In an intermediate pretest probability setting (e.g., stool frequency score 2 or 3, 50% prevalence), elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L) has false positives of 11.5%.

AGA Recommendation 4 — In patients with UC with mild symptoms, with normal stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, normal CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). For mild symptoms such as slight increase in stool frequency and/or infrequent rectal bleeding, proceeding directly with endoscopic assessment rather than testing biomarkers may be reasonable, and for those who prefer to avoid endoscopy or empiric escalation, repeat biomarker measurement (in 3–6 months) may be a reasonable alternative.

### Appropriateness and diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in the management of patients with ulcerative colitis: a prospective study in an open access endoscopy service [^116LDLaN]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Colonoscopy is frequently performed in ulcerative colitis (UC), but its benefit in the management of the disease is a matter of debate. The objective was to determine the clinical impact of colonoscopy in UC.

Methods

Consecutive patients with UC undergoing colonoscopy were studied. The design and main outcome measurement was appropriateness of indications, evaluated according to guidelines. Endoscopic findings altering the management of the patients were registered. The endoscopist's management decisions based on patient's clinical picture were compared with those selected after endoscopy. Need for further investigations was recorded. Endpoints for colonoscopy-improving management were prospectively defined: change in medical therapy, need for adjunctive procedures, identification or exclusion of cancer, adenomatous polyps, or other conditions with clinical impact. The setting was an open access endoscopy service in a tertiary care center.

Results

In all, 507 patients (268 male, 239 female, mean age 42 years) were included. Colonoscopy was indicated in 60.8% of cases. In 46% of patients endoscopy revealed a significant lesion; this rate was higher for indicated (67.2) than for not indicated procedures (13.5%, P < 0.0001). The endoscopist's decision was altered by the endoscopic finding in 7.6% of cases and was not different between appropriate and inappropriate procedures.

Conclusions

Endoscopy is a potent tool in the management of UC if correctly used. However, in the majority of cases a correct therapeutic decision may be established simply on the basis of the clinical picture. Relevant endoscopic findings have a relatively low impact on the medical treatment, but may have a very important value in the prognostic assessment of the disease.

Diagnostic tests for suspected inflammatory bowel disease

The majority of children with ulcerative colitis (UC) present with the characteristic features of diarrhoea, blood in stools and abdominal pain, which indicate a colitic process. Blood tests (full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, liver function tests and albumin) will show abnormalities in around 80% of cases in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and thus, form part of the initial assessment of suspected cases. Faecal tests such as calprotectin are useful adjuncts to these blood tests in identifying inflammation, but levels can be elevated by causes apart from IBD.

In cases with suspected IBD, following exclusion of an infective cause, both upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) (ileocolonic) endoscopy are required. Imaging of the small bowel is also recommended. With the more widespread availability of magnetic resonance enterography this is now the modality of choice, when available, for differentiating UC from Crohn's disease (CD). It is important to exclude Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection in the differential diagnosis of IBD initially and exclude C. diff infection as the cause of a disease 'flare'. Despite recommendations to screen for C. diff in these situations, it can often be difficult in practice as this test has not been historically widely performed in children.

Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) can occur in 6%–17% of patients with UC at diagnosis, and can increase with disease evolution to nearly 50%. EIMs can affect joints (arthritis), liver (primary sclerosing cholangitis, which affects 1.6% of cases of paediatric IBD at 10 years, autoimmune hepatitis), skin (pyoderma gangrenosum) and eyes (uveitis). Sclerosing cholangitis can be associated with progressive liver disease and cholangicarcinoma. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of colonic dysplasia in sclerosing cholangitis associated UC. Thus, in these cases, surveillance colonoscopy will need to be initiated earlier (possibly into the paediatric age range depending on age at diagnosis) and followed more frequently.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113cm3zk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — fecal calprotectin (FC) and serologic markers: FC levels are described as being correlated with clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and histologic healing with treatment and are predictive of risk of surgery in acute severe colitis, while serologic pANCA may be found in up to 70% of patients with ulcerative colitis but antibody testing has low pooled sensitivity for diagnosis and is not used for establishing or ruling out a diagnosis, and there is currently no role for such testing to determine the likelihood of disease evolution and prognosis.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^116tcqfi]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial investigation at diagnosis is not the focus of these guidelines (covered in depth in the revised Porto criteria), but a general approach is summarised in Figure 2. The PUCAI score aligns well with endoscopic disease activityand highly correlates with the Mayo score. The cut‐offs for remission, mild, moderate and severe disease activity have been validated in various cohorts. Nevertheless, although most studies report a good correlation between clinical symptoms and endoscopic findings, some studies describe persistent mild‐to‐moderate endoscopic inflammation in more than half of the patients in clinical remission. Furthermore, on an individual basis, one study reported a risk of about 20% for persistent endoscopic inflammation in patients with a PUCAI indicating complete remission. This discrepancy is particularly relevant for patients with UC associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC‐UC), in whom the lack of clinical symptoms may not reflect the absence of mucosal inflammation. Therefore, noninvasive biomarkers and imaging investigations should be routinely performed in patients in clinical remission (Figure 3).

Figure 3
Algorithm for monitoring paediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) during the maintenance phase. 1 Quality of life scores and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs), such as TUMMY‐UC, are encouraged as part of disease assessment. 2 In asymptomatic patients, consider repeating FC measurements (at least 2–4 weeks apart) before endoscopic evaluation or therapy change. 3 Proceeding to sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy should preferably be based on at least two independent calprotectin measurements. Endoscopic re‐evaluation is also recommended before major treatment modifications and when it is not clear if symptoms are disease‐related. 4 The decision whether to escalate therapy based on a Mayo 0 or 1 endoscopic findings should be individualised, based on the current treatment (e.g. it is easier to increase mesalamine dose or add rectal therapy than starting thiopurines), symptoms, and extent (short Mayo 1 segment may be closely monitored whereas extensive disease may require escalation).

### Can fecal calprotectin accurately identify histological activity of ulcerative colitis? A meta-analysis [^1158kHiZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

FC has a good diagnostic accuracy for histological response and remission in patients with UC. A cut-off value of 100–200 µg/g is more appropriate to identify patients in histological response and spare patients from unnecessary endoscopy and biopsy. The exact cut-off value should be further decided according to the prevalence of histological activity and different FC assays. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.

AGA Recommendation 3 — In patients with UC in symptomatic remission but with elevated stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, elevated CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). As an implementation alternative, repeat measurement of biomarkers (in 3–6 months) may be reasonable, but if biomarkers remain elevated on repeat evaluation then endoscopic assessment may be warranted.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1147iqfS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG guideline — Grading of recommendations and implications for ulcerative colitis care states that factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, risk of harm, and costs/ healthcare resource utilization. Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, with patient implications that most individuals would prefer the recommended course and clinician implications that most patients should receive the recommended course or an alternative with similar strength. Conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced, with patient implications that some individuals would want the suggested course while others may not and clinician implications that a shared decision-making model considering patient values and preferences is appropriate.

Diagnostic and referral strategies

Making a prompt diagnosis is key to good management of IBD, preventing malnutrition at diagnosis and allowing early therapeutic intervention. Unfortunately, there is frequently a delay of months or years in referral to specialist care, preventing the diagnostic process of endoscopy and histological confirmation. Drivers of this are varied including varied presentations, alongside inflammatory markers not always being raised and fluctuating symptoms. Family history is common and should lower the threshold for investigation.

Ulcerative colitis biomarker interpretation — C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin may be elevated because of nonintestinal sources of infection or inflammation; in patients with UC who present with elevated biomarkers and disease-related symptoms, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile and other enteric pathogens is important to help rule out other sources of gastrointestinal infections.

Ulcerative colitis–associated colorectal neoplasia — surveillance techniques include high-definition white-light colonoscopy with nontargeted 4-quadrant biopsies (typically taken at 10-cm intervals with a total of ≥ 32 biopsies) or chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies; early studies suggested chromoendoscopy was superior to standard white-light endoscopy for detecting adenomas and improved dysplasia detection with fewer overall biopsies, but high-definition white-light platforms have demonstrated similar dysplasia detection compared with chromoendoscopy; infrastructure, time, and expertise needs may limit widespread chromoendoscopy adoption, so high-definition white-light colonoscopy or chromoendoscopy can be used depending on availability and local expertise; because most dysplasia is visible with high-definition colonoscopy, performing surveillance with random biopsies has been called into question and the decision to add random biopsies may be individualized based on risk factors; in a prospective multicenter study of 1000 patients with IBD in France (2009 to 2011), 94 patients had dysplasia, and the yield of dysplasia from random biopsies was 0.2% (68 of 31,865 biopsies).

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^1174QAwQ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

ECCO — Ulcerative colitis (UC) surveillance includes screening all patients 6–8 y after onset of symptoms to reassess disease extent, then risk-stratifying by 4 criteria (1 point each: pancolitis, endoscopic or histologic evidence of active inflammation, pseudopolyps, and family history of CRC) to set intervals: Every 1–2 y for high-risk patients (3–4 points) and every 3–4 y for low-risk patients (0–2 points), with increasing the interval if no evidence of intraepithelial neoplasia or endoscopic and/or histologic inflammation is present in 2 consecutive surveillance colonoscopies (eg, from every 1–2 y to every 3–4 y). Chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies is the surveillance procedure of choice for appropriately trained endoscopists; alternatively, random biopsies (4-quadrant biopsies every 10 cm) and targeted biopsies of any visible lesion should be performed if white light endoscopy is used. Comments include PSC with annual surveillance at time of diagnosis, that proctitis does not require regular monitoring, and that good bowel preparation is essential with repeat colonoscopy considered if fecal residue is present.

### Drug trials snapshot: entyvio (vedolizumab) to treat ulcerative colit… [^114Ezajw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DRUG TRIALS SUMMARY: What is the drug for. ENTYVIO is used to treat adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis when certain other ulcerative colitis medications have not worked well enough or cannot be tolerated. How does one use this drug. ENTYVIO is administered by intravenous infusion through a vein, over approximately a 30 minute period. After the first dose, it is given again at two and six weeks, then every eight weeks thereafter. What are the benefits. ENTYVIO was better than the placebo at helping to get UC under control and keep UC under control. It may help reduce or stop the need to take corticosteroid medicines. It may also improve the way the lining of the large intestine looks to a healthcare provider during a colonoscopy procedure. What are the possible side effects.

The most common side effects that occurred in patients treated with ENTYVIO in clinical trials included common cold, headache, joint pain, nausea, fever, infections of the nose and throat, tiredness, cough, bronchitis, flu, back pain, rash, itching, sinus infection, throat pain, and pain in extremities. Other risks associated with ENTYVIO can include infusion and serious allergic reactions, serious infections, and liver injury. What are the results of the efficacy study. Efficacy assessments were at 6 weeks and 52 weeks. Results showed that a greater percentage of participants treated with ENTYVIO compared to placebo achieved and maintained clinical response, achieved and maintained clinical remission, achieved corticosteroid-free clinical remission, and as seen during endoscopy, had improved appearance of the colon. What are the results of the safety study.

The most common side effects in patients treated with ENTYVIO include common cold, headache, joint pain, nausea, fever, infections of the nose and throat, tiredness, cough, bronchitis, flu, back pain, rash, itching, sinus infection, throat pain, and pain in extremities. ENTYVIO can increase the risk of infusion and serious allergic reactions, serious infections, and liver injury. SUBGROUP: A subset of the population studied in a clinical trial.

### Ulcerative colitis: rapid evidence review… [^11746arc]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory bowel disease frequently encountered in primary care. This article provides a summary of ulcerative colitis and a review of the available evidence for management. Treatment INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF REMISSION The goal of managing patients with ulcerative colitis is to attain mucosal healing with symptom control so that sustained steroid-free remission can be achieved and prevent hospitalizations and surgeries. Initiation of treatment begins with stratifying disease activity into mild vs. moderate to severe. The American College of Gastroenterology Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index provides a set of criteria to help determine if the disease is in remission, mild, moderate to severe, or fulminant. TREATMENT OF MODERATE TO SEVERE DISEASE First-line therapy for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis is biologics.

14 Biologic agents with or without glucocorticoids and immune modulators should be used to induce and maintain remission. Thiopurines or methotrexate should not be used as monotherapy. 1 Systemic corticosteroids are effective in inducing remission, but dosages and treatment duration should be limited. Other options for inducing remission include tumor necrosis factor–alpha antibodies, anti-integrin antibodies, anti-interleukin antibodies, and Janus kinase inhibitors 1. Fecal microbiota transplantation induces remission in some patients with ulcerative colitis, but current use is limited to clinical trials. 15–17. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE One probiotic modestly improves symptoms. It also helps to prevent pouchitis, an abnormal immune response in patients susceptible to autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation of the rectal pouch fashioned after a colectomy.

19–21 A systematic review of six small studies found that curcumin promotes clinical and endoscopic improvement when added to conventional therapy in patients with mild ulcerative colitis. 22 Acupuncture is considered safe in addition to conventional treatment, but high-quality evidence of effectiveness is lacking.
25. It is unknown whether active inflammation from ulcerative colitis can increase the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends ongoing biologic therapy, deeming it safe for patients who are on such medications to continue working in environments with those who have known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
