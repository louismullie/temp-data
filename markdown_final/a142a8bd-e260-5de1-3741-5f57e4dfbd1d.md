## Question

is there any screening guidelines for NASH, is it a universal guideline

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are screening guidelines for NASH and whether these guidelines are universal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between screening for NASH versus screening for advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. Then, I should verify what major societies (AASLD, AGA, EASL-EASD-EASO, ADA) actually recommend and whether any endorse universal screening. Next, I will examine the rationale for targeted screening in high-risk groups and the recommended noninvasive tools. After that, I should review pediatric guidance and any exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note practical implications for clinicians.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. NASH is a histologic diagnosis that still requires liver biopsy in many contexts, whereas what we can and should screen for noninvasively is advanced fibrosis (stage F2 or higher) in patients with NAFLD/MASLD, because fibrosis stage drives liver-related outcomes and informs treatment decisions and surveillance needs [^0d7fe438] [^3721f7aa] [^bfaf1a0d].

> Wait, let me verify the universal screening question. The AASLD 2023 guidance explicitly advises against general population screening for NAFLD/MASLD, and the EASL-EASD-EASO 2024 guideline likewise recommends not screening the general population, so there is no universal screening recommendation for NASH or NAFLD from these societies [^ff2cc5dc] [^ea1c07ab] [^25cc966d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether any group endorses screening everyone with diabetes or obesity. The AGA Clinical Care Pathway recommends screening adults with type 2 diabetes for clinically significant fibrosis using FIB-4 and secondary noninvasive tests, and the ADA 2025 Standards advise additional risk stratification with transient elastography or ELF when FIB-4 is ≥ 1.3 in adults with T2DM or prediabetes, which is a targeted, not universal, approach [^e40d94d5] [^3492f88a]. I initially thought some European guidance might support universal screening, but wait, I should double-check: EASL-EASD-EASO explicitly rejects population screening and instead endorses case-finding in at-risk individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, which aligns with a targeted strategy rather than universal screening [^bfaf1a0d].

> Next, I should review who is considered high risk and why screening is justified in those groups. High-risk populations include adults with T2DM, those with medically complicated obesity or multiple metabolic risk factors, individuals with incidental hepatic steatosis or persistently elevated aminotransferases, and first-degree relatives of patients with NASH cirrhosis; the rationale is the higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis and the potential to alter outcomes with early detection and management [^ca16c760] [^e40d94d5] [^0a6b8bd8]. Let me verify the prevalence figures: in T2DM, clinically significant fibrosis is seen in roughly 6–19% depending on the cohort, which is substantially higher than the 0.9–2% background prevalence, supporting targeted screening in this group [^ca16c760].

> I will now examine the recommended screening tools and thresholds. FIB-4 is the most validated first-line test to stratify fibrosis risk, with low risk typically defined as FIB-4 < 1.3, indeterminate 1.3–2.67, and high risk > 2.67; indeterminate or high results should trigger secondary testing with transient elastography, MRE, or ELF to confirm or exclude advanced fibrosis and guide referral [^3721f7aa] [^91cffb91]. Hold on, I should verify that normal aminotransferases do not exclude disease; indeed, AASLD notes that AST/ALT may be normal in advanced NASH, so FIB-4 and elastography are preferred over relying on liver enzymes alone for risk stratification [^0c8ec408] [^cdf90a8d].

> Let me consider pediatric guidance, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from adults. NASPGHAN recommends screening children aged 9–10 years with obesity and those with other risk factors using ALT, given the high prevalence and the potential for early intervention; this is a targeted pediatric recommendation and still not a universal population screen [^739898eb] [^a638668f]. I should confirm that adult universal screening is not advised in pediatrics either; correct, the pediatric guidance is risk-based rather than population-wide [^739898eb].

> But wait, what if someone argues that the rising burden of NASH justifies universal screening anyway? I need to ensure I address the counterarguments. The main reasons against universal screening are the lack of cost-effectiveness, the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment given limited approved therapies and the invasive nature of confirming NASH, and the potential psychosocial harms from disease labeling; these concerns are reflected in AASLD and EASL-EASD-EASO positions and in broader commentaries on overdiagnosis in NAFLD [^ff2cc5dc] [^25cc966d] [^e4c67c6a]. Hold on, I should verify that emerging therapies change this calculus; even with recent approvals like resmetirom for noncirrhotic MASH with significant fibrosis, societies still frame screening as targeted rather than universal pending stronger population-level outcome and cost-effectiveness data [^bfaf1a0d].

> Next, I should review practical clinical implications so the guidance is actionable. For adults with T2DM, calculate FIB-4 at least every 1–2 years and, if FIB-4 is ≥ 1.3, add transient elastography or ELF to refine risk; refer to hepatology for confirmed advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis for HCC surveillance, variceal screening, and consideration of disease-modifying therapy where appropriate [^3721f7aa] [^3492f88a] [^3e28a61a]. I should double-check that HCC surveillance is reserved for cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis; yes, routine HCC surveillance is not recommended in noncirrhotic NASH, aligning with AASLD and NCCN positions [^7886ad3a] [^05d5e7d6].

> In summary, I need to ensure my conclusion is precise. There are no universal screening guidelines for NASH; current guidance recommends targeted screening for advanced fibrosis in high-risk adults, particularly those with T2DM, medically complicated obesity or multiple metabolic risk factors, incidental steatosis or persistent enzyme elevations, and first-degree relatives of patients with NASH cirrhosis, using a staged noninvasive approach with FIB-4 followed by elastography or ELF when indicated [^ff2cc5dc] [^e40d94d5] [^3721f7aa] [^bfaf1a0d]. Universal screening of the general population is not advised due to uncertain benefit, cost-effectiveness concerns, and the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and pediatric screening remains targeted to at-risk children rather than universal [^ff2cc5dc] [^25cc966d] [^739898eb].

There are **no universal screening guidelines** for NASH [^ff2cc5dc]. Major societies (AASLD, AGA, EASL) recommend **targeted screening** for advanced fibrosis in high-risk adults with T2DM, obesity, or metabolic syndrome using noninvasive tools (FIB-4, transient elastography) [^3721f7aa] [^e40d94d5] [^bfaf1a0d]. Routine screening is not advised for the general population due to low prevalence, limited treatment options, and cost-effectiveness concerns [^ff2cc5dc] [^25cc966d]. Pediatric screening is limited to children with obesity or metabolic risk factors, not universal [^739898eb] [^a638668f].

---

## Current screening guidelines and recommendations

### Adult population

- **AASLD 2023 guidance**: Do not screen the general population; screen high-risk adults (T2DM, obesity, metabolic syndrome) for advanced fibrosis using FIB-4, with transient elastography or ELF if FIB-4 is ≥ 1.3 [^3721f7aa] [^ff2cc5dc].

- **AGA 2022 clinical care pathway**: Screen adults with T2DM or ≥ 2 metabolic risk factors for clinically significant fibrosis (F2–F4) using FIB-4, then transient elastography or ELF to confirm [^e40d94d5] [^91cffb91].

- **EASL-EASD-EASO 2024**: Do not screen the general population; use case-finding in adults with cardiometabolic risk factors or abnormal liver enzymes, using FIB-4 followed by elastography [^25cc966d] [^bfaf1a0d].

---

### Pediatric population

For pediatric patients, **NASPGHAN 2017** recommends screening children aged 9–11 years with obesity or metabolic risk factors using ALT and AST, not universal screening [^739898eb]. The **AASLD 2025 pediatric guidance** similarly advises screening only in children with obesity or metabolic risk factors, not universally [^a638668f].

---

## Rationale against universal screening

- **Low prevalence**: NASH affects ~3–5% of the general population, so universal screening would yield many false positives and unnecessary interventions [^05d5e7d6] [^1fad72ce].

- **Limited treatment options**: There are no FDA-approved therapies for NASH, so screening may not change management in many cases [^4210cfcf] [^8168434f].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Universal screening is not cost-effective given low prevalence, limited treatment, and potential harms from overdiagnosis [^70e9c910] [^e4c67c6a].

---

## Limitations of current screening methods

- **Noninvasive tests**: FIB-4 and transient elastography are useful but have limitations (indeterminate zones, false positives/negatives) and may require confirmation with biopsy in some cases [^3721f7aa] [^84782338].

- **Liver biopsy**: Gold standard for NASH diagnosis but invasive, costly, and not feasible for large-scale screening [^0d7fe438] [^8168434f].

---

## Emerging developments and future directions

- **New therapies**: Resmetirom (FDA-approved 2024) for noncirrhotic MASH with significant fibrosis may shift screening strategies toward identifying treatable patients [^bfaf1a0d].

- **Improved noninvasive tests**: Advances in biomarkers and imaging may enable more accurate, scalable screening in the future [^notfound].

- **Personalized medicine**: Genetic markers (e.g. PNPLA3) may help identify high-risk individuals for targeted screening, though evidence is still evolving [^71177e32].

## Summary of screening recommendations by population

| **Population** | **Screening recommendation** | **Method** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | Not recommended | N/A |
| Adults with T2DM, obesity, metabolic syndrome | Recommended | FIB-4 → transient elastography/ELF |
| General pediatric population | Not recommended | N/A |
| Children with obesity or metabolic risk factors | Recommended | ALT/AST |

---

There are **no universal screening guidelines** for NASH; current guidance supports targeted screening in high-risk adults and selected children, with ongoing research and new therapies likely to refine future strategies.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are common conditions with a rising burden. Yet there are significant management gaps between clinical guidelines and practice in patients with NAFLD and NASH. Further, there is no single global guiding strategy for the management of NAFLD and NASH. The American Gastroenterological Association, in collaboration with 7 professional associations, convened an international conference comprising 32 experts in gastroenterology, hepatology, endocrinology, and primary care providers from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Conference content was informed by the results of a national NASH Needs Assessment Survey. The participants reviewed and discussed published literature on global burden, screening, risk stratification, diagnosis, and management of individuals with NAFLD, including those with NASH. Participants identified promising approaches for clinical practice and prepared a comprehensive, unified strategy for primary care providers and relevant specialists encompassing the full spectrum of NAFLD/NASH care. They also identified specific high-yield targets for clinical research and called for a unified, international public health response to NAFLD and NASH.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis — overall management goals and care model include early intervention to prevent progression and a multidisciplinary, individualized approach: The main goal of screening high-risk groups is to implement early interventions and prevent the development of cirrhosis and liver-related and all-cause mortality; care must also be directed at reversing the unfavorable metabolic profile, as cardiovascular disease is the main driver of morbidity and mortality; in patients with NASH, the goal of liver-directed treatment is to reverse steatohepatitis and fibrosis, or at least halt fibrosis progression; the presence of steatosis largely serves as a biomarker or risk factor and should not be considered a treatment target per se; successful intervention requires a cohesive multidisciplinary team including the primary care physician, an endocrinologist, and gastroenterologist/hepatologist; we recommend that clinicians follow shared decision making to develop individualized treatment plans based on a patient's risk status.

Natural history of NAFLD and NASH indicates limited progression in simple steatosis but potential progression to cirrhosis in NASH; despite smaller cohorts and modest follow-up, it is generally agreed that simple steatosis has very slow, if any, histological progression, whereas NASH can progress to cirrhotic-stage disease, and reported outcomes include increased overall mortality compared with matched control populations.

### AGA clinical practice update on screening and surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^d47d85d5]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading etiology for chronic liver disease with an immense public health impact and affects > 25% of the US and global population. Up to 1 in 4 NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent data confirm that HCC represents the fifth most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and NAFLD has been identified as a rapidly emerging risk factor for this malignancy. NAFLD-associated liver complications are projected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the next decade. Despite evidence that NAFLD-associated HCC may arise in the absence of cirrhosis, is often diagnosed at advanced stages, and is associated with lower receipt of curative therapy and with poorer survival, current society guidelines provide limited guidance/recommendations addressing HCC surveillance in patients with NAFLD outside the context of established cirrhosis. Limited data are presently available to guide clinicians with respect to which patients with NAFLD should undergo HCC surveillance, optimal screening tools, frequency of monitoring, and the influence of coexisting host- and disease-related risk factors. Herein we present an evidence-based review addressing HCC risk in patients with NAFLD and provide Best Practice Advice statements to address key issues in clinical management.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (AASLD Practice Guidance) — referral, laboratory interpretation, and family screening: Patients with suspected advanced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or discordant noninvasive tests (NITs) should be referred, as "Patients with suspected advanced NASH or discordant NITs should be referred to a specialist for evaluation, management, and/or further diagnostic evaluation." Aminotransferase levels may be misleading, as "Aminotransferase levels are frequently normal in patients with advanced liver disease due to NASH and should not be used in isolation to exclude the presence of NASH with clinically significant fibrosis." Family members merit counseling and assessment, as "First-degree relatives of patients with NASH cirrhosis should be counseled regarding their increased individual risk and offered screening for advanced hepatic fibrosis." Patients with "at-risk" disease are highlighted: "Patients with 'at-risk' NASH (NASH with at least stage 2 fibrosis) are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis and liver-related complications."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) prevalence — general population and global estimates — varies by assessment method: histology-based estimates in potential living liver donors were 20% and 51%, ultrasound-based prevalence ranged between 17% and 46%, and in a U.S. population study the prevalence was 31%. Global summaries report prevalence ranging from 6.3% to 33% with a median of 20%. For nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), histologically confirmed prevalence was 12.2%, aminotransferase-only estimates ranged between 7% and 11%, overall estimates range from 3 to 5%, and the prevalence of NASH cirrhosis in the general population is not known.

### AGA clinical practice update on screening and surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^bc5d3d43]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) introduces the scope and need for guidance: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects > 25% of the US and global population and up to 1 in 4 NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is broadly classified into 2 subtypes: NAFL and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Recent data confirm that HCC represents the fifth most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The incidence of NAFLD-related HCC is increasing in the United States, while screening and surveillance are suboptimal in general and disproportionately lower in patients with NAFLD-related HCC. It is estimated that 80–100 million Americans may have NAFLD, and NASH has become the second leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States, and is expected to become the leading indication in the next decade. Despite evidence that NAFLD-associated HCC may arise without cirrhosis and is often diagnosed at advanced stages, current society guidelines provide limited guidance/recommendations for surveillance outside established cirrhosis. The review states that Best Practice Advice statements address 8 key clinical issues.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an umbrella term that describes two subtypes of liver disease: non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).NAFL is characterised by fat accumulation (steatosis) in the liver without significant inflammation. NASH is a more severe form of NAFLD and is characterised by steatosis with inflammation and fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis. The prevalence of NAFLD in the USA is estimated to be 24%–26% of adults, of whom an estimated 20%–30% have NASH.

The transition from simple hepatic steatosis to NASH is a crucial point in the development of severe liver disease, putting patients at higher risk for fibrosis and progression to chronic liver disease. Nevertheless, NASH is often underdiagnosed in clinical practice. This may be due to several factors. First, there is a lack of clear patient symptoms and reliable biomarkers to help identify NASH, and there are no universal routine screening standards. Second, liver biopsy is the gold standard for NASH diagnosis but is costly, invasive, complicated by sampling errors and requires a specialist to perform. Finally, despite ongoing clinical trials, there are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for NASH outside of India. Thus, detection of NASH remains a challenge and reliable diagnostic tools, including minimal or even non-invasive techniques, are warranted.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) — natural history and progression — has fibrosis and the presence of steatohepatitis as primary predictors of disease progression; patients with NASH and at least stage 2 fibrosis (F2), referred to as "at-risk" NASH, have a demonstrably higher risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality, a meta-analysis of placebo-treated patients in 35 NASH trials found minimal progression, and an earlier meta-analysis showed a NAFLD fibrosis progression rate of one stage per 7 years in those with NASH versus 14 years for those with NAFL.

Screening in primary care, diabetes, and obesity clinics — screening for NAFLD in adults attending primary care clinics or high-risk groups attending diabetes or obesity clinics is not advised at this time due to uncertainties surrounding diagnostic tests and treatment options, along with lack of knowledge related to the long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening (Strength – 1, Evidence - B).

### Hepatocellular carcinoma, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^05d5e7d6]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) — nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) risk and screening: Metabolic disorders including NAFLD are associated with increased risk of HCC, and estimations of NASH prevalence in the United States are in the range of 3% to 5%. In one study of cirrhosis secondary to NASH, 12.8% of 195 patients developed HCC at a median follow-up of 3.2 years, with an annual incidence rate of HCC of 2.6%. Available epidemiologic evidence supports an association between NAFLD or NASH and an increased HCC risk predominantly in individuals with cirrhosis, although several studies suggest HCC may be somewhat less likely to develop with NASH-associated cirrhosis than with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C infection. The American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice update recommends that screening for HCC in patients with cirrhosis due to NAFLD be considered, and HCC screening should also be considered in patients with NAFLD with noninvasive markers that provide evidence of advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Introduction

Non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common, affecting approximately 25% of the population in many developed countries. The disease ranges from steatosis to non-alcohol-related steatohepatitis (NASH; fat with hepatocyte injury and hepatic inflammation) and can progress to cirrhosis and liver-related complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. Individuals with NAFLD have an increased risk of overall mortality compared with the general population, and common causes of death include cardiovascular disease, malignancy and liver-related complications –. The majority of the estimated 14.1 million individuals with NAFLD in the UK remain undiagnosed and worryingly the prevalence of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis is projected to double to 1 million individuals by 2030. Despite the high prevalence of NAFLD in the population, recognition and management of the condition is variable across the UK. One multicentre study from England found a large variability in the primary and secondary care management of NAFLD, with clear deficiencies identified in primary care investigations, fibrosis staging, provision of lifestyle treatments, and assessment and management of cardiovascular risk factors. There is therefore a clear need to improve the holistic management of patients with NAFLD in order to achieve better outcomes.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^ca16c760]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Screening for clinically significant fibrosis — targeted screening of populations at increased risk for advanced liver disease is advised to identify and manage those with clinically significant fibrosis (stage ≥ 2), and screening in high-risk populations such as those with T2DM, obesity with metabolic complications, a family history of cirrhosis, or significant alcohol use may identify those with asymptomatic but clinically significant fibrosis. Table 4 lists high-risk groups under "Screening recommended" with prevalence of advanced fibrosis (%) as follows: T2DM 6–19, medically complicated obesity 4–33, NAFLD in context of moderate alcohol use 17, and first-degree relative of a patient with cirrhosis due to NAFLD/NASH 18; a footnote notes prevalence of advanced fibrosis in the background population 0.9%–2%.

### Challenges and needs in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from the perspective of gastroenterology and hepatology specialists: a qualitative study [^bd894157]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study identified the absence of policies for education, informing, screening, prevention, providing specialized services for the patients, implementing a referral system, and sufficient research about NAFLD as a challenge/need. A survey showed that among 102 countries, none has a written strategy to fight this condition, and one-third of the countries scored zero in the policy preparedness index. The economic effect of NAFLD increases with the condition's progression, and it is estimated that more cases will increase the costs. NASH's heavy financial and clinical burden demands effective treatment options and policy-making for its prevention and treatment. The screening of NAFLD is still controversial, and there needs to be a consensus about the most effective screening strategy. Usually, the guidelines do not recommend screening for NAFLD, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not have any particular guidelines for NAFLD screening. However, screening is necessary due to the high number of NAFLD patients. The guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommend that noninvasive biomarkers such as NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) or fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) could be used in the screening of these patients. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to determine the practicality of these tools.

Statement 4: NASH Should Be Confirmed by Liver Biopsy Before Initiating Pharmacological Therapy in NAFLD

In response to the difficulties in using liver biopsy to confirm NASH, new data have shifted the focus toward NASH patients with stage 2 and higher fibrosis. These are stages that correlate with disease morbidity and mortality and potential candidacy for targeted therapies. The 2018 AASLD Guidance recommended that pharmacological therapy should be predicated upon the finding of F2 fibrosis or greater on liver biopsy.

Recent research has focused on identifying patients with NASH+NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4+ ≥ F2, primarily to replace biopsy, which is currently required for clinical trials. One promising NIT is the FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, which combines the controlled attenuation parameter score and stiffness assessed by TE with AST. In the derivative/validation cohorts study, the test performed well, with AUROC of ~0.80 and 2 author-determined cutoffs: the first (≤ 0.35) to rule out NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2 and the other (≥ 0.67) to rule in NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2. Greater than 30% of patients fell into the indeterminate zone. Nevertheless, the test is a promising alternative to liver biopsy for determining which NASH patients should be started on therapy.

### Expert panel consensus on clinical assertion statements describing noninvasive tools for diagnosing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^71177e32]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the recommendation in the 2018 AASLD Guidance Document on NAFLD, the panelists rejected Statement 4 that a liver biopsy demonstrating steatohepatitis and fibrosis is necessary before initiation of pharmacological therapy. The panelists emphasized fibrosis rather than steatohepatitis as the major prognostic determinant. Also cited were 2 newer NITs (the FAST score and NIS4) that can potentially predict NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ and ≥ F2, which are the criteria used to determine eligibility for many trials investigating new drugs for NASH.

The majority of the panelists accepted the recommendation in Statement 5. The presence of hepatic fibrosis should be considered regardless of transaminase levels in patients with NAFLD and metabolic risks. However, some members of the panel rejected the statement, and there was general agreement that there is poor to fair evidence in the literature supporting the statement as a cost-effective clinical approach. All panelists agreed, however, that normal transaminases do not preclude the possibility of fibrosis, especially in patients with T2D.

The recommendation in Statement 6 that all patients with NAFLD should undergo NITs for fibrosis every 1 to 2 years was generally accepted. This may identify patients in whom pharmacological therapy would be warranted or, in more advanced cases, patients who need HCC screening. The panelists emphasized, however, that other screening intervals may be appropriate, depending upon the clinical variables, including metabolic factors, laboratory or imaging results, and prior NIT results.

The panel rejected Statement 7, which asserts that genetic testing for PNPLA3 and other genetic markers would be useful at present in the clinical management of NAFLD. Despite the association between genetic variants at the PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and other loci and the development or progression of NAFLD, an evidence base for incorporating genetic profiling into treatment pathways is currently lacking. The panelists advocated for further research aimed at subphenotyping patients with NASH and correlating genetic variants with response to novel therapies.

### Too much medicine: overdiagnosis and overtreatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^e4c67c6a]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of liver disease. This remarkable rise in prevalence over the past 20 years is largely through the recognition of fatty liver in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption as a disease. The natural history of NAFLD is incompletely understood, and although a small proportion of individuals with NAFLD will develop complications of liver disease, most will not. This raises the prospect of widespread overdiagnosis of NAFLD. Clinical practice guidelines from the European specialist societies representing hepatology, endocrinology, and obesity endorse screening for NAFLD in at-risk groups, and this further increases the likelihood of overdiagnosis and consequent overtreatment through false-positive testing. Predictable outcomes of overdiagnosis include physical harms through investigation and treatment, and psychosocial harms through disease labelling. Prospective studies are required to better understand both the benefits and risks associated with an early diagnosis of NAFLD.

Clinically, these studies imply that if about 10% of adults with T2D have ≥ F3 fibrosis, universal screening of the estimated 30 million adults with T2D in the United States would identify about 3 million cases of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, many of whom are without elevated aminotransferases. Screening of adults with T2D would also be supported by a recent study that suggests screening followed by 1 year of lifestyle modification or pioglitazone treatment was cost-effective in preventing future end-stage liver disease. There is greater uncertainty for patients with NAFLD and obesity without T2D, where the prevalence of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis is lower. Recently, Barb et alexamined 3841 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2015–2016 database and concluded that steatosis was primarily driven by obesity, while diabetes doubled the risk of advanced fibrosis. Screening by ALT and AST levels (ie, rather than by FIB-4) would have failed to identify most of those at risk of clinically significant fibrosis.

Overall, there was a split in the panel's level of acceptance of the statement that in patients with NAFLD and metabolic risks the presence of hepatic fibrosis should be considered regardless of level of transaminase elevation. Some accepted the recommendation completely or with some reservations, while some rejected it with reservations. Two third of the panel members considered the nature of evidence to support the statement of moderate quality.

Considerations that weighed in the discussion were: (1) a need to refine the best screening approach; (2) adoption of evidence-based lower transaminase cutoffs to improve case finding and minimize workload and costs; and (3) establishment of a cost-effective treatment strategy. Overall, there was a strong(er) rationale to screen for hepatic fibrosis regardless of transaminase levels in patients with T2D and NAFLD than in patients with obesity in the absence of diabetes.

Screening and clinical management of NAFLD in lean individuals: outstanding questions

Despite the prevalence and adverse outcomes associated with NAFLD in normal weight individuals, there are no global consensus guidelines for NAFLD screening, nor is screening in the general population recommended by any professional societies. As shown in Table 3, practice guidance statements developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), and intended for use by physicians and other health professionals, do not recommend routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups (i.e. T2D or obesity) due to the uncertain evidence supporting diagnostic tests, treatment options, and the long-term benefits or cost-effectiveness of screening. Some specialists in the United States recommend screening individuals at risk of developing liver disease, such as those older than 50 years and with T2D or metabolic syndrome, using liver function tests and abdominal ultrasound in a primary care setting and imaging or prediction algorithms to assess the presence of fibrosis and subsequent diagnosis of NASH and staging of fibrosis.

Table 3
Summary of AASLD practice guidelines for the screening, evaluation, and treatment of NAFLD

A review of current international guidelines has recently been published. In contrast to the AASLD, European and Asian guidelines recommend that screening be considered for groups considered at risk for developing NAFLD, including patients with obesity and T2D. With respect to lean individuals, guidelines for NAFLD screening become less clear. Many guidelines acknowledge the importance of NAFLD in lean individuals, especially those of Asian ancestry or who exhibit features of metabolic syndrome. The development and distribution of consistent screening and risk assessment guidelines will be critical to ensure optimal clinical management for all NAFLD patients. Knowledge of disease etiology, screening, detection methods, and consensus guidelines are becoming increasingly important for adequate clinical care of both lean and obese NAFLD patients, especially for primary care physicians, who are the providers in the best position to make an initial diagnosis.

### High rates of ineligibility for participation in trials of new therapies in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a systematic review [^9f796e5c]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is common and there are a number of treatments in development. Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and significant fibrosis are thought to be the population most in need of treatment. Identification of this group requires liver biopsy. The aim of this study was to identify the proportion of patients screened for phase 2 randomised controlled trials who subsequently entered these studies.

Methods

Large, multicentre, phase 2 randomised controlled trials of pharmacological therapies for NASH were identified by systematic review. The pooled proportion of potential participants who entered the trials was estimated by meta-analysis. The reasons for trial ineligibility were separately extracted and analysed.

Results

Thirteen reports of 14 trials were included. Overall, there were 4014 screened individuals included in the quantitative analyses and 53% were subsequently enrolled in a trial. Considering trials in which the entry criteria matched the current paradigm for treatment, that is, the presence of NASH and significant fibrosis, only 35% of screened individuals were eligible for trial entry. More than half of ineligible individuals were excluded on the basis of liver histology most often due to insufficient disease activity with or without insufficient fibrosis.

Conclusion

The majority of patients considered at risk of NASH and fibrosis sufficient for treatment in randomised controlled trials are ineligible for trial entry. Most often, this is due to ineligible liver histology. These findings have implications for the design of future trials in NASH and for the applicability of treatments after licensing.

### A cross-sectional study of the public health response to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Europe [^acbed287]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing public health problem worldwide and has become an important field of biomedical inquiry. We aimed to determine whether European countries have mounted an adequate public health response to NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Methods

In 2018 and 2019, NAFLD experts in 29 European countries completed an English-language survey on policies, guidelines, awareness, monitoring, diagnosis and clinical assessment in their country. The data were compiled, quality checked against existing official documents and reported descriptively.

Results

None of the 29 participating countries had written strategies or action plans for NAFLD. Two countries (7%) had mentions of NAFLD or NASH in related existing strategies (obesity and alcohol). Ten (34%) reported having national clinical guidelines specifically addressing NAFLD and, upon diagnosis, all included recommendations for the assessment of diabetes and liver cirrhosis. Eleven countries (38%) recommended screening for NAFLD in all patients with either diabetes, obesity and/or metabolic syndrome. Five countries (17%) had referral algorithms for follow-up and specialist referral in primary care, and 7 (24%) reported structured lifestyle programmes aimed at NAFLD. Seven (24%) had funded awareness campaigns that specifically included prevention of liver disease. Four countries (14%) reported having civil society groups which address NAFLD and 3 countries (10%) had national registries that include NAFLD.

Conclusions

We found that a comprehensive public health response to NAFLD is lacking in the surveyed European countries. This includes policy in the form of a strategy, clinical guidelines, awareness campaigns, civil society involvement, and health systems organisation, including registries.

Lay Summary

We conducted a survey on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with experts in European countries, coupled with data extracted from official documents on policies, clinical guidelines, awareness, and monitoring. We found a general lack of national policies, awareness campaigns and civil society involvement, and few epidemiological registries.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^3721f7aa]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD — Screening for advanced fibrosis and risk stratification prioritizes high‑risk groups and staged noninvasive testing. General population-based screening for NAFLD is not advised, whereas high-risk individuals should be screened for advanced fibrosis. All patients with hepatic steatosis or clinically suspected NAFLD should undergo primary risk assessment with the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), and in prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or with 2 or more metabolic risk factors or imaging steatosis, FIB-4 should be repeated every 1–2 y with secondary assessment considered. If FIB-4 ≥ 1.3, vibration-controlled elastography (VCTE), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), or enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) may be used to exclude advanced fibrosis. In nongastroenterology/hepatology settings, suspected advanced NASH or discordant noninvasive tests (NITs) warrant specialist referral; patients with NASH cirrhosis require routine surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), esophageal varices, and decompensation monitoring. ELF > 11.3 is linked to hepatic decompensation in advanced fibrosis and should prompt screening and management of cirrhosis and portal hypertensive complications.

### Role of noninvasive tests in clinical gastroenterology practices to identify patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis At high risk of adverse outcomes: expert panel recommendations [^48fe5dec]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is generally considered a silent and potentially reversible condition. The subtype of NAFLD that can be classified as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Because of the metabolic nature of the pathogenic mechanism underlying NAFLD and NASH, it is often accompanied by common comorbidities such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The increase in the prevalence of these comorbidities has resulted in a parallel increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH, globally, nationally, and even in children. In recent years, it has been identified that the stage of fibrosis is the most important predictor of liver outcomes; therefore, identifying patients with NAFLD and NASH with more advanced stages of fibrosis can be essential for optimal management. Several noninvasive tools for diagnosing and staging NAFLD and NASH are available, but simple and straightforward recommendations on the use of these tools are not. Recognizing these unmet needs, hepatologists who are members of the American College of Gastroenterology and the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation created a practical decision tree/algorithm to risk stratify NAFLD/NASH as a resource in gastroenterology/hepatology clinical practices. This review will provide insight into how this algorithm was developed, describe it in detail, and provide recommendations for its use in clinical practice.

### Diagnosis… [^84782338]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- NAFLD and NASH are common in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity.
- If testing for NAFLD, start with the fibrosis-4 index, which uses platelet and transaminase measurements. Evaluate intermediate- or higher-risk patients with transient elastography or an enhanced liver fibrosis laboratory panel. Diagnosis HIGH-RISK PATIENTS Because of the high prevalence of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, screening these patients should be considered. Similarly, people with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and diabetes are at increased risk of fibrosis and mortality and can be considered for screening. Liver biopsy at the time of bariatric surgery should be considered because nearly 1 in 12 patients will have significant fibrosis, and up to 1 in 25 patients will have cirrhosis. Patients with persistently elevated transaminase levels are at high risk of NAFLD and developing hepatic fibrosis.

TESTING FOR NAFLD The first step to testing for NAFLD is to estimate fibrosis through the fibrosis-4 index, the most highly validated initial test, which uses platelet and transaminase measurements. The fibrosis-4 index has a high negative predictive value but low positive predictive value. Other suggested fibrosis indexes appear to further overestimate fibrosis. Alanine transaminase levels alone cannot rule out NAFLD because one-half of patients with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes have levels in the normal range. Liver ultrasonography is not effective for screening because of low sensitivity for mild to moderate steatosis. For an intermediate- or high-risk fibrosis-4 index, liver stiffness should be measured using transient elastography. This testing can rule out fibrosis with negative predictive values between 91% and 99%, depending on the specification used.

Magnetic resonance elastography is also accurate, but it is less widely available. Children NAFLD affects 1 in 13 children overall, 1 in 3 children with obesity, and one-half of children with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome also have increased risk of NAFLD. Children with polycystic ovary syndrome, obesity, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes should be screened for NAFLD.

NASPGHAN guideline — Screening for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children is appropriate because NAFLD is often asymptomatic, can be detected before irreversible, end-stage liver disease, and identification enables effective treatment via weight management and lifestyle improvements; lifestyle intervention can reverse NAFLD and even NASH when initiated early before advanced fibrosis, and because clinical events from pediatric NAFLD typically do not occur under the age of 21 years, determining clinical outcomes requires long-term follow-up into adulthood.

Discussion

In the setting of increasing prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and its associated conditions have become significant public health crises. PCP and subspecialists that manage many of these chronic conditions have been faced with significant challenges in terms of diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of these co-morbidities. In current clinical practice, there remain several key uncertainties regarding the optimal approach for screening and risk stratification of NAFLD. The AASLD does not recommend screening for NAFLD and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has no specific guidelines for NAFLD screening. Once NAFLD is found, AASLD guidelines do make recommendations to use non-invasive risk stratification tools, that is, serum biomarkers and TE, to identify which patients may benefit from referral to subspecialists.

In this nationwide survey, we demonstrated that while overall disease knowledge was good, there was an important disconnect between current guidelines and real-world clinical practice in regard to diagnosis, risk stratification, referral, and treatment. Interestingly, acknowledging the high prevalence of NAFLD, over half of respondents reported that there would be a role for screening patients for NAFLD. Opinions regarding the role for screening significantly varied by specialty and sample source, with subspecialists most strongly agreeing and respondents from the AH less likely to agree. Notably, liver enzymes were the primary method used to screen for NAFLD, despite their known limitations in sensitivity to detect NAFLD and NASH. – Data related to the cost-effectiveness and optimal approach to screening high-risk patients for NAFLD continue to evolve. Initial studies indicated that screening for NAFLD among patients with diabetes lacked cost-effectiveness, though the model used to assess cost did not take into account need for future liver transplantation or development of HCC. Recent studies have demonstrated that screening among patients with type II diabetes may improve liver-related outcomes and may be cost-effective depending on the inclusion of quality-of-life decrement. The role for screening will continue to evolve based on optimization of non-invasive methods to diagnose and risk stratify patients, and as the treatment landscape improves.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British society of gastroenterology NAFLD special interest group [^0d7fe438]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Liver biopsy

Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the general population, fatty liver frequently co-exists with other liver diseases (especially viral hepatitis, autoimmune and haemochromatosis), thereby necessitating a biopsy to understand their relative contributions to the patient's condition. Furthermore, the diseases may be synergistic e.g. iron overload and NAFLD.

Liver biopsy remains the standard for diagnosing NASH and assessing disease activity (inflammation; ballooning) as there are no approved non-invasive radiological or serological markers specific for NASH. International drug authorities (FDA and EMA) therefore continue to recommend that phase 2/3 clinical trials utilise liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and assess the grade and stage of the disease, to determine trial entry, as well as act as a primary trial endpoint. There has been a recent debate about the role and reliability of histology in this setting.

In the event that there is discordance between non-invasive fibrosis markers, a biopsy may be required to stage fibrosis; and most importantly rule in or out cirrhosis.

Patients with NAFLD should therefore be considered for a liver biopsy: A. if there is diagnostic uncertainty (other aetiologies/overlap conditions); B. to evaluate the severity of NASH and be considered for potential drug therapies (including clinical trials); C. to determine the stage of liver fibrosis where non-invasive tests are inconclusive to aid with future management (e.g. F4 for HCC surveillance) (Recommendation 14, Table 1).

The Royal College of Pathologists has developed guidelines for the processing, staining and reporting of liver biopsiesand these should be followed. The pathologists who report these biopsies should be active participants in the EQA scheme run by the UK Liver Pathology Group. It is recommended that the biopsy reporting should include the individual components of either the NASH Clinical Research Network criteria (NAS) or steatosis, activity fibrosis (SAF) score with the choice of score being made by agreement with the clinicians. Accordingly, liver biopsies should be processed, stained and examined according to the RCPath guidelines and reported by pathologists who participate in the liver EQA scheme using a validated score such as the NASH CRN or SAF score. (Recommendation 15, Table 1)

Screening for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Step 1: identify patients at risk for clinically significant fibrosis prioritizes patients with clinically significant hepatic fibrosis (fibrosis stage 2 or higher) and reports that screening patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosed with fibrosis stage F2 or higher was cost-effective. We identified 3 groups known to be at greatest risk of NAFLD/NASH-related fibrosis: (1) patients with T2D, in whom as many as 20% have clinically significant fibrosis; we recommend clinicians screen all patients with T2D; (2) patients with 2 or more metabolic risk factors, supported by a study of 271,906 patients with NAFLD and an 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis or HCC with each additional metabolic trait; therefore, we recommend that clinicians screen patients with 2 or more metabolic conditions for NAFLD-related clinically significant hepatic fibrosis; and (3) patients with incidental hepatic steatosis or elevated aminotransferases, as studies suggest that 11% of those with incidentally discovered hepatic steatosis might be at high risk for advanced hepatic fibrosis. The metabolic conditions include central obesity; raised serum triglycerides, ≥ 150 mg/dL, or specific treatment; reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, < 40 mg/dL in men and < 50 mg/dL in women, or specific treatment; hypertension, systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mm Hg, or specific treatment; and raised fasting plasma glucose, between 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL.

### Rational HCC screening approaches for patients with NAFLD [^27dcabfe]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially among those who have cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, but 20–30% of cases of NAFLD-related HCC occur in the absence of advanced fibrosis. The prevalence of NAFLD-related HCC is increasing in most countries worldwide. There are few direct data to support or refute the efficacy or effectiveness of HCC surveillance in NAFLD or to guide its application. We use evidence on surveillance in other conditions and studies on the clinical course of patients with NAFLD to arrive at recommendations for rational approaches to HCC surveillance in this growing cohort of patients. We also outline gaps in research and practice, including opportunities to advance the field.

### Global burden of NAFLD and NASH: trends, predictions, risk factors and prevention [^5e8110c8]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

NAFLD is one of the most important causes of liver disease worldwide and will probably emerge as the leading cause of end-stage liver disease in the coming decades, with the disease affecting both adults and children. The epidemiology and demographic characteristics of NAFLD vary worldwide, usually parallel to the prevalence of obesity, but a substantial proportion of patients are lean. The large number of patients with NAFLD with potential for progressive liver disease creates challenges for screening, as the diagnosis of NASH necessitates invasive liver biopsy. Furthermore, individuals with NAFLD have a high frequency of metabolic comorbidities and could place a growing strain on health-care systems from their need for management. While awaiting the development effective therapies, this disease warrants the attention of primary care physicians, specialists and health policy makers.

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [^bfaf1a0d]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This joint EASL-EASD-EASO guideline provides an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment for MASLD. Case-finding strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis, using non-invasive tests, should be applied in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity with additional metabolic risk factor(s). A stepwise approach using blood-based scores (such as FIB-4) and, sequentially, imaging techniques (such as transient elastography) is suitable to rule-out/in advanced fibrosis, which is predictive of liver-related outcomes. In adults with MASLD, lifestyle modification - including weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise and discouraging alcohol consumption - as well as optimal management of comorbidities - including use of incretin-based therapies (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) for T2D or obesity, if indicated - is advised. Bariatric surgery is also an option in individuals with MASLD and obesity. If locally approved and dependent on the label, adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and significant liver fibrosis (stage ≥ 2) should be considered for a MASH-targeted treatment with resmetirom, which demonstrated histological effectiveness on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. No MASH-targeted pharmacotherapy can currently be recommended for the cirrhotic stage. Management of MASH-related cirrhosis includes adaptations of metabolic drugs, nutritional counselling, surveillance for portal hypertension and HCC, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.

### Screening for MAFLD: who, when and how? [^d3371687]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a highly prevalent disease with increasing prevalence worldwide. Currently, no universal screening methods have been standardized, even when this disease poses a major health burden. MAFLD as a spectrum of diseases can range from simple steatosis, and steatohepatitis to fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its extra-hepatic manifestations are vast and include cardiovascular diseases, extra-hepatic malignancies, cognitive and respiratory alterations. Given its extensive damage targets as well as its high prevalence, timely identification of the high-risk population presenting metabolic dysfunction should undergo universal non-invasive screening methods, which can be carried out through blood tests, easy and effective imaging techniques, such as ultrasound, score calculation and general clinical information brought together from primary patient-physician contact.

Alcohol consumption thresholds in suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — By definition, NAFLD indicates the lack of evidence for ongoing or recent consumption of significant amounts of alcohol. For NASH clinical trials eligibility, significant alcohol consumption was recommended as > 21 standard drinks per week in men and > 14 standard drinks per week in women over a 2-year period preceding baseline liver histology, and a standard alcoholic drink contains about 14 g of pure alcohol. Ongoing or recent alcohol consumption > 21 standard drinks on average per week in men and > 14 standard drinks on average per week in women is a reasonable threshold for significant alcohol consumption when evaluating patients with suspected NAFLD.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A decalogue from the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) expert committee [^e7b76cc0]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

We report the evidence-based Italian Association for the Study of Liver guidelines for the appropriate diagnosis and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in clinical practice and its related research agenda. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease varies according to age, gender and ethnicity. In the general population, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is about 25% and the incidence is of two new cases/100 people/year. 2–3% of individuals in the general population will suffer from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Uncomplicated steatosis will usually follow a benign course. Individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, however, have a reduced life expectancy, mainly owing to vascular diseases and liver-related causes. Moreover, steatosis has deleterious effects on the natural history of HCV infection. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is usually diagnosed in asymptomatic patients prompted by the occasional discovery of increased liver enzymes and/or of ultrasonographic steatosis. Medical history, complete physical examination, etiologic screening of liver injury, liver biochemistry tests, serum lipids and insulin sensitivity tests should be performed in every patient. Occult alcohol abuse should be ruled out. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging technique. Liver biopsy, the gold standard in diagnosis and prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is an invasive procedure and its results will not influence treatment in most cases but will provide prognostic information. Assessment of fibrosis by composite scores, specific laboratory parameters and transient elastography might reduce the number of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients requiring liver biopsy. Dieting and physical training reinforced by behavioural therapy are associated with improved nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome should be ruled out at timed intervals in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients should undergo periodic evaluation of cardiovascular risk and of advancement of their liver disease; those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-cirrhosis should be evaluated for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis medical patient journey from the perspective of hepatologists, gastroenterologists and patients: a cross-sectional survey [^66fa4ee1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the inflammatory form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Both NAFLD and NASH are characterized by identification of > 5% hepatic steatosis in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption and other etiologies. NASH is characterized by steatosis accompanied by hepatocyte inflammation and injury (ballooning), which can perpetuate the development of fibrosis. The extent of liver fibrosis is the greatest predictor of hepatic morbidity and mortality. Both NAFLD and NASH can develop progressive hepatic fibrosis, though this is more likely in the context of NASH.

Globally, 25% of people are estimated to have NAFLD and 2–6% are estimated to have NASH. In the US, NAFLD prevalence is estimated at 37%; among patients with NAFLD, approximately 8% have advanced liver fibrosis. The prevalence of NASH is increasing, but more concerning is the disproportionate increase in those with advanced fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatic decompensation predicted by modeling studies. In the United States, NASH is currently the leading indication for liver transplant in women and those > 65 years of age and is predicted to become the overall leading indication for liver transplant. While there are currently no FDA approved pharmacologic treatments for NASH, management focused on optimal control of comorbidities, using available therapies that may have additive benefit in NASH, as well as implementation and sustained support for lifestyle change can improve liver health and overall health in patients with NASH.

NASH is underdiagnosed as patients are often asymptomatic or present with non-specific symptoms. According to 2018 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidance, NAFLD can be diagnosed by imaging or liver biopsy while NASH requires a liver biopsy. Many patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) are hesitant to use liver biopsies due to costs and associated risks. The requirement for liver biopsy to confirm diagnosis could be contributing to the under-diagnosis of NASH; liver biopsies are potentially dangerous, resource-intensive, and have limited scalability. The field is looking to non-invasive tests (NITs) to identify those at most risk, who can then be targeted for therapy or more confidently exclude those who do not need specialty care. Noninvasive risk stratification algorithms using calculations (e.g. Fibrosis-4 Index [FIB4]) followed by liver stiffness measurements in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus or high risk, are being proposed and refined to aid HCPs in their management.

A case for screening?

NAFLD is closely linked with type 2 diabetes and obesity. In one study from China which used transient elastography to screen more than 1900 people with type 2 diabetes, 73% of people had NAFLD, rising to 95% of those who had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or over. Some 35% of those with both risk factors had high liver stiffness suggestive of advanced fibrosis. This suggests a case for screening people with diabetes or obesity for NAFLD, as recommended by current Asian Pacific guidelines.

NAFLD is not, however, confined to the obese population. In the USA, 43% of people with NAFLD are not obese, rising to 71% in Sweden.

Figures on incidence of NAFLD are not easy to come by, but a study from Hong Kong using serial proton-MR spectroscopy to screen community participants with no liver disease at baseline found 13.8% developed fatty liver over 4 years, giving an incidence of 3.7 per 100 person-years. In contrast, a study using serial transient elastography examinations showed that 52% of patients with type 2 diabetes developed incident fatty liver in 3 years.

Therefore, current European and Asian Pacific guidelines support screening people with diabetes or obesity for NAFLD. That said, the optimal screening strategy remains unclear and will depend on the local clinical practice, referral pathway and availability of different tests. Recently, a consensus paper commissioned by the American Gastroenterological Association recommends the use of the Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) followed by specific fibrosis tests to screen for advanced liver disease in patients at risk of NAFLD.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in primary care and endocrinology settings — conclusions state that screening should involve calculation of the individual's liver fibrosis risk (FIB-4), followed by additional plasma biomarkers and/or liver imaging based on fibrosis risk stratification into low, indeterminate, or high risk of developing future cirrhosis, with referral to a liver specialist for those in the higher-risk groups. Treatment must include consideration of weight-loss medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) given proven benefit for steatohepatitis and bariatric surgery, and some diabetes medications, such as pioglitazone and GLP-1 RAs, should be preferred for those with T2D and NASH, particularly when at indeterminate or high risk of developing future cirrhosis. Management should also include careful control of CV risk factors, such as hypertension and atherogenic dyslipidemia. In the meantime, clinicians should become more familiar with the utilization of diabetes agents, such as pioglitazone or the GLP-1 RAs, although these agents are not FDA approved for the treatment of NASH; vitamin E has also shown benefit in people with NASH without diabetes. Pediatric NAFLD is also becoming a growing concern, but there is limited awareness among health care professionals about the problem.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease should be considered for treatment allocation in standard management algorithms for type 2 diabetes [^75d551f7]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) often exist together. This is a high-risk population, as presence of T2D promotes the progression of NAFLD to more severe liver pathologies. There are several international guidelines for managing T2D, however guidance for management of NAFLD in individuals with T2D is scarce. In India, there is hardly any screening programme for identification of high-risk NAFLD individuals.

Methods

A literature search was performed with Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar electronic databases till October 2020, using relevant keywords (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; NAFLD; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; NASH screening and management; metabolic associated fatty liver disease) to extract relevant studies describing screening and management strategies of NAFLD/NASH, especially in patients with T2D.

Results

An estimated 12.4 million Indian people are living with coexisting T2D and NAFLD-related advanced liver fibrosis, which is a major determinant of liver-related mortality in these individuals. Several studies have reported screening tools for identification of high risk NAFLD patients with coexisting T2D. The emphasis has been laid on the identification of advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, using noninvasive tests at the primary level. For management, lifestyle measures and appropriate glucose-lowering medication have been proposed that help patients with coexisting T2D and NAFLD. Timely referral to specialists is also critical for preventing complications of cirrhosis.

Conclusions

While current management algorithms for T2D include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, kidney dysfunction and obesity as co-morbidities to direct appropriate therapies, NAFLD should be considered as additional pathway to select appropriate treatment.

NAFLD — Assessment and management notes limitations of liver enzymes and preferred imaging for steatosis. Aminotransferase levels may be normal in advanced NASH and should not exclude disease with clinically significant fibrosis. Most laboratory "normal" ALT thresholds are high; as a general rule, ALT > 30 U/L should be considered abnormal. Standard ultrasound is not recommended to identify steatosis due to low sensitivity, whereas controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) may be used to identify steatosis and MRI–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) can quantify steatosis.

HCC surveillance

Surveillance can be defined as the repeated application of imaging or other modality for the detection of disease within a population at risk. The guiding principle of surveillance for HCC is to reduce overall and disease-related mortality by the early detection of HCC, at a stage when curative treatment options are possible. For this reason, surveillance has a limited role in patients with advanced or decompensated liver disease (unless they are transplant candidates), because there are no treatment options with curative intent.

The AASLD and EASL guidelines have nearly identical recommendations for surveillance, comprising US performed every 6 months. The AASLD guideline recognizes the additive value of measuring AFP (positive if > 20 ng/mL), while noting this may result in increased false positives and cost. Patient groups at the highest risk of HCC who should receive surveillance include those with cirrhosis and/or hepatitis B viral infection. Additional study is required on the benefits of surveillance in sub-cirrhotic patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; stage 2 and 3 fibrosis) or in patients with hepatitis C virus-induced advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have received antiviral therapy.

### Real-world data reveal a diagnostic gap in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^7ca13783]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly becoming the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. NAFLD is a spectrum of diseases that encompasses uncomplicated steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, which in a small proportion can lead to complications including cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is a multisystem disease with a multidirectional relationship with the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Among other high-risk groups, people with diabetes and NAFLD are at increased risk of micro- and macrovascular complications and these patients have a twofold increased risk of all-cause mortality.

The estimated point prevalence of NAFLD in the general Western population is 20–30%, largely based on cohort studies with heterogeneous inclusion criteria and research methods. The prevalence of NAFLD rises to 40–70% among patients with type 2 diabetes and up to 90% among patients with morbid obesity. Moreover, as the rates of diabetes and obesity rise worldwide, it is expected that NAFLD will become even more common. NAFLD-related cirrhosis is currently the third most common indication and is anticipated to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the USA within the next one to two decades.

There is much debate about whether screening programmes in the general population or in at-risk groups, such as people with diabetes, should be implemented. This debate is based on our current understanding of the epidemiology and natural history of NAFLD, which, in turn, derives from cohort or cross-sectional studies. These are often highly selected studies of individuals with metabolic risk factors, or they involve extensive phenotyping that would be unrealistic in routine practice.

A pragmatic approach is to focus on real-world patients for whom the diagnosis of NAFLD has been made during routine clinical care. A diagnosis of NAFLD is often made following abnormal imaging of the liver or elevated serum liver enzymes (so-called liver function tests) and involves exclusion of other causes of liver injury, such as excess alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis. Although routinely collected data can represent only the visible part of the clinical iceberg, there is a growing body of literature that has used well-curated electronic health records (EHRs) to study disease characteristics and epidemiology in large numbers of people.

Identifying high-risk populations for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis

As stated above, the prevalence of NAFLD has been rising and the disease is affecting a quarter of the general population. Parallel to this, the number of patients with NASH is also increasing. It is estimated that the prevalence of NASH in the general population ranges between 1.5% and 6.5%. However, some individuals with certain metabolic conditions are at a higher risk for the development of NAFLD and progression to NASH. In this context, conditions that have well-established associations with NAFLD include visceral obesity, type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypothyroidism. As these conditions are highly prevalent in the general population, it is a challenge to identify NAFLD patients at high risk for progression to advanced disease stages. Among patients with NAFLD, the presence of components of metabolic syndrome is a strong predictor of NASH. In fact, studies demonstrated that as the number of metabolic syndrome components increases, the risk of progression to advanced fibrosis and mortality will increase in parallel. At this point, the aforementioned non-invasive tools, combination of serum markers and imaging modalities are extremely helpful in identifying patients with higher likelihood of having stage 3 and stage 4 fibrosis, which is cirrhosis. In fact, the current American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines recommend the use of NFS, FIB-4 index, TE and MRE in clinical practice (if available) to identify patients with high risk for NASH and fibrosis.

Another important point when identifying patients who have high risk for NASH and advanced fibrosis is screening for complications of cirrhosis such as HCC and esophageal varices. It is well known that the presence of NAFLD is a risk factor for the development of HCC. Progression to cirrhosis due to NASH will increase the risk of HCC with an incidence rate between 1% and 8%. Kawamura and colleagues reported that patients with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis had a 25-fold increased risk for the development of HCC compared with patients with NAFLD without fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend that patients with NASH-related cirrhosis should undergo HCC screening with ultrasound, with or without α-fetoprotein, every 6 months. Because the risk of HCC is very low in patients with NAFLD without cirrhosis, surveillance is not recommended for that cohort. In addition to HCC screening, other recommendations for patients with cirrhosis (screening for varices, avoidance of hepatotoxic drugs, etc.) should apply to these patients.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Liver blood tests

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. Whilst unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease. However, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated. (Recommendation 3, Table 1)

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focussed history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests giving a full panel of results, suggested diagnosis and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost effective.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Several risk scores (e.g. Framingham, QRISK) have been suggested over the years to estimate risk of CVD at 10 years in the general population. UK guidelinescurrently recommend the QRISK-3 assessment tool (which includes ethnicity) in all individuals over 40 years of age who have no prior history of CVD. Although these guidelines are for asymptomatic individuals and are yet to be validated in patients with NAFLD, there is no reason to suggest that QRISK-3 would not be applicable in NAFLD clinics to guide primary prevention with pharmacological therapy (e.g. lipid lowering therapy). Therefore, people with NAFLD should undergo systematic assessment of cardiovascular risk factors including use of an objective risk score (e.g. QRISK-3) (Recommendation 17, Table 1). Individuals with 10% or greater 10-year risk of developing CVD should be offered HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ("statin") therapy for primary prevention in line with existing guidelines for people at risk of CVD.

NAFLD has a strong relationship with multi-organ insulin resistance, most notably the liver, muscle and adipose tissue. NAFLD is associated with a 2–5 fold increased risk of developing T2DM after adjustment of several metabolic and lifestyle confounders. We therefore suggest that patients with NAFLD should be screened annually for Type 2 Diabetes (using HbA1c), hypertension and dyslipidaemia (Recommendation 18, Table 1). The American Diabetes Association recommends annual screening for T2DM in individuals considered to be at high risk of T2DM (i.e. those with obesity, older age, 1 st degree relative with diabetes). NICE guidelines recommend annual screening for T2DM amongst individuals with risk factors and evidence of an elevated plasma fasting glucose and pre-diabetes (defined as an HbA1c 42–47 mmol/mol (6.0–6.4%)). For those with an HbA1c of less than 42 mmol/mol they recommend a reassessment in 3 years. Given NAFLD is recognised as a high-risk group for T2DMand for simplicity we advocate annual screening for diabetes in patients with NAFLD. A HbA1c of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or above is diagnostic for T2DM. The utility and convenience of blood testing for HbA1c in the out-patient setting, favours its use over that of fasting glucose sampling and/or 75g oral glucose tolerance test

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: what does the primary care physician need to know? [^c381a079]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States and is soon to be the leading cause of liver transplantation. Patients at the greatest risk are those with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In 2019 the American Diabetes Association guidelines called, for the first time, for clinicians to screen for steatohepatitis and fibrosis all patients with type 2 diabetes and liver steatosis or abnormal plasma aminotransferases. This requires primary care physicians to be aware of key aspects related to the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD, as well as to when to refer to a specialist. Unfortunately, there is still significant medical inertia as clinicians remain unaware of its high morbidity/mortality. Early diagnosis in the primary care setting is critical to prevent progression to end-stage liver disease. Patients with NAFLD are also at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Despite general perception to the contrary, weight loss by lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery and several pharmacological treatments (eg, vitamin E in nondiabetics, pioglitazone or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in patients with or without diabetes) can often be successful to reverse steatohepatitis and prevent disease progression.

Barriers in controlling NAFLD

Who should be screened?

Notwithstanding the gravity of the problem, along with the projected healthcare burden, multiple limitations and unmet needs in the management of NAFLD remain to be addressed. There are no clear screening guidelines for NAFLD. A survey conducted in Australia showed that non-hepatologists underestimated the prevalence of NAFLD, both in the general population and in high-risk patients. The study also reported that only a few patients were referred to hepatologists. A similar trend was demonstrated in a French study showing that only 20% of NAFLD patients seen by a gastroenterologist were referred by other specialists. Both studies showed that, when considering screening patients for NAFLD, there was an over-reliance on elevated liver enzymes, particularly elevated transaminases, instead of metabolic risk factors. Guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) do not recommend screening for NAFLD in family members or high-risk groups attending primary care, diabetic, or obesity clinics because of the lack of long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness.

Some hepatology societies recommend screening for NAFLD with liver function tests and ultrasound of the abdomen. The challenges with these diagnostic tests include the lack of standardization of ultrasound instruments in defining steatosis and the presence of normal transaminases in some patients with NAFLD, which does not correlate with histological disease. Despite these challenges, the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) recently released guidelines recommending screening children aged 9–11 years with obesity and other children with risk factors using an alanine aminotransferase test. The caveat, however, is that NAFLD can occur in non-obese patients without metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Furthermore, according to the National Guideline Centre (UK), the use of routine liver function tests to diagnose NAFLD is ill-advised in children and young adults, and the Centre recommends using liver ultrasound in high-risk patients or patients suspected of having NAFLD. Similar clinical guidelines have been issued by other European bodies. Given these recent guidelines in the pediatric population, updated guidelines for adults are long overdue. Having a more standardized validated model that incorporates risk factors such as age, family history of NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, ethnicity, and sleep apnea will streamline the process of screening, especially among primary care providers. This approach will aid the earlier detection of NAFLD. Further research is need to define this model and determine screening intervals in high-risk patients.

Abdominal ultrasounds, which have some qualitative utility in detecting hepatic steatosis and ultrastructural changes of cirrhosis, were the most commonly used imaging modality, performed in over 70% of patients at each stage of fibrosis. Abdominal ultrasound is frequently used to evaluate abnormal liver biochemistries and to guide liver biopsy. Utilization of non-imaging-based methods to assess liver fibrosis was highly variable, without clear distinction in utilization patterns between eventual fibrosis stages or type of provider. The best performing blood test-based biomarker in this analysis, NAFLD fibrosis score, was used in approximately one-quarter of patients. Of the imaging techniques reported to be of utility in predicting risk for advanced liver disease, transient elastography (Fibroscan) was the most common, with MRE used rarely. A minority of patients who underwent a liver biopsy had one of the tests currently recommended in the NAFLD and NASH diagnosis and management guidance documents from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and AASLD (NAFLD fibrosis score, transient elastography, or MRE). These findings suggest a substantial potential benefit of dissemination and awareness of practice guidance.

### Management of NAFLD: a stage-based approach [^65ad3bd8]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

NAFLD is the most prevalent form of liver disease in the USA, affecting an estimated 30% of the population. The condition is associated with increased mortality related to cardiovascular disease, malignancy and liver disease. Identification of patients who might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes is critical as it is not feasible to screen all patients with suspected NAFLD. Patients with NASH, the progressive subtype of NAFLD, should be targeted for treatment, especially if they have concomitant fibrosis because such patients are more likely than those without fibrosis to have adverse outcomes. Treatment goals in patients with NAFLD vary depending on the disease stage owing to differential risk of progression and the particularities of an individual's comorbid disease. Lifestyle intervention is important for all patients irrespective of disease stage, but other therapies should be targeted to those most likely to benefit. In this Review, we highlight risk factors for disease progression and offer a stage-based treatment approach for patients with NAFLD.

Find AGA's NASH Clinical Care Pathway App for iOS and Android mobile devices at nash.gastro.org. Scan this QR code to be taken directly to the website. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming increasingly common, currently affecting approximately 37% of US adults. NAFLD is most often managed in primary care or endocrine clinics, where clinicians must determine which patients might benefit from secondary care to address hepatic manifestations, comorbid metabolic traits, and cardiovascular risks of the disease. Because NAFLD is largely asymptomatic, and because optimal timing of treatment depends on accurate staging of fibrosis risk, screening at the primary care level is critical, together with consistent, timely, evidence-based, widely accessible, and testable management processes. To achieve these goals, the American Gastroenterological Association assembled a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a Clinical Care Pathway providing explicit guidance on the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of NAFLD. This article describes the NAFLD Clinical Care Pathway they developed and provides a rationale supporting proposed steps to assist clinicians in diagnosing and managing NAFLD with clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2-F4) based on the best available evidence. This Pathway is intended to be applicable in any setting where care for patients with NAFLD is provided, including primary care, endocrine, obesity medicine, and gastroenterology practices.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^b69f329c]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease epidemiology and complications — Approximately 37% of adults in the United States have NAFLD, and as many as 70% of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have NAFLD. Between 2017–2018, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in US adults was estimated at 42.4%, and by 2030 approximately 1 in 2 adults is expected to have obesity. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can lead to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular cancer (HCC), and both NAFLD and NASH are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease–related mortality, and reduced health-related quality of life.

Screening of MASLD in children — Over the last decade, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other North American guidelines have consistently recommended screening for NAFLD and other cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight and obese children, age 9–10 years, due to the high prevalence in children and clear association with early morbidity and mortality; lifestyle modification has been shown to improve histological severity (resolution of NASH and/or improvement in fibrosis) in up to half of children; given the typical absence of pathognomonic signs or symptoms, the only method for detection is screening with noninvasive biomarkers; children may also be incidentally identified during routine laboratory tests or imaging.

NAFLD alcohol intake classification and monitoring — Alcohol use can be an important contributor to fatty liver disease progression and should be quantified in all patients, with intake classified as mild (up to 20 g (women) and 30 g (men) per day), moderate (21–39 g (women) and 31–59 g (men) per day), or heavy (≥ 40 g (women) and ≥ 60 g (men) per day); moderate alcohol use increases the probability of advanced fibrosis, particularly in patients with obesity or T2DM, heavy alcohol consumption accelerates liver injury and fibrosis progression and should be avoided in patients with NAFLD/NASH, and moderate alcohol use (defined broadly as > 20 g/d) has been associated with less improvement in steatosis and AST and lower odds of NASH resolution, with daily alcohol potentially increasing risks for extrahepatic malignancies and HCC and with substantial variability in individual susceptibility and uncertainty about dose thresholds, indicating that the impact of alcohol use characteristics on the natural history of NAFLD/NASH requires further investigation.

Transaminase interpretation — limitations and thresholds are noted: Serum AST levels are often used clinically but can be normal in patients with diabetes, NASH, and advanced hepatic fibrosis; although AST levels are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying NAFLD/NASH with advanced fibrosis, intermittently or chronically (≥ 6–12 mo) elevated ALT or AST above a threshold of 30 U/L may suggest the presence of chronic liver injury, with these thresholds exceeding many laboratory upper reference ranges.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a rapidly rising prevalence worldwide and is the most common cause of liver disease in developed countries. In this article, we discuss the spectrum of disease of NAFLD with a focus on the earlier spectrum of the disease that is commonly encountered by non-specialists, as well as the hepatic and extra-hepatic associations of the disease. We discuss in detail the two common presentations of NAFLD, incidentally detected hepatic steatosis and asymptomatic raised liver enzymes, and provide an algorithm for management and continued to follow up for these patients. Considerations for the management of cardiovascular comorbidities in these patients are also discussed. Finally, we cover the topic of screening for NAFLD in high-risk populations.

### Prevalence and risk factors of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, high-risk nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and fibrosis among lean United States adults: NHANES 2017–2020 [^3beab48e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recently published a clinical practice guidance for the diagnosis and management of NAFLD. Although routine general screening is not recommended, the AGA recommends screening for adults over 40 years of age with diabetes, as well as for lean individuals with metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It is notable that our multivariate regression analysis confirmed these risk factors by identifying age > 40 years, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes as significant predictors of lean NAFLD. Therefore, it is important to identify and treat these modifiable risk factors to prevent and manage lean NAFLD in affected individuals.

The present study also offers the first estimated prevalence of high-risk NASH among lean US adults. Using a FAST cutoffs of 0.35 and 0.67, we found the high-risk lean NASH prevalence to be 1.29% and 0.05%, respectively. A recent report from NHANES 2017–2018 using the FAST score found high-risk NASH in the general population to be 5.8% (cutoff 0.35) and 1.2% (cutoff 0.67). Given that NASH is a histologic diagnosis, most of the available estimates of NASH in lean adults come from studies with available liver biopsies. When Fracazani et al assessed the presence of NASH in lean individuals with biopsy-proven NAFLD they found it to be 17%. However, prior studies from lean adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD have found NASH prevalence to be as high as 50%. The meta-analysis conducted by Ye et al also revealed a notable prevalence of lobular inflammation, amounting to 25.1% in non-obese or lean individuals with NAFLD and available biopsies, confirming that, despite their apparent healthier phenotype, such patients may exhibit the complete range of histopathological characteristics of NASH.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs very commonly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with a prevalence of 55%–68%due to the often superimposable condition of insulin resistance. The degree of fibrosis represents the strongest predictor of liver-specific and all-cause mortalityand although most individuals with NAFLD do not reach the cirrhotic stage, patients with type 2 diabetes seem to progress faster and are at higher risk of steatohepatitis (NASH)and liver-related mortality. For these reasons, identifying individuals with, or at higher risk for advanced fibrosis among the large NAFLD population is clinically useful for the patient and challenging for the physician. With this purpose the EASL-EASD-EASO Guidelines recommend to routinely screen type 2 diabetes patients for the presence of NAFLD and to assess the presence of advanced fibrosis in high risk individuals. Another reason to identify patients with NAFLD is that beside its effect on the liver, a growing body of evidence showed that this condition is also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular (CVD) events, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetic microvascular complications such as nephropathy, retinopathyand sensitive-motorand autonomic neuropathy. In the present study our aim was: (1) to test the sustainability in terms of specialist referrals of the diagnostic flow-chart proposed by the EASL-EASD-EASO Guidelines using sequentially non-invasive biomarkers of steatosis and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes and (2) to explore the association of these biomarkers with CVD and CKD morbidity.

### Primary care and referring physician perspectives on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease management: a nationwide survey [^172aca0b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity which has directly translated into a rise in metabolic diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Within the United States, it is estimated that approximately one-third of adults have NAFLD. Among individuals with common metabolic conditions, the prevalence of NAFLD is even higher, with an estimated two-thirds of individuals with diabetes having underlying NAFLD. Currently, NAFLD is the second most common cause of cirrhosis and indication for liver transplant in the United States. Individuals with NAFLD are estimated to have 26% higher overall healthcare costs compared with individuals without NAFLD. A core challenge of managing patients with NAFLD is identifying the optimal strategy for screening, diagnosis, and management given the present treatment options, difficulties in uptake and sustainability of first-line treatment, and competing co-morbidities in individuals with NAFLD.

Screening individuals for NAFLD, even those at high risk for having NAFLD, is not currently recommended given limitations in diagnostic testing and treatment options, and prior studies suggesting the lack of evidence demonstrating long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening.NAFLD is commonly diagnosed incidentally when imaging shows evidence of fatty liver infiltration or presumptively when liver enzymes are elevated in the setting of metabolic risk factors. From a primary care provider (PCP) perspective, it is challenging to determine the best approach to managing patients with either suspected or confirmed NAFLD, given current treatment landscape. Because the presence of advanced fibrosis is associated with increased all-cause and liver-related mortality, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines state that non-invasive biomarkers like the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) or fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) can be used to help identify individuals at high risk for advanced fibrosis. As an alternative, transient elastography (TE) can also be used for this purpose. It is unclear to what extent PCPs use these methods and how useful these tools are in the real-world clinical practice. The ability to accurately identify NAFLD patients at high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is critically important, as most patients with NAFLD are asymptomatic and often patients remain undiagnosed until they present with decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

### Care standards for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the United Kingdom 2016: a cross-sectional survey [^d9625bf6]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines for the assessment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have been published in 2016 by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and European Associations for the study of the Liver-European Association for the study of Diabetes-European Association for the study of Obesity. Prior to publication of these guidelines, we performed a cross-sectional survey of gastroenterologists and hepatologists regarding NAFLD diagnosis and management.

Design

An online survey was circulated to members of British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology between February 2016 and May 2016.

Results

175 gastroenterologists/hepatologists responded, 116 completing the survey, representing 84 UK centres. 22% had local NAFLD guidelines. 45% received > 300 referrals per year from primary care for investigation of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). Clinical assessment tended to be performed in secondary rather than primary care including body mass index (82% vs 26%) and non-invasive liver screen (86% vs 32%) and ultrasound (81% vs 37%). Widely used tools for non-invasive fibrosis risk stratification were aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) ratio (53%), Fibroscan (50%) and NAFLD fibrosis score (41%). 78% considered liver biopsy in selected cases. 50% recommended 10% weight loss target as first-line treatment. Delivery of lifestyle interventions was mostly handed back to primary care (56%). A minority have direct access to community weight management services (22%). Follow-up was favoured by F3/4 fibrosis (72.9%), and high-risk non-invasive fibrosis tests (51%). Discharge was favoured by simple steatosis at biopsy (30%), and low-risk non-invasive scores (25%).

Conclusions

The survey highlights areas for improvement of service provision for NAFLD assessment including improved recognition of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in people with type 2 diabetes, streamlining abnormal LFT referral pathways, defining non-invasive liver fibrosis assessment tools, use of liver biopsy, managing metabolic syndrome features and improved access to lifestyle interventions.

Management of chronic liver disease

Secondary care follow-up for patients with NAFLD

Patients with NAFLD who are at risk for development of liver-related complications include those with cirrhosis and significant-advanced fibrosis. These patients need to be managed in a secondary care setting, akin to those with other aetiologies. Regular surveillance of patients with cirrhosis with 6-monthly ultrasound is one of the quality standards laid down by NICEand allows early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and prompt treatment, which can improve the individual's survival. Regular monitoring also allows early detection and treatment of liver-related complications such as ascites, varices and hepatic encephalopathy and appropriate referral for liver transplantation once clinical thresholds are met. The process should be individualized wherein those with significant co-morbidities and poor performance status are counselled against active monitoring.

Individuals with NASH who have significant (F2), advanced fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) are at risk of progression to end stage liver disease and potential complications in the medium to long-term. Therefore, secondary care follow up may be appropriate for these individuals to consider specific treatment for NASH or investigational drugs. Accordingly, we suggest that people with NAFLD who are at significantly increased risk of disease progression and potential risk of liver related complications should continue to be managed in the secondary care setting. Such patients include those with cirrhosis or significant-advanced fibrosis whose liver disease is not outweighed by comorbidities or performance status. (Recommendation 25, Table 1)

Liver transplantation

Patients with decompensated liver disease caused by NAFLD should be considered for transplant assessment (Recommendation 26, Table 1). This includes patients with jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, or hepatocellular carcinoma within the accepted UK liver transplant criteria. Factors that may influence the decision to refer for assessment include the presence of life-limiting comorbidities or recent (within 5 years) extrahepatic malignancy (except skin) that would be contraindications to transplantation.

Management of cardio-metabolic risk factors

Hypertension

NAFLD is strongly associated with an increased risk of hypertension. Approximately 50% of patients with hypertension have NAFLD and correspondingly the prevalence of hypertension is significantly higher in patients with NAFLD, independently of other cardio-metabolic risk factors. In addition to lifestyle advice, pharmacological therapy should be offered to all patients, with the aim of optimising blood pressure and thereby reducing cardiovascular risk. We recommend that patients with hypertension should be managed in accordance with NICE guidelines (Recommendation 27, Table 1).

### A simple test to identify the risk of NASH and cirrhosis in people with obesity or diabetes: the time to screen is now [^1fcbdafd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The term "nonalcoholic fatty liver disease" involves a broad spectrum of disease, ranging from hepatic steatosis (only) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, in the absence of ongoing or recent consumption of significant amounts of alcohol or the presence of secondary causes of fatty liver disease. It is also associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The condition is more common in certain high-risk groups, such as those with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or in the presence of elevated plasma aminotransferases or steatosis on imaging. Early screening and risk stratification for advanced liver fibrosis in such groups is critical in primary care and endocrinology clinics to prevent future cirrhosis. While the best screening approach remains unclear, most noncommercial panels using a combination of clinical features [age, body mass index (BMI), presence of diabetes] with routine chemistries [ie, fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI), BARD] are inexpensive, simple, and have a good negative predictive value (NPV) to rule out advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. While historically FIB-4 and NFS have been the 2 most broadly tested, recent consensus statements recommend risk stratifying for clinically significant fibrosis (≥ F2) in primary care and endocrinology clinics with the FIB-4 index. This index calculates the risk of hepatic fibrosis from the computation of age, plasma aminotransferases [AST and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], and platelet count. While it has similar limitations of other diagnostic panels such as NFS, APRI, and BARD [in particular, modest positive predictive value (PPV)] and an indeterminate zone between its low and high probability of disease, recent studies provide robust evidence that FIB-4 predicts future liver outcomes, such as cirrhosis and even of hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, the NFS is considered to misclassify more the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis in people with obesity and T2DM. The performance of FIB-4 may be improved in patients with T2DM by using a higher cutoff (≥ 1.67 vs > 1.3) that reduces the indeterminate zone by about half, decreasing the need for specialist referral. However, larger validation studies are needed. The challenge remains on whether these inexpensive panels can be optimized (ie, NFS) for fibrosis risk stratification and which is the best test to follow an initial FIB-4 testing.
