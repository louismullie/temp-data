## Question

Interval hepatomegaly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "interval hepatomegaly", including what it means, how to think about it diagnostically, and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the term and clarifying whether it reflects a change over time versus a static finding. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where "interval" is commonly used and why it matters. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline a staged diagnostic approach. After that, I need to consider special populations and red flags that change urgency. Finally, I will synthesize management principles and follow-up intervals, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "interval hepatomegaly" is not a standard disease entity; rather, it signals a change in liver size between two time points, typically detected on serial imaging or examination, and it should prompt a search for an underlying cause rather than be treated as a diagnosis itself [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the clinical contexts where "interval" is most often used. In oncology and transplant follow-up, "interval change" language is routine to flag new or evolving findings that may reflect disease progression, treatment toxicity, or complications, so "interval hepatomegaly" in those settings usually triggers expedited evaluation and possible modification of therapy [^notfound].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, but I need to ensure I organize it by mechanism and likelihood. Infiltrative and malignant causes include metastases, lymphoma, and primary liver tumors, where hepatomegaly can be an early sign of progression; vascular and congestive causes include right-sided heart failure, Budd-Chiari, and Fontan-related congestion; metabolic and storage diseases such as Gaucher, glycogen storage diseases, and NASH/MASLD can present with progressive enlargement; infectious etiologies like schistosomiasis, malaria, and visceral leishmaniasis can cause persistent or evolving organomegaly; and drug-induced injury, including nucleoside analogs and asparaginase, can produce hepatomegaly with steatosis or SOS/VOD, sometimes with delayed onset [^73fedff1] [^a0a6dea1] [^3c1b5e35] [^ee19056d] [^f764ec68] [^377531e1] [^85ac3cc3] [^3383f6c9].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't miss time-sensitive complications. The initial workup should confirm the finding with repeat imaging and quantify the change, obtain directed history including oncologic history, travel, and medications, and order targeted labs such as liver chemistries, viral hepatitis serologies, metabolic panels, and tumor markers when appropriate; imaging should start with ultrasound to assess echotexture, vessels, and spleen, and escalate to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI if malignancy is suspected or if ultrasound is nondiagnostic; in selected cases, elastography can help assess fibrosis, and biopsy may be needed if the etiology remains unclear after noninvasive testing [^d6a25fc0] [^7ec45ea9] [^05342e3c] [^6a1d9f8f].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has a specific syndrome? I should double-check pediatric and special-population nuances. In children, inborn errors of metabolism and cystic fibrosis–related liver disease are key considerations, and guidelines emphasize early recognition of hepatomegaly with persistent enzyme abnormalities and the use of elastography to stage fibrosis; in Fontan physiology, increasing liver volume correlates with adverse outcomes, so interval enlargement warrants cardiology input; in refugees from endemic regions, persistent splenomegaly and hepatomegaly may reflect ongoing malaria or schistosomiasis and require targeted antiparasitic therapy and follow-up [^ad3fa06d] [^ed84bfdd] [^6525377d] [^f2c309af].

> I need to ensure I flag red flags that mandate urgent action. New painful hepatomegaly with jaundice and weight gain raises concern for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, particularly after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or asparaginase exposure; rapidly enlarging liver with systemic symptoms suggests infiltrative malignancy; and hepatomegaly with lactic acidosis or steatosis in the setting of nucleoside analogs requires immediate drug cessation and supportive care [^6947c936] [^3383f6c9] [^85ac3cc3].

> Let me reconsider management principles so they are practical and evidence-aligned. Management is cause-specific: treat the underlying disease, stop offending drugs, and provide supportive care; in oncology or transplant follow-up, interval hepatomegaly may alter therapy intensity or prompt restaging; in chronic liver disease, monitor for complications such as portal hypertension and varices; and in children, coordinate with pediatric hepatology for metabolic testing and longitudinal surveillance, including periodic imaging where indicated [^5d98d6c3] [^ad3fa06d] [^079b259a].

> Next, I should review follow-up intervals, but I need to tailor them to the etiology and acuity. For new-onset or unexplained interval hepatomegaly, repeat imaging in 4–6 weeks is reasonable to confirm persistence and trajectory; for known chronic liver disease, ultrasound every 6–12 months is typical; for cystic fibrosis, consensus supports abdominal ultrasound every 2 years through adolescence; and for HCC surveillance in at-risk patients, ultrasound with or without AFP every 6 months is recommended, with earlier cross-sectional imaging for nodules ≥ 10 mm [^079b259a] [^4b1c0f5f].

> In summary, I should confirm that "interval hepatomegaly" is a change-in-size signal that demands a structured, mechanism-based workup rather than reassurance. By correlating history, labs, and imaging, and by escalating to tissue diagnosis when needed, we can identify treatable causes early and avoid missing high-stakes entities like SOS, infiltrative malignancy, or metabolic disease, with follow-up cadence matched to the underlying diagnosis and risk profile [^d6a25fc0] [^6a1d9f8f].

Interval hepatomegaly refers to a **new or increased liver size** detected on serial imaging or examination, indicating progression or emergence of underlying disease. It is not a diagnosis but a **red flag** that warrants prompt evaluation for causes such as malignancy, infection, metabolic disease, or drug toxicity [^b599e49e] [^73fedff1]. Management is cause-specific: obtain targeted labs, imaging, and consider biopsy if the etiology remains unclear [^d6a25fc0] [^6a1d9f8f]; monitor closely for complications and treat the underlying condition to reverse or stabilize hepatomegaly [^notfound].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Interval hepatomegaly denotes a **new or increased liver size** on serial assessment, signaling disease progression or a new process. It is a **clinically significant change** that should trigger evaluation for underlying causes and potential complications, including liver failure, portal hypertension, and malignancy [^b599e49e].

---

## Common causes of interval hepatomegaly

Interval hepatomegaly has a broad differential; **key categories and examples** include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Malignancy | - Hepatocellular carcinoma <br/> - Metastatic disease <br/> - Lymphoma [^c7e2354b] [^f6163987] |
| Infectious | - Hepatitis B/C <br/> - Malaria <br/> - Schistosomiasis <br/> - Tuberculosis <br/> - Visceral leishmaniasis [^aa61921e] [^a516e445] [^f764ec68] [^f2f49b77] [^377531e1] |
| Metabolic/genetic | - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis <br/> - Glycogen storage diseases <br/> - Gaucher disease <br/> - Hemochromatosis [^ee19056d] [^3c1b5e35] [^a0a6dea1] [^279ff993] |
| Vascular/congestive | - Right-sided heart failure <br/> - Budd-Chiari syndrome <br/> - Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome [^6525377d] [^6947c936] |
| Drug-induced | - Nucleoside analogs (e.g. tenofovir, entecavir) <br/> - Nevirapine <br/> - Asparaginase [^85ac3cc3] [^24713f37] [^3383f6c9] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm hepatomegaly**: Repeat imaging (ultrasound, CT, or MRI) to verify size change and characterize liver parenchyma, vessels, and lesions [^b7df840e].
- **Laboratory evaluation**: Liver function tests, viral hepatitis serologies, metabolic panels, autoimmune markers, and tumor markers (AFP, CA 19–9) as indicated [^d6a25fc0].
- **Imaging**: Use ultrasound for initial assessment; CT/MRI for characterization of masses, vascular abnormalities, or diffuse disease [^7ec45ea9].
- **Biopsy**: Consider if malignancy, infiltrative disease, or unclear etiology persists after noninvasive evaluation [^6a1d9f8f].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Interval hepatomegaly reflects **active disease** and may herald complications such as:

- **Liver failure**: Synthetic dysfunction, coagulopathy, encephalopathy [^notfound].
- **Portal hypertension**: Ascites, varices, splenomegaly [^d7e523b9].
- **Malignancy**: Progression or new primary/secondary tumors [^c7e2354b].
- **Systemic effects**: Fatigue, jaundice, nutritional impairment, growth failure in children [^c27680af].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Malignancy**: Oncologic therapy, surgical resection, transplant evaluation [^d95ad21a].
- **Infection**: Pathogen-specific therapy (e.g. antivirals, antiparasitics) [^f2c309af].
- **Metabolic disease**: Dietary therapy, enzyme replacement, iron removal [^c504a455] [^a0a6dea1] [^279ff993].
- **Drug-induced injury**: Immediate cessation of offending agent and supportive care [^85ac3cc3] [^3383f6c9].
- **Supportive care**: Manage complications (ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy) and monitor liver function [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause, reversibility, and treatment response**. Benign or reversible etiologies (e.g. drug-induced, infectious) may resolve with therapy, whereas malignant or advanced fibrotic disease carries poorer outcomes and may require transplant or palliative care [^d95ad21a].

---

Interval hepatomegaly signals a **significant change in liver size** and mandates a focused search for underlying causes. A structured workup — imaging, labs, and selective biopsy — guides therapy, and close monitoring is essential to address complications and improve outcomes.

### Fetal hepatomegaly: causes and associations [^d28dc65b]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Fetal hepatomegaly is associated with significant fetal morbidity and mortality. However, hepatomegaly might be overlooked when numerous other fetal anomalies are present, or it might not be noticed when it is an isolated entity. As the largest solid organ in the abdomen, the liver can be seen well with US or MRI, and the normal imaging characteristics are well described. The length of the fetal liver, which can be used to identify hepatomegaly, can be determined by measuring the liver from the diaphragm to the tip of the right lobe in the sagittal plane. Fetal hepatomegaly is seen with infection, transient abnormal myelopoiesis, liver storage and deposition diseases, some syndromes, large liver tumors, biliary atresia, and anemia. Some of these diagnoses are treatable during the fetal period. Attention to the associated findings and specific hepatic and nonhepatic imaging characteristics can help facilitate more accurate diagnoses and appropriate patient counseling. © RSNA, 2020.

### Retrospective evaluation of the Dutch pre-newborn screening cohort for propionic acidemia and isolated methylmalonic acidemia: what to aim, expect, and evaluate from newborn screening? [^48fef9fd]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

In NBS cohorts, patients in whom the disease is mild and who would not become symptomatic during infancy, could be detected as has been reported in Japan, where a 10 times higher incidence of PA was found during preparatory studies for NBS implementation. 21 These mildly affected patients will probably be treated according to the current treatment guidelines, 19 inducing a risk for developing treatment‐related complications. One could advocate that these patients should not be treated in order to prevent treatment‐related complications. However, in our cohort, two PA patients presented at 48 and 56 years of age with cardiomyopathy as first presenting symptom, 22 indicating that even in very mild, untreated patients, mitochondrial complications can still occur. It is presently unknown whether earlier initiation of adequate treatment could have prevented this complication. Even if this would alter the clinical course, it is questionable whether these patients should be exposed to life‐long protein restriction, to prevent complications occurring well into adulthood. We consider overtreatment of mildly affected patients, which might or might not develop late complications, 21, 22 a serious risk of NBS.

4.3 Lessons learned from the pre‐NBS cohort, to guide follow‐up of NBS cohorts

We demonstrated that mitochondrial complications with acute onset can already develop before monitoring should be initiated according to recent guidelines 19 and we thus propose to adapt these guidelines. Specifically, we suggest to assess renal function in patients with MUT and MMAB type MMA from 1 year of age, to regularly check QTc intervals in PA and MMA patients starting at birth, and to maintain yearly cardiac ultrasounds and ophthalmologic assessments from 6 years onwards. Importantly, as we demonstrate that hepatomegaly is associated with the occurrence of other acute onset mitochondrial complications later in life, we advise to perform physical examination to check for hepatomegaly during every outpatient visit starting at birth, to be able to study the relevance of this finding. Lastly, we advocate awareness of all complications assessed in this cohort, including rarely described complications as exercise intolerance, acute psychosis, premature ovarian failure, pes planovalgus, gout, and urolithiasis.

### Prognostic factors for patients with hepatic metastases from breast cancer [^f1fd698c]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Factors adversely affecting prognosis include: jaundice, deranged liver function tests, ascites, palpable hepatomegaly, poor performance status and disease confined to the liver. The interval between primary presentation and metastatic disease is an important predictor of survival in bone metastases but may not be important in liver metastases. The tumour marker CA15-3 is often higher in patients who do poorly, but is not reported to be an independent predictor of survival. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) has not been previously studied in this respect although it is recognised as useful in monitoring disease progression.

The influence of disease pattern, both outside the liver and within the liver has received little attention. Two studies suggest that extrahepatic disease may impair survival, but there are no data on the prognostic significance of disease distribution within the liver.

This study has examined the cases of all patients presenting in the last 5 years to a single breast unit with metastatic breast cancer involving the liver at metastatic diagnosis. Survival from the time of metastatic diagnosis was compared with primary disease information, patient characteristics and pattern of metastatic disease in an attempt to establish factors predicting outcome. It is hoped that these prognostic factors may be of benefit in tailoring treatment to avoid toxicity to patients with only a short life expectancy for whom palliative support would be most appropriate.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C testing among perinatally exposed infants and children-United States, 2023 [^aa61921e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Features and Natural History of Perinatally Acquired HCV Infection

Among children with perinatally acquired HCV infection, spontaneous clearance of infection (i.e. resolution of the infection without treatment resulting in undetectable virus) typically occurs in 20%–40% of children by age 5 years (,–). However, a recent study analyzed data from three prospective studies, accounting for interval censoring and left-truncated data, to evaluate HCV RNA clearance more precisely by age. Among 106 infants aged < 36 months with current infection included in the analysis, 57.3% cleared by age 3 years and 65.9% cleared by age 5 years. Clearance is associated with sustained undetectable HCV RNA; viral RNA levels are initially high and then slowly decline. Antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) typically persists for life but can wane over time.

Limited studies have evaluated long-term outcomes among children perinatally infected with HCV. One of the largest studies was a cohort of 266 children infected perinatally and followed prospectively through a median age of 4.2 years (range: 3.2 months to 15.9 years). Children were recruited from 30 European Paediatric HCV Network centers and were considered infected if they had ≥ 2 positive nucleic acid tests (NATs) for HCV RNA or a positive anti-HCV test at age ≥ 18 months. In this study, 10% of children had hepatomegaly, which was found to be associated with elevated alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) levels. Among the children with hepatomegaly, the study estimated median age at first diagnosis to be 7.1 months, with approximately 13% of children developing hepatomegaly by age 5 years and approximately 28% by age 10 years. Among the infected cohort, approximately 20% of children cleared the infection (median age: 14.9 months), 50% had chronic asymptomatic infection, and 30% had chronic active infection (i.e. persistent viremia with or without hepatomegaly and elevated ALT). Another prospective study of 45 children infected perinatally found that all children were asymptomatic for liver disease; however, 11 children had evidence of mild-to-moderate fibrosis. In addition, autoimmune phenomena, including nonorgan-specific autoantibodies, cryoglobulinemia, low C4 levels, and persistent proteinuria were also found among perinatally infected children.

### A rare cause of severe hepatomegaly with an improving outcome [^eab6b42d]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 43-year-old man presented with dyspnoea, 15 kg weight loss, severe hepatomegaly and alkaline phosphatase at 5400 U/L. Examinations seemed to suggest cirrhosis, but blood samples did not show any signs of underlying liver disease. Liver biopsy revealed amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis and bone marrow showed multiple myeloma (MM). The patient was treated with drugs of choice cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone. He responded well to the treatment and so far achieved partial response. Previously MM was associated with poor prognosis but due to improved treatment for AL the patient can achieve a progression-free period with good quality of life.

### Epidemiology of gaucher disease in France: trends in incidence, mortality, management, and complications over three decades [^80b9c4e8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding their manifestations at diagnosis, 244/261 (93%) of patients had splenomegaly, and 171/233 (73%) clinical hepatomegaly; 84/426 (20%) had chronic bone pain. The median platelet count was 94 g/L (63–125).

The genotype was known for 251 (56%) of the patients, with a majority of patients having at least one p. Asn409Ser allele (90%), of whom 53 (21%) were homozygous, and 16 (6.4%) patients had the p. Leu483Pro/p. Leu483Pro genotype, exclusively type 3 GD.

The median time (IQR) from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of GD was 0.6 years (0.0–2.7) with a maximum delay of 56.6 years. Several diagnoses were made in the absence of symptoms, notably through family screening. This interval significantly decreased over time, with a median (min‐max) of 5.4 (0.0–56.6) years before 2000, 3.0 (0.0–30.7) between 2000 and 2010, 2.7 (0.0–25.5) between 2010 and 2020, and 0.8 (0.0–3.5) after 2020 (p = 0.001).

### Elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Stribild) [^85ac3cc3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

STRIBILD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients.

Prior to initiation and during use of STRIBILD, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. Discontinue STRIBILD in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome. Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Although cobicistat (a component of STRIBILD) may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety.

The emtricitabine and TDF components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidney. STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute as dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and TDF cannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5.3	Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including TDF and emtricitabine, components of STRIBILD, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with STRIBILD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^5a3721d5]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

When should liver blood tests be checked?

There are a range of settings where requesting liver blood tests should be considered to determine the presence, or severity, of liver disease:

Non-specific symptoms

Liver disease tends to develop silently with no signs or symptoms, and there is evidence that the majority of people with late-stage liver disease are undiagnosed. However, inflammatory liver diseases including autoimmune liver disease and viral hepatitis can be associated with symptoms. For example, 75% of patients with AIH have one or more non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea or anorexia. These diseases can be effectively treated, and are often diagnosed late, so the presence of these non-specific symptoms would be an indication to check routine liver blood tests, accepting that there are many other causes for these symptoms.

Evidence of chronic liver disease

Patients with symptoms or signs of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or liver failure, including ascites, peripheral oedema, spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly, need liver blood tests to monitor their function. In that regard the inclusion of INR is important to fully define their synthetic function.

Conditions which are associated with a high risk of developing liver disease

Autoimmune liver disease is more common in patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases, and liver blood tests may be appropriate if clinical symptoms change to suggest development of liver disease — for example, pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) have a particular notable risk of developing the autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis; disease prevalence is estimated at just under 10%. Primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased complications relating to liver disease, as well as increased colorectal cancer risk. Periodic monitoring of liver blood tests is therefore common practice, with a low clinical threshold for investigation of cholestatic liver blood tests by MRI. In the absence of currently approved medical therapy ongoing efforts clinically focus on early recognition of disease with subsequent risk stratification, in order to facilitate timely consideration of trial-based intervention.

### Emtricitabine, rilpivirine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^a4b6107a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.7 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and other drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Contraindications (4), and Drug Interactions (7)]:

Loss of therapeutic effect of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and possible development of resistance due to reduced exposure to RPV.
Possible clinically significant adverse reaction from greater exposures of components of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets.

In healthy subjects, 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily doses of RPV (3 times and 12 times the dose in emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. Consider alternatives to emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets when coadministered with a drug that is known to have a risk of Torsade de Pointes [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablet therapy and review concomitant medications during emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablet therapy.

5.8 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including TDF and FTC, components of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Hepatotoxicity and Skin Reactions

Inform patients of the possibility of severe liver disease or skin reactions associated with nevirapine that may result in death. Instruct patients developing signs or symptoms of liver disease or severe skin reactions to discontinue nevirapine and seek medical attention immediately, including performance of laboratory monitoring. Symptoms of liver disease include fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. Symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions include rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis.

Intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring, including liver enzymes, is essential during the first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine to detect potentially life- threatening hepatotoxicity and skin reactions. However, liver disease can occur after this period; therefore, monitoring should continue at frequent intervals throughout nevirapine treatment. Extra vigilance is warranted during the first 6 weeks of therapy, which is the period of greatest risk of hepatic events. Advise patients with signs and symptoms of hepatitis to discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately. If nevirapine is discontinued due to hepatotoxicity, do not restart it. Patients, particularly women, with increased CD4+cell count at initiation of nevirapine therapy (greater than 250 cells/mm³in women and greater than 400 cells/mm³in men) are at substantially higher risk for development of symptomatic hepatic events, often associated with rash. Advise patients that co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminases at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.7	Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions

The concomitant use of COMPLERA and other drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Contraindications (4), and Drug Interactions (7)]:

Loss of therapeutic effect of COMPLERA and possible development of resistance due to reduced exposure to RPV.
Possible clinically significant adverse reaction from greater exposures of components of COMPLERA.

In healthy subjects, 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily doses of RPV (3 times and 12 times the dose in COMPLERA) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. Consider alternatives to COMPLERA when coadministered with a drug that is known to have a risk of Torsade de Pointes [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during COMPLERA therapy and review concomitant medications during COMPLERA therapy.

5.8	Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including TDF and FTC, components of COMPLERA, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with COMPLERA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).

5.9	Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including the components of COMPLERA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

### Does this patient have malaria? [^a516e445]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Malaria commonly infects residents of and travelers to tropical regions. The clinical features of infection are notoriously nonspecific but have not been comprehensively evaluated.

Objective

To systematically review and synthesize data related to the predictive value of clinical findings for the diagnosis of malaria in endemic areas and in travelers returning from endemic areas.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

The databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1950-July 2010) were searched to identify studies published in the English language of endemic and "imported" (acquired during travel) malaria. Additional studies were identified from reference lists. Studies were included that had patients suspected of having acute malaria (usually because of fever) and compared the presence or absence of clinical findings with blood smear confirmation. Two authors independently identified studies, appraised study quality, and extracted data on the patient population, outcome assessment, and clinical findings. Differences between reviewers were resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen studies for endemic malaria were identified that met review criteria. Individual symptoms are of limited diagnostic utility but presence of splenomegaly (summary likelihood ratio [LR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–4.7) or hepatomegaly (summary LR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6–3.6) make malaria more likely. Combinations of findings can affect the likelihood of malaria, but their performance varies by setting. Seven studies of imported malaria were identified. The presence of fever (LR, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.9–5.3), splenomegaly (summary LR, 6.5; 95% CI, 3.9–11.0), hyperbilirubinemia (LR, 7.3; 95% CI, 5.5–9.6), or thrombocytopenia (summary LR, 5.6; 95% CI, 4.1–7.5) make malaria more likely.

Conclusions

In endemic areas, the likelihood of malaria is increased by the presence of splenomegaly and hepatomegaly but individual findings are of limited utility and cannot reliably exclude malaria; combinations of findings may be useful to stratify risk in patients. In returning travelers, the clinical assessment can provide substantial diagnostic benefit, although all patients still require laboratory testing because malaria can be rapidly fatal.

### Shortness of breath in a 38-year-old woman with pulmonary and hepatic nodules [^e7d33807]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 38-year-old African American woman with a history of menometrorrhagia on previous estrogen therapy and a previously biopsied benign thyroid nodule with recent interval enlargement presented with symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion, an intermittent nonproductive cough, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain for 1 year. She denied wheezing, hemoptysis, fevers, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss. Socially, the patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and denied alcohol or drug use. Travel history was not significant, and she had no contributory occupational, environmental, or animal exposures. Recent cancer screening that included Papanicolaou smear and mammography were negative for neoplasia. Vital signs were normal, and ambulatory pulse oximetry did not demonstrate evidence of oxygen desaturation. Physical examination demonstrated normal respiratory effort, diffuse vesicular breath sounds, and a soft abdomen without hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant tenderness.

### Retrospective evaluation of the Dutch pre-newborn screening cohort for propionic acidemia and isolated methylmalonic acidemia: what to aim, expect, and evaluate from newborn screening? [^54914898]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Mitochondrial complications were comparable among sibling pairs (similar in 1, better in 4, and worse in 4) (Table S1). LO patients were significantly more frequently recorded to have only mild mitochondrial complications than EO patients (Table 2 and Figure S1). PA patients had more very severe mitochondrial complications than MMA patients (Table S7), and all of these PA patients were EO patients (EO 53%, LO 0%, P = 0.019). Among MMA patients, mitochondrial complications were comparable between EO and LO patients but the prevalence of moderate to very severe mitochondrial complications was significantly higher in vitamin B12 unresponsive patients (unresponsive 63%, responsive 24%, P = 0.016).

EO for PA and vitamin B12 unresponsiveness for MMA were also found to be significantly associated with a higher risk for mitochondrial complications with acute onset (Figure 3). In addition, EO in PA tended to be associated with the occurrence of hepatomegaly, prolonged QTc interval, psychoses, and sensorineural hearing loss (Figure S2). Vitamin B12 unresponsiveness tended to be associated with the occurrence of optic atrophy, pancreatitis and prolonged QTc interval in MMA, and was significantly associated with the occurrence of renal failure (Figure S3). One of the first occurring mitochondrial complications with acute onset was hepatomegaly (Figure 2). Intriguingly, hepatomegaly was significantly associated with the onset of other mitochondrial complications with acute onset later in life, for PA and MMA as a group and for both PA and MMA separately (Figure 3).

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^64a525be]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

We report a case of a man presenting with an unexplained fever, pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly without lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow flow cytometry strongly suggested hepatosplenic γδ T-cell lymphoma and infiltration of bone marrow samples by pathological T-lymphocytes confirmed the diagnosis. Despite chemotherapy the patient died 1 year after diagnosis. This is a rare disease that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hepatosplenomegaly especially when it presents with B-symptoms and no lymph node enlargement. There is no standard therapy and the prognosis is poor.

### Toluene inhalant addiction and cardiac functions in young adults: a comparison of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters [^56734969]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

A second case of cardiomyopathy resulting from toluene exposure has been reported from Poland. In this case, atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure were diagnosed. The ejection fraction was initially at 15%, but it increased to 45% after treatment and cessation of exposure. Vural et al. presented a case of dilated cardiomyopathy in a 21‐year‐old male patient who had been intermittently using toluene for 10 years. The patient complained of exertional dyspnea, easy fatigue, abdominal distension, and an irregular pulse. Tests showed an incomplete right bundle branch block on the ECG, hepatomegaly, left ventricular dilatation, and global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 40%. Follow‐up at 6 months after heart failure treatment indicated an improvement in pathological findings.

The QT interval serves as a measure of cardiac depolarization and repolarization. QT and QTc intervals are also significant determinants of clinical morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a comprehensive examination of factors influencing the QT interval is of great importance. Numerous factors can influence QT and QTc intervals, as well as QT and QTc dispersion. Several anthropometric and autonomic factors affecting the QT interval have been identified, both in childhood and adulthood. It has been revealed that these factors can lead to notable changes and differences in the QT interval, even in the absence of metabolic diseases or electrolyte imbalances. Many studies have reported conflicting results. Age is a prominent factor under scrutiny. While some studies have demonstrated a lengthening of the QT interval and an increase in QTc dispersion with age, others have indicated that age may not have a significant impact. Studies have shown an inverse relationship between age and QTc in children, and in the adult population, gender has been identified as the significant factor in the relationship between age and the QT interval. All studies related to gender have consistently demonstrated that the QT interval is longer in females, and consequently, women are at a higher risk than men in clinical conditions such as long QT syndrome triggered by drugs. The contribution of hormonal factors to gender differences has also been explored. In our study, both the patient and control groups comprised young adult individuals. The QTc interval was within normal limits in the control group. Due to the limited number of female participants, an evaluation based on gender was not performed.

### Fetal hepatomegaly… [^d6750209]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old gravida 3, para 1-0-1-1 woman had an unexpected, short interval pregnancy detected at 10 weeks' gestation while taking oral contraceptive pills. The pregnancy was notable for maternal Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, and gestational diabetes, treated pharmacologically with infliximab infusions every 8 weeks, levothyroxine, and insulin, respectively. At 16 weeks' gestation, she met with her gastroenterologist about management of Crohn's disease during pregnancy and was counseled that the literature to date did not show an increased risk of birth defects or adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with infliximab use during pregnancy. Thus, this anti–tumor necrosis factor α therapy was continued.

Routine prenatal laboratory tests included sequential screening, with the risk of trisomies 21 and 18 being less than 1 in 10, 000; blood type A, Rh positive, antibody screen negative; hepatitis B surface antigen negative; human immunodeficiency negative; rapid plasma reagin nonreactive; rubella immune; gonorrhea and chlamydia negative; and group.

### NASPGHAN guidelines for training in pediatric gastroenterology [^c27680af]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN hepatology training — importance and medical knowledge emphasize that because diseases of the liver and biliary tract have a significant impact on children, trainees in pediatric gastroenterology should have comprehensive exposure to the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders, their complications, and their pathophysiology; trainees should understand the normal structure and function of the liver and biliary tree and the prevalence, natural history, age-appropriate differential diagnoses, and genetic and other risk factors of hepatobiliary disorders; caring for children with hepatobiliary disease requires understanding of both common and rare causes including infectious, metabolic, genetic, anatomic, immunologic, and toxic; trainees should understand varying clinical manifestations including issues unique to pediatric hepatobiliary disorders (eg, effects on growth, nutrition, puberty, psychosocial functioning); and trainees also should have a complete understanding of diagnostic criteria that distinguish liver and biliary diseases with common patterns of presentation (eg, cholestasis, neonatal cholestasis, elevated aminotransferases, hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, acute liver failure, direct or indirect hyperbilirubinemia, ascites) including differences in affected populations, results of laboratory evaluations, histopathology, radiologic studies, and disease course.

### Exposure to malaria affects the regression of hepatosplenomegaly after treatment for schistosoma mansoni infection in Kenyan children [^f764ec68]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The effects of praziquantel treatment on hepatomegaly in this cohort were more subtle. There was gradual decline in the prevalence of hepatomegaly after praziquantel treatment indicating that the removal of S. mansoni infection was a critical factor for improvement. However, upon analysing hepatomegaly data across sectors, it emerged that children from the sector with relatively high anti-Pfs IgG3 responses, but relatively low S. mansoni egg counts, had the lowest rate of regression. A possible explanation of this observation is that an aetiological agent other than S. mansoni was responsible for the observed hepatomegaly. A likely candidate is malaria infection. Enlargement of the liver in acute malaria infection is temporary and recedes rapidly after treatment; however, studies of young children in Gambia have shown that repeated infection with malaria, perhaps when combined with other unidentified factors, can lead to the development of chronically enlarged livers. Our observations suggest that even if school-aged children are examined outside the malaria transmission season, they may still be affected by hepatomegaly attributable to malariainfection.

Children from the sector with relatively low exposure to both infections experienced a significant decrease in liver enlargement along the mid sternal line when baseline data were compared with data from the third year follow-up. It is possible that hepatomegaly in these children was attributable to neither S. mansoni nor malaria infection. Alternatively, because they were relatively lightly infected with S. mansoni, and experienced relatively low exposure to malaria infection, it is possible that they were more likely to regress in terms of hepatomegaly within the follow-up period.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^376f0048]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

An increased incidence of mild hepatotoxicity in early trials usually results in heightened screening to detect and evaluate liver injury during phase 3 testing.

To make this distinction, it is important to. 7 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations is intended to be prescribed or marketed to such patients after approval, they should be enrolled in controlled trials.

For drugs being studied with short treatment courses, both baseline and post-treatment liver enzyme testing should be performed, since there may be a gap between the end of treatment and the onset. no sign of liver injury after a reasonable length of exposure, the monitoring interval can be increased to once every 2 to 3 months.

Cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD) definitions — published criteria are summarized across multiple sources. Colombo 2002 considers CFLD if at least 2 conditions are present on at least 2 consecutive examinations spanning a 1-year period, including clinical hepatomegaly with the liver edge palpable more than 2 cm below the costal margin and abnormal serum liver enzyme levels consisting of elevation above the upper normal limits of 2 of AST, ALT, and GGT, or ultrasound abnormalities other than hepatomegaly. Debray 2011 states diagnosis of CFLD should be considered if 2 or more categories are present, including hepatomegaly > 2 cm below the costal margin and increased transaminases and GGT in at least 3 consecutive determinations over 12 months. Flass 2013 includes persistent AST, ALT, GGT > 2 times upper limit of normal. Koh 2017 lists criteria such as at least 2 persistently abnormal ALT, AST, GGT, or ALP and transient elastography or FibroScan® at > 90th centile, with persistently abnormal defined as abnormalities on multiple dates over at least 2 consecutive years.

### Morbidity associated with schistosomiasis before and after treatment in young children in rusinga island, Western Kenya [^cdfbcfc1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Schistosoma mansoni infection is a major cause of organomegaly and ultimately liver fibrosis in adults. Morbidity in pre-school-aged children is less defined, and they are currently not included in mass drug administration (MDA) programs for schistosomiasis control. We report results of a study of the association of schistosomiasis with organomegaly in a convenience sample of 201 children under 7 years old in Rusinga, Kenya on two cross-sectional visits, before and after praziquantel treatment. Data included stool examination and serology for schistosomiasis, the Niamey ultrasound protocol to stage hepatosplenic morbidity including organomegaly, and potential confounders including malaria. Unadjusted and adjusted Poisson regressions were performed. The baseline prevalence of schistosomiasis by antibody and/or stool was 80.3%. Schistomiasis was associated with hepatomegaly (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0–2.1) and splenomegaly (aPR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.2–3.7). The association with hepatomegaly persisted posttreatment (aPR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.6). Schistosomiasis was associated with morbidity in this cohort.

Approximately 40% of children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who respond to initial therapy subsequently relapse. Multidimensional flow cytometry employing a standardized panel of monoclonal antibodies enables the detection of small numbers of occult leukemic cells that persist during therapy using technology adaptable by most clinical laboratories. We performed a prospective, blinded evaluation of bone marrow specimens obtained from 252 pediatric patients with de novo AML to determine whether detection of occult leukemia defined as more than or equal to 0.5% blasts with aberrant surface antigen expression as determined by flow cytometry was predictive of subsequent relapse. Occult leukemia was detected in 41 (16%) of the 252 patients who responded to initial induction therapy. In time-dependent multivariate analyses that controlled for allogeneic marrow transplantation, variable intervals between sample submission, age, sex, white blood cell count at diagnosis, presence of splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, and presence of more than 15% blasts in the marrow after the first course of induction, patients harboring occult leukemia were 4.8 times more likely to relapse (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.8 to 8.4, P < .0001) and 3.1 times more likely to die (95% CI; 1.9 to 5.1, P < .0001) than those lacking leukemia detectable by flow cytometry. In this analysis, flow cytometric evidence of leukemia after the initiation of therapy emerged as the most powerful independent prognostic factor associated with poor outcome. Among patients in whom a marrow sample was available for analysis at the end of consolidation therapy, overall survival at 3 years was 41% versus 69% for patients with and without occult leukemia, respectively (P = 0.0058).

### Exposure to malaria affects the regression of hepatosplenomegaly after treatment for schistosoma mansoni infection in Kenyan children [^9cf364be]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Although we observed several significant changes following praziquantel treatment of the cohort, it is important to note that this was a retrospective analysis, which carries a few limitations. The observations made in this study were based on a small, case-only cohort, and therefore do not represent the outcome of an intervention programme involving mass treatment of a population. As this was a retrospective analysis, no control was possible concerning treatment for malaria during the follow-up period. The population had access to antimalarial drugs at local shops, but so far as we are aware there was no systematic intervention against malaria infection during the follow-up period. The results therefore encompass the effects of background treatment for, as well as exposure to, malaria infections.

Reliability of the clinical measurements is an important factor, especially given the size of the cohort. We have assessed this procedure elsewhere and it has been found to be satisfactory (unpublished observations). The involvement of three or four clinicians at each examination also reduced the degree of imprecision in the organomegaly measurements, and previous analysis has demonstrated that interpretable changes in the measurements occurred within this cohort.

### Changing disease course of crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in children, Turkey [^4df3cbf3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

A second change was observed in clinical manifestations. All 12 CCHF case-patients in the study manifested > 1 severe disease sign fulfilling the criteria for HLH: all had fever and hepatosplenomegaly, headache was the next most common complaint, most patients had petechiae, and 3 had neurologic findings at admission; none had tonsillopharyngitis. In previously published research on pediatric CCHF, the most common symptoms reported were fever and nausea, and tonsillopharyngitis was observed in a substantial percentage of patients, but hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were rarely reported.

Cytokines/chemokines play substantial roles in the pathogeny of viral hemorrhagic fevers, and previous work has proposed that CCHF cytokine profiles are similar to cytokine profiles of other hemorrhagic fevers. Studies on the cytokine and chemokine profiles of CCHF patients have mainly been conducted in adults, and the levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL8 have been proposed as correlated with severe and fatal CCHF. Contrary to those findings, in our study, neither IL-6 nor CXCL8 was elevated in any patient during any time interval. Our finding that IL-6 and TNF-α levels were not elevated was consistent with a previous pediatric study. However, the finding on IL-6 levels differed from another pediatric study in which pediatric CCHF patients were reported to have elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-10 compared with control groups. The difference might have been because of timing and a single measurement of cytokines/chemokines. In our study, IFN-α, IFN-γ, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were elevated during all 3 time intervals, indicating the consequential role of the T-helper 1–dependent pathway in pediatric CCHF cases.

### Nevirapine [^9dd6319b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening hepatic events. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment.

Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment.

### Long-term outcomes of modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster-90 regimen in adults with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma: a single-center experience [^4c590574]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

The standard treatment for adult T-Lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) has not been defined. This study was to analyze the efficiency of modified BFM-NHL-90 regimen in 36 adult patients with newly diagnosed T-LBL at the Sun Yat-Sen cancer center between August 2000 and December 2010. After the induction protocols, 34/36 (94%) of the patients achieved complete remission or unconfirmed complete remission. At the median follow-up of 36 months, 13 patients relapsed, but no relapses were observed in the CNS. The 3-year overall survival and 3-year event-free survival rates were 66.9% and 65.4%, respectively. Patients of female gender with hepatomegaly and hemoglobin less than 120 g/L, and the time interval exceeding 38 days between induction 1a and 1b, had inferior EFS and OS. The results was comparable to the previous regimens and the regimen could prevent CNS relapse with 4 high-dose MTX every 3 months during the maintenance phase.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^05342e3c]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

S4. The CFF recommends that PwCF who are found to have hepatobiliary involvement (abnormal physical exam, persistently elevated liver enzymes, or abnormal abdominal US findings) should undergo baseline liver elastography, when available, for the identification of advanced liver disease.

While persistent elevation of liver tests, abnormal physical exam (hepatomegaly and splenomegaly), and US abnormalities may be sufficient to detect aCFLD, these modalities are not sufficiently sensitive for the detection of earlier stages of clinically relevant liver fibrosis. Differentiation of mild to moderate (stage F0-1) from more advanced liver fibrosis (stage F2-4) at baseline during diagnosis has been shown to impact prognosis and clinical care in many chronic liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis. Liver stiffness measurement is ideal for this purpose as it is noninvasive and can be repeated over time. Modalities include transient elastography (TE), US shear-wave elastography (SWE), and MRI with elastography, each of which has been tested in PwCF liver involvement. Among these modalities, TE and SWE are the most readily available and most studied in CF and other chronic liver diseases. – Published small cohort studies for TE and SWE thresholds for PwCF are variable but have been described (Table 1).

### Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^056c11db]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition characterized by hepatomegaly, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and a histologic picture similar to alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of alcohol abuse. Most patients with NASH are obese women, and many have diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertriglyceridemia. NASH has also been associated with a number of metabolic conditions, surgical procedures, and drug treatments. Most patients are asymptomatic. The most common sign of NASH is hepatomegaly. Stigmata of chronic liver disease are rare. Laboratory abnormalities include a 2-4-fold elevation of serum aminotransferase levels; other liver function test results are usually normal. Histologically, there is moderate to severe macrovesicular steatosis and lobular hepatitis with necrosis or ballooning degeneration and/or fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is poorly understood, but lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are the leading culprits. The natural history of NASH is unknown, but NASH seems to be a stable disease in most patients. Treatment of NASH is unproven, but weight reduction is recommended in obese patients. Small pilot studies of several drugs have shown promise, but large randomized clinical trials are awaited. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease secondary to NASH.

### Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome during maintenance therapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with continuous asparaginase therapy and mercaptopurine metabolites [^422d61bb]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) during treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has mainly been associated with 6-thioguanine. The occurrence of several SOS cases after the introduction of extended pegylated asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) therapy in the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol led us to hypothesize that PEG-asparaginase, combined with other drugs, may trigger SOS during 6-thioguanine-free maintenance therapy.

Procedure

In children with ALL treated in Denmark according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol, we investigated the risk of SOS during methotrexate (MTX)/6-mercaptopurine (6MP) maintenance therapy that included PEG-asparaginase until week 33 (randomized to two- vs. six-week intervals), as well as alternating high-dose MTX or vincristine/dexamethasone pulses every four weeks.

Results

Among 130 children receiving PEG-asparaginase biweekly, 29 developed SOS (≥ 2 criteria: hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, ascites, weight gain ≥ 2.5%, unexplained thrombocytopenia < 75 × 10⁹ l⁻¹) at a median of 30 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 17–66) into maintenance (cumulative incidence: 27%). SOS cases fulfilling one, two, or three Ponte di Legno criteria were classified as possible (n = 2), probable (n = 8), or verified (n = 19) SOS, respectively. Twenty-six cases (90%) occurred during PEG-asparaginase treatment, including 21 (81%) within 14 days from the last chemotherapy pulse compared with the subsequent 14 days (P = 0.0025). Cytotoxic 6MP metabolites were significantly higher on PEG-asparaginase compared to after its discontinuation. Time-dependent Cox regression analysis showed increased SOS hazard ratio (HR) for erythrocyte levels of methylated 6MP metabolites (HR: 1.09 per 1,000 nmol/mmol hemoglobin increase, 95% confidence interval: 1.05–1.14). Six-week PEG-asparaginase intervals significantly reduced SOS-specific hazards (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

PEG-asparaginase increases cytotoxic 6MP metabolite levels and risk of SOS, potentially interacting with other chemotherapy pulses.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children — screening — appears underused and underrecognized, with underdiagnosis attributed to lack of recognition, screening, or appreciation of complications; one study found that less than one third of children with obesity were screened with laboratory testing at clinic visits, and recognition may be hindered by unacknowledged age-appropriate body mass index (BMI) norms and abdominal adiposity masking hepatomegaly on examination.

### Identification of the gene altered in berardinelli-seip congenital lipodystrophy on chromosome 11q13 [^b6b19026]. Nature Genetics (2001). Medium credibility.

Congenital generalized lipodystrophy, or Berardinelli-Seip syndrome (BSCL), is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by a near-absence of adipose tissue from birth or early infancy and severe insulin resistance. Other clinical and biological features include acanthosis nigricans, hyperandrogenism, muscular hypertrophy, hepatomegaly, altered glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus, and hypertriglyceridemia. A locus (BSCL1) has been mapped to 9q34 with evidence of heterogeneity. Here, we report a genome screen of nine BSCL families from two geographical clusters (in Lebanon and Norway). We identified a new disease locus, designated BSCL2, within the 2.5-Mb interval flanked by markers D11S4076 and D11S480 on chromosome 11q13. Analysis of 20 additional families of various ethnic origins led to the identification of 11 families in which the disease cosegregates with the 11q13 locus; the remaining families provide confirmation of linkage to 9q34. Sequence analysis of genes located in the 11q13 interval disclosed mutations in a gene homologous to the murine guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), gamma3-linked gene (Gng3lg) in all BSCL2-linked families. BSCL2 is most highly expressed in brain and testis and encodes a protein (which we have called seipin) of unknown function. Most of the variants are null mutations and probably result in a severe disruption of the protein. These findings are of general importance for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of body fat distribution and insulin resistance.

Abnormalities in liver morphology

Hepatomegaly

Hepatomegaly is defined as abnormal diffuse enlargement of the liver. Imaging diagnosis of hepatomegaly is mainly based on subjective evaluation supplemented by lineal craniocaudal measurement (e.g. craniocaudal diameter of the liver in midclavicular line of ≥ 15.5 cm). However, unidimensional measurement cannot accurately reflect liver volume, and a consensus on the threshold of hepatomegaly is still lacking. Hepatomegaly in PBCs is thought to be associated with diffuse intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatocyte edema, degeneration, and massive inflammatory cell infiltration. Approximately 11–50% of patients with PBC present hepatomegaly, with the exact percentage tending to decrease with increasing stage of the disease.

Liver surface nodularity

The liver margin in patients with PBC can be smooth or nodular (with nodules of < 3 cm). The configuration of the liver margin is correlated with the size of the underlying regenerative nodules. Gerald et al. reported that 64% of patients with cirrhosis caused by PBC presented with nodular liver margins, and 36% presented with smooth liver margins. However, lobulated liver margins (with more than one nodule > 3 cm) are not seen in PBC. The presence of liver surface nodularity was correlated with advanced stages of the disease and can be used for differentiating stage I–II and stage III–IV fibrosis in PBC.

Liver lobe redistribution

Lobal redistribution in PBC might be correlated with altered segmental portal venous perfusion, although the exact mechanism is still not fully understood. Segmental atrophy often appears when the disease progresses to late cirrhosis. Atrophy is only seen in 36% of patients with cirrhosis caused by PBC (half with diffuse atrophy and half with segmental atrophy), which is different to that of viral-induced cirrhosis, and focal atrophy of the left medial segment and right anterior segment is uncommon. Previous studies have reported that segmental hypertrophy was common in PBC patients with stage IV fibrosis but less frequent in those with advanced cirrhosis. In PBC-induced cirrhosis, segmental hypertrophy (most common in the left lateral segment and the caudate lobe) is found more frequently than diffuse hypertrophy (56% vs. 12%).

Table 1
Brief summary of updated consensus recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and management of CF‐related liver disease.

If any abnormalities are found on screening, further evaluation and monitoring for progression is recommended in the second set of recommendations (Table 1). Note, that previously if lab variables were elevated to > 1.5–2 times the ULN additional evaluation was recommended; however, the newest guidelines recommend evaluation if there are elevations of any amount that persist over 3–6 months. Lab evaluation is expanded and elastography and other imaging modalities should be obtained. The type of evaluation and frequency varies based on if CF hepatobiliary involvement (CFHBI) or advanced CFLD (aCFLD) is present.

CFHBI refers to having one (or more) of the following without features of advanced CFLD: hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis (Metavir score < F4), increased liver stiffness by elastography, hepatic steatosis, focal biliary cirrhosis, cholestasis, persistent (> 3–6 months) elevated serum liver function tests (any level above ULN), abnormal liver imaging, cholelithiasis, sclerosing cholangitis, or hepatolithiasis. Once CFHBI is identified, monitoring and progression is unchanged apart from elastography annually.

aCFLD is defined as having one (or more) of the following: nodular liver, advanced fibrosis (Metavir score of F4), multilobular cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension, or noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Esophageal variceal management is per the most relevant currently published guidelines in adults, however, there is insufficient evidence for or against surveillance in children.

The final set of recommendations relates to treatment, managed in consultation with a gastroenterologist. Key points to note are a recommendation against use of ursodeoxycholic acid as no study has demonstrated use prevents development of aCFLD or liver transplantation. However, there are also no studies evaluating discontinuation. Recommendations for CFTR modulator use (which vary by clinical status), surgical interventions, treatment of varices, and transplantation are included in Table 1.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^eadb7763]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

MANAGEMENT OF LIVER INVOLVEMENT IN COVID-19

The majority of patients with COVID-19 have no or mild liver function abnormalities during the illness. In mild COVID-19, hepatic damage may be transient and generally returns to normal without any special measures. Thus, management is generally supportive with monitoring of LFTs. A summary of the liver management and recommendations are given in Table 4. –

Table 4
Management of liver disease in COVID-19

Diagnostic aspects.

Liver function tests and abdominal imaging are the primary investigations done in relation to liver involvement in COVID-19 patients. Liver biochemistry including the liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum bilirubin, albumin, and PT should be monitored for diagnosing liver damage. However, the reasons for derangement of these blood tests are multifactorial and systemic inflammatory response because of COVID-19 may play a greater role than liver injury. Nevertheless, the liver tests should be performed during admission to establish a baseline and also to identify patients with suspected or known underlying liver disease. Further biochemical investigations may be needed in patients with known liver disease for example, known hepatitis B, C, and so on. The optimal interval for undertaking LFTs is uncertain. It has been suggested that LFTs be monitored at least twice weekly in COVID-19 patients receiving potential liver-toxic medications, whereas those with abnormal LFT results or with preexisting liver disease should be monitored more frequently. Increased serum AST and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with normal ALT levels should raise the suspicion of alternative diagnoses such as skeletal muscle or myocardial injury. Abnormal LFTs are frequently noted at admission before antiviral treatment of COVID-19 is commenced. Abnormal LFTs at the onset of a COVID-19 infection may indicate underlying chronic liver disease (CLD)and the treating physicians should take this into account. The imaging modalities include abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scans. The imaging findings are nonspecific and are usually indicated when there is suspicion of portal venous thrombosis or biliary obstruction.

### Diagnostic laparoscopy guidelines: this guideline was prepared by the SAGES guidelines committee and reviewed and approved by the board of governors of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), November 2007 [^46b8e9c4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic laparoscopy for liver diseases — rationale for the procedure states that liver disease amenable to laparoscopic exploration can be divided into three main categories, including discrete masses (metastatic cancer, hepatoma, or benign masses), diffuse diseases (HIV-related liver function abnormalities, hepatomegaly with or without splenomegaly, unexplained portal hypertension, and cirrhosis), and disease processes possibly related to the liver (ascites, abnormal liver function tests, or fever of unknown origin); diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role as an adjunct to other diagnostic tests, especially when the diagnosis is in question or to grade the severity of disease.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^079b259a]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

S3a. The CFF recommends abdominal ultrasound (US) to assess the liver and spleen at least every 2 years in PwCF from childhood until late adolescence, starting at age 3 or at diagnosis, if diagnosed after age 3.

S3b. In adults with CF, there is value in baseline screening for CFHBI, but the optimal frequency of subsequent imaging for those with normal baseline findings is unknown, and a specific recommendation cannot currently be made.

Together with laboratory tests and physical examination, periodic abdominal US imaging to evaluate the liver and spleen is recommended for screening in all PwCF. US is a readily available, noninvasive test with modest cost, which can identify abnormalities not detected by screening with physical exam or laboratory tests, such as the presence of echogenicity from steatosis, heterogeneous parenchyma and surface nodularity of the liver, and findings suggestive of portal hypertension (ascites, mesenteric edema, and splenic enlargement). Abnormal findings during screening can help in the characterization of CFHBI and evaluation for aCFLD. Dedicated vascular assessment by Doppler is not technically necessary to detect portal venous reversal of flow. However, centers should consult with local radiologists for local preferences on use of Doppler for this purpose. Since US abnormalities in PwCF can develop at any age, initiation of screening should occur starting at age 3, or at diagnosis if diagnosed after age 3. While some studies have reported on annual screening abdominal US in PwCF, there is insufficient evidence to recommend imaging on a yearly basis and defining the optimal frequency of US imaging is an important topic for future research. Specifically, studies to define risk stratification of individuals at high risk of developing CFHBI despite a normal baseline US will enable a more precise approach to US screening. Based in part on the PUSH Study of US imaging in pediatric populations with CF, the CFF recommends US imaging every 2 years from childhood through late adolescence. In adults with CF, a baseline screening is recommended to detect abnormal US patterns. However, there are no data to define the frequency of subsequent US imaging if the initial screening results are normal. Therefore, a specific recommendation for follow-up US imaging in adults with CF cannot be currently made.

5.6	Hepatotoxicity, Including Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease

Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), have been observed in patients treated with ONCASPAR in combination with standard chemotherapy, including during the induction phase of multiphase chemotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Do not administer ONCASPAR to patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

Evaluate bilirubin and transaminases prior to each dose of ONCASPAR and at least weekly, during cycles of treatment that include ONCASPAR, through 6 weeks after the last dose of ONCASPAR. Monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of hepatic VOD, which may include rapid weight gain, fluid retention with ascites, hepatomegaly (which may be painful), and rapid increase of bilirubin. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after ONCASPAR, more frequent monitoring for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of VOD is recommended. In the event of serious liver toxicity, including VOD, discontinue treatment with ONCASPAR and provide supportive care [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

The purpose of this study was to assess outcomes and indications in a large cohort of patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT) for liver metastases (LM) from neuroendocrine tumors (NET) over a 27-year period.

Background

LT for NET remains controversial due to the absence of clear selection criteria and the scarcity and heterogeneity of reported cases.

Methods

This retrospective multicentric study included 213 patients who underwent LT for NET performed in 35 centers in 11 European countries between 1982 and 2009. One hundred seven patients underwent transplantation before 2000 and 106 after 2000. Mean age at the time of LT was 46 years. Half of the patients presented hormone secretion and 55% had hepatomegaly. Before LT, 83% of patients had undergone surgical treatment of the primary tumor and/or LM and 76% had received chemotherapy. The median interval between diagnosis of LM and LT was 25 months (range, 1–149 months). In addition to LT, 24 patients underwent major resection procedures and 30 patients underwent minor resection procedures.

Results

Three-month postoperative mortality was 10%. At 5 years after LT, overall survival (OS) was 52% and disease-free survival was 30%. At 5 years from diagnosis of LM, OS was 73%. Multivariate analysis identified 3 predictors of poor outcome, that is, major resection in addition to LT, poor tumor differentiation, and hepatomegaly. Since 2000, 5-year OS has increased to 59% in relation with fewer patients presenting poor prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis of the 106 cases treated since 2000 identified the following predictors of poor outcome: hepatomegaly, age more than 45 years, and any amount of resection concurrent with LT.

Conclusions

LT is an effective treatment of unresectable LM from NET. Patient selection based on the aforementioned predictors can achieve a 5-year OS between 60% and 80%. However, use of overly restrictive criteria may deny LT to some patients who could benefit. Optimal timing for LT in patients with stable versus progressive disease remains unclear.

### Nevirapine (viramune) [^863b4be1]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Transaminases should be checked immediately if a patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity reaction. Transaminases should also be checked immediately for all patients who develop a rash in the first 18 weeks of treatment. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness, or hepatomegaly. The diagnosis of hepatotoxicity should be considered in this setting, even if transaminases are initially normal or alternative diagnoses are possible [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.4), and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

If clinical hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms occur, permanently discontinue nevirapine. Do not restart nevirapine after recovery. In some cases, hepatic injury progresses despite discontinuation of treatment.

The patients at greatest risk of hepatic events, including potentially fatal events, are women with high CD4+cell counts. In a retrospective analysis of pooled clinical trials with immediate-release VIRAMUNE, during the first 6 weeks of treatment women had a 3-fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (6% versus 2%). Patients with higher CD4+cell counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events. Women with CD4+cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm³had a 12-fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse events compared to women with CD4+cell counts less than 250 cells/mm³(11% versus 1%). An increased risk was observed in men with CD4+cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm³(6% versus 1% for men with CD4+cell counts less than 400 cells/mm³). However, all patients, regardless of gender, CD4+cell count, or antiretroviral treatment history, should be monitored for hepatotoxicity since symptomatic hepatic adverse events have been reported at all CD4+cell counts. Co-infection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminase elevations at the start of therapy with nevirapine are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT.

### Identifying gaps and disparities in screening for cystic fibrosis associated liver disease: insights from a CF center analysis [^6943311e]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Cystic fibrosis‐associated liver disease (CFLD) encompasses a spectrum of liver disease including elevated liver enzymes, steatosis, biliary disease, cirrhosis, and non‐cirrhotic portal hypertension. Advanced CFLD is the third most common cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF), causing 2.5% of all CF mortality. But CFLD can remain asymptomatic until it reaches an advanced stage. Therefore, screening PwCF is essential to identify CFLD at early stages — and ideally to mitigate its complications.

In 1999, the CF Foundation published guidelines for CFLD diagnosis and management. However, since then, much has been learned about CFLD. In 2023, a CF Foundation committee issued new evidence‐based guidelines for screening, monitoring, and treatment. The committee had international experts and included a multidisciplinary team along with patients and family members. In these guidelines, CFLD was categorized into hepatobiliary involvement (HBI, which includes hepatomegaly, liver fibrosis, elevated serum liver function tests for 3−6 months, abnormal liver imaging, cholelithiasis, sclerosing cholangitis or hepatolithiasis), and advanced CFLD (cirrhotic or non‐cirrhotic portal hypertension). These new guidelines advocate for additional testing in PwCF including routine abdominal ultrasound (US), liver elastography and standardized evaluations for other potential liver diseases in PwCF with HBI. They aim to identify CFLD earlier and enhance outcomes through timely interventions.

In this study, we assessed gaps in our center's CFLD screening practices — compared to the new guidelines — and identified person‐level predictors of incomplete screening. We also investigated HBI identification and evaluation and identified predictors for additional liver disease evaluation. We hypothesized that PwCF with low socioeconomic status, those living far from the CF center, and those with a high disease burden might be at a higher risk for incomplete screening. We suspected that HBI might be overlooked if age‐appropriate liver enzyme normative values were not used. Our goal was to inform an approach to implementing the new guidelines effectively and equitably, at our center and more broadly across CF centers.

### Hepatomegaly… [^ded7a4a2]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Hepatomegaly results from increase in the number or size of cells in the liver. Liver span correlates more strongly with hepatomegaly than projection below the costal margin. As a sign, not itself a disease, hepatomegaly can result from broad categories of disorders with an extensive differential diagnosis.

### Revised diagnosis and severity criteria for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome / veno-occlusive disease in adult patients: a new classification from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [^6947c936]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Beyond day 21, the Baltimore criteria are still valid to establish the diagnosis of SOS/VOD. However, this may represent a problem in patients who develop late onset SOS/VOD in the absence of hyperbilirubinemia, with only weight gain and ascites. Therefore, hyperbilirubinemia should no longer be mandatory in late onset SOS/VOD, and the diagnosis of late onset SOS/VOD may be made if patients fulfill a less stringent version of the Baltimore criteria, that is, at least two of the following: bilirubin ⩾2 mg/dL, painful hepatomegaly, weight gain > 5% or ascites. However, hemodynamic and/or ultrasound evidence of SOS/VOD (hepatomegaly, ascites and decrease in velocity or reversal of the portal flow) is mandatory in addition to these criteria. Finally, although transjugular liver biopsy is invasive and difficult to perform, histological evidence of SOS/VOD remains the gold standard (but not mandatory) for the diagnosis.

Obviously, many other causes can also lead to liver dysfunction after HCT, such as hepatic GvHD, viral infection, iron overload, sepsis and drug toxicity. Patient history, concomitant symptoms and laboratory testing allow exclusion of these differential diagnoses. However, one must keep in mind that SOS/VOD may coexist with others conditions presenting common symptoms.

Peripheral thrombocytopenia with a rapid consumption of transfused platelets is frequently observed in patients with SOS/VOD, and it has been debated whether it should be included as a diagnostic criterion. However, this feature is difficult to evaluate during the pancytopenic phase after conditioning, and lack specificity, given the numerous causes of thrombocytopenia after HCT. Therefore thrombocytopenia with rapid platelet consumption was not retained as a criterion for SOS/VOD diagnosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^abd53d51]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### Splenomegaly: a combined clinical and radiologic approach to the differential diagnosis [^3d94be8b]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) is a common imaging finding and may be related to a broad array of underlying conditions. The multifaceted functions of the spleen make it susceptible to involvement by a variety of pathophysiologic processes. Understanding these conditions and incorporating all relevant clinical and radiologic data allow narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^8755fe23]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

### Vanishing bile duct syndrome: a sequela of temozolomide and levetiracetam-induced cholestatic liver injury [^f8d8dd6c]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

DILI is common and caused by a wide variety of medications. A population-based study in 2020 found the crude incidence to be approximately 19 cases per 100 000 per year.DILI is the most common cause of acute liver failure episodes in the USA (13–16%). It was found that DILI is more commonly observed in older individuals, although it may be more reflective of the greater number of drugs prescribed to this population.

Presentation of DILI can vary widely from patient to patient. Symptoms of DILI include jaundice, weakness, abdominal pain, dark stools or urine, nausea and pruritus. Immune-mediated DILI can also have symptoms such as rash, eosinophilia, fever or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Thorough history should be taken to determine new medications that may be causing problems. On physical examination, patients may have right-upper quadrant tenderness, jaundice or hepatomegaly.

Evaluation of DILI should include AST and ALT, ALP, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin, prothrombin time and international normalised ratio. Other tests may include complete blood count, basic metabolic panel and viral serologies. Abdominal imaging such as ultrasound or MRI may be helpful to determine if there are other causes of disrupted biliary flow. Liver biopsy is not required but is beneficial to determine the type of liver injury occurring.

Typically, DILI develops between 5 days and 3 months after starting a medication. The time frame may be measured until the development of symptoms or until changes in laboratory values. DILI is often benign and resolves soon after drug discontinuation, typically a few days to 1 week. Full recovery may be rapid or may take up to several months. Early detection of DILI is critical to prevent progression to acute liver failure or chronic liver disease.

### Paediatric fatty liver disease (PeFLD): all is not NAFLD-pathophysiological insights and approach to management [^11c83b9a]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The recognition of a pattern of steatotic liver injury where histology mimicked alcoholic liver disease, but alcohol consumption was denied, led to the identification of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has since become the most common chronic liver disease in adults owing to the global epidemic of obesity. However, in paediatrics, the term NAFLD seems incongruous: alcohol consumption is largely not a factor and inherited metabolic disorders can mimic or co-exist with a diagnosis of NAFLD. The term paediatric fatty liver disease may be more appropriate. In this article, we summarise the known causes of steatosis in children according to their typical, clinical presentation: i) acute liver failure; ii) neonatal or infantile jaundice; iii) hepatomegaly, splenomegaly or hepatosplenomegaly; iv) developmental delay/psychomotor retardation and perhaps most commonly; v) the asymptomatic child with incidental discovery of abnormal liver enzymes. We offer this model as a means to provide pathophysiological insights and an approach to management of the ever more complex subject of fatty liver.

Imaging of Gaucher disease involvement

Due to the reliance on ERT and SRT for the long-term management of patients with Gaucher disease, non-invasive imaging methods are essential in ascertainment of response to therapy and detection of disease-related complications. Therefore, understanding the role of different imaging modalities in the context of disease processes is important to provide clinicians and radiologists with guidance in assessing disease severity and treatment response. General strengths and limitations of each imaging modality are summarized in Table 4.

Table 4
Imaging modalities relevant to Gaucher disease

Hepatic and splenic involvement

Organomegaly and infiltration

While the inciting pathophysiological mechanism of Gaucher disease, enzymatic deficiency with accumulation of glucocerebroside, has been elucidated, the extent to which substrate accumulation accounts for liver enlargement has been called into question. Originally, visceromegaly was attributed to simple accumulation glucocerebroside in the reticuloendothelial system with buildup of this material within Gaucher cells in the spleen as well as Kupffer cells in the liver. However, newer evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory and pro-infiltrative chemotaxis factors may also account for organ enlargement with Gaucher cells contributing only partially to enlarged liver and spleen volumes. Regardless, severe hepatic involvement generally corresponds with additional organ system manifestations. Hepatosplenomegaly is a hallmark of Gaucher disease and uniformly present beginning in childhood, and liver disease is a major contributor to Gaucher disease-related mortality. As such, traditional imaging of disease severity has been based on hepatic and splenic visceral organ enlargement.

### Identification of mutations that causes glucose-6-phosphate transporter defect in Tunisian patients with glycogenosis type 1b [^3c1b5e35]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The high rate of consanguineous marriage in Tunisia suggests a high incidence of autosomal recessive disorders. Thus is the first Tunisian published study, presenting the confirmation of the GSD1-type b. In fact, the definitive diagnosis is based on measuring the enzymatic activity of G6PT1 on a non-frozen liver biopsy. This technique is not available in Tunisia.

Phenotypic expression of GSD 1b

The clinical manifestations of glycogen storage disease type 1b are heterogeneous, most are healthy at birth and clinical symptoms appear gradually in varying degrees. The deficiency of the glucose 6-translocase T1 system generally appears around 4 to 6 months (sometimes earlier).

In the present study, the first clinical signs appear at an average age of 4 months with a time interval ranging from 2 months to 8 months, which is consistent with the data in the literature.

Metabolic phenotype of GSD1b

In this study, the metabolic phenotype of GSD 1b patients was characterized by episodes of hypoglycemia. This main biological parameter of the disease causes seizures associated with lactic acidosis which clinically often results in hyperventilation; the latter is a parameter that parents can easily watch over.

In addition, the three patients (MB, MT and SI) have presented episodes of hypoglycemia ranging from 0.55mmol/l to 2.09mmol/l; besides, the reason for consultation of SI was respiratory distress, which is consistent with data from the literature.

The accumulation of glycogen in the liver is due to the impossibility of transforming it into glucose, this accumulation causes hepatomegaly which is manifested by abdominal distension. It is noteworthy to mention that this symptom represented the main reason for consultation in the most studied patients (for 83% of cases) with glycogen storage disease type 1b.

In this serie, all patients presented with hepatomegaly at diagnosis, but only the 2nd patient consulted mainly for abdominal distension. These data are in agreement with the literature. In addition, an Egyptian study showed that 90% of patients with GSD 1b also had chubby facies. In this study, only the first patient MB of the first family developed large, well-filled cheeks.

It is not unusual to encounter abnormal liver enzyme levels on routine blood tests. When the abnormal elevation in aminotransferases persist, they require prompt and appropriate investigations as liver diseases in children are often insidious in onset and clinically silent. This article aims to provide (1) an explanation to the aetiologies of elevated aminotransferases; (2) an investigational approach to these children and (3) an insight into further investigations performed at a liver centre.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. (5.1, 6.1)
Co-infection with HIV: Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. (5.2)
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. (5.3)

5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV

Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating entecavir therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use.

5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including entecavir, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors.

Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).

Visceral leishmaniasis — Among symptomatic people, the incubation period typically ranges from weeks to months, and illness onset can be abrupt or gradual. Clinical manifestations include fever, hepatosplenomegaly (especially splenomegaly), night sweats, weight loss, and possible lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings characteristic of VL include pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), high total protein, low albumin, and hypergammaglobulinemia. If untreated, severe cases typically are fatal, and latent infection can clinically manifest years to decades after exposure in people who become immunocompromised through HIV infection, biologic immunomodulatory therapy, or immunosuppressive therapy.

Gaucher's disease is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of adult patients with hepatosplenomegaly and increased serum ACE. A 19-year-old girl presented with recurrent epigastric and left hypochondrial pain over a period of 9 years, associated with episodes of nausea and diarrhoea. She was extensively investigated and found to have splenomegaly and raised serum ACE. A screen for haematological disorders was negative. She reported an insect bite during an overseas holiday preceding her symptoms. She was therefore also screened for infectious causes of hepatosplenomegaly but without success. Later on in life, she reported joint pain and discomfort. Sarcoidosis was thought to be the putative cause on more than one occasion. However, the presence of splenomegaly and her relatively young age, led the rheumatologist to the correct diagnosis.

DISCUSSION

This investigation adds to CDC's previously published descriptive results of splenomegaly in individuals following departure from a tropical and malaria-endemic area. Persistent splenomegaly, defined as persistence beyond 6 months after arrival, was present in more than half of case-patients with available records; and chronic splenomegaly, defined as persistence beyond 18 months, occurred in about a third of patients with available follow-up records. Splenomegaly failed to resolve in many of the case-patients, despite previous literature suggesting the condition would improve in a vast majority of patients within the observed time frame of this investigation. These findings indicate that in certain populations, splenomegaly and associated morbidities will persist in a substantial proportion of individuals.

Despite previous treatment recommendations for malaria, only 36.9% of all case patients received primaquine after arrival to treat liver-stage hypnozoites; however, 60.9% of refugees with persistent splenomegaly received primaquine at some point during the follow-up, suggesting that it was more often considered for clinically complicated cases. Contributors to inconsistent primaquine administration may include the need for repeated visits for G6PD testing, a long (14-day) course, availability of primaquine, and lack of awareness among domestic physicians of CDC's recommendation. Although inadequate treatment for malaria is not the sole contributor to splenomegaly persistence in this population, CDC has recommended that primaquine be prescribed to all refugees with splenomegaly arriving from a malaria-endemic region who are G6PD-negative, and clinical progression should be closely followed after treatment administration.

Combined HCC-CCA (cHCC-CCA) is a rare hepatobiliary tumor type for which resection for those with early-stage disease is the only potentially curative option; diagnosis through imaging is difficult and misdiagnosis may occur, AFP levels may be elevated but tend not to differ significantly from HCC, and cHCC-CCA may be characterized by elevated serum CA 19–9. If suspected, thorough pathology review is recommended; biopsy and sequencing can help in disease management if there are actionable mutations; needle biopsies will not necessarily show both elements, and multidisciplinary management is required.

For liver masses < 10 mm, US and AFP testing should be repeated in 3 to 6 months, and patients with viral hepatitis who have had a complete or sustained viral response should continue with screening despite that response.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. (5.1, 6.1)
Co-infection with HIV: Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. (5.2)

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. (5.3)

5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti- hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV

Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating entecavir therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use.

5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including entecavir, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors.

Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).

### Recognizing gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of primary immunodeficiency diseases [^4f8154a0]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Given the complex immune function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, it is not surprising that many children with primary immunodeficiencies present with GI tract manifestations. Although many immunodeficiency disorders present with overt evidence of immune dysregulation, a few can present in older children with more subtle signs and symptoms. Such children may present first to a gastroenterologist with common symptoms, including malabsorption, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, or inflammatory bowel disease, which may actually be a manifestation of their underlying immune disorder. A thorough clinical history in combination with a careful review of histology from biopsies may reveal clues that one is dealing with a disease entity outside the norm and may prompt additional laboratory studies beyond the usual set of screening laboratory tests. Once the true underlying diagnosis is revealed, more appropriate therapy can be initiated. Additionally, more appropriate anticipatory guidance regarding the expected disease course, response to medications, and any additional risks that therapy may entail can be provided to the family.

### Exposure to malaria affects the regression of hepatosplenomegaly after treatment for schistosoma mansoni infection in Kenyan children [^f5ff3e9f]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our observations lend further support to the hypothesis that severity of hepatosplenomegaly in Kenyan school-aged children is related to their degree of exposure to both S. mansoni and malaria infections. Specifically, although the degree of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly may be correlated with S. mansoni infection, there is likely to be further exacerbation of the condition if a child is concurrently exposed to malaria. We have now observed that the apparent benefits of treating a case of hepatosplenomegaly with praziquantel may be reduced if a child lives in an area of relatively high exposure. We have therefore confirmed the long-standing, but untested, hypothesis that co-infections of S. mansoni and malaria may obscure the clinical evaluation associated with infection by either species. Our results also introduce the necessity of considering the level of exposure to malaria when evaluating the clinical outcome of praziquantel treatment for S. mansoni infection.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^d7e523b9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric acute liver failure — history and physical findings — emphasizes historical elements linked to common etiologies and examination signs of chronic disease. Infectious history includes recent travel and known sick contacts; toxic history includes prescribed and over‑the‑counter medications, herbal supplements, illicit drug use, consumption of wild mushrooms, and exposure to household or industrial chemicals; autoimmune or metabolic history includes family history of autoimmune disease, preexisting developmental delay, family history of liver disease, consanguinity, family history of recurrent late miscarriage or early infant death, and episodes of altered mental status or confusion. Physical examination findings suggestive of preexisting or chronic liver disease include growth failure and dysmorphic features; hepatosplenomegaly suggestive of portal hypertension and ascites; digital clubbing and rachitic rosary; and skin findings such as xanthomas, abdominal varices or spider angiomas, and peripheral edema.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: from pathogenesis to patient care [^ee19056d]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in Western countries. It encompasses a wide spectrum of liver lesions, from pure steatosis to end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis corresponds only to one stage of NAFLD. As NAFLD can be considered a liver manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, its prevalence is high in obese people and in patients who have type 2 diabetes-insulin resistance is one of the key elements of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. This disease is often asymptomatic in the absence of decompensated cirrhosis, but should be suspected in patients with elevated aminotransferase levels or radiological evidence of a fatty liver or hepatomegaly. Liver fibrosis is associated with age over 50 years, obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Liver biopsy is the only way to assess the histologic features of necrotic inflammation and fibrosis that define nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and to determine its probable prognosis. The prognosis is good for pure steatosis, whereas the presence of necrotic inflammation is associated with a significant risk of progression to cirrhosis and, possibly, hepatocellular carcinoma. Lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications and exercise, are recommended. To date, there have been very few randomized, placebo-controlled trials of drug treatments for NAFLD.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-Multiple States, 2015–2018 [^0fdead6a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Associated comorbidities and complications.

Although clinical follow-up information varied in quality and duration across clinic sites, any refugee with splenomegaly at any point after arrival was 39% more likely to have had a hematologic abnormality, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia (aRR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04–1.85), and, more specifically, was 43% more likely to have had anemia (aRR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.04–1.97) (Table 3). Refugees with persistent splenomegaly beyond 6 months after arrival were 60% more likely (aRR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.15–2.23) than controls to have had a hematologic abnormality at some point during the follow-up period. More specifically, patients with persistent splenomegaly were more than five times as likely to have had thrombocytopenia during the follow-up period (aRR: 5.53, 95% CI: 1.73–17.62). Splenomegaly did not appear to be associated with elevated liver transaminases (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) in this population; however, refugees with persistent splenomegaly were 57% more likely to have elevated ALP (aRR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.03–2.40). All estimates were adjusted for age, gender, and length of follow-up time.

Table 3
Comorbid conditions among Congolese refugees diagnosed with splenomegaly and their matched controls, measured at the initial post–U.S. arrival screening visit or the first available result

One patient presented with massive splenomegaly (splenic size: 27.1 cm × 7.1 cm × 26 cm by ultrasound) and hepatomegaly with extensive thrombosis of the main portal vein and superior mesenteric and splenic veins. Although this patient did receive malaria treatment (artemether–lumefantrine) before departure, approximately 8 months after arrival, this patient required a splenectomy. Within one month of the splenectomy, this patient was hospitalized for clinical malaria. Clinical notes from this hospitalization did not indicate malaria testing methods or species, although P. falciparum was detected by PCR from the patient's blood sample collected at her predeparture visit. The patient only initiated a 14-day course of primaquine to treat liver-stage hypnozoites after this hospitalization, not immediately after her arrival. There was no indication of any testing for schistosomiasis in this patient's medical chart.

Sensitivity and specificity of select clinical findings and events for distinguishing HIV-infected from exposed uninfected infants

WAZ - weight-for-age score. CI - confidence interval.

+LR - positive likelihood ratio. n/a - not applicable.

When these algorithms were applied to HIV-infected infants to predict severe immune suppression (CD4 < 25%), the algorithms were sensitive, but poorly specific using one cut-off finding. For example, any one of the six clinical findings in Table 4 B (weight below 50 th centile, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, diaper dermatitis, and lymphadenopathy) had a sensitivity of 89% but specificity of 2% for predicting severe immune suppression.

### Undetected hepatomegaly in obese children by primary care physicians: a pitfall in the diagnosis of pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^fc53a3a2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) relies on the initial detection of hepatomegaly or elevated serum aminotransferases by the primary care provider. In this investigation, the aptitude of the primary care provider to identify children with hepatomegaly and initiate an evaluation for NAFLD is determined. The physical examination findings and requests for diagnostic testing of 18 primary care physicians (and pediatric gastroenterologists) on 11 obese school-aged children, including a subset of children with hepatomegaly and NAFLD, were analyzed. In children with NAFLD, clinicians detected hepatomegaly in 1.4% of encounters and requested serum liver chemistries in 12.5% of encounters. Hepatomegaly is detected poorly in obese children by primary care physicians and thereby increases the likelihood of a delayed or omitted evaluation for NAFLD.

### An unexpected finding of hepatosplenomegaly in a pediatric patient [^ad3877cb]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Course in Hospital

The patient was started on ERT with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) at 60 U/kg every 2 weeks. She tolerated this well with no reported side effects. Two years later, she continues to thrive with a weight of 28.4 kg (69th percentile) and height of 122.6 cm (15th percentile). Clinical examination and a repeat abdominal ultrasound demonstrated resolved hepatosplenomegaly with improved liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia (Table 1).

### Hepatobiliary tuberculosis: imaging findings [^f2f49b77]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Tuberculosis (TB) may present with highly variable imaging findings. The findings may vary from nonspecific hepatomegaly to abscesses or solid focal lesions, mimicking liver tumors. Biliary tract involvement may also be detected, which may manifest with ductal dilatations from underlying strictures.

Conclusion

All cross-sectional imaging modalities, including sonography, CT, and MRI, may be used in the evaluation of patients with TB. Imaging findings may be perplexing to radiologists, particularly ones who practice in areas where TB is not endemic; thus, histopathologic diagnosis may be required.

### Relation of liver volume to adverse cardiovascular events in adolescents and adults with fontan circulation [^6525377d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevated central venous pressure in those with Fontan circulation causes liver congestion and hepatomegaly. We assessed if liver volume by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Retrospective study of 122 patients with Fontan circulation who were > 10 years old and had a liver MRI with magnetic resonance elastography. Liver volume (ml) was measured by manual segmentation from axial T2-weighted images and was indexed to body surface area. The composite outcome included death, heart transplant, ventricular assist device placement, or nonelective cardiovascular hospitalization. The median age at the time of MRI was 18.9 (interquartile range 15.8 to 25.9) years, and 47% of the patients were women. The mean indexed liver volume was 1,133 ± 180 ml/m². Indexed liver volume was not significantly associated with age, years since Fontan, or with liver stiffness (r = 0.15, p = 0.10), but was positively correlated with Fontan pressure (r = 0.32, p = 0.002). Over a median follow-up of 2.1 (0.8 to 4.2) years, 32 patients (26%) experienced the composite outcome. Higher indexed liver volume was associated with a greater hazard for the composite outcome (hazard ratio per 1 SD increase = 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.35, p = 0.0004) but increased liver stiffness was not significantly associated with the composite outcome (hazard ratio per 1 SD increase 1.44, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 2.21, p = 0.11). In conclusion, greater liver volume indexed to body surface area is associated with unfavorable hemodynamics and adverse outcomes in patients with Fontan circulation. Liver volume may be a useful, simple imaging biomarker in adolescents and adults with Fontan circulation.
