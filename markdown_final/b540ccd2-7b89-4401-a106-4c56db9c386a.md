## Question

How long to give Bactrim for a elderly male with UTI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to treat an elderly man with a urinary tract infection using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether this is uncomplicated lower UTI versus febrile UTI or prostatitis. Then, I should verify the best available randomized evidence for treatment duration in men. Next, I will check contemporary guideline positions and reconcile them with the evidence. After that, I need to consider age-related risks and stewardship trade-offs in older adults. Finally, I will outline practical dosing, monitoring, and follow-up, including renal function adjustments and culture-directed therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because duration hinges on syndrome classification. In men, most symptomatic lower UTIs are considered complicated by definition, and the presence of fever, chills, flank pain, or systemic signs pushes me toward febrile UTI or pyelonephritis, whereas isolated dysuria, frequency, and urgency without fever or prostatic tenderness suggests lower UTI; I should also actively consider acute bacterial prostatitis if there is fever, perineal pain, obstructive symptoms, or tender prostate, since that changes duration and agent selection [^114JeXVq].

> Now, I will examine the highest-quality evidence for afebrile men with lower UTI symptoms. The 2021 JAMA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial in afebrile men showed that 7 days of TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin was noninferior to 14 days for symptom resolution, with similar recurrence and fewer adverse events in the shorter arm; the median age was 69, which fits many "elderly" patients, so I should not overextend treatment in this scenario [^1171F9GK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for febrile presentations. I initially thought 7 days might suffice across the board, but wait, I should verify the evidence for febrile UTI in men. A multicenter randomized trial in men with febrile UTI found 7 days of ofloxacin was inferior to 14 days for treatment success, and IDSA guidance notes that men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from 10–14 days, acknowledging the evidence gap; so for febrile UTI or suspected prostatitis, 10–14 days remains reasonable while we await stronger data [^112RVKPh] [^112RVKPh] [^1132mcKt].

> Next, I should review guideline syntheses to ensure alignment. Contemporary primary care and stewardship guidance for men with uncomplicated lower UTI supports 7 days of TMP-SMX when the pathogen is susceptible, whereas for febrile UTI or suspected prostatitis, 10–14 days is commonly advised; importantly, IDSA's cUTI guidance allows shorter courses for some complicated presentations if the patient is improving and certain exclusions are met, but it explicitly flags suspected prostatitis as a situation where longer therapy may be warranted, which helps reconcile shorter-course trends with prostatitis exceptions [^1132xnmk] [^117Smpys] [^116wywDX].

> I need to ensure I factor in age-specific risks and benefits in older adults. Shorter effective courses reduce adverse events and C. difficile risk, and observational data in older adults link TMP-SMX with hyperkalemia and AKI, so minimizing exposure is prudent when clinically safe; conversely, delays or undertreatment in vulnerable elders can increase risks of bloodstream infection and mortality, so I should balance stewardship with timely, appropriate therapy and close follow-up [^113HkUjC] [^114pht5t] [^11382d8c].

> Let me think about dosing and renal function because this affects both safety and duration. Standard adult dosing is 1 double-strength TMP-SMX tablet every 12 hours, but in older adults with reduced creatinine clearance, dose reduction is recommended; for CrCl 15–30 mL/min, many clinicians halve the dose, and for CrCl less than 15 mL/min, TMP-SMX is generally avoided or used with extreme caution, so I should confirm kidney function before finalizing the regimen and duration [^112psvoK] [^116vbFzz].

> I should double-check culture strategy and susceptibility because this directly informs duration and agent choice. In men with UTI, obtaining a urine culture with susceptibilities is standard to guide therapy and to confirm TMP-SMX activity; if resistance exceeds local thresholds or prior use within 90 days increases resistance risk, I should avoid empiric TMP-SMX and choose an active alternative, then tailor duration to the clinical syndrome and response [^1132xnmk] [^114CVrxj].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is as follows: for an elderly man with an afebrile, uncomplicated lower UTI and a TMP-SMX–susceptible organism, treat for 7 days with appropriate renal dosing; for an elderly man with febrile UTI or suspected acute bacterial prostatitis, treat for 10–14 days, recognizing the evidence base is stronger for 14 days in febrile presentations and weaker but supportive of 10–14 days when prostatitis is suspected; throughout, I will monitor for clinical response within 48–72 hours and extend or adjust therapy if there is delayed improvement or if source control issues are identified [^1171F9GK] [^112RVKPh] [^117Smpys].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and safety monitoring. Given higher risks of hyperkalemia and AKI with TMP-SMX in older adults, I will check electrolytes and renal function within a week if feasible, reassess symptoms at 48–72 hours to ensure trajectory toward resolution, and obtain a post-treatment urine culture only if symptoms persist or recur; if there is no improvement, I will reconsider the diagnosis, evaluate for obstruction or prostatic abscess, and broaden or change therapy based on culture results and local resistance patterns [^114pht5t].

For an elderly male with a UTI, **Bactrim (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg PO BID for 7 days** is recommended if the infection is uncomplicated and the patient is afebrile, based on randomized trial data showing noninferiority to 14 days and fewer adverse effects [^1171F9GK]. For complicated UTI, febrile illness, or suspected prostatitis, **extend therapy to 10–14 days** to reduce recurrence and ensure eradication [^117Smpys] [^116wywDX]. Always adjust for renal function and local resistance patterns, and monitor for hyperkalemia, AKI, and hematologic adverse effects.

---

## Recommended duration of Bactrim therapy

### Uncomplicated UTI (afebrile, no systemic symptoms)

For uncomplicated UTI (afebrile, no systemic symptoms), the **duration** is 7 days of TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID [^notfound]. Evidence: a randomized trial in afebrile men showed 7 days was noninferior to 14 days for symptom resolution, with fewer adverse effects [^1171F9GK].

---

### Complicated UTI (febrile, systemic symptoms, or suspected prostatitis)

For complicated UTI (febrile, systemic symptoms, or suspected prostatitis), the **duration** is 10–14 days of TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID. Rationale: longer therapy is needed to eradicate infection and prevent recurrence, especially with prostatic involvement [^117Smpys] [^116wywDX].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting duration recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence supporting duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated UTI in elderly males | 7 days | Randomized trial showing noninferiority of 7 days vs 14 days [^1171F9GK] |
| Complicated UTI or suspected prostatitis | 10–14 days | IDSA guidelines recommending longer duration for complicated infections [^116EXLaV] |

## Special considerations in elderly patients

### Renal function

In elderly patients with **impaired renal function**, reduce the dose or extend the dosing interval to mitigate hyperkalemia and AKI risks [^112psvoK] [^114pht5t].

---

### Adverse effects

Monitor for **hyperkalemia, AKI, and hematologic adverse effects**, which are more common in older adults [^114pht5t] [^1148ZfsU].

---

### Drug interactions

Review for interactions — especially with **warfarin, digoxin, and antihypertensives** — and adjust therapy as needed [^112zjydu].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

- **7 days**: Effective for uncomplicated UTIs with fewer adverse effects and lower risk of C. difficile infection [^1171F9GK] [^113HkUjC].
- **10–14 days**: Better for complicated infections or prostatitis, reducing recurrence and ensuring eradication [^112RVKPh] [^116wywDX].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

IDSA recommends **7 days for uncomplicated male UTI** and 10–14 days for complicated UTI or suspected prostatitis [^117Smpys] [^116wywDX]. The **AAFP** similarly recommends 7 days for uncomplicated male UTI and 10–14 days for complicated infections.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Uncomplicated UTI**: 7 days of TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID [^1132xnmk].
- **Complicated UTI or suspected prostatitis**: 10–14 days of TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID [^117Smpys].
- **Adjust for renal function and monitor for adverse effects**.

---

For elderly males with UTI, use **7 days of Bactrim for uncomplicated cases** and 10–14 days for complicated cases or suspected prostatitis, with careful attention to renal function, adverse effects, and drug interactions.

Importance

Determination of optimal treatment durations for common infectious diseases is an important strategy to preserve antibiotic effectiveness.

Objective

To determine whether 7 days of treatment is noninferior to 14 days when using ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat urinary tract infection (UTI) in afebrile men.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial of afebrile men with presumed symptomatic UTI treated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at 2 US Veterans Affairs medical centers (enrollment, April 2014 through December 2019; final follow-up, January 28, 2020). Of 1058 eligible men, 272 were randomized.

Interventions

Participants continued the antibiotic prescribed by their treating clinician for 7 days of treatment and were randomized to receive continued antibiotic therapy (n = 136) or placebo (n = 136) for days 8 to 14 of treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The prespecified primary outcome was resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after completion of active antibiotic treatment. A noninferiority margin of 10% was selected. The as-treated population (participants who took ≥ 26 of 28 doses and missed no more than 2 consecutive doses) was used for the primary analysis, and a secondary analysis included all patients as randomized, regardless of treatment adherence. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of UTI symptoms and/or adverse events within 28 days of stopping study medication.

Results

Among 272 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [62–73] years) who were randomized, 100% completed the trial and 254 (93.4%) were included in the primary as-treated analysis. Symptom resolution occurred in 122/131 (93.1%) participants in the 7-day group vs 111/123 (90.2%) in the 14-day group (difference, 2.9% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.2% to ∞]), meeting the noninferiority criterion. In the secondary as-randomized analysis, symptom resolution occurred in 125/136 (91.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 123/136 (90.4%) in the 14-day group (difference, 1.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -5.8% to ∞]) Recurrence of UTI symptoms occurred in 13/131 (9.9%) participants in the 7-day group vs 15/123 (12.9%) in the 14-day group (difference, -3.0% [95% CI, -10.8% to 6.2%]; p = 0.70). Adverse events occurred in 28/136 (20.6%) participants in the 7-day group vs 33/136 (24.3%) in the 14-day group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among afebrile men with suspected UTI, treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 7 days was noninferior to 14 days of treatment with regard to resolution of UTI symptoms by 14 days after antibiotic therapy. The findings support the use of a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as an alternative to a 14-day course for treatment of afebrile men with UTI.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of BACTRIM in pediatric patients under two years of age. BACTRIM is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults

For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that BACTRIM could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis

For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia

For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and for prophylaxis against P. jirovecii pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing P. jirovecii pneumonia.

Traveler's Diarrhea in Adults

For the treatment of traveler's diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^1132xnmk]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^113AK4Tq]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that there were similar clinical cure rates between 7 and 14 days of treatment during longer follow-up (70–84 days post-treatment) and this holds both for women and men. In others words, the need for additional antibiotic UTI treatment during longer follow-up is similar irrespective of whether the initial treatment of fUTI was 7 or 14 days. Given the principles of antimicrobial stewardship, this is an interesting finding because, even in men with fUTI, this might be an argument to treat them for 7 days. Indeed, our study indicates that a further study upon treatment duration of men with fUTI should be performed, including outcome measures being set at 3 months or even longer instead of the traditional 2–6 weeks.

Given the consistency of our findings and those of the recent study in Sweden, we conclude that women with fUTI, irrespective of disease severity and comorbidities, can be treated orally with 7 days of adequately dosed fluoroquinolones. Ciprofloxacin was chosen as treatment because of its reliable intestinal resorption and bioavailability, and excellent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of susceptible gram-negative uropathogens, making it a drug of choice in both outpatient as well as hospital settings. As a surplus, activity against perineum and vagina colonizing Enterobacteriaceae may help to prevent early recurrences. An important concern has been the rise of ciprofloxacin resistance in the community, i.e. up to 15% of Enterobacteriaceae are currently resistant in The Netherlands, that may preclude the use of fluoroquinolones as first-choice empiric oral treatment of fUTI. Of great concern, in other countries, this figure has been reported as high as 40–50%. In countries with concurrent high rates of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, there may be no oral antibiotic option left for general practitioners to treat fUTI at home, raising healthcare costs. These findings underscore the importance of controlling antimicrobial resistance through antibiotic stewardship, including the administration of antibiotics with optimal duration.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for adult urinary tract infections within emergency department and urgent care settings [^112fHoxa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common reason for emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are frequently prescribed for treatment of UTI in the outpatient setting; however, data evaluating prescribing patterns after FDA safety warnings is limited, especially in UC. The study goal was to investigate and compare antimicrobial prescribing for UTIs in a single-site ED and an off-site UC in an urban, academic health system. This retrospective study included patients presenting with a UTI to the ED or UC between January and June 2018. Those 18 years or older with uncomplicated, complicated UTI, or pyelonephritis were included. Exclusion criteria were catheter-related UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromised, or hospitalization. Primary outcome was FQ prescribing rate for all UTI in the ED and UC. Secondary outcomes were rates of non-FQ prescribing, re-presentation, bug-drug mismatch, and treatment durations. 184 patients were included. FQ prescribing rate was similar in ED and UC (21.2% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.4). Non-FQs prescribed in ED and UC were nitrofurantoin (20.2% vs 53.6%), beta-lactams (46.1% vs 22.6%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5% vs. 5%). A longer than recommended duration was identified in 46.3% UC patients compared to 21.2% ED patients. Thirty-day re-presentation with persistent UTI symptoms occurred more frequently in the ED compared to UC (13.5% vs. 7.5%). Predictors of FQ prescribing on logistic regression were male, recurrent UTI, and malignancy. FQ prescribing rate for UTI treatment was low with no difference between ED and UC. Opportunity exists to improve treatment duration and antimicrobial choice.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^112KTmNx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Diagnosis and management of male urinary tract infections: a need for new guidelines. study from a French general practice electronic database [^112QV3ba]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The definition and the treatment of male urinary tract infections (UTIs) are imprecise. This study aims to determine the frequency of male UTIs in consultations of general practice, the diagnostic approach and the prescribed treatments.

Methods

We extracted the consultations of male patients, aged 18 years or more, during the period 2012–17 with the International Classification of Primary Care, version 2 codes for UTIs or associated symptoms from PRIMEGE/MEDISEPT databases of primary care. For eligible consultations in which all symptoms or codes were consistent with male UTIs, we identified patient history, prescribed treatments, antibiotic duration, clinical conditions, additional examinations and bacteriological results of urine culture.

Results

Our study included 610 consultations with 396 male patients (mean age 62.5 years). Male UTIs accounted for 0.097% of visits and 1.44 visits per physician per year. The UTIs most commonly identified were: undifferentiated (52%), prostatitis (36%), cystitis (8.5%) and pyelonephritis (3.5%). Fever was recorded in 14% of consultations. Urine dipstick test was done in 1.8% of consultations. Urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli in 50.4% of bacteriological tests. Fluoroquinolones were the most prescribed antibiotics (64.9%), followed by beta-lactams (17.4%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (11.9%) and nitrofurantoin (2.6%).

Conclusions

Male UTIs are rare in general practice and have different presentations. The definition of male UTIs needs to be specified by prospective studies. Diagnostic evidence of male cystitis may reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy and spare critical antibiotics.

### Trimethoprim [^114M66v5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^1174z6KP]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

For two of the antibiotic indications we studied, treatment was frequently prescribed for shorter durations than recommended — both urinary tract infections in men: acute cystitis and acute prostatitis. This could arise because prescribers appreciate that recommendations for these conditions are based on expert opinion and historical precedent rather than evidence, and that treatment durations for urinary tract infections in women have declined considerably in recent years. It needs to be established whether shorter treatment durations are effective for men with urinary tract infections, as this is a small but important patient population with a risk of harm from under-treatment. Notably, the conditions for which course durations tended to be less than recommended in the guidelines were those for which evidence supporting duration of treatment is weak (supplementary figs S5-S7).

In general, the preference seemed to be for antibiotic prescriptions with durations of five or seven days or multiples thereof, without a clear evidence base for this preference. The preference for such durations has been observed previously in other settings and depended more on local practice and subspecialty than on clinical features such as fever, comorbidities, and severity. In addition, for conditions where guidelines recommend longer durations, the percentage of prescriptions beyond the recommendation is substantially lower than for conditions where guidelines recommend a relatively short duration.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^117TcBoR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^114giEYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^112nW2xn]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

The primary endpoint was analyzed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, including all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug (on the eighth day of UTI treatment), and on the per-protocol (PP) population, including all randomized patients who had been given the study drug for a minimum of 24 hours (in case of treatment failure) or who had taken at least 80% of the study drug (in case of clinical cure).

The study sample size was calculated on the basis of a clinical cure rate of 10 percentage points lower at short-term follow-up in the 7-day treatment arm with the assumption of a 90% clinical cure rate in patients treated for 14 days. We adopted 10% as the margin of non-inferiority as suggested previously. As we were only interested in non-inferiority and not in equivalence, the sample size calculation was based on a one-tailed alpha of 0.05. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 0.10, 1-tailed alpha of 0.05, and a power of 0.90, the required sample size per group was 200. This implies that the 90% confidence interval of a two-tailed χ² test should not cross the predefined risk difference of 10% lower clinical cure rate, or equivalently, the one-sided P value is less than the 0.05 significance level. Interim analyses were done after randomization of 100 and 200 patients. After the second interim analysis, there was no reason to stop the trial for safety reasons. However, the principal investigators, who obviously were still blinded with respect to treatment allocation, noted that the overall cure rate was 92%. This is comparable with the results of a recently published similar trial in women comparing 73 to 83 patients treated over 7 or 14 days, respectively. As we had indeed included a larger sample size of 200 patients, we estimated that our study would likely have already met the criteria for non-inferiority while still having a power of 0.80 with a type 1 error of 0.05. As we were confronted with an almost empty budget and a dropping inclusion rate after almost 5 years of participation, we considered continuation of the trial was no longer realistic and thus we decided to stop the trial at this point.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^113BEzPi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10⁴ CFU/mL in women or < 10³ CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117RCSCu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^1172okH4]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Women with fUTI can be successfully treated with antibiotics for 7 days, including those who initially were treated with β-lactams intravenously. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days when looking at short-term clinical cure. During long-term follow-up, even in men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 14 days.

Is should be considered that the primary outcome measures on future trials on antibiotic treatment duration of fUTI in men, should be set at 3 months instead of the traditional 2 weeks.

### Guidelines for the management of male urinary tract infections in primary care: a lack of international consensus-a systematic review of the literature [^1164PKSN]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of adult male urinary tract infections (mUTIs) in primary care lacks international consensus. The main objective of this study was to describe the different guidelines for the diagnosis and management of mUTIs in primary care, to assess their methodological quality, and to describe their evidence-based strength of recommendation (SoR).

Methods

An international systematic literature review of the electronic databases Medline (PubMed) and EMBASE, and gray-literature guideline-focused databases was performed in 2021. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) assessment tool was used by 2 independent reviewers to appraise each guideline.

Results

From 1,678 records identified, 1,558 were screened, 134 assessed for eligibility, and 29 updated guidelines met the inclusion criteria (13 from Medline, 0 from EMBASE, and 16 from gray literature). Quality assessment revealed 14 (48%) guidelines with high-quality methodology. A grading system methodology was used in 18 (62%) guidelines. Different classifications of mUTIs are described, underlining a lack of international consensus: an anatomic classification (cystitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis) and a symptomatic classification (approach based on the intensity and tolerance of symptoms). The duration of antibiotic treatment for febrile mUTIs has been gradually reduced over the last 20 years from 28 days to 10–14 days of fluoroquinolones (FQ), which has become the international gold standard. Guidelines from Scandinavian countries propose short courses (3–5 days) of FQ-sparing treatments: pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim. Guidelines from French-speaking countries use a watchful waiting approach and suggest treating mUTIs with FQ, regardless of fever.

Conclusions

This lack of scientific evidence leads to consensus and disagreement: 14 days of FQ for febrile mUTIs is accepted despite a high risk of antimicrobial resistance, but FQ-sparing treatment and/or short treatment for afebrile mUTIs is not. The definition of afebrile UTIs/cystitis is debated and influences the type and duration of antibiotic treatment recommended.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### Rational antibiotic treatment of outpatient genitourinary infections in a changing environment [^115e4DU4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In the outpatient setting, genitourinary infections (GUIs) remain costly to treat and are a significant cause of morbidity. Recent evidence supports more substantial roles for pathogens other than Escherichia coli, particularly gram-positive pathogens, in the pathogenesis of GUIs. Broad-spectrum agents should be considered in order to address this etiologic change appropriately. Criteria for antimicrobial selection set forth by the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) recommend using antibiotics that are supported by strong clinical evidence, have good susceptibility profiles, are safe, are cost-effective, and are used for the optimal duration. Evidence-based guidelines recommend considering local E coli resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and using fluoroquinolones as second-line therapy when resistance is high. Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Among the fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin offer coverage for the gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, which may make them preferable in treating urinary tract infections empirically in such patient groups. For the treatment of bacterial prostatitis, only trimethoprim and the fluoroquinolones possess both the appropriate bactericidal activity and the ability to diffuse into the prostate. Levofloxacin shows particularly good penetration into prostatic tissue. Safety issues to consider include imbalances in intestinal microflora caused by antimicrobial agents that may lead to overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Once the optimal agent is identified, the optimal duration of treatment should be determined to maximize treatment success while minimizing the potential for resistance. Finally, cost considerations include the costs of treatment failure due to inappropriate therapy or nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^11382d8c]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In the context of randomised controlled trials, strict exclusion criteria particularly related to age have been applied that prevent the results being generalised to older adult populations who may require a different approach in the management of UTI. In contrast, our study specifically looked at the group of older patients (> 65 years) who are more susceptible to complications and are often neglected in UTI related research. We showed that antibiotics prescribed at the time of UTI diagnosis may benefit this vulnerable population by significantly reducing the risk of all cause mortality and the rate of bloodstream infection and hospital admission.

Recent guidance from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence has proposed no antibiotic or delayed antibiotic prescriptions when infection is likely to be self limiting in an effort to reduce inappropriate prescribing. Evidence and recommendations, however, refer mainly to upper respiratory tract infections. Evidence is nonetheless emerging that delayed prescribing in the treatment of UTI is becoming more acceptable in practice.

A randomised controlled trial evaluated various antibiotic management strategies, including empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics and immediate antibiotics strategies for UTI in women younger than 70 years. No significant differences in symptom duration, severity, or frequency of symptoms between the strategies were reported. In our study, deferred antibiotics were associated with less severe adverse outcomes than no antibiotics for older adults but still showed a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with immediate antibiotics.

The question remains as to why a significant proportion (about 7%) of vulnerable older patients had a diagnosis of UTI but were not prescribed antibiotics. It could be patient or doctor choice, but it is also possible that antimicrobial stewardship programmes and quality premium payments are encouraging a culture of more judicious antibiotic use. Public Health England recently reported a 13.2% reduction in antibiotic prescribing in primary care between 2013 and 2017.

There is also a major concern about the risk of C difficile infection in elderly people associated with antibiotic use, which also includes trimethoprim.

Other circumstances, such as the presence of mild urinary symptoms, may encourage clinicians to withhold antibiotics in the context of a working diagnosis of UTI. Nevertheless, if this explanation holds true, patients with disease not severe enough to prompt antibiotic treatment are at risk of severe consequences.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^117BfiK4]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis of pooled data from seven studies (six of which were randomized), there were significantly fewer symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients receiving prophylaxis during removal of a urinary catheter than in those not receiving prophylaxis. Our finding in favor of antibiotic prophylaxis, however, must be tempered by possible publication bias toward positive studies, the limitations of the included studies, and practical considerations about encouraging more widespread antibiotic use.

Indwelling urinary catheters pose several risks to patients, including urethral trauma, discomfort, and urinary tract infection. In an era of increasingly constrained fiscal resources and evolving antibiotic resistance, evidence based antimicrobial prescribing is essential to promote antimicrobial stewardship. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on whether clinicians should prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to patients when an indwelling urinary catheter is removed.

Current practice and variation in study designs

Administration of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of removal of a catheter might already be common practice, particularly among urologists. In a survey by Wazait and colleagues, conducted in 2004, antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of catheter removal was practiced by 60% of respondents from various medical specialties, and 40% of urologists indicated that they used antibiotic prophylaxis in all patients. At the time of that survey, however, little objective evidence was available to guide management of bacteriuria after catheterization. Variation in clinical practice is therefore not surprising given the inconclusive evidence at that time. In addition, the survey by Wazait and colleagues showed that there was heterogeneity in the selection and duration of prophylactic antimicrobial agents. This variation in practice was also evident in the trials included in our meta-analysis and precludes any formal recommendations about choice of antibiotics or duration of treatment. Ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the most common drugs used, followed by nitrofurantoin (one study) and cefotaxime (in the oldest study). Dose varied from single dose to multiple day administration. Of note, current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in uropathogens clearly argue against the promotion of the use of both trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Nitrofurantoin, although its activity is limited to the lower urinary tract, has broad activity against Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens and an acceptable toxicity profile and is not associated with important resistance issues.

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^113MtEQu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

Antimicrobial overuse is a major health care issue that contributes to antibiotic resistance. Such overuse includes unnecessarily long durations of antibiotic therapy in patients with common bacterial infections, such as acute bronchitis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and cellulitis. This article describes best practices for prescribing appropriate and short-duration antibiotic therapy for patients presenting with these infections.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative literature review of published clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, and individual studies that addressed bronchitis with COPD exacerbations, CAP, UTIs, and cellulitis. This article is based on the best available evidence but was not a formal systematic review. Guidance was prioritized to the highest available level of synthesized evidence.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should limit antibiotic treatment duration to 5 days when managing patients with COPD exacerbations and acute uncomplicated bronchitis who have clinical signs of a bacterial infection (presence of increased sputum purulence in addition to increased dyspnea, and/or increased sputum volume).

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should prescribe antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia for a minimum of 5 days. Extension of therapy after 5 days of antibiotics should be guided by validated measures of clinical stability, which include resolution of vital sign abnormalities, ability to eat, and normal mentation.

Best Practice Advice 3

In women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, clinicians should prescribe short-course antibiotics with either nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose. In men and women with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, clinicians should prescribe short-course therapy either with fluoroquinolones (5 to 7 days) or TMP-SMZ (14 days) based on antibiotic susceptibility.

Best Practice Advice 4

In patients with nonpurulent cellulitis, clinicians should use a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci, particularly for patients able to self-monitor and who have close follow-up with primary care.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^112XZiFX]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Blood cultures were obtained in 339 patients, of which 80 (24%) had bacteremia with growth of E. coli in the majority of the cases (n = 67, 84%).

Both treatment regimens resulted in a high clinical cure rate at short-term follow-up in the ITT population (90% vs. 95% in patients treated for 7 or 14 days, respectively) (Table 3). The difference in short-term clinical cure rate between both treatment arms was 4.5% (90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7, P non-inferiority = 0.072). Accordingly, the criteria for non-inferiority were not met as the 90% CI exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The median time to defervescence did not differ between the two groups: 2 (IQR, 1–2) days in 7-day antimicrobial treatment, 2 (IQR, 1–3) days in 14-day antimicrobial treatment. Short-term clinical cure was 85% in non-randomized patients, whereas median time to defervescence amounted to 2 (IQR, 1–3) days. Among all analysis performed, there were no significant differences between ITT and PP analysis. Therefore, within the following, only outcomes of ITT analysis are presented.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113bqtGg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — women with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI): Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence from a Cochrane review of studies published from 1977 to 2003 included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 6,016) and found no differences between fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, or nitrofurantoin versus TMP-SMX in short-term (within two weeks of treatment) or long-term (up to 8 weeks) symptomatic or bacteriological cure, with risk ratio (RR) estimates close to 1.0; results were similar with treatment durations of 3 days or 7 to 10 days and across specific fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin). For harms, fluoroquinolones (2 trials; pooled RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.43; I2 = 0%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; I2 = 0%) were associated with lower likelihood of rash than TMP-SMX, there was no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events though estimates favored fluoroquinolones (3 trials; RR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.14; I2 = 39%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.41; I2 = 0%), and there was no difference between β-lactams and TMP-SMX in rates of rash or other harms.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^1111HVc1]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

There was significant variation in the duration of monitoring after catheter removal, ranging from about four days in the study of Pfefferkorn and colleaguesto six weeks in the study by Pinochet and colleagues. Also, various antimicrobial agents were used (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and a cephalosporin). The duration of prophylaxis ranged from single dose administrationto three day courses. The study by Harding and colleagues also had an arm in which patients were given a 10 day course of antibiotics; this arm was not considered in our meta-analysis because 10 days was thought to represent pre-emptive treatment rather than prophylaxis.

The funnel plot (fig 3) suggests some publication bias, but funnel plots can be difficult to interpret if the number of included studies is small. In addition, asymmetrical funnel plots are not sufficient proof of publication bias. Alternative explanations for asymmetry include heterogeneity between studies with the intervention fidelity or outcome assessment, as well as improved standard of care in the control groups as routine management evolves over time, which reduces the observed effect size. It is also possible that an asymmetric funnel plot is the result of chance alone.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113HmjFr]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognised threat to global health, with the United States alone accounting for 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35 000 deaths each year. Increasing realisation of the need to minimise this public health threat can be seen in the efforts of regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, which recently established requirements for antimicrobial stewardship for ambulatory healthcare organisations, effective at the beginning of 2020. The new requirements mandate that such organisations provide resources to practitioners to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices.

Although most studies of outpatients have focused on implementing antibiotic stewardship for upper respiratory infections, there is also a high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary care, including overuse of fluoroquinolones and longer duration of treatment than recommended by guidelines. A study in France found that only 20% of outpatient UTIs were treated with the guidelines-recommended drug, dose and duration. An Irish study found that only 55% of the antibiotic prescriptions for UTI in general practice were appropriate. Of 7738 outpatient encounters for UTI in Israel, 91% were treated with a longer duration of antibiotics than recommended by guidelines. A recent US study revealed that fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI, comprising up to 49% of prescriptions. Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones is especially concerning because it promotes the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain sequence type 131. In addition, continued overprescribing of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis in patients with other treatment options is occurring in the United Statesdespite two black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoroquinolones due to an association between their use and serious side effects. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with more central nervous system-related and gastrointestinal-related adverse events compared with other types of antimicrobials in a recent meta-analysis. Excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis is another common problem documented internationally. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelinesrecommend nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and a single dose of fosfomycin as the first-line regimens for uncomplicated cystitis. In our previous study in the same setting, most prescriptions for trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones had a treatment duration longer than recommended.

Next, a daily "post-process" was performed to generate the final recommendations presented to physicians. The daily recommendation preparation process included three steps: (1) filtering antibiotic recommendations based on clinical constraints in the patient's medical record and determining the recommended dose and duration (Supplementary Fig. 4); (2) selecting the commercial drug code for each antibiotic's main generic ingredient based on the current pharmaceutical HMO preference for generic agents available for prescription. (3) recommending the top two antibiotics as per descending sensitivity score.

Antibiotic prioritization framework (Fig. 5B): To balance between minimizing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and optimizing treatment outcomes, a predetermined target ranking was created for antibiotics. The ranking was determined through a comprehensive evaluation of local guidelines for UTI management and local antibiotic susceptibility profiles, safety profiles, efficacy, and patient adherence to therapy. An agile frequency table, including six antibiotic regimens for treating UTIs, was built. The table provided target values for the percentage of each antibiotic prescribed for UTIs among MHS patients, assuming that all patients receive antibiotics on the same day. The designated target values for six antibiotics were as follows: Nitrofurantoin (40%), Fosfomycin (30%), Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (12%), Cefuroxime (9%), Cephalexin (5%), and Ciprofloxacin (4%). These values could be readily modified in response to changes in resistance patterns or further evaluation of the model performance to optimize treatment outcomes.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^111UXBQU]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge the limitations of this retrospective cohort study. First, our study was not designed to assess causality, and there are important differences (known and unknown) between residents who received suboptimal and optimal antibiotic treatment. While we did adjust for confounders of suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes, our findings neither confirm nor deny a causal relationship, as our findings may be confounded by unmeasured factors which affect suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes. As such, while we found an association between suboptimal antibiotic treatment and poor clinical outcomes even after adjusting for several resident and CLC characteristics, this association may be impacted by residual confounding. Second, we defined UTI based on a urine culture and antibiotic treatment, per recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. While we excluded patients with other positive cultures and only included those exposed to common antibiotics recommended by national guidance or with reliable urinary concentrations, the antibiotic treatment captured may have been targeting another non-urinary tract infection type or asymptomatic bacteriuria. Additionally, we did not capture UTIs in which a urine culture was not obtained. Urine culturing practices are not standardized across VA CLCs, and some facilities may only recommend obtaining UTI cultures in certain clinical situations, such as recurrent infection. However, our population was mostly a complicated, male population, in which urine cultures would be generally recommended. Third, no established definitions for suboptimal antibiotic treatment of residents with UTI have been developed. There is no IDSA guidance for the treatment of complicated UTIs in males, so we based suboptimal treatment definitions on available guidelines for uncomplicated infection in females and expert opinion. Suboptimal antibiotic treatment is multifactorial and as such we considered three elements of suboptimal treatment (drug choice, dose frequency, and longer duration). However, other elements, such as drug strength and route of administration may also be suboptimal. Insufficient treatment duration is also a clinical problem. We excluded those treated for 2 days or less, but some residents may have still been exposed to insufficient treatment durations. Future research should continue to investigate and operationalize the definition of suboptimal antibiotic treatment among residents with UTI. Additionally, while we conducted analyses by subtype of suboptimal treatment, comparative analyses are warranted to determine which individual aspects of suboptimal antibiotic treatment (the drug choice, dose frequency, or longer than recommended duration) are the most strongly associated with poor outcomes. Forth, we measured all-cause hospitalizations, ED visits, and mortality. Our frail older resident population is already at risk for these events and many of the events observed may have not been related to antibiotic use. Alternatively, we likely underestimated antibiotic-related adverse events, as these events may not have been coded or other codes were used. Adverse events are difficult to identify in large databases as they are often not recorded in health claims and reports. Fifth, while we investigated five potential harms of suboptimal antibiotic use, we did not assess the development of colonization or infection with resistance, which is a well-known harm of antibiotic use. Finally, the generalizability of our findings conducted in a largely older male population may be limited to other non-VA long-term care populations.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^113B3mZi]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

UTI is often overdiagnosed and overtreated in the elderly population. Studies have suggested that UTI is misdiagnosed in 40% of hospitalised elderly patients. Clinicians often misdiagnose UTI in the elderly who present with non-specific symptoms such as anorexia, fatigue, malaise, or generalised weakness. Antibiotic therapies are commenced in this group of patients without sufficient evidence supporting a diagnosis of UTI. Therefore, it is unsurprising that UTI rates as the second most common reason for empirical antibiotic therapy in secondary care. While the SIGN guidance for the management of suspected bacterial UTI in adults recommends that urine cultures are appropriate in certain cases (where symptoms are resistant to trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin, UTI in men and pregnant women), their algorithm for the treatment of UTI in the elderly recommends the collection and analysis of urine samples in all cases, once a diagnosis of UTI has been made based on symptoms and signs. Antimicrobials should then be tailored in light of sensitivities, switching to narrow spectrum if possible. In view of increasing Clostridium difficile infection and antibiotic resistance, it is imperative that changes are made to the management of UTIs in the elderly population.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^114pht5t]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic drug containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, prescribed for multiple indications and is the fourth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Its use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death among people taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. This may be owing to acute kidney injury, a rapid deterioration in kidney function. Alternately, co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim alone have both been associated with an increased risk of an acute rise in potassium levels, hyperkalaemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

Existing evidence has important limitations. It is not clear if the association between co-trimoxazole and adverse outcomes is owing to the sulfamethoxazole or the trimethoprim component. The observed association may be owing to confounding if the combination antibiotic was used for patients with more severe infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. Finally, existing evidence is primarily associated with specific groups of patients such as those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. In the UK, co-trimoxazole is licensed for specific, uncommon indications and trimethoprim is more commonly used. However, there are efforts to reduce trimethoprim prescribing due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. In 2015 over 3.7 million prescriptions for trimethoprim were dispensed in England and it remains a first line option for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite this, whether trimethoprim alone is linked to sudden death both in the general population and in high risk groups is unknown.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) [^113oPfZ7]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults

For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.

Shigellosis

For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated.

Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia

For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

Traveler's Diarrhea in Adults

For the treatment of traveler's diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli.

### Urinary tract infection in male general practice patients: uropathogens and antibiotic susceptibility [^116PNFRY]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate uropathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility in male general practitioner (GP) patients presenting with an uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI).

Material and Methods

A population-based study was conducted among males, 18 years and older, general practice patients, who had symptoms indicative of an uncomplicated UTI. A UTI was defined as ≥ 10³ colony-forming units/mL (CFU/mL). The etiology of the infection, antimicrobial susceptibility, and treatment strategies used by the GP were determined.

Results

Escherichia coli was most frequently isolated (48%), followed by other enterobacteriaceae (24%) and enterococci (9%). The etiology of infection was age-dependent; E. coli was more frequently isolated in younger patients and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the elderly. The overall susceptibility rates were low for amoxicillin (63%) and trimethoprim (70%), and high for fluoroquinolones (91%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (90%), which is similar to susceptibility rates in females with UTIs from the same population. Antibiotics were prescribed to 59% of the males with symptoms of UTI. Fluoroquinolones were given to 33% of the patients and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to 24%. No difference in antibiotic prescription, nor in duration of therapy, was found between the different age groups.

Conclusions

In the male presenting with complaints of an acute uncomplicated UTI at the GP, E. coli, followed by other Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently isolated uropathogens. Susceptibility rates in uncomplicated male and female UTIs were similar, indicating that data from UTI susceptibility studies in females from the same geographic region can be useful in the choice of empirical therapy in males.

### The IOU consensus recommendations for empirical therapy of cystitis in nursing home residents [^112zjydu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish consensus recommendations for empirical treatment of uncomplicated cystitis with anti-infectives in noncatheterized older nursing home residents to be implemented in the Improving Outcomes of UTI Management in Long-Term Care Project (IOU) funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Design

Two-round modified Delphi survey.

Participants

Expert panel of 19 clinical pharmacists.

Measurements

Comprehensive literature search and development/review/edit of draft survey by the investigative group (one geriatric clinical pharmacist, two geriatric medicine physicians, and one infectious disease physician). The expert panel members rated their agreement with each of 31 recommendations for drugs of choice, dosing medications at various levels of renal function, drug-drug interactions to avoid, and duration of therapy by sex on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Consensus agreement was defined as a lower 95% confidence limit of 4.0 or higher for the recommendation-specific mean score.

Results

The response rate was 95% for the first round, and three recommendations achieved consensus (dosing for nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in those without chronic kidney disease, and drug-drug interaction between trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and warfarin). In the second round, 90% responded and reached consensus on an additional eight recommendations (two for nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as initial drugs of choice, three for dosing ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at various levels of chronic kidney disease, and three drug-drug interactions to avoid: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with phenytoin and ciprofloxacin with theophylline or with tizanidine).

Conclusion

An expert panel of clinical pharmacists was able to reach consensus on a set of recommendations for the empirical treatment of cystitis with oral anti-infective medications in older nursing home residents. The recommendations were incorporated into a treatment algorithm for uncomplicated cystitis in noncatheterized nursing home residents and used in educational materials for health professionals in an ongoing controlled intervention study.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^114RLvXD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^1148ZfsU]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Our results show that trimethoprim is associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia compared with other antibiotic drugs for a UTI, among the general population aged 65 and over, and not just those treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. However, this is not associated with an increased risk of death.

### A seven-day course of TMP-SMX may Be as effective as a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis [^112dV6U2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend either 14 days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or 7 days of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis. Antibiotic courses of 7 days of TMP-SMX vs 7 days of ciprofloxacin for pyelonephritis have not been previously compared. We evaluated the odds of a subsequent, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) for women with Escherichia coli pyelonephritis receiving a 7-day course of TMP-SMX vs a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin.

Methods

Women ages 16 years and older with E. coli pyelonephritis presenting to 5 health care facilities in the greater Maryland area between 2010 and 2016 receiving either TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin were included. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (a) pregnancy, (b) dialysis dependency, (c) E. coli not susceptible to the treatment prescribed, (d) polymicrobial urine culture, or (e) > 48 hours of antibiotic therapy other than TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin.

Results

Of 272 women meeting eligibility criteria, 81 (30%) and 191 (70%) received 7 days of TMP-SMX and 7 days of ciprofloxacin, respectively. In an adjusted model, the likelihood of a recurrent UTI within 30 days for the TMP-SMX and ciprofloxacin groups was similar (adjusted odds ratio 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–7.42).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy may result in similar clinical outcomes compared with 7 days of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis. Considering the frequency of pyelonephritis and risks of antibiotic resistance and associated toxicities, decreasing the duration of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis may impact a large number of women.

### Oral β-lactam antibiotics vs fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for definitive treatment of enterobacterales bacteremia from a urine source [^112kdCWi]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Oral β-lactam antibiotics are traditionally not recommended to treat Enterobacterales bacteremia because of concerns over subtherapeutic serum concentrations, but there is a lack of outcomes data, specifically after initial treatment with parenteral antibiotics. Given the limited data and increasing limitations of fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), oral β-lactam antibiotics may be a valuable additional treatment option.

Objective

To compare definitive therapy with oral β-lactam antibiotics vs fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX for Enterobacterales bacteremia from a suspected urine source.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2007, to September 30, 2015, at 114 Veterans Affairs hospitals among 4089 adults with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, or Proteus spp bacteremia and matching urine culture results. Additional inclusion criteria were receipt of active parenteral antibiotic(s) followed by conversion to an oral antibiotic. Exclusion criteria were previous Enterobacterales bacteremia, urologic abscess, or chronic prostatitis. Data were analyzed from April 15, 2019, to July 26, 2020.

Exposures

Conversion of therapy to an oral β-lactam antibiotic vs fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX after 1 to 5 days of parenteral antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was a composite of either 30-day all-cause mortality or 30-day recurrent bacteremia. Propensity-based overlap weights were used to adjust for differences between groups. Log binomial regression models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (aRRs) and adjusted risk differences (aRDs).

Results

Of the 4089 eligible patients (3731 men [91.2%]; median age, 71 years [interquartile range, 63–81 years]), 955 received an oral β-lactam antibiotic, and 3134 received fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX. The primary outcome occurred for 42 patients (4.4%) who received β-lactam antibiotics and 94 patients (3.0%) who received fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX (aRD, 0.99% [95% CI, -0.42% to 2.40%]; aRR, 1.31 [95% CI, 0.87–1.95]). Mortality rates were 3.0% (n = 29) for patients receiving β-lactam antibiotics vs 2.6% (n = 82) for those receiving fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX (aRD, 0.06% [95% CI, -1.13% to 1.26%]; aRR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.67–1.56]). Recurrent bacteremia rates were 1.5% (n = 14) among those receiving β-lactam antibiotics vs 0.4% (n = 12) among those receiving fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX (aRD, 1.03% [95% CI, 0.24%-1.82%]; aRR, 3.43 [95% CI, 0.42–27.90]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of adults with E coli, Klebsiella spp, or Proteus spp bacteremia from a suspected urine source, the relative risk of recurrent bacteremia was not significantly higher with β-lactam antibiotics compared with fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX, and the absolute risk and risk difference were small (ie, < 3%). No significant difference in mortality was observed. Oral β-lactam antibiotics may be a reasonable step-down treatment option, primarily when alternative options are limited by resistance or adverse effects. Further study is needed because statistical power was limited owing to a low number of recurrent bacteremia events.

### Antimicrobial for 7 or 14 days for febrile urinary tract infection in men: a multicenter noninferiority double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^112RVKPh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in men remains controversial.

Methods

To compare 7 days to 14 days of total antibiotic treatment for febrile UTIs in men, this multicenter randomized, double-blind. placebo-controlled noninferiority trial enrolled 282 men from 27 centers in France. Men were eligible if they had a febrile UTI and urine culture showing a single uropathogen. Participants were treated with ofloxacin or a third-generation cephalosporin at day 1, then randomized at day 3–4 to either continue ofloxacin for 14 days total treatment, or for 7 days followed by placebo until day 14. The primary endpoint was treatment success, defined as a negative urine culture and the absence of fever and of subsequent antibiotic treatment between the end of treatment and 6 weeks after day 1. Secondary endpoints included recurrent UTI within weeks 6 and 12 after day 1, rectal carriage of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacterales, and drug-related events.

Results

Two hundred forty participants were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic therapy for 7 days (115 participants) or 14 days (125 participants). In the intention-to-treat analysis, treatment success occurred in 64 participants (55.7%) in the 7-day group and in 97 participants (77.6%) in the 14-day group (risk difference, -21.9 [95% confidence interval, -33.3 to -10.1]), demonstrating inferiority. Adverse events during antibiotic therapy were reported in 4 participants in the 7-day arm and 7 in the 14-day arm. Rectal carriage of resistant Enterobacterales did not differ between both groups.

Conclusions

A treatment with ofloxacin for 7 days was inferior to 14 days for febrile UTI in men and should therefore not be recommended.

Regarding medical management for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to duration of antibiotics, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to consider completing 3 days of antimicrobial treatment in ≤ 65 years old female patients developing CA-UTI without upper urinary tract symptoms, after the indwelling catheter has been removed.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^111KgKpK]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

For 7.2% (n = 22 534) of the UTI episodes a record of an antibiotic prescription in primary care was lacking and 6.2% (n = 19 292) were related to a delay in antibiotic prescribing. For those participants prescribed antibiotics for a UTI episode, 73.8% (n = 200 078) received either trimethoprim (54.7%; n = 148 333) or nitrofurantoin (19.1%; n = 51 745); cephalosporins or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were prescribed for 11.5% (n = 31 090) and 9.5% (n = 25 616) of these episodes, respectively, whereas quinolones were prescribed in 4.4% (n = 11 995). Pivmecillinam, which was only included among recommended first line treatments in PHE guidelines in October 2014, was prescribed for 0.4% (n = 1084) of these episodes (table 2).27

Patients older than 85 years, living in a deprived area, with a high Charlson comorbidity index score, were mainly managed using either deferred antibiotics or a no antibiotics approach, whereas patients aged between 65 and 74 years were mainly prescribed immediate antibiotics. The female:male ratio was also much higher in the immediate antibiotics group compared with the other groups. A course of antibiotics was more often prescribed at the first visit to the GP or with a delay in patients experiencing recurrent UTIs. Patients who were prescribed antibiotics or were discharged to the hospital within 30 days before the index UTI event were more often prescribed deferred antibiotics or no antibiotics (table 1).

Overall, 7.5% (n = 23 502) of the UTI episodes involved at least one of a range of specific or non-specific signs or symptoms within 30 days before the index UTI. Pain, dysuria, micturition frequency, incontinence, and haematuria were the five most frequent symptoms encountered 30 days before a UTI was diagnosed, and 90.8% (19 666/21 668) of the participants with these symptoms recorded were prescribed antibiotics. This proportion was lower for participants with non-specific signs such as confusion (77.9%; 136/1459) and malaise (86.6%; 596/688) (table 1).

### Urinary tract infection in male veterans: treatment patterns and outcomes [^113HkUjC]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Lengthier antimicrobial therapy is associated with increased costs, antimicrobial resistance, and adverse drug events. Therefore, establishing minimum effective antimicrobial treatment durations is an important public health goal. The optimal treatment duration and current treatment patterns for urinary tract infection (UTI) in men are unknown. We used Veterans Affairs administrative data to study male UTI treatment and outcomes.

Methods

Male UTI episodes in the Veterans Affairs system (fiscal year 2009) were identified by combining International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes with UTI-relevant antimicrobial prescriptions. Episodes were categorized as index, early recurrence (< 30 days), or late recurrence (≥ 30 days) cases. Drug name, treatment duration, and outcomes (recurrence and Clostridium difficile infection during 12 months) were recorded for index cases. Demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics were assessed for associations with outcomes in univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

Among 4 854 765 outpatient male veterans, 39 149 UTI episodes involving 33 336 unique patients were identified, including 33 336 index cases (85.2%), 1772 early recurrences (4.5%), and 4041 late recurrences (10.3%). Highest-use antimicrobial agents were ciprofloxacin (62.7%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.8%); 35.0% of patients received shorter-duration treatment (≤ 7 days), and 65.0% of patients received longer-duration treatment (> 7 days). Of the index cases, 4.1% were followed by early recurrence and 9.9% by late recurrence. Longer-duration treatment was not associated with a reduction in early or late recurrence but was associated with increased late recurrence compared with shorter-duration treatment (10.8% vs 8.4%, P < .001), including in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10–1.30). In addition, C difficile infection risk was significantly higher with longer-duration vs shorter-duration treatment (0.5% vs 0.3%, P = 0.02) and exhibited a similar suggestive trend in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.97–2.07).

Conclusion

Longer-duration treatment (> 7 days) for male UTI in the outpatient setting was associated with no reduction in early or late recurrence.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^117Xzkrt]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Our study therefore aimed to investigate the association between trimethoprim and acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death in a cohort of patients aged 65 and over. To limit confounding by antibiotic indication we restricted our analysis to patients with an antibiotic prescription for the same indication (UTI) and examined the risk of adverse outcomes in patients prescribed trimethoprim and four comparison antibiotics (amoxicillin, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin). However, even when treatment is restricted to the same indication, different classes of antibiotic drugs are prescribed in slightly different clinical scenarios. For simple UTIs in adults, current UK guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin as the first line treatment (except for patients with poor renal function) and trimethoprim as a first line alternative where there is low risk of microbial resistance. Ciprofloxacin and cefalexin are not currently recommended treatments for simple UTIs (although ciprofloxacin is a first line option for pyelonephritis) but are used for patients with resistance to first line antibiotics. In addition, ciprofloxacin and cefalexin were used in practice as treatment for simple UTIs during the years covered by this study. We aimed to address the impact of these different usage patterns on the outcomes through adjustment for a range of comorbidities and sensitivity analyses.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^114mLbfd]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The only subtype of potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment that was associated with the composite poor clinical outcome and CDI in our study was potentially suboptimal dose frequency. The risk of CDI was 2.42 times higher among those treated with a suboptimal dose frequency versus optimal treatment. Potentially suboptimal dose frequency was also associated with hospitalization/ED visits and all-cause mortality. In prior work, a dose-dependent increased risk of CDI has been observed, with increasing cumulative defined daily dose of antibiotics resulting in increasing risks of CDI. Our results suggest that dose frequency, in addition to drug choice and antibiotic duration, may also impact risk of CDI and other poor outcomes.

We found no difference in risk for UTI recurrence for residents treated with potentially suboptimal or optimal antibiotic treatment. Previous work has found that among women with UTI, longer courses of antibiotics may be associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI, possibly due to alterations in urogenital flora. However, among males with UTI treated in the outpatient setting, longer treatment duration was not associated with UTI recurrence, nor was antibiotic choice. Interestingly, for unclear reasons, among the subgroup of residents treated with initial beta-lactam therapy, suboptimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of UTI recurrence which requires further investigation.

It is possible that suboptimal initial treatment could lead to clinical failure, the consequences of which could be serious and may include bacteremia, urosepsis, acute care hospitalization, and potentially death. In our study, suboptimal treatment was not associated with mortality. It is possible that despite being suboptimal, an appropriate agent was ultimately used considering the susceptibility of the uropathogen causing the UTI. Three previous studies have similarly demonstrated that inappropriate empiric therapy for UTI was not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Excessive treatment duration versus optimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of mortality. The optimal duration of treatment of males with UTI is largely unknown. In females, durations as short as 3 days are recommended for those with uncomplicated infection, but for males longer durations between 7 and 14 days are generally recommended. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal treatment duration in males to decrease the risk of treatment failure.

### Risk factors for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole-resistant Escherichia coli in ED patients with urinary tract infections [^114CVrxj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended as one of the first-line empiric therapies for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, institutions that observe resistance rates exceeding 20% for Escherichia coli (E. coli) should utilize alternative empiric antibiotic therapy per the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Identifying risk factors associated with TMP-SMX resistance in E. coli may help guide empiric antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective study included adult patients who were discharged from 12 emergency departments (EDs) with a urine culture positive for E. coli between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between potential risk factors and TMP-SMX resistance. The overall institutional antimicrobial resistance rates for E. coli were compared to the rates seen in the study population of ED urinary isolates.

Results

Among 427 patients included from a randomized sample of 500 with a urine culture positive for E. coli, 107 (25.1%) were resistant to TMP-SMX. Three predictors of TMP-SMX resistance were identified: recurrent UTI (OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.27–3.99]), genitourinary abnormalities (OR 2.31 [95% CI 1.17–4.49]), and TMP-SMX use within 90 days (OR 8.77 [95% CI 3.19–28.12]). When the antibiotic susceptibilities for this ED cohort were compared to the institutional antibiogram, the TMP-SMX resistance rate was found to be higher in the ED population (25.1% vs 20%).

Conclusions

TMP-SMX should likely be avoided as first-line therapy for UTI in patients who have recurrent UTIs, genitourinary abnormalities, or have previously received TMP-SMX within the past 90 days. The use of an ED-specific antibiogram should be considered for assessing local resistance rates in this population.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. In this article, the authors review the evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department. They review the pathophysiology and describe the initial diagnostic workup, spending some time discussing the urine dipstick. The authors discuss whether hospital antibiograms are useful in making the initial antibiotic choice. The treatment section reviews the current recommendations and also highlights the use of nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. The authors also discuss the appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs.

Interventions

AF: The first page of the confidential personalised prescribing tool shows 2019–2020 first-line prescribing patterns for oral antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated lower UTI and the current recommendations for BC. The primary recommendation is to choose nitrofurantoin for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI. A second message recommends choosing fosfomycin as first-line therapy for patients who cannot tolerate nitrofurantoin due to allergy or have impaired renal function. A final recommendation advises against prescribing ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and other antibiotics as first-line empiric therapy due to bacterial resistance rates in BC and adverse effects associated with fluoroquinolones. Each message is accompanied by a bar chart depicting the physicians' individual prescribing compared with the average BC FP. The second page of the AF provides supporting evidence for why nitrofurantoin is recommended for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI including a graph of 10-year history of E. coli isolates resistance rates by an antibiotic agent from the BC Centre for Disease Control Antimicrobial Resistance Dashboard. It shows escalating resistance to cephalexin over 50%, relative stability of∼40% resistance to amoxicillin, ∼20% resistance to ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX and low or declining < 10% resistance to nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. This makes it visually obvious which antibiotic is least likely to be resisted.

The evidence summary describes antimicrobial best practices for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated lower UTI in BC. It recommends diagnosing uncomplicated UTI based on patient symptoms and against routine use of a urine dipstick/urinalysis or urine culture for diagnosing as testing abnormalities increase with age. Empiric treatment with nitrofurantoin (Macrobid 100 mg two times a day or Macrodantin 50 mg four times a day) for 5–7 days is recommended with fosfomycin recommended as an alternative when there is an allergy or intolerance to nitrofurantoin. TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams are unsuitable for empiric therapy (unguided by susceptibility profile) in BC due to bacterial resistance.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

Randomization and interventions

The allocation of patients to either the PCT-pyuria group or the control group was based on a pre-specified computer generated randomization list and was concealed on the study website.

Clinical presentation without (control group) or with PCT and pyuria (PCT-pyuria group) was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy. The choice of antibiotics and the minimal duration of therapy were based on recent guidelines. The algorithm is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Algorithm for procalcitonin (PCT) and pyuria-guided therapy. TMP-SMX, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; NSAIDs, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; eGFR, Estimated glomerular filtration rate with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation.

For simple UTIs, we used fosfomycin (3 g single dose), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (800/160 mg twice daily) for estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m² or ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². In the PCT-pyuria group, patients with uncomplicated simple UTIs were planned to receive only non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 3 days regardless of PCT-values.

For febrile UTIs/pyelonephritis, ciprofloxacin was chosen as standard oral treatment for better comparability with recent studies (500 mg orally twice daily, respectively ciprofloxacin 250 mg orally twice daily for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²), if intravenous therapy was necessary ceftriaxone (2 g once daily) was chosen. When known, antibiotic resistance profiles of prior or current pathogens were taken into account and antibiotic therapy was adjusted.

In inpatients in the PCT-pyuria group, antibiotic duration was based on absolute PCT-values and relative decreases of PCT-levels, as well as pyuria. PCT and pyuria were measured on admission in all patients; in hospitalized patients, the measurements were continued every other day till the end of antibiotic therapy. For outpatients in the PCT-pyuria group, antibiotic duration was calculated according to absolute values of PCT at baseline. In the control group, antibiotic therapy durations were recommended based on current guidelines (Figure 1).

Each of these regimens has been shown to decrease the morbidity of recurrent UTIs without a concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance. Long-term studies have shown antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective for up to five years with trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin, without the emergence of drug resistance. 3, 19 Unfortunately, antibiotic prophylaxis does not appear to alter the natural history of recurrences because 40 to 60 percent of these women reestablish their pattern or frequency of infections within six months of stopping prophylaxis.
19. Complicated UTI A complicated UTI is one that occurs because of anatomic, functional or pharmacologic factors that predispose the patient to persistent infection, recurrent infection or treatment failure.

These factors include conditions often encountered in elderly men, such as enlargement of the prostate gland, blockages and other problems necessitating the placement of indwelling urinary devices, and the presence of bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. Although antibiotic-susceptible. The initial empiric therapy for these patients should include an agent with a broad spectrum of activity against the expected uropathogens. Treatment most often includes a fluoroquinolone, administered orally if possible. Patients with complicated UTIs require at least a 10- to 14-day course of therapy. Follow-up urine cultures should be performed within 10 to 14 days after treatment to ensure that the uropathogen has been eradicated.

Recent studies have shown that patients initially placed on parenteral therapy can be switched to oral therapy within 72 hours as long as they are clinically improving and able to tolerate the oral agent, and a regimen is available that covers the identified pathogen. Symptomatic bacteriuria in a patient with an indwelling Foley catheter should be treated with antibiotics that cover potential nosocomial uropathogens. Patients with mild to moderate infections may be treated with one of the oral quinolones, usually for 10 to 14 days. Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary in patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medications. The recommended duration of therapy for severe infections is 14 to 21 days.

Treatment is not recommended for catheterized patients who have asymptomatic bacteriuria, with the following exceptions: patients who are immunosuppressed after organ transplantation, patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis and patients who are about to undergo urinary tract instrumentation.

### Don't use antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults… [^116FiRMC]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Cohort studies have found no adverse outcomes for older men or women associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Antimicrobial treatment studies for asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults demonstrate no benefits and show increased adverse antimicrobial effects. Consensus criteria have been developed to characterize the specific clinical symptoms that, when associated with bacteriuria, define urinary tract infection. Screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended before urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated.
