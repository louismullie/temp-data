## Question

Can Lamictal be used to treat ITP?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lamotrigine (Lamictal) should be used to treat immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what current ITP guidelines recommend as standard therapies. Then, I should verify lamotrigine's approved indications and any plausible mechanisms relevant to platelet autoimmunity or thrombopoiesis. Next, I will review lamotrigine's hematologic safety profile, especially risks for thrombocytopenia or cytopenias. After that, I should check for any evidence linking lamotrigine to drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) or bleeding manifestations. Finally, I will synthesize these points into a clear recommendation and note any exceptions and monitoring if lamotrigine must be used for another compelling indication in an ITP patient [^112NMVhK] [^1111QdM5].

> Let me first confirm the benchmark for ITP care so I don't jump to conclusions; standard first-line therapy includes corticosteroids with or without IVIG or anti-D, while second-line options include thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrombopag, romiplostim, avatrombopag), rituximab, fostamatinib, and splenectomy, none of which include lamotrigine in recommended algorithms, so I should double-check guidelines to be certain lamotrigine is not mentioned as therapy for ITP [^112NMVhK] [^111cUdiS] [^117MXzwT].

> I need to check lamotrigine's pharmacologic purpose; it is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer for epilepsy and bipolar disorder, and I don't see a therapeutic mechanism that would reduce immune-mediated platelet destruction or stimulate platelet production, which makes a disease-modifying role in ITP biologically implausible on first principles and by labeling history [^116szzRX].

> Wait, let me verify the hematologic safety signals; the FDA labeling for lamotrigine carries serious warnings about blood dyscrasias and immune/hyperinflammatory syndromes including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, DRESS, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, any of which can worsen cytopenias and bleeding risk in someone with ITP and directly conflict with the goal of maintaining a safe platelet count [^116szzRX] [^116sHpRH].

> Hold on, I should review whether lamotrigine specifically triggers thrombocytopenia; drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia is a recognized entity and lamotrigine has been implicated in case-based pharmacovigilance and clinical reports of thrombocytopenia and purpura, though the strength of evidence is observational rather than randomized, and this still flags a risk that is clinically meaningful in ITP patients [^113Y8WVM] [^113rQrpU] [^116sHpRH].

> Hmm, wait a minute — earlier I almost said "contraindicated"; I should be precise here: the FDA label does not list a formal absolute contraindication specific to pre-existing ITP, but the presence of label warnings for serious hematologic adverse reactions, including thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, means lamotrigine can precipitate or exacerbate low platelets, so functionally it is ill-suited and potentially harmful in ITP unless no safer neurologic alternative exists [^116szzRX] [^116sHpRH].

> Next, I should align risks with therapeutic goals; ITP management aims to raise platelets to a hemostatic level and reduce bleeding using evidence-based agents like TPO-RAs, rituximab, fostamatinib, or splenectomy, whereas lamotrigine's documented hematologic risks and lack of ITP efficacy signal are directly counter to those goals, and compelling trial and regulatory data support the approved options and their dosing strategies rather than off-target anticonvulsants [^1111QdM5] [^114WU8aJ] [^1168PtTA] [^116eFi4d].

> But wait, what if the patient truly needs lamotrigine for seizures or bipolar disorder; I should confirm the risk-mitigation approach: if lamotrigine must be used despite ITP, ensure a baseline CBC and frequent CBC monitoring during titration and dose changes, maintain heightened vigilance for early signs of hypersensitivity, fever, rash, liver dysfunction, or bleeding, and have a low threshold to discontinue the drug if platelet counts fall or systemic hypersensitivity features emerge, recognizing that safer alternative antiepileptics may be preferable in collaboration with neurology and hematology [^116szzRX] [^116sHpRH].

> Synthesizing the evidence, I need to ensure the conclusion is clear and clinically actionable: lamotrigine should not be used to treat ITP and may worsen thrombocytopenia; guideline-directed ITP therapies should be selected instead, and lamotrigine — if required for a separate neurologic indication — should only be continued with close hematologic monitoring and shared decision-making given its hematologic risk profile [^112NMVhK] [^111cUdiS] [^116szzRX] [^116sHpRH].

Lamotrigine (Lamictal) is **not indicated for** immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). It is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer [^116szzRX] that can cause thrombocytopenia as a rare adverse effect. If thrombocytopenia occurs, **discontinue lamotrigine** and manage ITP with standard therapies such as corticosteroids [^1111QdM5], IVIG [^116Qk9D1], rituximab [^112NMVhK], or thrombopoietin receptor agonists [^117MXzwT]. It should be **avoided** in patients with a history of drug-induced thrombocytopenia [^115dbmhu].

---

## Pharmacological profile of lamotrigine

Lamotrigine is **an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer** approved for epilepsy and bipolar disorder [^116szzRX]. It inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, reducing glutamate release and neuronal excitability [^116szzRX]. It is **not indicated for ITP or other hematologic disorders** [^111D26Sr].

---

## Lamotrigine and thrombocytopenia

Lamotrigine has been **associated with thrombocytopenia** as a rare adverse effect [^116sHpRH], including immune-mediated forms [^116szzRX]. The FDA label warns of blood dyscrasias — thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia [^116szzRX] [^116sHpRH]. Thrombocytopenia usually occurs within weeks to months of initiation and resolves after discontinuation.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding lamotrigine and ITP

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting lamotrigine for ITP; rather, it has been implicated in drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) [^113Y8WVM], which is distinct from primary ITP and is characterized by a rapid, often severe platelet drop that resolves after stopping the drug [^115dbmhu].

---

## Mechanisms of lamotrigine-induced thrombocytopenia

Lamotrigine-induced thrombocytopenia is thought to be **immune-mediated**, with drug-dependent antibodies [^115DNAFT] that bind platelets in the presence of lamotrigine, leading to destruction via complement activation or phagocytosis [^113Y8WVM]. This mechanism differs from primary ITP, which involves autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins [^114voZcX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do **not recommend** lamotrigine for ITP; it is not listed as a treatment option [^111D26Sr]. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) and other authorities recommend corticosteroids, IVIG [^1111QdM5], rituximab [^112NMVhK], and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrombopag, romiplostim) [^117MXzwT] as standard therapies.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of lamotrigine in ITP patients

Lamotrigine carries **significant risks** in patients with thrombocytopenia or ITP, including:

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Rare but potentially severe [^116sHpRH] [^116szzRX].
- **Pancytopenia**: Reduction in multiple blood cell lines [^116sHpRH].
- **Aplastic anemia**: Rare but serious [^116sHpRH].
- **Immune-mediated reactions**: Including DRESS and HLH [^116sHpRH] [^116szzRX].

Given these risks, **use lamotrigine cautiously** in patients with pre-existing thrombocytopenia or ITP, and monitor platelets regularly [^116szzRX].

---

## Alternative treatments for ITP

Effective **alternatives** to lamotrigine for ITP include [^1111QdM5]:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Corticosteroids | Immunosuppression and reduced platelet destruction | First-line therapy [^111D26Sr] [^1111QdM5] |
| IVIG | Immune modulation and rapid platelet increase | First-line therapy [^111D26Sr] [^116Qk9D1] |
| Rituximab | B-cell depletion and reduced autoantibody production | Second-line therapy [^112NMVhK] |
| Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrombopag, romiplostim) | Stimulate platelet production | Second-line therapy [^117MXzwT] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where lamotrigine might be considered

Lamotrigine may be considered in ITP patients only for **coexisting epilepsy or bipolar disorder** requiring mood stabilization. In such cases, close monitoring of platelet counts is essential; consider alternative anticonvulsants or mood stabilizers if thrombocytopenia develops [^113Y8WVM].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

If lamotrigine is used in ITP patients, **the following strategies are recommended**:

- **Regular platelet monitoring**: Baseline and periodic CBCs.
- **Patient education**: Report bleeding, bruising, or petechiae promptly.
- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop lamotrigine if significant thrombocytopenia occurs [^115dbmhu].
- **Alternative therapies**: Use standard ITP treatments if thrombocytopenia persists [^111D26Sr].

---

Lamotrigine is **not indicated for ITP** and may cause thrombocytopenia. It should be **avoided** in patients with a history of drug-induced thrombocytopenia; standard ITP therapies should be used instead [^111D26Sr].

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^111TE1pw]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) experience a high burden of disease, making it essential to offer management options that improve quality of life. Whenever possible, treatment options compatible with the personal preferences and lifestyle of the patient should be offered. Oral treatments taken once a day may be preferred by some patients, while others may favor injections administered less frequently. For patients wishing to minimize their medication and monitoring needs, splenectomy may be the most desirable option. An in-depth understanding of second-line treatment options can help optimize the management of ITP and patient outcomes by ensuring the best use of available therapeutic options.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115XZsxe]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

What if the immune thrombocytopenia is secondary to other blood disorders?

While chronic lymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome would be very unlikely in our patient given her young age, other clinical conditions could be present, such as autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. It has not yet been decided which tests should be performed to search for specific conditions, particularly if there are no specific symptoms suggesting a particular entity. We assay immunoglobulin levels and conduct thyroid tests in our patients, as we did in this young woman. Ideally, in the future, there would be an established panel of tests for patients with putative ITP which would explore inherited thrombocytopenias, bone marrow failure, secondary ITP, other diagnoses that could resemble ITP such as myelodysplastic syndrome, markers of the future course of the ITP, the degree of bleeding, and to which treatments the patient would respond best.

What is the optimal second-line treatment for a young female with immune thrombocytopenia?

There are numerous options that can be considered in this non-pregnant premenopausal female.

- **Rituximab**: Rituximab and other (generic) anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies exert immunosuppressive effects by depleting B lymphocytes. This occurs uniformly in the blood and bone marrow, but what happens to B cells in lymph nodes is not well-defined. Women under the age of 40 years with a less than 2-year history of ITP usually respond to rituximab, with the response rate and "cure" rate.

Regarding medical management for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, specifically with corticosteroids and IVIG, the 2019 ICR guidelines recommend considering the administration of IVIG in pregnant patients with immune thrombocytopenia. This is to urgently increase platelet count during bleeding or for delivery, recognizing that IVIG provides a rapid but often very transient increase in platelet count.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^117Qvw6E]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Transitioning to second-line therapy**: My approach to selecting patients for second-line therapy is depicted in Figure 1. If a first-line therapy has produced a response that lasted for > 6 months and was tolerable, the patient could be re-treated with it. However, I generally discontinue first-line therapy and switch to second-line therapy if any of the following criteria are met: (1) the patient cannot tolerate first-line treatment; (2) the patient does not respond to first-line treatment within 2–4 weeks; (3) the patient's response to the last course of therapy is lost within 6 months, including a failure to taper corticosteroids to a low dose (i.e. prednisone ≤ 5 mg/day) due to loss of response. In addition to these criteria, patient preferences and treatment burden should also be incorporated in decision-making.

Figure 1 shows the selection of patients for second-line treatment of ITP. General management suggestions are shown. Clinicians should make individualized treatment decisions that take into account the patient's comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal values and preferences. ITP, immune thrombocytopenia; QOL, quality of life. Corticosteroids are standard first-line therapy and may be combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) when a more rapid response is required. Either IVIg or anti-D may be used as first-line treatment if corticosteroids are contraindicated. Anti-D should be considered only in nonsplenectomized, Rh+ patients who have a negative direct antiglobulin test.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^112XACYQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). High credibility.

Despite these limitations, this systematic review of the literature provides a comprehensive and updated view of the evidence around the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of second-line treatments for adult primary ITP based on nearly 200 studies conducted in several populations worldwide. It confirms that a gap remains: outside of the TPO-RAs eltrombopag and romiplostim, the majority of treatment options for managing persistent thrombocytopenia are still without rigorous evidence from RCTs to demonstrate safety and efficacy in this setting. Many treatments have limited supportive evidence of any kind.

These findings are echoed in a recent review by Lambert and Gernsheimer, although not systematic in nature but based on extensive clinical experience. They conclude that for the second-line treatment of adult ITP patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding, evidence supports medical alternatives to splenectomy. This is specifically in the context of both TPO-RAs, which are now backed by long-term follow-up data on efficacy and safety.

### Comparison of up-front treatments for newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia - a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117ADBdy]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review and network meta-analysis of the efficacy of up-front treatments for newly diagnosed ITP included 21 trials with 1,898 randomly assigned participants. Our main findings showed significantly superior sustained response (SR) for the rhTPO + dexamethasone and rituximab + dexamethasone arms compared to those for the conventional therapies (PSL and dexamethasone monotherapy). Moreover, both rhTPO + dexamethasone and rhTPO + PSL also improved the early overall response (OR) compared to PSL, dexamethasone, or rituximab-containing regimens. Therapy-related adverse events showed similar profiles and were tolerable in all treatment arms.

The superior efficacy of rhTPO + dexamethasone compared to PSL or dexamethasone monotherapy as an initial treatment for newly diagnosed ITP concerning long-term SR has been first shown in this meta-analysis. This methodology demonstrates more formally what some clinicians have suspected, and the result suggests that TPO-RA may possibly be a first choice for the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP, in addition to therapy-resistant or chronic ITP, in which the additive effects of TPO-RA have previously been shown in various RCTs and systematic reviews. Our results are partially supported by previous studies that analyzed blood thrombopoietin concentrations; serum thrombopoietin levels in patients with newly diagnosed ITP are within the normal range or only minimally elevated compared to those of healthy people, although data on serum thrombopoietin levels were not available in any RCT included in our study. Attention should be paid to the fact that in all treatment arms, the…

### Insights on treatment of adult ITP: Algorithm for management and role of multimodal therapy [^114dntzB]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Low credibility.

The management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is continuously evolving with the development and introduction of newer therapies and a better understanding of the disease. Corticosteroids still represent the cornerstone of first-line treatment. Patients who fail to achieve remission with a short course of corticosteroids require subsequent therapy. Most guidelines recommend starting with either a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), rituximab, or fostamatinib since these agents have been investigated in randomized trials and have well-characterized efficacy and safety profiles. Patients' involvement to reach a shared decision regarding the choice of therapy is essential as these treatments have different modes of administration and mechanisms of action. Less than 10% of patients will fail to respond to and/or be intolerant of multiple second-line therapeutic options, thus being considered to have refractory ITP and requiring a third-line therapeutic option. Such patients may require drugs with different targets or a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Combining a TPO-RA and an immunomodulatory agent may be an appropriate approach at this stage. Many studies have been conducted during the last two decades investigating the efficacy and safety of combination strategies for first and later lines of therapies, yet none of these are recommended by guidelines or have gained wide acceptance and consensus.

### Contemporary management of primary immune thrombocytopenia in adults [^113mhdD2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a syndrome of diverse disorders that share immune-mediated thrombocytopenia but differ in pathogenesis, natural history, and response to therapy. ITP may occur without an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or as a sequela of various associated conditions (secondary ITP). Primary ITP remains a diagnosis of exclusion, essential to differentiate from non-autoimmune etiologies of thrombocytopenia and secondary causes of ITP.

The traditional management objective is to provide a hemostatic platelet count (> 20–30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ in most cases) while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. Treatment goals should be tailored to the individual patient and clinical setting. Corticosteroids, supplemented with either intravenous immune globulin G or anti-Rh(D) as needed, are used as upfront therapy to stop bleeding and acutely raise the platelet count in patients with newly diagnosed or newly relapsed disease.

Although most adults with primary ITP respond to first-line therapy, the majority relapse after treatment tapering and require a second-line approach to maintain a hemostatic platelet count. Standard second-line options include splenectomy, rituximab, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists, romiplostim and eltrombopag. Studies directly comparing the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of these approaches are lacking. In the absence of such data, we do not favor a single second-line approach for all patients. Instead, we consider the pros and cons of each option with our clinical judgment.

### Fostamatinib for the treatment of adult persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia: Results of two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^114WU8aJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). High credibility.

Prior to randomization, patients had a washout period during which therapeutic agents, other than those allowed as concomitant ITP therapies, were discontinued for up to eight weeks. Patients were allowed to continue one concomitant ITP medication (corticosteroids at < 20 mg prednisone equivalent per day, azathioprine, or danazol) throughout the study without any changes if they were on a stable dose for 14 days prior to baseline. Rescue therapies, such as increased dosing of concomitant ITP therapy, IVIg, IV anti-D, steroids, and platelet transfusion, were allowed.

Fostamatinib was administered at 100 mg BID and could be increased to 150 mg BID after four weeks or later, depending on platelet count. Doses could be reduced to fostamatinib 100 or 150 mg once daily if a dose‐limiting adverse event occurred. The need for dose modifications was determined during biweekly visits. Patients who completed the 24‐week study treatment could enroll in the long‐term, open‐label extension study (Study 049; NCT02077192). Nonresponders who were treated for ≥ 12 weeks and received 150 mg BID of the study drug for ≥ 4 weeks could also enter the extension study.

- **Efficacy and safety assessments**: The primary efficacy endpoint was a stable response by week 24, defined as platelet counts ≥ 50,000/μL on at least four of the six clinic visits occurring every two weeks during weeks 14–24 inclusive. Patients receiving rescue medication after week 10 were considered nonresponders. A secondary efficacy platelet endpoint was measured in patients with a baseline platelet count < 15,000/μL: achievement of platelet counts.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: Can we change outcomes [^116cAR6d]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia, resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production, is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors, including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, preventing bleeding, and inducing remission. Standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable.

This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account the assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Updated international consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^117VSebh]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, particularly in the context of managing the fetus or neonate, the ICR 2019 guidelines recommend administering IVIG and limited corticosteroids. This regimen is advised to maintain a platelet count of greater than 100×10⁹/L for one week, if possible, and more than 50×10⁹/L for an additional week in neonates with ICH. It is important to recognize that the use of platelet transfusion may increase neonatal risk.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^113xXaiY]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia that can lead to an increased tendency to bleed. Although it typically presents as a subtle-onset, chronic syndrome in adults, with no forewarning symptoms or illness, clinical manifestations can range from minor bruising to severe hemorrhaging. The primary goal of treatment is to achieve a safe platelet count, above which a patient does not experience bleeding episodes, and this is determined on a case-by-case basis.

Common first-line therapies include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and anti-D (Rho[D] immune globulin intravenous). Relapse or failure to respond to these may necessitate second-line treatment, which can include splenectomy or various medical therapies, most of which have not been approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of ITP. However, they have been used because of efficacy demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases or as immune suppressants.

Splenectomy has historically been considered the second-line therapy of choice in adult ITP. A systematic review was previously conducted to examine studies (published from 1966 to 2003) that assessed the efficacy/effectiveness of medical treatments for adult patients with ITP who have not responded to splenectomy. The review covered a total of 90 studies representing 656 patients who were splenectomized, aged over 16 years, had ITP for over 3 months, and a platelet count less than 50 × 10⁹/L. Only one study was a randomized controlled trial.

### Lamotrigine and anti-seizure medications in HLH: A systematic review [^115XZga1]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine and other anti-seizure medications have been reported to cause both haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). HLH and DIHS have many characteristic clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings, as well as underlying mechanisms. We identified significant clinical overlap between these two syndromes in our systematic review. Notably, the presence of haemophagocytosis on bone marrow biopsy, while supportive, is not exclusive to or synonymous with a diagnosis of HLH.

### Rituximab in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia: What is the role of this agent in 2019 [^111XNAAt]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Twenty years after the first use of rituximab in ITP, published studies show an ORR of nearly 60% and a CR rate of 50%. Long-term remissions occur in 20–30% of patients, with slightly different outcomes possibly related to different selection of populations of patients.

In the interpretation of the results, it is worth noting that heterogeneous criteria for response were adopted across different studies (according to older or updated criteria); moreover, older studies included mostly chronic, plurirefractory patients, while in the more recent studies, patients with newly diagnosed/persistent ITP were also included. Finally, the ability to compare studies is often only partial because of different follow-up periods.

The data from placebo-controlled studies seem discouraging, but some considerations should be made: in the experimental treatment and placebo arms, patients were allowed to continue corticosteroid therapy, which could have biased the results. In the placebo arms, the ORR were 67% (39% CR) and 73% (46% CR). Probably a more meaningful observation is that the median time to relapse in patients who achieved an overall response was 36 weeks in the rituximab group and 7 weeks in the placebo group.

The main criticism that only 20% to 30% of patients achieve long-term remission for more than 3–5 years deserves further consideration. The main "error" was probably the mistaken belief that rituximab could represent the medical substitute of splenectomy: a single treatment administered once in a lifetime that could definitively cure many or even most patients.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^111d3nJz]. Haematologica (2022). High credibility.

What would we have liked to have been able to offer our two patients with immune thrombocytopenia?

First, it would have been beneficial to predict their course, considering many factors: risk of bleeding, likelihood of chronicity, effectiveness of treatments, and potential toxicity.

Second, identifying a curative yet non-toxic treatment would be ideal. We discussed rituximab for a younger woman, as there is a good likelihood of cure in a patient of this age and gender. However, for other patients, the likelihood of cure is low, and in her case, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination presented an issue. This leaves splenectomy as an option, which is remarkably effective; recent work suggests it remains effective even for patients previously treated with thrombopoietin agents. Why are patients hesitant to undergo splenectomy? Perhaps primary reasons include uncertainty about natural improvement, the success of splenectomy, and the irreversibility of the procedure. Additionally, the risks of sepsis and thrombosis post-splenectomy persist lifelong.

In the future, using combinations of agents (dexamethasone and rituximab, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil, dexamethasone and eltrombopag, or others) within one week of diagnosis may offer a higher cure rate and justify the extra expense and risks involved in these interventions.

Finally, treatment selection could be more rational if data were provided by randomized, controlled trials comparing different agents and regimens.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^111TT4vg]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a complicated disease due to its heterogeneity and lack of diagnostic markers, making treatment selection difficult. The most straightforward management aspect is at the presentation of ITP. If the platelet count is very low and no other findings are present, the worldwide consensus treatment is steroids. Whether dexamethasone, prednisone/prednisolone (prednis[ol]one), or intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone is used, the response rate and side effects are relatively predictable. IV methylprednisolone or dexamethasone increases platelet counts faster and may have fewer side effects than weeks of prednis(ol)one treatment. Questions revolve around whether to add IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and/or platelet transfusion. While the latter is rarely appropriate, if there is serious bleeding and/or the diagnosis is unclear, an analysis based on medical records in the United States identified that as many as 25% of ITP patients receive platelet transfusion, which is far too many.

The management of ITP becomes more complicated if other findings arise, if patients do not respond to steroids, or if patients continue to require treatment. Both the American Society of Hematology guidelines and an international consensus report emphasize that continued steroid use beyond 6 weeks is to be avoided. Compliance with this strong recommendation entails earlier use of "second-line" therapy in patients with ITP, a practice already gaining traction. However, the definition of "early" remains fluid; "early" can be at 1 month of steroid treatment.

### Lamotrigine and anti-seizure medications in HLH: A systematic review [^1126NAaz]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review explores the use of lamotrigine and other anti-seizure medications in the treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The analysis focuses on the effectiveness and safety profiles of these medications in managing HLH symptoms. Despite the potential therapeutic roles, findings suggest that further clinical trials are required to establish definitive treatment recommendations.

### Lamotrigine and anti-seizure medications in HLH: A systematic review [^113Jx7Kn]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of HLH: five of the eight criteria must be met [Table S1]. To account for cases where HLH was clinically suspected but a complete work-up may not have been reported, we defined 'suspected HLH' as meeting four of the eight criteria. We also included the H-score for each case by extracting the relevant outcome data and calculating it for most cases, where it was not explicitly reported by the authors. The H-score was also used to define confirmed (H > 169) or suspected HLH (H > 138 in adult and H > 120 in pediatric patients). The H > 169 threshold was obtained from the original study, and the lower thresholds were identified from a later validation study. The RegiSCAR score was used to define DIHS overlap, with a score of 1 or less defined as 'no DIHS', 2–3 as 'possible DIHS', 4–5 as 'probable DIHS', and 6 or higher as 'definite DIHS'. We extracted the clinical features involved in the RegiSCAR score and calculated and interpreted it except in cases where it was explicitly reported by the authors.

We identified 31 cases of ASM-associated HLH, of which 20 cases were attributable to lamotrigine as the sole ASM or a new medication added to a stable regimen (Figure S1: PRISMA flowchart; Table 1). Other aromatic ASMs, including carbamazepine (3), phenobarbital (2), and oxcarbazepine (1), accounted for six cases, while valproic acid (3) and multiple medications (2) were implicated in the other five cases [Table 1]. The median age of patients was 27 years, with a range of 3–66 years; there were 23 adult and [text is incomplete].

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: Can we change outcomes [^115cE4iR]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia, resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production, is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors, including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, preventing bleeding, and inducing remission.

Standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable.

This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account the assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Pathophysiology and management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia: Focusing on what matters [^114voZcX]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. Antibody-mediated platelet destruction has been the prevailing hypothesis to explain ITP pathogenesis, supported by the efficacy of B-cell depletion therapy; however, the recent success of thrombopoietin receptor agonists lends support to the notion that platelet production is also insufficient. Best practice for the management of chronic ITP has not yet been established because data from comparative trials are lacking.

Despite renewed interest in novel drugs capable of increasing platelet counts, ultimate treatment goals for ITP patients must be kept in mind: to improve patients' health and well-being. In this article, the pathophysiology of ITP is reviewed and key remaining questions about mechanism are explored. A rational approach to the management of ITP in adults is outlined, acknowledging evidence and evidence gaps, and highlighting the need for clinically important endpoints in future clinical trials.

### Identifying drugs that cause acute thrombocytopenia: An analysis using 3 distinct methods [^115DNAFT]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) is often suspected in patients experiencing acute thrombocytopenia that cannot be explained by other causes. However, documenting that a drug is the causative factor of thrombocytopenia can be challenging. To aid in the diagnosis of DITP and support drug safety surveillance, we analyzed three distinct methods to identify drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia.

- **Published case reports**: A total of 253 drugs were suspected of causing thrombocytopenia; using defined clinical criteria, 87 (34%) of these were identified with evidence linking the drug to thrombocytopenia.

- **Serum sample testing**: Serum samples from patients with suspected DITP were tested for 202 drugs. Drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies were identified for 67 drugs (33%).

- **FDA Adverse Event Reporting System**: The database was searched using data mining algorithms for drugs associated with thrombocytopenia. Out of 1444 drugs with at least one report linked to thrombocytopenia, 573 (40%) demonstrated a statistically distinctive reporting association with the condition.

Among 1468 drugs suspected of causing thrombocytopenia, 102 were evaluated by all three methods. Notably, 23 of these 102 drugs showed evidence of an association with thrombocytopenia across all three methods. This study demonstrates that multiple methods, each providing a distinct perspective, can significantly contribute to the identification of drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^114Zx88e]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are conventionally considered lifelong therapies that need continuous use to maintain response. However, accumulating data suggest that some patients using TPO-RAs may achieve long-term remissions sustained off treatment. Although randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term studies directly demonstrating the remission-inducing potential of TPO-RAs are not available, it appears unlikely that the remissions observed in TPO-RA discontinuation studies are purely spontaneous. Earlier studies showed that the rate of spontaneous remissions in adult patients is only about 9%, while the overall rate of long-term (≥ 6 months) remission in TPO-RA studies is nearly 30%.

Spontaneous remissions are less frequent following the first year after diagnosis, yet most patients achieving remission in TPO-RA studies had ITP for more than one year, with some living with ITP much longer (up to 54 years). The authors speculate that this putative disease-modifying activity of TPO-RAs could be linked to the TPO-RA–mediated restoration of impaired regulatory T-cell function and immune tolerance observed in patients with ITP.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^115pQuDG]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

**Second-line treatment options**: Second-line or maintenance therapy in persistent or chronic ITP (hereafter referred to as ITP) aims to establish a durable platelet response and to minimize bleeding events with a treatment that is safe, tolerable, and convenient for long-term management. Splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), and rituximab are the standard second-line treatment options in use. Before the initiation of a second-line therapy, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis of primary ITP by excluding potential non-immune causes of thrombocytopenia, as well as causes of secondary ITP if these have not been previously ruled out.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^113djX1u]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with immune thrombocytopenia who do not adequately respond to first-line therapy, there is no clear consensus on which second-line therapy to initiate and when. This situation leads to suboptimal approaches, including prolonged exposure to treatments that are not intended for long-term use (e.g. corticosteroids) and overuse of off-label therapies (e.g. rituximab) while approved, more efficacious options exist. These approaches may not only fail to address symptoms and burden of disease but may also worsen health-related quality of life. A better understanding of available second-line treatments may ensure the best use of therapeutic options and thereby optimize patient outcomes.

### Localized purpura associated with lamotrigine [^113rQrpU]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Antiepileptic drug hypersensitivity syndrome consists of fever, rash, and internal organ involvement and usually occurs within the first two months of initiation of therapy. This report describes a 13-year-old female with a right frontal high-grade glioma and complex partial seizures, who developed localized purpura after 23 months of lamotrigine monotherapy. This case study is the second report of localized purpura after prolonged lamotrigine treatment, suggesting this may be an atypical lamotrigine-induced drug reaction.

- **Third-line therapy for immune thrombocytopenia and beyond**: What happens if the thrombopoietin agent used in the two patients does not work or at least cannot be tapered?

In the case of the young woman, the platelet count remained less than 20x10⁹/L, and she experienced heavy menses, bruising, and nosebleeds. The now 26-year-old woman opted for rituximab. She had a long-term response but unfortunately relapsed after four years. She considered repeating the rituximab and undergoing splenectomy but opted to try a different thrombopoietin agent since she was not planning another pregnancy in the immediate future. Previously, she used eltrombopag, so she now tried avatrombopag. On a dose of 20 mg/day, she was able to maintain an adequate platelet count and is very slowly tapering her dose. This choice was consistent with evidence that not responding well to one TPO-RA does not preclude a good response to another.

Our older male patient, given his continued bruising and minor nosebleeds, was afraid of major bleeding; he also felt very tired even though he was not anemic. The now 64-year-old man opted to try rituximab since avatrombopag did not work well for him. He received the standard dose of rituximab with dexamethasone. He responded with a platelet count of 60×10⁹/L by six weeks after initiating treatment; however, his count started to fall monthly, down to 30x10⁹/L. He and his doctor decided to initiate mycophenolate mofetil, and he began with a dose of 500 mg twice daily and then increased to 1000 mg twice a day. He tolerates this treatment well.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^1162FrCh]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

The agents listed as "other treatments" have been utilized in ITP as alternative treatments due to cost and availability considerations. However, these agents may produce highly variable responses in individual patients and may require weeks or months to be effective. Thus, they may potentially be of use as adjunct therapy in patients with insufficient response to second-line therapy. They are not recommended for most patients unless available second-line options have been exhausted. An important exception is for patients in countries where access to TPO-RAs and rituximab is limited.

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^116VkjRU]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

We are confident that increased awareness of the relevance of the disorders discussed in this review series may stimulate further basic and clinical research. Cutting-edge technologies and bioinformatics applied to genomics will contribute to the identification of an increasing number of inherited thrombocytopenias and make their diagnosis easier and more precise. Perhaps more importantly, we need a reinvigorated international collaboration to produce large cohorts of patients with long-term follow-up to better capture the most relevant outcomes of these disorders. Regarding drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, the recent unexpected emergence of thrombocytopenic disorders after COVID-19 vaccination or after the introduction of an increasing list of innovative drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, calls for supranational pharmacovigilance systems and the creation of easily accessible, updated repertories of drugs identified or suspected to cause immune or non-immune thrombocytopenias. While waiting for artificial platelets to become available in clinical settings and potentially make platelet transfusion an obsolete practice, the potential benefit of increasing natural thrombopoiesis in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and other thrombocytopenias needs to be further exploited by well-designed prospective studies investigating old and new TPO-RA.

### Case of lamotrigine-induced drug adverse reaction under tocilizumab treatment with clinical and virological features of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome [^116cb1Ct]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The pathological mechanisms and immunological kinetics of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), including the relevance of interleukin (IL)-6, remain unclear. We report a case of drug adverse reaction that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria of DIHS but mimics its characteristic features. Because the patient was under anti-IL-6 therapy at the onset, some symptoms typically seen in DIHS were absent, such as fever and leukocyte count abnormalities. However, the characteristic features of DIHS were clearly observed in the subsequent course, including the repeated recurrence of skin rash, prolonged liver dysfunction, and reactivation of herpes viruses. This case suggested that the role of IL-6 at the onset is not a main factor to determine the subsequent pathomechanism of DIHS, and attention should be paid to the preceding therapy for achieving an accurate diagnosis.

### Dapsone for primary immune thrombocytopenia in adults and children: an evidence-based review [^113tpLKz]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Primary immune thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening condition. Approximately two-thirds of adult patients do not have a sustained response to steroids, which are considered first-line therapy. For these patients, several other treatment options exist, such as rituximab, splenectomy, immunosuppressants, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. However, these options are costly and associated with side effects. Dapsone, on the other hand, is an inexpensive drug with a well-established safety profile. Unfortunately, this treatment option has not been adequately explored. This review aims to analyze the currently available evidence for the use of dapsone as second-line or third-line therapy in primary immune thrombocytopenia.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115rnTag]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

What if none of the obvious options, such as thrombopoietin agents, rituximab, or splenectomy, helps and no single treatment, including fostamatinib and mycophenolate mofetil, is effective?

It is difficult to predict what approach will be effective in these "refractory" patients. If a patient has been on too low a dose or for too short a period, it may not be clear that a given medication will not be helpful.

The approach to difficult-to-treat patients, such as these examples, is discussed at great length in our review of refractory ITP and in another recent review. The major principles are:

- **Reconfirming the diagnosis**: Reconsider all options if the response to treatments of ITP is absent or very limited.

- **Bone marrow examination**: Do a complete bone marrow examination, unless one was performed recently, with aspirate, biopsy, flow cytometry, and cytogenetics.

- **Combination therapy**: If a treatment is ineffective, continue the treatment and add another treatment, initiating combination therapy. In our opinion, this is preferable to discontinuing the ineffective treatment and starting another one.

- **Single vs. combination treatments**: If indeed the case is refractory ITP, combination approaches are often better than single treatments. Including treatments with different mechanisms of effect is useful; however, there are situations in which two agents targeting the same mechanism are effective, such as combining IVIG and IV anti-D.

- **Treatment selection**: When using combination treatments, it would be ideal not to give maximum doses and to select agents with differing toxicities. If an adverse event requiring a change in treatment occurs, it is then easier to choose.

### Efficacy and safety of treatments in newly diagnosed adult primary immune thrombocytopenia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1111QdM5]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease characterized by decreased platelet count and an increased tendency for bleeding due to excessive platelet destruction and/or insufficient platelet production. The incidence of ITP is 3.3 per 100,000 adults per year, with a prevalence of 9.5 per 100,000 adults. The majority of patients are asymptomatic or experience only mild mucocutaneous hemorrhage, while about 5% of patients may suffer from lethal bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage.

Since the first International Consensus Report on ITP was released in 2008, corticosteroid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and Rho(D) immune globulin (Anti-D) have been listed as the first-line treatments. As the initial choice and most frequently used therapy, corticosteroids are recommended by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) for adults with newly diagnosed ITP (< 3 months) and a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L, whether bleeding or not. Approximately 80% of patients with ITP respond to corticosteroids, but over 50% relapse after the steroids taper off. Over the last two decades, numerous investigations into the pathogenesis have further emphasized the heterogeneity and complexity of ITP. In recent years, several novel drugs, such as rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) — including romiplostim, eltrombopag, and avatrombopag — have been developed and applied in the management of ITP. Moreover, researchers have repurposed some readily available drugs based on updates on the pathogenesis of ITP, such as all-trans retinoic acid, tacrolimus, and oseltamivir.

Thrombocytopenia after drug administration can be associated with bleeding or thrombosis, depending on the pathophysiology of platelet destruction. Significant progress has been made over the last two decades in understanding the pathogenetic mechanism of drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DITP). However, there are still numerous diagnostic and treatment challenges, especially in critically ill patients, including the difficulty in distinguishing drug-associated thrombocytopenia from secondary thrombocytopenia caused by underlying disorders.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^116reRJY]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

This article summarizes our approach to the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), its secondary forms, and the choice of second-line treatment options. We very briefly summarize first-line treatment and then utilize a case-based approach. We first explore persistent, chronic ITP in a younger female, considering many possibilities beyond primary ITP, such as hypogammaglobulinemia, chronic infection, and anemia, and how to approach their diagnosis and management.

The journey continues throughout pregnancy, the post-partum period, and eventually includes fourth-line treatment following a late relapse. We then consider an older male, emphasizing differences in diagnostic considerations and management. The focus is on the initiation and continuation of second-line treatment, the pros and cons of each option, and briefly, the impact of treatment choices related to the endemic presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

During the review of potential second-line treatment options, we also briefly touch upon novel treatments. Finally, there is a short section on refractory disease drawn from our previous extensive review published in February 2020. The clinical nature of the discussions, replete with figures and tables and with the interspersion of pearls regarding efficacy and toxicity at different ages and genders, will serve the reader in the management of "typical" adult patients who develop persistent and chronic ITP.

### Rituximab in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia: What is the role of this agent in 2019 [^117EyEcy]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, based on what has been published in the last 20 years, it is still difficult to give clear indications on when, to whom, and how rituximab should be administered. In 2019, the choice of rituximab over other treatment options has to be weighed considering the individual patient's features and expectations, the disease's characteristics, the availability of the drug, and the single center's experience.

The authors of this review think that rituximab still represents a valuable therapeutic option for patients with ITP and, based on knowledge, believe that it should be considered especially (although not exclusively) at an early stage of the disease, as second- or third-line therapy, in young patients (particularly young women) and in patients treated with curative purposes.

### Efficacy and safety of dapsone in adult primary immune thrombocytopenia [^115Emnv6]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

These results show that the place of dapsone as a second-line treatment for primary adult ITP is more limited than previously assessed in retrospective studies. Dapsone remains an affordable option, which might be useful for a subset of patients with ITP, potentially with nonsevere persistent ITP. In countries where other treatments for ITP are approved and readily available, its use should be restricted.

### Cost-effectiveness of second-line therapies in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia [^114FXNRH]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Low credibility.

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from a healthcare sector perspective. Both cost and health outcomes were appropriately discounted by 3% annually. We measured the cost-effectiveness of the treatment strategies by estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), representing the difference in total costs divided by the difference in effectiveness associated with each pairing of the six treatment sequences considered.

We began by ordering the strategies by their costs in ascending order. Next, we identified and excluded strongly and weakly dominated strategies. A treatment strategy was deemed strongly dominated when it was associated with higher costs and fewer QALYs relative to the next less costly strategy. A treatment strategy was deemed weakly dominated when a combination of two alternative strategies was associated with improved costs and benefits.

Finally, we determined a cost-effective strategy using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $195,300 per QALY, derived from the 2019 per capita U.S. gross domestic product, as previously reported. We also reported the net monetary benefit of each strategy. The net monetary benefit is calculated by multiplying the effectiveness in QALYs by the willingness-to-pay and subtracting the cost of the given strategy.

Other immunomodulators

Previously, immunomodulatory agents were widely used as second-line treatments, but drawbacks include the need to wait 1–3 months for the platelet count to increase, side effects (depending on the agent) such as hepatic toxicity, and the need to take these medications consistently long-term. If a single agent is used, the risk of infection despite the immunosuppression seems very small, but for these agents, efficacy is less than 50%. This group is lumped together as if all agents are the same; it potentially includes mycophenolate mofetil, danazol, dapsone, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide.

Recently, a randomized controlled trial of steroids given with or without mycophenolate mofetil within one week of the diagnosis of ITP showed that the "cure" rate was higher in the combination arm. One surprise was that quality of life was significantly lower among patients treated with the combination despite them having a better platelet response. Another surprise was that more than 50% of patients on the steroid-alone arm were cured despite a low rate of dexamethasone usage and that 27% of the patients were over 65 years of age. The study nonetheless highlighted the potential advantage of earlier use of second-line treatment.

There are at least 20 studies of danazol, almost all of which demonstrated a positive effect on platelet counts; this drug induces facial hair and acne and may be toxic to the liver. Dapsone, beyond an immunosuppressive effect, induces hemolysis, which mimics IV anti-D in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

### Lamotrigine and anti-seizure medications in HLH: A systematic review [^113u94dC]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The majority of medication-associated HLH presented with initial symptoms — such as fever, skin rash, and cytopenias — within three weeks of drug initiation (19 of the 20 lamotrigine-associated cases and 6 of the 11 multidrug cases) with a median time of two weeks. In all cases, the drug was discontinued upon recognition of DIHS or HLH.

The most common treatment regimens employed included the HLH-1994 chemotherapy protocol in the form of etoposide and dexamethasone or other steroids (12 cases), high-dose corticosteroids only (12 cases), or in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (7 cases). Other adjunctive treatments included:

- Intrathecal methotrexate (2 cases)
- Anakinra (1 case)
- Emapalumab (1 case)
- Hydroxychloroquine (1 case)
- Mycophenolate (1 case)

In one case, drug discontinuation and supportive management only were employed. Outcomes were favorable: 26 of the 31 cases achieved complete clinical resolution, two had a chronic relapsing recurring course, and three patients died.

Seven of the 31 ASM-associated HLH cases also had probable or definite DIHS, with one further case being formally diagnosed by study authors as DIHS, though per reported data, meeting the possible range with a score of 3. There were an additional 12 of the 31 cases with a score of 2–3, meeting a diagnosis of possible DIHS. The most common overlapping features were fever, transaminitis, and a diffuse erythematous skin rash. Lamotrigine and other aromatic ASMs accounted for 18 of the 20 cases.

### Markers of refractory primary immune thrombocytopenia [^112XrQD4]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

Refractory immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a challenging disease that can be defined by refractoriness to second-line treatments. In this review, we list and comment on the available evidence about clinical and biological factors associated with refractoriness to splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), rituximab, and fostamatinib, as well as those associated with multirefractory ITP (active disease with failure of rituximab, TPO-RAs, and splenectomy).

### State of the art - how I manage immune thrombocytopenia [^116pGhdm]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is rapidly evolving. Over the last 15 years, a number of novel treatments have improved practice, introducing many steroid-sparing agents and reducing the progression to splenectomy. Although clinical care has improved, many therapeutic challenges remain. There is no diagnostic test or biomarkers to direct treatment, and few comparative studies exist to aid management decisions. Developing up-to-date guidelines is difficult due to the lack of high-grade evidence.

First-line treatments continue to be steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), although both are often poorly tolerated and not curative. Common second-line treatments include rituximab; immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil; and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists romiplostim and eltrombopag. With no comparative studies to decide between these agents, treatment is generally individualized, depending on comorbidity.

Use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients with chronic disease, although the exact position of splenectomy remains a subject of debate. Further understanding of the cause of disease in individual patients may help guide treatment. Randomized controlled studies of both common treatments and novel treatments for refractory patients are urgently needed.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^115GTiyH]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Challenges in the transition to second-line treatment**: In patients who require additional treatment after first-line therapy, there is no consensus on when to stop first-line treatment and switch to a therapy more suitable for maintaining a long-term response. Furthermore, there is no consensus on which second-line option to try first. Perhaps because of this uncertainty, several common suboptimal treatment approaches have emerged in clinical practice.

- **Excessive duration of corticosteroid treatment**: As corticosteroid treatment is a familiar, low-cost, and efficacious option for many patients, some clinicians maintain their patients on corticosteroids for months or even years before transitioning to a second-line therapy. This practice may increase not only the risk of bleeding due to poor management of thrombocytopenia as the corticosteroid dose is tapered, but also the risk of adverse events associated with prolonged exposure to corticosteroids, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, and infections.

Patients with ITP already experience a high burden of disease; thus, best efforts should be made to provide treatment options that do not augment the overall burden. Inadequate management of thrombocytopenia may cause emergencies that exacerbate a patient's fear of bleeding. Hospitalizations for emergencies or infusion treatments may also impact the patient's day-to-day functioning and be disruptive for work or school. Adverse events associated with corticosteroids are particularly burdensome. Brown et al reported that nearly all patients who received

Since the publication of this systematic review, the management of ITP has evolved. Treatment decisions are less likely to be guided solely by platelet counts and more likely to rely on a combination of platelet levels, shared decision-making between the physician and the patient, and patient factors such as insurance coverage, lifestyle, history of bleeding, occupation, comorbidities, and expectations. Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), including eltrombopag and romiplostim, have also entered the market after undergoing rigorous randomized trials in splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients with persistent or chronic ITP. Additionally, the incidence of splenectomy has declined in recent years.

Despite these developments and trends, the International Consensus Report on the management of primary ITP (released in 2010) lists medical treatment options in the second-line setting in alphabetical order to avoid indicating a preference for a specific treatment, highlighting the lack of sufficient data to rank the treatments according to efficacy. Similarly, shortly after the publication of this report, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) published practice guidelines for ITP, concluding that there is no evidence to guide a sequence of treatment for patients who have persistent thrombocytopenia with bleeding after first-line treatment with corticosteroids, IVIg, or anti-D.

Indeed, clinical decision-making on optimal second-line ITP treatment is challenging and has been described as controversial.

### Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura: current strategies for investigation and management [^116qoLKU]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

There is currently no consensus on how best to manage refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In part, this reflects the need for individualized treatment due to the wide spectrum of patients' requirements and responsiveness to therapies. The objective of this review is to provide a clinically useful guide to management strategies. This article suggests investigations to identify factors that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia and underlie poor therapeutic responses, and highlights emerging therapies, including thrombopoietic agents, which are anticipated to dramatically alter the natural history of "refractory" ITP. Morbidity, mortality, and health-related quality of life are also discussed.

### Refractory immune thrombocytopenia in adults: Towards a new definition [^114yhQbP]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune haematological disorder characterized by immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and a variable risk of bleeding. Despite multiple treatment options, some patients are considered refractory as they do not achieve a platelet count response to various treatments and remain at risk of bleeding. The term 'refractory' has been used to identify this patient group; however, with the advent of multiple lines of treatment, its meaning has become ambiguous.

To address this issue, we reviewed previous definitions of refractory ITP, solicited opinions from ITP experts, and collected data from registries to inform a new definition.

- **Expert survey**: Twenty ITP experts who attended the 7th Expert Meeting of the Intercontinental Cooperative ITP Study Group in September 2022 responded to a web-based survey. Ninety-five percent felt there was a need for a new definition of refractory ITP for clinical and research purposes. The use of the term refractory, with a clear indication of the type and timing of failed treatments, was supported by 85% of respondents.

- **Registry data**: Preliminary data from the McMaster and Norwegian ITP Registries demonstrated that the proportion of adult ITP patients who had failed first-line therapy, rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, any immune suppressant medication, and splenectomy ranged from 0.4% to 3.8%.

We propose a definition of refractory ITP that could be evaluated in future studies.

### Identifying and treating refractory ITP: Difficulty in diagnosis and role of combination treatment [^1142de7f]. Blood (2020). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common acquired thrombocytopenia after chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Existing guidelines describe the management and treatment of most patients who, overall, do well, even if they present with chronic disease, and they are usually not at a high risk for bleeding. However, a small percentage of patients is refractory and difficult to manage. Patients classified as refractory either have a diagnosis that is not truly ITP or have disease that is difficult to manage. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, as no specific tests exist to confirm the diagnosis. Response to treatment is the only affirmative confirmation of diagnosis. However, refractory patients do not respond to front-line or other treatments, thus no confirmation of diagnosis exists.

- **Diagnostic considerations**: The first section of this review carefully evaluates the diagnostic considerations in patients with refractory ITP.
- **Combination treatment**: The second section describes combination treatment for refractory cases of ITP. The reported combinations are divided into the era before thrombopoietin (TPO) and rituximab and the new era of therapy, which appears to have increased effectiveness. However, the definition of refractory, if it includes insufficient response to TPO agents, describes a group with more severe and difficult-to-treat disease.

The biology of refractory ITP is largely unexplored and includes oligoclonality, lymphocyte pumps, and other possibilities. Newer treatments, especially rapamycin, fostamatinib, FcRn, and BTK inhibitors, may be useful components of future therapy given their mechanisms of action.

### Efficacy and safety of dapsone in adult primary immune thrombocytopenia [^116G73XN]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disease that leads to accelerated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production, with an increased risk of bleeding when the platelet count is ≤ 30 × 10⁹/L. First-line treatment of adult ITP relies on a short course of corticosteroids, with or without IV immunoglobulin (IVIg), for severe bleeding manifestations. Most adults with newly diagnosed ITP initially respond to first-line treatment; however, approximately two-thirds relapse within days or weeks of stopping corticosteroids.

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists have become the preferred second-line option in many countries for adult patients with corticosteroid-dependent or persistent ITP. However, in countries where thrombopoietin receptor agonists are unavailable or unaffordable, and in some European countries such as France and Italy, dapsone remains an off-label treatment option in this setting, and it appears as such in some ITP guidelines. Dapsone is an old and inexpensive drug characterized by antimicrobial and antiprotozoal properties with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.

In adult ITP, dapsone has shown a 40% to 60% efficacy rate in a few uncontrolled retrospective studies, but its efficacy might be hampered by the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) such as hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia, or severe cutaneous reactions, which may lead to treatment discontinuation in approximately 15% of the patients. At the time of writing, there is, to our knowledge, no data based on a prospective randomized trial available supporting its use with a high level of evidence.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^114CLeMg]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Selection of second-line therapy and beyond**: The risks and benefits of all second-line management options should be discussed with the patient before making a treatment decision. My approach to selecting optimal second and subsequent lines of treatment for patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is illustrated in Figure 2.

		Figure 2 provides an approach to the selection of second-line treatment for ITP. General management suggestions are shown. Clinicians should make individualized treatment decisions that take into account the patient's comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal values and preferences. For most patients who have had ITP for more than one year, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) should be considered in the second-line setting. Splenectomy is also an important option for eligible patients who prefer surgical treatment. Before making a treatment decision, the patient should be informed of the long-term risks of splenectomy that might require lifelong medical attention, including delayed relapse, infection, thromboembolism, and possibly cancer.

		The possibility of long-term remission or treatment holidays with TPO-RAs or rituximab should be discussed with the patient. However, it is important to clarify that these medications are neither intended nor confirmed to cure the disease and that the possibility of long-term platelet response after discontinuation of therapy is much higher with splenectomy. For patients who have had ITP for less than one year, TPO-RAs remain a viable option regardless of age and gender. For adult women who have had ITP for less than one year, rituximab with high-dose steroids could be considered, as shown in Figure 2.

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^1172mBD5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4 per 100,000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP and standards for terminology. Evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both efficacy and safety, particularly for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients and may influence clinician and patient choice of second-line therapy. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^113Y8WVM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) can be triggered by a wide range of medications. Although many cases of DITP are mild, some are characterized by life-threatening bleeding symptoms. The pathogenesis of DITP is complex, with at least six different mechanisms proposed by which drug-induced antibodies can promote platelet destruction. It is possible in many cases to identify antibodies that react with platelets in the presence of the sensitizing drug, but the required testing is technically demanding and not widely available. Therefore, a decision on whether to discontinue an implicated medication in a patient suspected of having DITP must be made on clinical grounds.

An algorithm is available that can help assess the likelihood that a particular drug caused thrombocytopenia. However, the most important aspects of patient management are maintaining a high index of suspicion and taking a careful history of drug exposure in anyone presenting with acute, often severe thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology. How drugs induce platelet-reactive antibodies, and how these antibodies cause platelet destruction following exposure to the drug, is poorly understood. Further studies are needed to address these issues and more completely characterize the range of drugs and drug metabolites that can cause DITP.

### Doptelet [^1168PtTA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use the lowest dose of DOPTELET needed to achieve and maintain a platelet count greater than or equal to 50×10⁹/L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding. Dose adjustments are based on platelet count response. Do not use DOPTELET to normalize platelet counts.

- **Initial dose regimen**: Begin DOPTELET at a starting dose of 20 mg (1 tablet) once daily with food.

- **Monitoring**: After initiating therapy with DOPTELET, assess platelet counts weekly until a stable platelet count greater than or equal to 50×10⁹/L has been achieved, and then obtain platelet counts monthly thereafter. Obtain platelet counts weekly for at least 4 weeks following discontinuation of DOPTELET.

- **Dose adjustments**: Dose adjustments are based on the platelet count response. Do not exceed a daily dose of 40 mg (2 tablets).

In the case of a missed dose, patients should take the missed dose of DOPTELET as soon as they remember. Patients should not take two doses at one time to make up for a missed dose and should take the next dose per the regimen.

- **Discontinuation**: Discontinue DOPTELET if the platelet count does not increase to greater than or equal to 50×10⁹/L after 4 weeks of dosing.

### International consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^116bvYQZ]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Previously published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) require updating due to the introduction of new classes of therapeutic agents and a greater understanding of the disease pathophysiology. However, treatment-related decisions still remain primarily dependent on clinical expertise or patient preference rather than high-quality clinical trial evidence. This consensus document aims to report on new data and provide consensus-based recommendations relating to the diagnosis and treatment of ITP in adults, in children, and during pregnancy. The inclusion of summary tables within this document, supported by information tables in the online appendices, is intended to aid in clinical decision-making.

Fostamatinib in an older male: If this patient were at particular risk of thrombosis, fostamatinib might be a particularly good option. Otherwise, in general practice, it is usually reserved for patients who have failed to respond to thrombopoietin agents.

With many second-line agents, there are various treatment options and courses depending on individual responses, relapses, and potential complications with each agent, as demonstrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Second-line treatment options for immune thrombocytopenia and possible treatment courses. TPO: thrombopoietin; R1, R2, R3, R4: first, second, third and fourth weekly dose of rituximab; COVID: coronavirus disease 2019; ITP: immune thrombocytopenia; BID: bis in die.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^114CMvH6]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

In the context of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in pregnancy, there are several important considerations to bear in mind. As ITP is common in women of reproductive age, it is not surprising that it may complicate the course of pregnancy. For pregnant women with known ITP, management must be adjusted throughout pregnancy stages.

During the first trimester, platelet counts may spontaneously increase, apparently due to increased progestational hormones. Consequently, relatively few women with ITP require treatment at this stage, which is advantageous from a teratogenic perspective. The risk of cleft palate from steroid use in the first trimester appears to be small.

- **Second and third trimesters**: In these stages, even healthy women without ITP can experience a decrease in platelet counts, resulting in "gestational" thrombocytopenia. Three large series suggest that gestational thrombocytopenia prevalence at the end of pregnancy is between 6.6% and 11.6%. This has been attributed to increased volume of distribution in the later stages of pregnancy, as well as "consumption".

Recently, research from China, presented at the 2021 European Hematology Association Congress, hypothesized that very high estradiol levels towards the end of pregnancy inhibit platelet production. While requiring confirmation, this hypothesis aligns with the observed decrease in platelet counts and the progression of ITP in pregnancy.

### Promacta [^116eFi4d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Use the lowest dose of Promacta to achieve and maintain a platelet count greater than or equal to 50 × 10⁹/L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding. Dose adjustments are based upon the platelet count response. Do not use Promacta to normalize platelet counts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In clinical trials, platelet counts generally increased within 1 to 2 weeks after starting Promacta and decreased within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuing Promacta [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Initial dose regimen**: Adult and pediatric patients 6 years and older with immune thrombocytopenia: Initiate Promacta at a dose of 50 mg once daily, except in patients who are of East-/Southeast-Asian ancestry or who have mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B, C).

- **Specific populations**:
	- For patients of East-/Southeast-Asian ancestry with immune thrombocytopenia, initiate Promacta at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
	- For patients with immune thrombocytopenia and mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B, C), initiate Promacta at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Characterization of drug-specific T cells in lamotrigine hypersensitivity [^111cidCJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine is associated with hypersensitivity reactions, most commonly characterized by skin rash. An immune etiology has been postulated, though the nature of this is unclear.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to characterize the role of T cells in lamotrigine hypersensitivity.

- **Methods**: A lymphocyte transformation test was performed on four hypersensitive patients. Lymphocytes from three of the four lamotrigine-hypersensitive patients proliferated when stimulated with lamotrigine. T-cell clones were generated from one patient to further characterize the nature of the T-cell involvement. Cells were characterized in terms of their phenotype, functionality, and mechanisms of antigen presentation and cytotoxicity.

- **Results**: Of the 44 drug-specific T-cell clones generated, most were CD4(+) with occasional CD8(+) cells. All clones expressed the alphabeta T-cell receptor; several Vbeta 5.1(+) or 9(+) T-cell clones were generated. All clones also expressed the skin-homing receptor cutaneous lymphocyte antigen. Lamotrigine-stimulated T cells were cytotoxic and secreted perforin, IFN-gamma, IL-5, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, RANTES, and I-309. Lamotrigine was present on HLA-DR and HLA-DQ by antigen-presenting cells in the absence of drug metabolism and processing. The T-cell receptor of certain clones could accommodate analogs of lamotrigine, but no cross-reactivity was seen with other anticonvulsants.

- **Conclusions**: Our data provide evidence that T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of some lamotrigine-hypersensitivity reactions.
