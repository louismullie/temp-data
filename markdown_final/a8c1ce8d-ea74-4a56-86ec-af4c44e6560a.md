## Question

is diltiazem contraindicated in chf?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diltiazem is contraindicated in heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism that would make diltiazem risky in heart failure. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in heart failure, especially HFrEF. Next, I will review the FDA labeling for explicit contraindications and warnings. After that, I need to examine the clinical evidence, including randomized trials and observational studies, to quantify harm. I should also distinguish acute decompensated heart failure from chronic compensated disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable bottom line with safer alternatives for rate control and hypertension management in heart failure patients [^113TPwDL] [^114Wfo3r].

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of concern. Diltiazem is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with negative inotropic effects that depress myocardial contractility; in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, further reduction in contractility can worsen symptoms and outcomes, and this risk is reflected in multiple authoritative sources listing diltiazem among drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure with an immediate to intermediate onset profile [^111HNRyn] [^114Z9AVz] [^115LGPCj].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether guidelines use "contraindicated" versus "avoid" or "not recommended". The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline states that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including diltiazem and verapamil, are myocardial depressants and generally not well tolerated in HF, and it lists diltiazem among medications that may cause or exacerbate HF, aligning with ACC/AHA data standards that record calcium channel blockers as generally contraindicated in HF with permissible values including diltiazem, verapamil, amlodipine, other, none, or unknown, which reflects documentation needs rather than endorsement of use [^113TPwDL] [^114Z9AVz] [^116xdcsr]. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP AF guideline explicitly advises that in AF with LVEF less than 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be administered due to potential to exacerbate HF, and the acute AF algorithm labels diltiazem as harmful in patients with decompensated HF or moderate to severe LV dysfunction, which is functionally a contraindication in those settings [^113VKrgp] [^114Wfo3r]. European guidance similarly cautions against diltiazem in severe LV dysfunction and decompensated HF, reinforcing the same principle across societies [^114Hx7Xt] [^1162NPsL].

> I will now examine FDA labeling to see if there is a formal contraindication. Wait, let me verify the exact language. Multiple diltiazem labels carry a contraindication for acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary congestion documented on admission, which is a decompensated HF phenotype, and they warn about exacerbation of heart failure, advising caution in congestive HF and avoidance in acute decompensated HF or cardiogenic shock, with explicit instruction to discontinue if HF develops during therapy [^113kr3tE] [^115wvak3] [^114VXSkv] [^117L2fk5]. So, while the word "contraindicated" is applied to the AMI with pulmonary congestion scenario, the labeling otherwise uses strong warnings and precautions rather than a universal contraindication for all HF, which still translates into a do-not-use stance in decompensated disease and a use-with-extreme-caution stance in chronic HF with reduced EF [^114VXSkv] [^117L2fk5].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence quantifying harm. The Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial showed that in patients with LVEF less than 40%, late heart failure occurred more frequently with diltiazem than placebo, with life-table analysis confirming a higher incidence of late HF, and this signal was not observed in those with EF 40% or higher, highlighting EF-dependent risk [^115jNfs7] [^114H4SeZ]. Observational ED data in patients with AF and RVR demonstrate higher rates of worsening HF symptoms after IV diltiazem in those with reduced EF compared with preserved EF, supporting mechanistic plausibility and clinical concern in real-world settings [^116zQBRj]. Additional retrospective ED cohorts comparing IV diltiazem versus metoprolol in HFrEF show mixed signals for overall adverse events but a consistent trend toward more heart failure exacerbations with diltiazem, reinforcing caution even when short-term rate control is achieved [^1169NLP5].

> Hold on, I should verify the distinction between acute decompensated HF and chronic compensated HF. In acute decompensated HF or cardiogenic shock, diltiazem is effectively contraindicated and should not be initiated, given the risk of hemodynamic deterioration and the availability of safer alternatives; in chronic compensated HFrEF, diltiazem is not absolutely contraindicated in labeling but is strongly discouraged by guidelines due to negative inotropy and potential to precipitate decompensation, so if used at all, it should be with specialist oversight and close monitoring, recognizing that most authorities advise against it [^113TPwDL] [^113VKrgp] [^117L2fk5].

> Let me consider exceptions and edge cases. In patients with HFpEF, the negative inotropic concern is less pronounced mechanistically, and some guidelines still permit consideration of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for rate control in AF when other options are unsuitable, though even here many experts prefer beta-blockers or digoxin first and remain cautious about diltiazem; in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with preserved EF, diltiazem may be used for LVOT gradient and symptom relief, but if systolic dysfunction emerges, negative inotropes including diltiazem should be withdrawn, underscoring the EF-dependent risk calculus [^113zhaW4] [^111aD1fx]. But wait, what if there is no better acute rate-control option in HFrEF with AF and RVR? Even then, contemporary AF guidance still directs clinicians away from diltiazem and toward beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone depending on hemodynamics and urgency, reserving diltiazem only with great caution and close monitoring if absolutely necessary [^113VKrgp] [^114Wfo3r].

> I should double-check safer alternatives to ensure the recommendation is actionable. For hypertension in HFrEF, guideline-directed therapies such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs or sacubitril/valsartan, beta-blockers, and MRAs are preferred, and if additional BP lowering is needed, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker like amlodipine is reasonable because it lacks meaningful negative inotropy; nondihydropyridines like diltiazem should be avoided for hypertension in HFrEF [^113TPwDL] [^1162NPsL]. For AF rate control in HFrEF, beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone are preferred depending on acuity and hemodynamics, and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used when LVEF is less than 40%, with synchronized cardioversion indicated if the patient is unstable [^113VKrgp] [^114Wfo3r].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Diltiazem is contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure and in acute myocardial infarction with pulmonary congestion, and it is generally not recommended and should be avoided in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to negative inotropic effects and increased risk of worsening heart failure; in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, use remains controversial and, if considered, should be exceptional and carefully monitored, with beta-blockers or other preferred agents prioritized for rate control and hypertension management in heart failure populations [^113kr3tE] [^115wvak3] [^113TPwDL] [^113VKrgp] [^114Wfo3r].

---

Diltiazem is **contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure** [^117L2fk5] and in patients with **moderate-to-severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 40%)** [^113VKrgp] because of its negative inotropic effects, which can worsen heart failure symptoms and outcomes [^111HNRyn]. It is also contraindicated in patients with **sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker, or systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg** [^113kr3tE] [^115wvak3]. For heart failure patients with atrial fibrillation, use beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone for rate control; avoid diltiazem unless the patient has preserved ejection fraction and no decompensation [^114Wfo3r] [^1135qgne].

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to heart failure

Diltiazem is a **non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker** that inhibits L-type calcium channels, producing negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. These effects reduce myocardial contractility and slow AV nodal conduction, which can be beneficial for arrhythmias but problematic in heart failure [^114kcWwF].

---

## Clinical evidence of adverse effects in heart failure

Multiple studies and guidelines highlight the **risks of diltiazem in heart failure**:

- **Negative inotropy**: Diltiazem's negative inotropic effect can reduce cardiac output and exacerbate heart failure symptoms, particularly in patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [^111HNRyn] [^113TPwDL].

- **Clinical deterioration**: Diltiazem use in heart failure patients has been associated with increased rates of clinical deterioration, including higher utilization of inotropes and vasopressors, and increased ICU transfers [^117NXogz].

- **Worsening heart failure**: Observational studies have shown that diltiazem use in heart failure patients is associated with worsening heart failure symptoms, increased oxygen requirements, and the need for inotropic support [^1169NLP5] [^116zQBRj].

---

## Specific contraindications and precautions

According to FDA labeling and clinical guidelines, diltiazem is **contraindicated or should be avoided** in the following heart failure-related scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Acute decompensated heart failure | Contraindicated [^117L2fk5] |
| Moderate-to-severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) | Contraindicated [^114Wfo3r] |
| Sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker | Contraindicated [^113kr3tE] |
| Second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker | Contraindicated [^113kr3tE] |
| Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg | Contraindicated [^113kr3tE] |

---

Additionally, diltiazem should be used with caution in patients with **mild heart failure or compensated heart failure**, as it may still exacerbate symptoms or cause hemodynamic instability [^114VXSkv].

---

## Alternative medications for heart failure patients

Given the risks associated with diltiazem, **alternative medications are recommended** for heart failure patients:

- **Beta-blockers**: Metoprolol, carvedilol, and bisoprolol are recommended for heart failure patients, as they improve survival and reduce hospitalizations [^114SF5bp] [^112FaXSM].

- **Digoxin**: Useful for rate control in atrial fibrillation patients with heart failure, particularly when beta-blockers are not tolerated or contraindicated [^113VKrgp] [^1135qgne].

- **Amiodarone**: Considered for rhythm control in selected heart failure patients, although its use is limited by potential adverse effects [^11488C8o].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines consistently **advise against the use of diltiazem** in heart failure patients:

- **AHA/ACC/HFSA guidelines**: Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including diltiazem, are not recommended for heart failure patients due to their negative inotropic effects and potential to exacerbate heart failure symptoms [^113TPwDL] [^114Z9AVz].

- **ESC guidelines**: Diltiazem is contraindicated in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) and should be avoided in patients with decompensated heart failure [^114Hx7Xt].

---

## Summary of risks and benefits

| **Risks** | **Benefits** |
|-|-|
| Negative inotropic effect | Effective rate control in atrial fibrillation |
| Exacerbation of heart failure symptoms | Useful in patients with preserved ejection fraction and no decompensation |
| Increased risk of clinical deterioration | Alternative to beta-blockers in patients with contraindications |
| Contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure | ∅ |

---

Diltiazem is **contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure** and in patients with moderate-to-severe left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) due to its negative inotropic effects, which can exacerbate heart failure symptoms and lead to clinical deterioration [^113VKrgp] [^111HNRyn]. It should be avoided in heart failure patients unless they have preserved ejection fraction and no signs of decompensation. Alternative medications such as beta-blockers, digoxin, and amiodarone are recommended for heart failure patients who require rate or rhythm control [^113VKrgp] [^1135qgne].

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'. Evidence on rhythm control notes 'a total of 5032 patients in 4 separate trials' with 'no improvement in mortality or morbidity using a strategy of aggressive rhythm control'.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Intravenous diltiazem hydrochloride 20 mg prolongs AH conduction time and AV node functional and effective refractory periods by approximately 20%. PR in healthy volunteers and HR in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are dependent on plasma level of diltiazem. Based on this relationship, the mean plasma diltiazem concentration required to produce a 20%, 30% and 40% decrease in heart rate was determined to be 80 ng/mL, 130 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL, respectively.

In patients with cardiovascular disease, diltiazem hydrochloride administered intravenously in single bolus doses, followed in some cases by a continuous infusion, reduced blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow. In a limited number of studies of patients with compromised myocardium (severe congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), administration of intravenous diltiazem produced no significant effect on contractility, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The mean ejection fraction and cardiac output/index remained unchanged or increased. Maximal hemodynamic effects usually occurred within 2 to 5 minutes of an injection. However, in rare instances, worsening of congestive heart failure has been reported in patients with preexisting impaired ventricular function.

Calcium channel blockers

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are not recommended in patients with significantly impaired left ventricular function due to their negative inotropic effects, although specific data are limited. In the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, patients were randomized to diltiazem or placebo 3–15 days after the onset of myocardial infarction.HF patients, including 490 with evidence of pulmonary congestion, had an increase in the composite of cardiac death or non-fatal re-infarction (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01–1.96). In subsequent analysis, diltiazem was found to increase late-onset HF in those with LVEF < 40%. Verapamil did not improve outcomes after myocardial infarction in patients who developed HF in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials.

Heart rate targets for atrial fibrillation in the context of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

Following the publication of the Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RACE II) trial, patients with AF can initially be treated to a more lenient heart rate regime (< 110 beats/min resting heart rate). To summarize, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to a heart rate < 80 b.p.m. at rest and < 110 b.p.m. during moderate exercise or lenient control, with results showing a similar rate of composite clinical events in each arm. There were also no differences in functional outcomes, hospital admissions, or symptoms. Fifteen percent of the population had LVEF < 40% but it remains unclear if these targets apply to AF patients with HFrEF. However, these findings are consistent with other results, and would suggest that heart rate in AF is more a marker of disease than a therapeutic target and that a lenient heart rate may be acceptable if symptoms are controlled and tachycardia is avoided. It is worth noting that other guideline recommendations continue to advocate a resting heart rate < 80 b.p.m. in patients with symptomatic AF and left ventricular dysfunction.

Specific rhythm-control strategies

Cardioversion

The first step in rhythm control is the restoration of sinus rhythm, which often requires cardioversion. Urgent cardioversion is recommended in any patient with significant haemodynamic impairment secondary to AF. Elective cardioversion is indicated in individuals with symptomatic persistent AF. Unfortunately, recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion is a frequent problem (∼50% at 6 months), particularly in patients with HF. Over half of inpatients undergoing cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias have HF.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115KtUYC]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and post–myocardial infarction (MI) risk — key evidence and cautions are as follows: The Framingham studies have shown a 60% increased risk of death in patients with asymptomatic low LVEF compared with those with normal LVEF. MADIT-II showed a 31% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% receiving a prophylactic ICD compared with standard of care. For prevention of progression, beta-blocker therapy is recommended to prevent symptomatic HF in patients with reduced LVEF. Regarding comorbid therapy, thiazolidinediones should be avoided in patients with reduced LVEF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are myocardial depressants and generally not tolerated in HF, and although not specifically tested in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be harmful in this population because of their negative inotropic effects.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. (5.2)
Second-or third-degree AV block. (5.3)
Heart failure. (5.4)
Hypotension. (5.5)

5.1 Tachycardia and Hypotension in patients with AF/AFL and accessory bypass tract

Diltiazem may cause ventricular fibrillation if given to patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome. Distinguish atrial fibrillation with aberrancy (bundle branch block) from pre-excited atrial fibrillation prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Hemodynamic Deterioration in Patients with Wide Complex Tachycardia

Diltiazem may cause hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. Distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 AV Block

Diltiazem prolongs AV nodal conduction and refractoriness that may cause second- or third-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Concomitant use of diltiazem with agents known to affect cardiac conduction may result in additive effects [see Drug Interactions (7)]. If high-degree AV block occurs in sinus rhythm, discontinue diltiazem and institute appropriate supportive measures [see Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Heart Failure

Diltiazem is a negative inotrope and can cause decreased systolic function and heart failure. Do not initiate in patients with acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock. If heart failure develops during diltiazem treatment, discontinue treatment and treat heart failure appropriately.

5.5 Hypotension

Diltiazem can cause symptomatic hypotension. Patients with low blood pressure at baseline and those on concomitant medications that decrease blood pressure, intravascular volume, or myocardial contractility are at increased risk for hypotension.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115LGPCj]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blockers in heart failure (HF) — dihydropyridines such as nifedipine have negative inotropic and vasodilating effects by blocking transmembrane calcium influx, and small trials reported marked worsening of HF with nifedipine in which 5 of 21 patients required hospitalization versus 0 of 20 with isosorbide dinitrate. In HF, amlodipine showed no evidence of a favorable or unfavorable effect on mortality (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.83–1.13; P = 0.66), with higher frequencies of peripheral and pulmonary edema reported, and it may exacerbate HF. Non‑dihydropyridines diltiazem and verapamil can worsen HF; after myocardial infarction (MI), diltiazem increased adverse cardiac events in the subgroup with baseline pulmonary congestion (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01–1.96) among 2466 total patients with 490 in the subgroup, and risk was directly related to baseline HF severity.

### Diltiazem hci [^115WGf1C]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Like other calcium channel antagonists, because of its effect on vascular smooth muscle, diltiazem decreases total peripheral resistance resulting in a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Hemodynamics

In patients with cardiovascular disease, diltiazem hydrochloride injection administered intravenously in single bolus doses, followed in some cases by a continuous infusion, reduced blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow. In a limited number of studies of patients with compromised myocardium (severe congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), administration of intravenous diltiazem produced no significant effect on contractility, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The mean ejection fraction and cardiac output/index remained unchanged or increased. Maximal hemodynamic effects usually occurred within 2 to 5 minutes of an injection. However, in rare instances, worsening of congestive heart failure has been reported in patients with preexisting impaired ventricular function.

Pharmacodynamics

The prolongation of PR interval correlated significantly with plasma diltiazem concentration in normal volunteers using the Sigmoidal Emax model. Changes in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure did not correlate with diltiazem plasma concentrations in normal volunteers. Reduction in mean arterial pressure correlated linearly with diltiazem plasma concentration in a group of hypertensive patients.

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^114SF5bp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Beta‐blockers: Metoprolol Extended Release, carvedilol and bisoprolol have shown benefits in HFrEF. Similar to above, their role in HFpEF is limited to treating underlying conditions (eg, atrial arrhythmias). 30

Digoxin: The use of digoxin for chronic heart failure has declined as benefits appear to be limited to symptomatic relief without mortality benefit. Furthermore, appropriate management is difficult due to its narrow therapeutic window (0.5 to 0.9 ng/mL) and older adults in particular are at risk for digoxin toxicity secondary to declining renal drug clearance. In this case it is imperative that renal function be monitored frequently to minimize drug accumulation. Prior to initiating digoxin in older adults, optimization of first‐line guideline‐directed medical therapy should be performed. Discontinuation of digoxin should be considered but requires monitoring for signs of worsening symptoms as stopping therapy may be associated with poorer outcomes among patients with heart failure. 41

On‐going goals of care discussions are paramount as patients' heart failure progresses towards advanced stages. Quality of life can be greatly improved by simplification of the medical regimen. Review and assess the tolerability of recommended therapies and eliminate adjuvant agents that can exacerbate heart failure symptoms (sotalol, dronedarone, propafenone, verapamil, diltiazem, cilostazol, metformin, thiazolidinediones, NSAIDs, etc). 42

Atrial fibrillation — nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are effective for rate control with specific use considerations. The nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists verapamil and diltiazem are commonly used for treatment of AF and are the only agents associated with improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance; intravenous bolus is effective but usually requires continuous intravenous infusion, these agents should be used cautiously or avoided in HF due to systolic dysfunction, eight randomized studies found heart rate decreases with diltiazem, verapamil decreased heart rate both at rest by 8 to 23 beats per minute and during exercise by 20 to 34 beats per minute, and they may be preferred long term over beta blockers in patients with bronchospasm or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — recommendations emphasize first-line agents and safety limits. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for long-term rate control, and for patients in whom measuring serum digoxin levels is indicated, it is reasonable to target levels < 1.2 ng/mL. In AF with heart failure (HF) symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. In AF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF, and in patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.

### Blood pressure effects and risk of hypotension due to intravenous furosemide in acute decompensated heart failure [^115rvb3N]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient‐level factors, such as severely low EF, advanced age, and atrial fibrillation, significantly increased blood pressure reduction and risk of hypotension in the ED. In patients with these features, it may be reasonable to administer lower doses of furosemide (e.g. 40 mg) when pre‐treatment SBP is borderline to low (e.g. < 110 mmHg). By examining the confounding effects of co‐administered treatments with and without IV furosemide, we found that multiple co‐administered treatments also had profound effects on SBP which, at times, were multiplicative with IV furosemide's effects. Some of these are likely unavoidable based on specific clinical situations, such as NIPPV in patients with respiratory failure.

Others, like calcium channel blockers, are relatively contraindicated in heart failure per AHA guidelines. Use of diltiazem in combination with furosemide was the single greatest multivariable‐adjusted predictor of reduced SBP (Figure 2C), which underscores that these agents should be avoided or used with extreme caution in ADHF patients who require IV loop diuresis. Patients administered ACEi/ARB alongside IV furosemide had small but significantly greater SBP reduction than those with equivalent IV furosemide doses alone. Other medications administered in the ED (e.g. beta blockers, MRAs, dihydropyridine CCBs) did not show significant effects on SBP reduction; but the analysis was not specifically powered to detect subtle effects in these subgroups.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (matzim LA) [^114kcWwF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Like other calcium channel antagonists, diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations. In the intact animal, prolongation of the AH interval can be seen at higher doses.

In man, diltiazem prevents spontaneous and ergonovine-provoked coronary artery spasm. It causes a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a modest fall in blood pressure in normotensive individuals and, in exercise tolerance studies in patients with ischemic heart disease, reduces the heart rate-blood pressure product for any given workload. Studies to date, primarily in patients with good ventricular function, have not revealed evidence of a negative inotropic effect; cardiac output, ejection fraction, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure have not been affected. Such data have no predictive value with respect to effects in patients with poor ventricular function, and increased heart failure has been reported in patients with preexisting impairment of ventricular function. There are as yet few data on the interaction of diltiazem and beta-blockers in patients with poor ventricular function. Resting heart rate is usually slightly reduced by diltiazem. Diltiazem decreases vascular resistance, increases cardiac output (by increasing stroke volume), and produces a slight decrease or no change in heart rate.

Atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — use of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) — are negative inotropic agents and may not be tolerated; limited data from 2 retrospective analyses suggest potential for increased morbidity with diltiazem in the acute setting, and in the multicenter randomized MDPIT of patients postacute myocardial infarction, among those with baseline ejection fraction (EF) < 40% late heart failure (HF) appeared in 12% receiving placebo and 21% receiving diltiazem (P = 0.004), with life table analysis confirming more frequent late HF in those with EF < 40% taking diltiazem (P = 0.0017); this increase was not seen when EF was ≥ 40% with pulmonary congestion at baseline, and in the chronic setting diltiazem had no impact on mortality in a trial of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

### Safety of diltiazem for acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^116zQBRj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diltiazem is an effective rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AF RVR). However, its negative inotropic effects may increase the risk for worsening heart failure in patients with a reduced ejection fraction (EF).

Objectives

This observational study aims to describe the incidence of worsening heart failure in patients who receive intravenous diltiazem for acute atrial fibrillation management.

Methods

Adult patients that received diltiazem in the emergency department (ED) for AF RVR (heart rate ≥ 100 beats/min) from 2021 to 2022 and had a prior documented EF were included. The primary outcome is worsening heart failure within 24 h of diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes include return ED visits and death within 7 days. EF percentage was compared across outcomes using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Outcomes were compared by reduced EF (< 50%) and preserved EF (≥ 50%). Continuous data were summarized with medians and interquartile ranges, and categorical features were summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for numeric outcomes and chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical outcomes, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results

There were 674 patients with AF RVR that received diltiazem, and 386 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Baseline demographics included a median age of 72 (64–81) years, with 14.5% of patients having a prior diagnosis of congestive heart failure. EF < 50% was identified in 13.7% of patients (n = 53), of which approximately 30% of these patients safely discharged home after receiving i.v. diltiazem. The primary outcome of worsening heart failure occurred in 7/41 (17%) and 10/207 (4.8%) patients with reduced and preserved ejection fractions, respectively, who were admitted to the hospital (p = 0.005).

Conclusion

The development of worsening heart failure is multifactorial and may include the use of diltiazem in critically ill patients requiring hospital admission.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Cardizem) [^113z3VeR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia.

In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered:

Bradycardia: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1.0 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

High-Degree AV Block: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

Cardiac Failure: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

Hypotension: Vasopressors (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine).

Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.

1.1 Hypertension

CARDIZEM LA is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mm Hg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

CARDIZEM LA may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^1169NLP5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart rate control for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department (ED) is often achieved utilizing intravenous (IV) non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) or beta blockers (BB). For patients with concomitant heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the American Heart Association and other clinical groups note that CCB should be avoided due to their potential negative inotropic effects. However, minimal evidence exists to guide this current recommendation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of adverse effects in the HFrEF patient population whose AF with RVR was treated with IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED.

Methods

This single center, retrospective review included patients ≥ 18 years old with HFrEF who presented in AF with RVR and received IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was adverse effects of therapy defined as: 1) hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg requiring fluid bolus or vasopressors) or bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min) within 60 min of medication administration 2) worsening heart failure symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirements within four hours or inotropic support within 48 h. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of rate control failure, patient disposition, ED length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, with 57 receiving diltiazem and 68 receiving metoprolol. Overall adverse effects for diltiazem and metoprolol were similar (32% vs. 21%, P = 0.217). However, there was a significantly higher incidence of worsening heart failure symptoms within the diltiazem group (33% vs 15%, P = 0.019). Rate control failure at 60 min did not differ significantly between diltiazem and metoprolol (51% vs 62%, P = 0.277).

Conclusions

In HFrEF patients with AF, there was no difference in total adverse events in patients treated with IV diltiazem compared to metoprolol. However, the diltiazem group had a higher incidence of worsening CHF symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirement within four hours or initiation of inotropic support within 48 h.

### Mavacamten (Camzyos) [^114TvtmH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Heart Failure

CAMZYOS reduces systolic contraction and can cause heart failure or significantly reduce ventricular function. Patients who experience a serious intercurrent illness (e.g., serious infection) or arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation or other uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia) are at greater risk of developing systolic dysfunction and heart failure [see Clinical Trial Experience (6.1)].

Assess the patient's clinical status and LVEF prior to and regularly during treatment and adjust the CAMZYOS dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. New or worsening arrhythmia, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, leg edema, or elevations in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) may be signs and symptoms of heart failure and should also prompt an evaluation of cardiac function.

Asymptomatic LVEF reduction, intercurrent illnesses, and arrhythmias require additional dosing considerations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

Initiation of CAMZYOS in patients with LVEF < 55% is not recommended. Avoid concomitant use of CAMZYOS in patients on disopyramide, ranolazine, verapamil with a beta blocker, or diltiazem with a beta blocker as these medications and combinations increase the risk of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure symptoms and clinical experience is limited [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.2 CYP450 Drug Interactions Leading to Heart Failure or Loss of Effectiveness

CAMZYOS is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Concomitant use of CAMZYOS and drugs that interact with these enzymes may lead to life-threatening drug interactions such as heart failure or loss of effectiveness [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Advise patients of the potential for drug interactions, including with over-the-counter medications (such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, or cimetidine). Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant products prior to and during CAMZYOS treatment [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Using other agents known to affect cardiac conduction or contractility with diltiazem may increase the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

Ivabradine: Concurrent use of diltiazem increases exposure to ivabradine and may exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances. Avoid concomitant use of ivabradine and diltiazem.

7.2 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Cytochrome P450 3A4 Mediated Drug Interactions

Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the Pg-p and cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system which may affect exposure to diltiazem and concomitant drugs metabolized by those pathways. Patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment may be particularly at risk of exposure changes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Clinical outcomes associated with diltiazem use in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction after implementation of a clinical support system [^117NXogz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite atrial fibrillation guideline recommendations, many patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF) continue to receive IV diltiazem for acute rate control.

Objective

Our institution recently implemented a clinical decision support system (CDSS)-based tool that recommends against the use of diltiazem in patients with an EF ≤ 40%. The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes of adherence to the aforementioned CDSS-based tool.

Methods

This multi-hospital, retrospective study assessed patients who triggered the CDSS alert and compared those who did and did not discontinue diltiazem. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinical deterioration. The primary endpoint was compared utilizing a Fisher's Exact Test, and a multivariate logistic regression model was developed to confirm the results of the primary analysis.

Results

A total of 246 patients were included in this study with 146 patients in the nonadherent group (received diltiazem) and 100 patients in the adherent group (did not receive diltiazem). There was a higher proportion of patients experiencing clinical deterioration in the alert nonadherence group (33% vs 21%, P = 0.044), including increased utilization of inotropes and vasopressors, and higher rate of transfer to ICU.

Conclusion and Relevance

In patients with heart failure with reduced EF, diltiazem use after nonadherence to a CDSS alert resulted in an increased risk of clinical deterioration. This study highlights the need for improved provider adherence to diltiazem clinical decision support systems.

Drugs to avoid in patients with HF — several classes are cautioned or discouraged in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with a history of hypertension, including that "the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided", while "most calcium channel–blocking drugs except amlodipine are not recommended"; conversely, "amlodipine appeared to be safe… as was felodipine". Centrally acting norepinephrine‑depleting agents "may need to be avoided or used with caution", the ALLHAT "α‑blocker doxazosin arm… was discontinued because of a 2‑fold increase in the risk of developing HF", and "the safety and efficacy of α‑blockers… are currently unclear". Additionally, "Potent direct‑acting vasodilators such as minoxidil should also be avoided", and "Nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory agents should be used with caution".

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hypertension — treatment thresholds, targets, and agents are described as follows: in patients with HFrEF, antihypertensive drug treatment should start (if not already initiated) when BP is > 140/90 mmHg, and because outcomes for patients with heart failure have repeatedly been shown to be poor if BP values are low, it may be wise to avoid actively lowering BP to < 120/70 mmHg; heart failure guideline-directed medications are recommended for the treatment of hypertension in patients with HFrEF, with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) all effective in improving clinical outcome; if further BP lowering is required, a dihydropyridine CCB may be considered; sacubitril/valsartan lowers BP, has also been shown to improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF, and is indicated as an alternative to ACE inhibitors or ARBs; non-dihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem and verapamil), alpha-blockers, and centrally acting agents, such as moxonidine, should not be used.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1176FeNJ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — synopsis highlights effective classes and selection considerations. Both nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) and beta blockers are effective for long-term rate control, and these agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. Digoxin may be useful in patients with limited tolerability to other agents, or as adjunct therapy in patients with a difficult to control ventricular rate. Limited data exist comparing various rate control agents, especially in the setting of chronic rate control, and selection of specific agents should consider patient-specific characteristics (ie, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF], reactive airway disease) and response.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with concomitant heart failure [^112CepYP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Atrial fibrillation (Afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) is acutely treated with intravenous push (IVP) metoprolol (MET) or diltiazem (DIL). In heart failure (HF) patients, diltiazem is not recommended due to negative inotropic effects. Studies comparing the treatment of atrial fibrillation often exclude HF. Hirschy et al. evaluated HF patients with concomitant Afib with RVR who received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem to determine their effectiveness and safety. They found similar safety and effectiveness outcomes between the two groups.

Methods

This retrospective, IRB-approved study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency center (EC) with Afib with RVR and HF from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2021. Included patients were 18 years of age or older, received IVP metoprolol or diltiazem in the EC, and had a recorded baseline ejection fraction (EF). The primary effectiveness outcome was successful heart rate (HR) control 30 min after treatment with either IVP metoprolol or diltiazem, which was defined as HR < 100 beats per minute (bpm). Secondary effectiveness outcomes included HR control 60 min post-IVP and at EC discharge or transfer and HR reduction > 20% at 30 min after IVP, 60 min after IVP, and at time of discharge or transfer. Other secondary outcomes included the time to adequate HR control, the total dose of IVP metoprolol or diltiazem given, any additional rate-controlling agents given, and crossover between metoprolol and diltiazem. Safety outcomes included bradycardia, hypotension, shortness of breath, increased oxygen requirements, change in EF, acute kidney injury or renal replacement therapy.

Results

Of 2580 evaluated, 193 patients were included (134 DIL vs. 59 MET) with age 73.3 ± 12.2 years, 63% female. The average EF was 48.2 ± 14.2% and 30% of patients had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) while 64% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Effective heart rate control 30 min post-IVP was not different between the two groups (55% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.063). DIL effectively controlled HR quicker than MET (13 [9, 125] DIL vs. 27 [5, 50] MET, min, p = 0.009). DIL resulted in greater HR reductions at 30 min (33.2 ± 25.4 DIL vs. 19.7 ± 19.7 MET, bpm, p < 0.001) and at 60 min (31 ± 23.5 DIL vs. 19.6 ± 19.1 MET, bpm, p = 0.002). DIL also more frequently resulted in a HR reduction of 20% or greater at 30 min (63% DIL vs. 27% MET, p < 0.001), 60 min post-IVP (59% DIL vs. 41% MET, p = 0.019), and at time of patient discharge or transfer from the EC (70% DIL vs. 49% MET, p = 0.005). No differences in safety outcomes were identified.

Conclusion

Acute management of patients with Afib with RVR and HF is challenging. While successful rate control at 30 min was not significantly different between diltiazem and metoprolol, IVP diltiazem reduced HR more quickly and reduced HR by 20% or greater more frequently than IVP metoprolol with no safety outcome differences. Further studies are needed to evaluate diltiazem's safety in patients with Afib and HF.

American Heart Association scientific statement — hypertension therapy in heart failure: Antihypertensive treatment thresholds are recommended in individuals with ≥ 140 mmHg SBP or 90 mm Hg diastolic BP (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics can be used for blood pressure (BP) control and to reverse mild volume overload in symptomatic heart failure (HF) with volume overload, with this use rated (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). The addition of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate to background therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a β-blocker may be beneficial in nonblack patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hypertension (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Drugs to avoid in HF with hypertension include nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil and diltiazem) and moxonidine (Class III: Harm; Level of Evidence C), and α-adrenergic blockers such as doxazosin should be avoided and might be used only if other drugs for the management of hypertension and HF are inadequate to achieve BP control at maximum tolerated doses (Class III: Harm; Level of Evidence C).

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — pharmacological rate control (Class I): Measurement of the heart rate at rest and control of the rate with pharmacological agents are recommended for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C).

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious adverse reactions have been rare in studies carried out to date, but it should be recognized that patients with impaired ventricular function and cardiac conduction abnormalities usually have been excluded.

In domestic placebo-controlled angina trials, the incidence of adverse reactions reported during CARDIZEM therapy was not greater than that reported during placebo therapy.

The following represent occurrences observed in clinical studies of angina patients. In many cases, the relationship to CARDIZEM has not been established. The most common occurrences from these studies, as well as their frequency of presentation, are edema (2.4%), headache (2.1%), nausea (1.9%), dizziness (1.5%), rash (1.3%), and asthenia (1.2%). In addition, the following events were reported infrequently (less than 1%):

Cardiovascular: Angina, arrhythmia, AV block (first-degree), AV block (second- or third-degree – see WARNINGS, Cardiac Conduction), bradycardia, bundle branch block, congestive heart failure, ECG abnormality, flushing, hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia, ventricular extrasystoles

### Drug-disease and drug-drug interactions: systematic examination of recommendations in 12 UK national clinical guidelines [^113m1hUr]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the number of drugs or drug classes recommended as first line (for all or nearly all patients) and second line (for some patients under some circumstances) for each condition(details of the individual drugs are in appendix 1). There were 23 drugs recommended in the type 2 diabetes guideline (four first line), 13 drugs in the depression guideline (one first line), and 11 in the heart failure guideline (two first line).

Table 1
Number of drugs recommended for each condition in each NICE guideline considered

NICE = National Institute of Health and Care Excellence; MI = myocardial infarction.

Drug-disease interactions

Table 2 shows the number of times that a drug recommended for each of the three index conditions would be contraindicated or should be avoided in the presence of any of the other 11 conditions. Drug-disease interactions were not common, with the exception of those related to chronic kidney disease, which occurred with type 2 diabetes in particular. Chronic kidney disease was involved in 27 of the identified 32 drug-disease interactions for drugs recommended in the clinical guideline for type 2 diabetes and all of the six and 10 drug-disease interactions for the guidelines for depression and heart failure, respectively. But the guidelines for type 2 diabetes and heart failure each specifically discussed just one of these identified interactions. For type 2 diabetes this recommendation was regarding the need to avoid treatment with thiazolidinediones in people with comorbid heart failure. In heart failure, it was identified that amlodipine should be considered for the treatment of comorbid hypertension and/or angina in patients with heart failure, but verapamil, diltiazem, or short acting dihydropyridine agents should be avoided. The depression guideline did not discuss any of the identified drug-disease interactions.

### Atrial fibrillation (acute onset) [^115iZp3t]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease. Acute atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. Acute atrial fibrillation resolves spontaneously within 24–48 hours in over 50% of people, however many people will require interventions to control heart rate or restore sinus rhythm.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions: to prevent embolism; for conversion to sinus rhythm; and to control heart rate in people with recent onset atrial fibrillation (within 7 days) who are haemodynamically stable? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amiodarone, antithrombotic treatment before cardioversion, digoxin, diltiazem, direct current cardioversion, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, sotalol, timolol, and verapamil.

### Brain-penetrant calcium channel blockers are associated with a reduced incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders [^112ZFfkS]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Secondary analyses

Differences found between BP-CCBs and amlodipine might reflect something unique about amlodipine rather than merely its low brain penetrability, such as aspects of its channel blocking kinetics Thus, in a secondary analysis we compared people prescribed BP-CCBs with patients prescribed verapamil or diltiazem. We omitted these drugs from the primary analysis since (a) they have different clinical indications from amlodipine (i.e. they are not recommended first line for hypertension, and are contraindicated in heart failure) and hence are more likely to lead to confounding by indication, and (b) their pharmacological profiles differ from the dihydropyridines. Though the evidence regarding the brain penetrability and central effects of verapamil and diltiazem is less clear than for the dihydropyridines, we included both drugs in the non-penetrant group, in line with others.

We also conducted secondary analyses for BP-CCBs versus amlodipine separately in men and women, and based on age (under or over 60 years). Finally, we compared BP-CCBs with ARBs, given the evidence mentioned earlier that the latter group are associated with lower risks of many neuropsychiatric disorders compared to CCBs as a class. We hypothesised that this difference would be reduced, or eliminated, when the comparison was limited to BP-CCBs. The same covariates were used for the secondary analyses as for the primary comparison between BP-CCBs and amlodipine.

A STROBE document was completed (Supplementary Table 2).

### Acute rate control with metoprolol versus diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1117qHaG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare heart rate control between parenteral metoprolol and diltiazem and identify safety outcomes in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included adult patients with HFrEF who received intravenous (IV) metoprolol or diltiazem for AFib RVR in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was rate control defined as HR < 100 bpm or a HR reduction ≥ 20% within 30 min of first dose administration. The secondary outcomes included rate control within 60 min and 120 min from first dose, need for repeat dosing, and disposition. Safety outcomes included hypotensive and bradycardic events.

Results

Out of 552 patients, 45 patients met the inclusion criteria with 15 in the metoprolol group and 30 in the diltiazem group. Using bootstrapping method, patients treated with metoprolol were equally able to reach the primary outcome as those treated with diltiazem (BCa 95% CI: 0.14, 4.31). Hypotensive and bradycardia events remained zero in both groups.

Conclusion

Our study provides further evidence that short term use of diltiazem is likely as safe and effective as metoprolol in the acute management of HFrEF patients with AFib RVR and provides support for the use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in this patient population.

Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone safety, interactions, and dosing are detailed as follows: In patients with recently decompensated heart failure and depressed LV function, dronedarone increased mortality after a median follow-up of only 2 months; 8.1% in the dronedarone group died and 3.8% in the placebo group died (HR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.25; P = 0.03). Therefore, dronedarone should not be administered to patients with depressed ventricular function and recent heart failure decompensation or NYHA class IV heart failure. The major adverse cardiac effects are bradycardia and QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes has been reported. Dronedarone inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine without reducing glomerular filtration rate and increases digoxin levels 1.7- to 2.5-fold. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 with a half-life of approximately 19 hours; it should not be administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 but can be administered with verapamil or diltiazem using low initial doses titrated to response and tolerance. Dronedarone does not alter the international normalization ratio when used with warfarin. The recommended oral dose is 400 mg twice a day with meals, and an intravenous form is not available.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117JARSL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

### Guideline for the management of heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction: part II. treatment [^114oSHnt]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Several large clinical trials conducted over the past decade have shown that pharmacologic interventions can dramatically reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. These trials have modified and enhanced the therapeutic paradigm for heart failure and extended treatment goals beyond limiting congestive symptoms of volume overload. Part II of this two-part article presents treatment recommendations for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The authors recommend that, if tolerated and not contraindicated, the following agents be used in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in all patients; a beta blocker in all patients except those who have symptoms at rest; and spironolactone in patients who have symptoms at rest or who have had such symptoms within the past six months. Diuretics and digoxin should be reserved, as needed, for symptomatic management of heart failure. Other treatments or treatment programs may be necessary in individual patients.

Ibutilide is an I Kr blocker and late inward I Na agonist. Ibutilide is used for pharmacological cardioversion (Figure 1) of AF or atrial flutter. QT interval must be monitored for 2 to 6 hours after the infusion. 58 Ibutilide is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.

Dofetilide and ibutilide use may be limited in COVID‐19 patients already receiving hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, macrolides, or lopinavir/ritonavir because of their intrinsic dose‐dependent QT prolongation. However, the use of ibutilide may be a good option for conversion of acute symptomatic AF (Figure 1).

Sotalol is an I Kr blocker (dose dependent) with moderate β‐blockade effect. 38 Sotalol is renally excreted (Figure 2). 38 If sotalol is used in the presence of lopinavir/ritonavir, which is nephrotoxic, QT interval should be followed closely. Sotalol may be used with lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, or sarilumab, given lack of interaction on CYP3A4 or CYP2D6. However, there are dose‐dependent QT prolongation drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and macrolides, so monitoring should be implemented. Class III AADs are generally contraindicated in patients who are treated with fingolimod because of QT prolongation and risk of torsade de pointes. 36

Nonhydropyridine calcium channel blockers are used as first‐line rate‐control agents in AF. 17 Diltiazem and verapamil block L‐type calcium channels and are contraindicated in patients with decompensated CHF or significantly reduced ejection fraction because of negative inotropic effect 17, 49 (Figure 1).

Diltiazem is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. The use of diltiazem (P‐glycoprotein inhibitor) with azithromycin (P‐glycoprotein substrate) has been reported to prolong QT interval, leading to torsade de pointes. 59 Lopinavir/ritonavir may cause prolonged PR and second‐ or third‐degree heart block when used with calcium channel blockers. 24 Lopinavir/ritonavir can increase calcium channel blocker plasma concentration through CYP3A4 inhibition and should be closely monitored 47, 60 (Figure 1).

### Diltiazem to treat sinus tachycardia in critically ill patients: a four-year experience [^111iGB37]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether an intravenous infusion of the calcium channel blocker diltiazem was effective and safe in treating sinus tachycardia in critically ill adult patients with contraindications to beta-blockers or in whom beta-blockers were ineffective.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

University medical center.

Patients

The records of 171 surgical intensive care unit patients with sinus tachycardia treated with intravenous diltiazem were evaluated.

Interventions

In all patients with sinus tachycardia (heart rate > 100 beats/min), heart rate control with intravenous diltiazem was attempted after adequate intravascular volume expansion, pain, and anxiety control. In all patients, beta-blockade either was contraindicated or (in 7%) had failed. Intravenous diltiazem was administered as a slow 10-mg bolus dose (0.1–0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight), and then an infusion was started at 5 or 10 mg/hr and increased up to 30 mg/hr, as needed, to decrease heart rate to < 100 beats/min. Variables retrospectively collected included demographic data, preinfusion blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and preinfusion pressure-rate quotients (pressure-rate quotient = mean arterial pressure / heart rate). Intravenous bolus dose, when given, and diltiazem infusion rate and time necessary to achieve the target heart rate also were recorded. The lowest heart rate recorded within 24 hrs from the initiation of the infusion and the time necessary to achieve the lowest heart rate after beginning the infusion were recorded.

Measurements and Results

Of 171 patients studied, 97 (56%) were classified as responders. Multiple linear regression suggested that response could be predicted by age, pressure-rate quotients, baseline mean arterial pressure, and central nervous system failure. In the responders, a heart rate < 100 beats/min was achieved in an average of 2 hrs, at a mean diltiazem infusion of 13.3 mg/hr. The lowest rate reached by the responders in a 24-hr period averaged 86 beats/min and was achieved in 4.8 hrs with a mean infusion rate of 14.8 mg/hr. Both target and lowest rate values were statistically different from baseline heart rate.

Conclusion

Diltiazem was effective in achieving short-term control of heart rate in 56% of the patients, virtually without adverse effects, where beta-blockade was contraindicated or ineffective.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: a clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows: RECOMMENDATION 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A. RECOMMENDATION 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1B. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options. RECOMMENDATION 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2A. RECOMMENDATION 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115E7Do6]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), and other arrhythmias — key associations and treatment considerations are stated as follows: "Hypertension predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular arrhythmias, but most commonly AF", and "High–normal BP is associated with incident AF, and hypertension is the most prevalent concomitant condition in AF patients". "AF adds to the risk of stroke and heart failure. AF necessitates stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation, with monitoring of the associated risks and prevention of bleeding". For rate control in AF with hypertension, "beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (e.g. diltiazem and verapamil) are recommended as antihypertensive agents", but "Non-dihydropyridine CCBs should be avoided in patients with reduced LV systolic function and may precipitate heart failure in some patients". "Beta-blockers are often indicated to reduce ventricular rate and may need to be combined with digoxin to obtain rate control". Regarding prevention of AF, "RAS blockers have been shown to reduce first occurrence of AF, compared with beta-blockers or CCBs", whereas "Beta-blockers do not prevent recurrence of paroxysmal or persistent AF", and "In patients with heart failure, beta-blockers and MRAs may also prevent AF".

### Association of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers versus β-adrenergic receptor blockers with risk of heart failure hospitalization [^111cmhTc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are interrelated and often coexisting conditions in older adults. Although equally recommended, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs), such as diltiazem and verapamil, are less often used than β blockers. Because recent studies suggested that β-blocker use in both HFpEF and AF may increase the risk for HF, we tested whether non-DHP CCBs were associated with lower HF hospitalization risk than β blockers. We examined fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who were aged ≥ 66 years, had HFpEF or AF, and newly initiated a β blocker (n = 83,458) or non-DHP CCB (n = 18,924) from 2014 to 2018. The outcomes of HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression in the full cohort and, separately, in the subset without a recent hospital or skilled nursing discharge. Follow-up was analyzed using 2 frameworks: intention-to-treat and censored-at-drug-switch-or-discontinuation. There was a modestly protective association of non-DHP CCBs for the risk of HF hospitalization. Before drug switch or discontinuation, the use of diltiazem or verapamil was associated with decreased risk of HF hospitalization in the full cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 to 1.00, p = 0.05) and in the subgroup (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89, p = 0.003). However, the association with all-cause mortality tended to favor β blockers, including in the intention-to-treat analysis (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.25, p < 0.001). In conclusion, compared with β blockers, the initiation of diltiazem or verapamil in patients with HFpEF or AF may be associated with fewer HF hospitalization events but also with more all-cause deaths.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112YJxMn]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blockers — statin co-prescription context is as follows: Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) include dihydropyridines (eg, amlodipine, felodipine) and nondihydropyridines (diltiazem and verapamil), and because of clearly defined cardiovascular benefits, CCBs are often co-prescribed in patients treated with statin therapy.

Antiarrhythmic drug pharmacodynamics — key interaction risks and monitoring are described: for Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD), "Combinations of these drugs reduce cardiac contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia, intracardiac conduction disturbances, and proarrhythmia", and "Co-administration of Class I AAD with beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, or digoxin increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and hypotension"; "Lidocaine is less effective in the presence of hypokalaemia; therefore, it should be corrected", and "Propafenone increases the effects of cyclosporin, desipramine, and theophylline"; with beta‑blockers, "Their combination with Class I AAD, digoxin or amiodarone increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block and myocardial depression… [and] The combination with diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided because it increases the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure"; for amiodarone, "Co-administration with digoxin, beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block and hypotension; thus, ECG and blood pressure should be monitored… Severe bradycardia has been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with hepatitis C antiviral drugs (daclatasvir, ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir)", while "Combination of amiodarone with fentanyl may cause hypotension, bradycardia, and decreases cardiac output" and "Higher IV doses of dopamine and dobutamine are needed in patients on amiodarone"; torsade risk is highlighted as "Class I and III AAD (particularly dofetilide, ibutilide, and sotalol) prolong the QT interval and should be used with caution (or avoided)… [and] Hypokalaemia increases the risk of torsades de pointes and potentiates digoxin-induced arrhythmias; thus, it should be corrected"; for nondihydropyridine calcium‑channel blockers, "Co-administration of diltiazem or verapamil with disopyramide or inhaled anaesthetics decreases cardiac contractility and increases the risk of bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension; therefore, it should be avoided"; for adenosine, "Its coadministration with beta-blockers, digoxin, diltiazem, or verapamil increases the risk of bradycardia and AV block… Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine potentiating its effects; theophylline blocks adenosine receptors and decreases the effects of adenosine".

### Siponimod (Mayzent) [^115RN3d1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec)
Arrhythmias requiring treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]
Ischemic heart disease, heart failure, history of cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension
A history of second-degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block [see Contraindications (4)]

Treatment-Initiation Recommendations

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present.
In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of MAYZENT treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].
In patients with sinus bradycardia (HR less than 55 bpm), first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure, if not contraindicated, ECG testing and first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4) and Contraindications (4)].
Since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in patients with history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, MAYZENT is not recommended in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.
Use of MAYZENT in patients with a history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
Experience with MAYZENT is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate, such as ivabradine and digoxin). Concomitant use of these drugs during MAYZENT initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block.
For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing MAYZENT treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 50 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, MAYZENT can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 50 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart rate is greater than 50 bpm. Treatment with MAYZENT can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after MAYZENT has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with MAYZENT should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Atrial fibrillation (acute onset) [^117NdQZ7]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute atrial fibrillation is rapid, irregular, and chaotic atrial activity of less than 48 hours' duration. Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease. Acute atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. The condition resolves spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours in over 50% of people; however, many people will require interventions to control heart rate or restore sinus rhythm.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent embolism, for conversion to sinus rhythm, and to control heart rate in people with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (within 7 days) who are haemodynamically stable? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 30 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amiodarone, antithrombotic treatment before cardioversion, digoxin, diltiazem, direct current cardioversion, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, sotalol, timolol, and verapamil.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^115Varue]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There have been reports of significant bradycardia, heart failure, and cardiovascular collapse with concurrent use of verapamil and beta blockers.

Coadministration of propranolol and diltiazem in patients with cardiac disease has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, high-degree heart block, and heart failure.

ACE Inhibitors

When combined with beta blockers, ACE inhibitors can cause hypotension, particularly in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

The antihypertensive effects of clonidine may be antagonized by beta blockers. Propranolol hydrochloride tablets should be administered cautiously to patients withdrawing from clonidine.

Alpha Blockers

Prazosin has been associated with prolongation of first dose hypotension in the presence of beta blockers. Postural hypotension has been reported in patients taking both beta blockers and terazosin or doxazosin.

Reserpine

Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, should be closely observed for excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous activity, which may result in hypotension, marked bradycardia, vertigo, syncopal attacks, or orthostatic hypotension.

Inotropic Agents

Patients on long-term therapy with propranolol may experience uncontrolled hypertension if administered epinephrine as a consequence of unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation. Epinephrine is therefore not indicated in the treatment of propranolol overdose (see OVERDOSAGE).

### The importance of beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure [^112FaXSM]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Heart failure, the only cardiovascular disease with an increasing incidence, is associated with significant mortality and poses a considerable economic burden. Traditionally, beta blockers have been considered to be contraindicated in patients with heart failure. Recently, however, several large randomized, controlled mortality trials have been stopped early because of significant improvement in mortality rates in patients with heart failure who were given beta blockers in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and, sometimes, digoxin. Beta blockers should now be considered standard therapy in patients with New York Heart Association class II or class III heart failure who are hemodynamically stable, who do not have dyspnea at rest and who have no other contraindications to the use of these agents.
