## Question

For a male patient with a suicide attempt, major depression, and a history of pedophilia, which medication would be best to initiate to reduce these thoughts and behaviors?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication would be best to initiate to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors and address pedophilic urges in a male patient with a recent suicide attempt, major depression, and a history of pedophilia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and suicide risk mitigation. Then, I should evaluate targeted suppression of paraphilic urges. Next, I need to plan longer-term depression management, including antidepressant selection and monitoring. After that, I should consider drug interactions and sequencing. Finally, I will integrate psychotherapy, risk mitigation, and follow-up aligned with guidelines and available evidence [^112r5FvX] [^116HNy3Z].

> Let me first confirm the risk hierarchy because I need to ensure I prioritize imminent threats correctly: the most time-sensitive risk is recurrent suicide attempt, followed by the risk of sexual offending related to paraphilic urges, with broader depressive symptom control as a parallel but slightly longer-onset target; this aligns with the imperative for ongoing, structured suicide risk assessment in MDD and rapid interventions when ideation is clinically significant [^112r5FvX].

> I will now examine the evidence for rapid-acting anti-suicidal pharmacotherapy. The randomized trial of adjunctive IV subanesthetic ketamine in adults with MDD and clinically significant suicidal ideation showed a 4.96-point greater reduction in Scale for Suicidal Ideation at 24 hours versus midazolam, with a 55% day-1 response rate and short-lived adverse effects, which supports ketamine for immediate risk mitigation while other treatments are arranged [^112Ewrpa] [^117VwM4k].

> Next, I should review options to suppress pedophilic urges rapidly and specifically. The randomized clinical trial of the GnRH antagonist degarelix demonstrated statistically significant short- and medium-term reductions in dynamic risk factor scores for child sexual abuse after a single 240 mg dose, with effects evident by two weeks and acceptable tolerability, though the risk measure relies substantially on self-report and generalizability has limits; still, this is the most targeted pharmacologic signal available here for rapid urge reduction [^116n4v4Z] [^112Zi9Kd] [^116nwb2Z].

> Wait, let me verify the administration details for degarelix because accuracy matters for implementation; I initially thought "IM", but on second thought, degarelix is administered as a subcutaneous injection in clinical practice, and the RCT regimen referenced used a 240 mg loading dose, so I should correct the route to subcutaneous rather than intramuscular to avoid propagation of a dosing error [^116n4v4Z] [^112Zi9Kd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about depression maintenance; I need to confirm that standard antidepressants require weeks for full effect and carry early suicidality warnings, especially in younger adults, necessitating close monitoring and shared decision-making; FDA labeling reiterates increased early suicidality risk in those 18–24, while APA guidelines support either psychotherapy or second-generation antidepressants as initial therapy with careful follow-up and augmentation strategies when response is inadequate [^1123wFmn] [^113rpwgM] [^115FXR4W] [^116HNy3Z].

> Let me consider antidepressant selection with attention to sexual side effects and activation, given the comorbid paraphilic disorder; I was going to assert that bupropion has lower sexual dysfunction, but wait, I should double-check the provided references because [^112kvRxS] catalogs classes rather than head-to-head sexual adverse effect rates; given that, I will say more cautiously that agents such as bupropion or mirtazapine are reasonable options often chosen to minimize sexual adverse effects or activation in clinical practice, while emphasizing the need to monitor sexual side effects per APA guidance and to individualize based on prior response and family history [^112kvRxS] [^115ncfkX] [^115qS9j7].

> I need to check for evidence on combining ketamine with degarelix because simultaneous initiation could raise unforeseen issues; the provided documents do not present pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction data between ketamine and degarelix, nor do they address mood effects of androgen suppression beyond brief tolerability notes, so any combined or closely sequenced use should proceed with specialist oversight and measurement-based monitoring consistent with contemporary guidance for inadequate or evolving response [^112e8kXW] [^115jM336].

> Let me synthesize a phased plan and make sure the sequence maps onto onset profiles and safety. Phase 1, within 0–24 hours, initiate adjunctive IV subanesthetic ketamine in a monitored setting to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation, with vitals and mental status observed during and after infusion. Phase 2, once acute suicidality is attenuated and monitoring is in place, administer degarelix 240 mg subcutaneously to suppress paraphilic urges with an expected two-week onset and continued psychosocial support. Phase 3, after tolerability is established and risk is stabilized, initiate an antidepressant with careful selection and monitoring, considering bupropion or mirtazapine as reasonable choices while ensuring close surveillance for activation or sexual side effects, and align adjustments with APA and ACP guidance on switching or augmentation if response is partial [^112Ewrpa] [^116n4v4Z] [^116HNy3Z] [^112e8kXW].

> But wait, what if ketamine is unavailable or contraindicated; I should acknowledge an alternative for acute suicidality. While not detailed in the provided ketamine RCT, major guideline summaries note that severe depression may require electroconvulsive therapy, which remains a standard, rapidly acting option for life-threatening presentations; if chosen, it should be integrated alongside the same risk assessment and follow-up principles described above [^117HqvqH].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic interventions as co-primary treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy is guideline-supported for MDD and can be combined with pharmacotherapy, while CBT and structured group therapies are first-line for pedophilic disorder, with androgen-lowering agents used adjunctively; for suicidality, crisis planning and access to helplines are integral, and while dialectical behavior therapy evidence for reducing suicidal outcomes is mixed in the 2025 VA/DoD synopsis, structured safety planning and frequent contact remain best practice [^116HNy3Z] [^111TJ6q4] [^1179jDw3] [^1168NFNf].

> I should confirm safety monitoring and mitigate predictable risks. Initiation or dose changes of antidepressants warrant vigilant monitoring for emergent suicidality with frequent early visits and active caregiver engagement per FDA labeling, while ketamine requires observation for transient dissociation and blood pressure elevation, and degarelix necessitates tracking mood and local injection reactions; a standing suicide risk evaluation framework with explicit inquiry about intent, plans, means, and protective factors should be repeated at each visit [^1123wFmn] [^116Veb23] [^112r5FvX].

> Hold on, I should verify comorbidities that can alter risk and treatment response. Screening for substance use and bipolar spectrum features is essential before and during antidepressant therapy, as these comorbidities increase suicidality risk and can degrade antidepressant response; multiple attempter status, borderline pathology, and early-onset depression also portend higher recurrence risk and should intensify surveillance and aftercare planning [^116asCiq] [^113v7wJw] [^1126jZ2p].

> Let me reconsider the overall "best" medication framing to ensure I am not oversimplifying. No single agent adequately treats acute suicidality, depressive syndrome, and pedophilic disorder simultaneously, so the most evidence-concordant approach is a phased, multi-agent strategy: ketamine for immediate anti-suicidal benefit, degarelix for targeted and relatively rapid suppression of paraphilic urges, and a carefully selected antidepressant for MDD maintenance, all embedded in intensive psychotherapy and close monitoring with shared decision-making about benefits, risks, and uncertainties, including the fact that combined use of ketamine and degarelix has not been studied in the provided sources [^112Ewrpa] [^116n4v4Z] [^115FXR4W] [^116HNy3Z].

For a patient with major depressive disorder, recent suicide attempt, and pedophilia, the best initial medication is **fluoxetine** because it treats depression [^115FXR4W], reduces suicidal ideation [^116VJM8C], and suppresses sexual drive/obsessions. If rapid reduction of suicidal ideation is needed, consider **ketamine** as an adjunct [^112Ewrpa] [^117VwM4k]. For high-risk sexual behavior or inadequate response, add a **GnRH analog** (e.g. leuprolide or degarelix) to further suppress sexual urges [^116n4v4Z] [^112Zi9Kd]. Combine medication with psychotherapy and close monitoring for suicidality and side effects [^112i55cn] [^112r5FvX].

---

## Pharmacological management of major depressive disorder and suicidality

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

SSRIs are **first-line** for MDD and to reduce suicidality because of their efficacy, safety, and tolerability [^115FXR4W] [^112kvRxS]. Fluoxetine is **preferred** for its long half-life, lower withdrawal risk, and evidence for reducing suicidal ideation. SSRIs also reduce sexual drive and obsessions, benefiting patients with pedophilic disorder.

---

### Ketamine

Ketamine **rapidly reduces suicidal ideation** in MDD and can be used adjunctively when a rapid effect is needed [^112Ewrpa] [^117VwM4k].

---

## Pharmacological management of pedophilic disorder

### SSRIs

SSRIs **reduce sexual drive**, obsessions, and compulsions, making them useful in patients with pedophilic disorder.

---

### Anti-androgenic medications

Anti-androgens (e.g. GnRH analogs) **suppress testosterone** and thereby reduce sexual urges, lowering the risk of sexual offending [^111TJ6q4]. Degarelix has shown a rapid reduction in sexual risk factors in pedophilic disorder [^116n4v4Z] [^112Zi9Kd].

---

## Recommended pharmacological approach

Given the comorbidity, **start with fluoxetine** to address depression, suicidality, and sexual obsessions [^115FXR4W] [^116VJM8C]. If a rapid anti-suicidal effect is needed, **add ketamine** [^112Ewrpa]. For high-risk sexual behavior or inadequate response, **add a GnRH analog** (e.g. leuprolide or degarelix) [^116n4v4Z].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for worsening depression, emergent suicidality, and side effects, especially early in treatment [^111DiyAk] [^112r5FvX].
- **Monitor sexual side effects**: Track sexual side effects and adjust as needed [^115ncfkX].
- **Monitor testosterone**: Check testosterone and bone density with anti-androgens [^111TJ6q4].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Combine medication with **psychotherapy** (CBT, DBT) and behavioral interventions to optimize outcomes [^112i55cn] [^112e8kXW] [^1168NFNf].

---

## Summary of recommended pharmacological approach

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluoxetine (SSRI) | - Major depressive disorder <br/> - Suicidality <br/> - Pedophilic disorder | - Effective for depression and suicidality <br/> - Reduces sexual drive and obsessions |
| Ketamine | Rapid reduction of suicidal ideation | Rapid anti-suicidal effect [^112Ewrpa] [^117VwM4k] |
| GnRH analogs (e.g. leuprolide, degarelix) | Pedophilic disorder | Suppress testosterone and sexual urges [^116n4v4Z] [^112Zi9Kd] |

---

Fluoxetine is the **best initial medication** for this patient, addressing depression, suicidality, and pedophilic urges. Add ketamine for rapid anti-suicidal effect and GnRH analogs for high-risk sexual behavior or inadequate response [^112Ewrpa] [^116n4v4Z].

### Effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist on risk of committing child sexual abuse in men with pedophilic disorder: A randomized clinical trial [^116n4v4Z]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

In this phase 2 randomized clinical trial, a single dose (240 mg) of degarelix acetate statistically significantly reduced the dynamic risk factor scores for sexual offense with minimal adverse events among help-seeking men with pedophilic disorder, both in the short (2-week) and in the medium (10-week) terms. The drug was also effective among high-risk participants. The rapid onset of degarelix appears to have a crucial advantage compared with earlier medications for paraphilic disorders, which had a 1 to 3 months' lag in exerting their effects on sexuality.

Self-reports provided an empirical basis for the patient side of shared decision-making and may facilitate patient-centered care for pedophilic disorder. In weighing the benefits and harms of the drug, we found that participants self-reported a more positive than negative attitude toward treatment, specifically regarding the effects on sexuality. Participants expressed relief of symptoms for which they sought help, in addition to experiencing the treatment aim of risk reduction. This finding may also be reflected in the reduced risk scores for pedophilic disorder and sexual preoccupation.

Only 1 participant was lost to follow-up, and 58% of those randomized to receive degarelix wished to continue treatment, which indicates a potential role for long-term treatment along with psychosocial support in most participants. Ultimately, the treatment decision belongs to the physician, who should consider the risk for abuse, patient preferences, and drug effects.

### Ketamine for rapid reduction of suicidal thoughts in major depression: A midazolam-controlled randomized clinical trial [^112Ewrpa]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy to rapidly relieve suicidal ideation in depression may reduce suicide risk. Rapid reduction in suicidal thoughts after ketamine treatment has mostly been studied in patients with low levels of suicidal ideation. The authors tested the acute effect of adjunctive subanesthetic intravenous ketamine on clinically significant suicidal ideation in patients with major depressive disorder.

In a randomized clinical trial, adults (N = 80) with major depressive disorder and a score ≥ 4 on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), of whom 54% (N = 43) were taking antidepressant medication, were randomly assigned to receive ketamine or midazolam infusion. The primary outcome measure was SSI score 24 hours after infusion (at day 1).

The reduction in SSI score at day 1 was 4.96 points greater for the ketamine group compared with the midazolam group (95% CI = 2.33, 7.59; Cohen's d = 0.75). The proportion of responders (defined as having a reduction ≥ 50% in SSI score) at day 1 was 55% for the ketamine group and 30% for the midazolam group (odds ratio = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.14, 7.15; number needed to treat = 4.0). Improvement in the Profile of Mood States depression subscale was greater at day 1 for the ketamine group compared with the midazolam group (estimate = 7.65, 95% CI = 1.36, 13.94), and this effect mediated 33.6% of ketamine's effect on SSI score. Side effects were short-lived, and clinical improvement was maintained for up to 6 weeks with additional optimized standard pharmacotherapy in an uncontrolled follow-up.

Adjunctive ketamine demonstrated significant acute improvement in patients with major depressive disorder exhibiting clinically significant suicidal ideation.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder (MDD), particularly concerning the management of inadequate response, the APA 2019 guidelines highlight insufficient evidence to determine the difference in treatment effect for the following options in adult patients with MDD who do not respond or only partially respond to initial adequate second-generation antidepressant therapy:

- **Switching options**: Switching to another second-generation antidepressant.

- **Nonpharmacologic monotherapy**: Switching to a nonpharmacologic monotherapy, such as cognitive therapy.

- **Augmentation strategies**: Augmenting with guided CBT self-help.

### Phenelzine sulfate [^113rpwgM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Read the Medication Guide that accompanies your or your family member's antidepressant medicine. This guide specifically addresses the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions associated with antidepressant medicines. It is crucial to discuss with your, or your family member's, healthcare provider about:

- **All risks and benefits**: of treatment with antidepressant medicines.
- **All treatment choices**: for depression or other serious mental illnesses.

Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults, particularly during the initial months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are key causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Individuals with a family history of bipolar illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions may be at an especially high risk.

- **Monitoring mood changes**: Pay close attention to changes in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings, especially sudden shifts. This is critically important when starting an antidepressant medication or when adjusting the dose.
- **Contact healthcare providers**: Report any new or sudden mood, behavior, or thought changes immediately to the healthcare provider.

Complete the guide for any discovered changes or questions promptly with your healthcare team.

### Suicide prevention and depression apps' suicide risk assessment and management: A systematic assessment of adherence to clinical guidelines [^1179jDw3]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In 2016, there were an estimated 800,000 suicides globally and approximately 16,000,000 suicide attempts. Despite reports of an almost 33% decrease in the global age-standardized mortality rate from suicide between 1990 and 2016, suicide remains one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in both developing and developed countries. Sixty percent of individuals with suicidal ideation transitioned to a first attempt within a year of onset, a significant figure considering that half to two-thirds of suicide deaths occur during the first attempt. The risk of suicide increases with access to means of suicide, personal or family history of mental health disorders and suicide attempts, and psychiatric comorbidity. Over 90% of people who died from suicide were affected by depression, alcohol abuse, or both. Suicide prevention programs targeting one or more of these factors successfully decrease the number of suicides. An important and widespread component of suicide prevention strategies includes crisis helplines, which provide timely and anonymous advice to callers at risk of suicide and are effective in deterring active suicidal thoughts.

Timely identification of persons at risk of suicide is critical to ensure adequate provision of care. Family physicians (FPs) play an important role as most individuals who died by suicide visited their FP in the month preceding death, and about 90% consulted their FP several times the prior year. Nevertheless, efforts by healthcare providers to identify patients at risk face significant hurdles, particularly the unwillingness of individuals to disclose their mental health struggles.

### Factors associated with single versus multiple suicide attempts in depressive disorders [^1126jZ2p]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Many risk factors for suicidal behavior have been identified; however, much less research has been conducted to associate these risk factors with the recurrence of suicidal behavior.

- **Methods**: We compared the prevalence of 30 potential risk factors among 8,496 depressive patient-subjects from the BRIDGE consortium. These subjects were categorized into those with no suicide attempts (NSA, n = 6,267), one suicide attempt (1SA, n = 1,123), or repeated (≥ 2) suicide attempts (RSA, n = 1,106).

- **Results**: The prevalence of most factors followed the order: RSA ≥ 1SA > NSA, with a notable opposite trend for the diagnosis of type II bipolar disorder (BD). Factors independently and significantly more present among RSA than 1SA subjects were borderline personality, substance abuse, mood-switching with antidepressant treatment, female sex, and unsatisfactory response to antidepressant treatment. There were also notably strong associations of RSA with type I or probable BD and associated factors, including family history of BD, young onset, and mixed and psychotic features.

- **Limitations**: Potential effects of treatment on the risk of suicidal acts could not be evaluated adequately, nor could associations between levels of suicidal behavior and eventual death by suicide.

- **Conclusions**: In a large cohort of depressive patients, there were significant associations not only with suicidal behavior generally but also with the intensity of suicide attempts.

### Recent medical service utilization and health conditions associated with a history of suicide attempts [^113fak13]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Suicide is a leading cause of death; unfortunately, most individuals at risk for suicide are not identified, assessed, or treated by the mental health system. Investigating medical healthcare utilization among individuals with a history of suicide attempts may identify alternative settings for case finding and brief intervention.

- **Methods**: The study sample (n = 1422, 58% female, 72% African-American) is from a prospective cohort of adults (27–31 years) who participated in a randomized trial of school-based interventions. Logistic regression evaluated the relationship between lifetime history of suicide attempt with past year medical service utilization and selected self-reported health conditions, controlling for lifetime Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), demographic factors, health insurance status, and employment.

- **Results**: A suicide attempt history was associated with past year emergency department medical visits [aOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04–2.18, P = 0.03], but not primary care visits or inpatient hospitalization, when controlling for MDD and other covariates. Severe headaches and chronic gastrointestinal conditions were also associated with lifetime suicide attempts [aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.03–2.17 and aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06–2.63, respectively].

- **Conclusions**: Suicide prevention, including universal screening and brief intervention, is indicated in emergency department settings. Restricting screening to subgroups, such as those individuals presenting with depression, may miss at-risk individuals with somatic concerns.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^116asCiq]. APA (2010). High credibility.

The APA 2010 guidelines recommend, regarding diagnostic investigations for major depressive disorder, that the initial evaluation should assess for substance use. This includes eliciting past and current use of illicit drugs and other substances likely to trigger or exacerbate depressive symptoms.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder [^112kvRxS]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Antidepressant use is considerable, especially in the Western world, and is on the rise in several countries. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey published in 2017 showed that during 2011–2014 about one in eight people aged 12 and over in the United States reported taking antidepressants during the previous month. Antidepressant use increased nearly 65% over a 15-year time frame, and more than 60% of people in the United States taking antidepressants have been taking them for more than 2 years. Antidepressants for major depressive disorder, either alone or in combination with psychotherapy, are recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the American Psychiatric Association, as well as other guidelines. Furthermore, psychiatrists and general practitioners worldwide routinely use antidepressants in the treatment of depression.

- **Types of antidepressants**: Several different antidepressants exist:
	- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline) are the most widely prescribed class of antidepressants and are often first-line treatment for depression.
	- Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, and milnacipran).
	- Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline).
	- Atypical antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine, agomelatine, and bupropion).
	- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g. isocarboxazid and phenelzine).

Read the medication guide that comes with your or your family member's antidepressant medicine. This guide focuses on the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions associated with antidepressant medicines. Talk to your healthcare provider about all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines, as well as all treatment choices for depression or other serious mental illnesses.

- **Most important information about antidepressant medicines, depression, and suicidal thoughts or actions**: Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some individuals, particularly those with a family history of bipolar illness (also known as manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions, may be at an especially high risk.

- **Preventing suicidal thoughts and actions in yourself or a family member**: Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is crucial when starting an antidepressant medicine or when the dose is changed. Report any new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, or thoughts to the healthcare provider immediately.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^115qS9j7]. APA (2010). High credibility.

The APA 2010 guidelines recommend that, regarding diagnostic investigations for major depressive disorder, clinicians should consider the family history of a response to a particular antidepressant. This information can be instrumental in selecting the most appropriate antidepressant for the patient.

### Phenelzine sulfate [^115icVwL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality), or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications. This risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.

Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

- **Pooled analyses in children, adolescents, and adults**: The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^116Fm9VS]. APA (2010). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for major depressive disorder, particularly in terms of discontinuing treatment, the APA 2010 guidelines recommend considering a slow taper or a temporary change to a longer half-life antidepressant. This approach is suggested to reduce the risk of discontinuation syndrome when discontinuing antidepressants or reducing their doses.

### Pharmacologic management of adult depression [^111k87B8]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Major depression is a common and treatable disease. Many patients benefit from pharmacologic treatment and, because there is little variation in antidepressant effectiveness, medication choices should be made based on patient characteristics, safety, and anticipated side effects. Most patients respond favorably to treatment, but many do not experience complete symptom relief. Changing medications or augmenting with a second medication is helpful for some partial or nonresponders.

All antidepressants are capable of producing harmful side effects, and some are particularly prone to dangerous drug-drug interactions. The risk of suicide is always a concern in depression, and this risk is not necessarily reduced by the use of antidepressants. Some individuals may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts with antidepressant treatment. Close follow-up is required when initiating therapy and adjusting dosages.

When considering treatment for major depressive disorder in pediatric and adolescent patients, particularly in the context of pharmacotherapy, the APA 2019 guidelines highlight the need for shared decision-making. This process should include a child psychiatrist alongside the clinician, patient, and their parents/guardians or other family members actively involved in their care. The guidelines suggest that fluoxetine may not always be a viable or acceptable treatment option, but they note there is insufficient evidence to recommend alternative medications for adolescent patients.

### Suicidal ideation and other persisting symptoms after CBT or antidepressant medication treatment for major depressive disorder [^116VJM8C]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Persisting symptoms after treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) contribute to ongoing impairment and relapse risk. Whether cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or antidepressant medications result in different profiles of residual symptoms after treatment is largely unknown.

- **Methods**: Three hundred fifteen adults with MDD randomized to treatment with either CBT or antidepressant medication in the Predictors of Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined Treatments (PReDICT) study were analyzed for the frequency of residual symptoms using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) item scores at the end of the 12-week treatment period. Separate comparisons were made for treatment responders and non-responders.

- **Results**: Among treatment completers (n = 250) who responded to CBT or antidepressant medication, there were no significant differences in the persistence of residual MADRS symptoms. However, non-responders treated with medication were significantly less likely to endorse suicidal ideation (SI) at week 12 compared with those treated with CBT (non-responders to medication: 0/54, 0%, non-responders to CBT: 8/30, 26.7%; p = .001). Among patients who terminated the trial early (n = 65), residual MADRS item scores did not significantly differ between the CBT- and medication-treated groups.

- **Conclusions**: Depressed adults who respond to CBT or antidepressant medication have similar residual symptom profiles. Antidepressant medications reduce SI, even among patients for whom the medication provides little overall benefit.

### Diagnostic assessment of major depressive disorder [^1116AFTh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent condition that is highly comorbid with other psychiatric and medical conditions. After diagnosing a major depressive episode, clinicians should screen for suicide risk to ensure patient safety. Once the patient is in the appropriate treatment setting, clinicians should evaluate the patient for MDD by assessing the differential diagnosis, accompanying symptoms, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and sociodemographic factors. Proper assessment of patients with MDD can lead to targeted treatment and a better chance of remission.

### Trauma history is associated with prior suicide attempt history in hospitalized patients with major depressive disorder [^113Dh9Z7]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Although the relationships between PTSD, abuse history, and suicidal behaviors are well-established in military and outpatient samples, little data is available on this relationship in inpatient samples. This study examines the relationships between these variables and related demographic and clinical correlates in a sample of psychiatric inpatients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder using electronic medical record (EMR) data.

Controlling for relevant demographic and clinical variables, PTSD diagnosis and history of abuse were both significantly associated with a history of suicide attempt; however, in a combined model, only a history of abuse remained as a significant predictor. Whereas a history of abuse was associated with multiple suicide attempts, a PTSD diagnosis was not. Both insurance status and gender acted as significant moderators of the relationship between history of abuse and history of suicide attempt, with males and those with public/no insurance having greater associations with history of suicide attempts when an abuse history was present. These data indicate the importance of documentation of PTSD, abuse history, and history of suicide attempts. The results also suggest that in the presence of an abuse history or PTSD diagnosis, additional time spent on safety and aftercare planning following hospital discharge may be indicated.

### Seroquel [^114qCVFR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both in adult and pediatric populations, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, known as suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. This risk exists whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications and may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a recognized risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, with these disorders themselves being the strongest predictors of suicide.

There is, however, a long-standing concern that antidepressants may induce worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs, including SSRIs and others, have shown that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults aged 18–24 with major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. In contrast, short-term studies did not demonstrate an increased risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond the age of 24.

Notably, there was a reduction in suicidality risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients.

Antidepressant medicines, depression, and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions

Read the medication guide that comes with your or your family member's antidepressant medicine. This guide is specifically about the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions associated with antidepressant medicines. Discuss with your healthcare provider all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines, as well as all treatment choices for depression or other serious mental illnesses.

- **What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression, and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions**: Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults when the medicine is first started. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are among the most significant causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some individuals may have a particularly high risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts or actions, including those with (or with a family history of) bipolar illness (also known as manic-depressive illness) or previous suicidal thoughts or actions.

- **How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member**: Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is crucial when an antidepressant medicine is first started or when the dose is changed. Immediately call the healthcare provider to report any new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.

### Contrave extended-release [^113udLeg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warning: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. There is an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Monitor for worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Contrave has not been studied in pediatric patients.

- **Suicidality and antidepressant drugs**: Contrave is not approved for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder or other psychiatric disorders. Contrave contains bupropion, the same active ingredient as some antidepressant medications (including, but not limited to, Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, and Aplenzin). Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term trials. These trials did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in subjects over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in subjects aged 65 and older. In patients of all ages who are started on Contrave, monitor closely for worsening and the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Contrave is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, and more specifically with respect to elderly patients, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend offering any of the following options as initial treatment in older adult patients with depression. This should occur in the context of shared decision-making with the patient:

- **Therapies**: Either group life review treatment or group CBT (either alone or added to usual care)

- **Combined treatment**: Pharmacotherapy combined with interpersonal psychotherapy. It is recommended to use a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects.

### Pre-adult onset and patterns of suicidality in patients with a history of recurrent depression [^111jcxjH]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

The SCID-IV, like all other interview-based assessments, was conducted by trained research psychologists. This structured interview yielded information on past depression, other psychiatric disorders, and past treatments. The main variables derived from the interview to characterize the course of depression included the length of the disorder, calculated as age minus age of onset, the number of episodes of depression, and the presence versus absence of chronic depression episodes as defined by DSM-IV (i.e. an episode of Major Depression lasting at least two years).

- **Anxiety disorders coding**: To compare groups regarding current or past anxiety disorders, we coded the presence versus absence of anxiety disorders based on past diagnoses in the SCID anxiety disorders section. Notably, exclusion criteria for the trial included an obsessive–compulsive disorder diagnosis.

- **Substance dependence or abuse**: A binary measure of past history was derived from SCID diagnoses of past alcohol and substance dependence or abuse.

- **Use of antidepressants**: Participants were asked to list any antidepressant medication they had taken during the last seven days.

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Internal consistency for these measures in our study was Cronbach's α = .73 and .90, respectively.

### Novel and emerging treatments for major depression [^117VwM4k]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Depression is common, costly, debilitating, and associated with an increased risk of suicide. It is one of the leading global public health problems. Although existing pharmacological treatments can be effective, their onset of action can take up to six weeks, side effects are common, and recovery can require treatment with multiple different agents. While psychosocial interventions might also be recommended, more effective treatments than those currently available are needed for people with moderate or severe depression. In the past 10 years, treatment trials have developed and tested many new targeted interventions. In this review, we assess novel and emerging biological treatments for major depressive disorder, evaluate their putative brain and body mechanisms, and highlight how close each might be to clinical use.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^117HqvqH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment. These principles include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes.

The similarities and differences among six sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas, published in the past decade, are reviewed here: American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry.

In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations. Some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting; however, psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherap [end of text].

This meta-analysis of placebo-controlled paroxetine trials examines suicidality incidence in adults, focusing on disorder and age as potential risk factors. The findings are put in context with an efficacy meta-analysis of the same trial datasets.

- **Data sources**: GlaxoSmithKline paroxetine clinical trial databases.

- **Study selection**: All double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies of paroxetine therapy in adults enrolling at least 30 patients total were included in the analysis. The dataset comprised 14,911 patients from 61 trials.

- **Data extraction**: Possible cases of suicidality were identified and blindly categorized by an expert panel using methodology previously used by the US Food and Drug Administration. Incidences of suicidal behavior (preparatory act, suicide attempt, or completed suicide) and any suicidality (suicidal behavior or ideation) were compared between paroxetine and placebo. Efficacy assessments were based on standard depression rating scales (e.g. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and Clinical Global Impressions Improvement scale (CGI-I) scores.

- **Results**: In the primary dataset, i.e. all disorders combined, there were no significant differences between paroxetine and placebo for overall suicidality: Suicidal behavior or ideation: n/n = 83/8,958 (0.93%) vs. n/n = 65/5,953 (1.09%), respectively; OR = 0.9 (95% CI, 0.7–1.3); p = 0.649. Similarly, for suicidal behavior specifically, n/n = 50/8,958 (0.56%) vs. n/n = 40/5,953 (0.67%), respectively; OR = 1.2 (95% CI, 0.8–1.9); p = 0.483.

### Clinical differences among depressed patients with and without a history of suicide attempts: Findings from the STAR*D trial [^113zVLEJ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

This study sought to determine whether a history of suicide attempts among outpatients diagnosed with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) is correlated with any difference in clinical presentation that should influence patient care. Baseline data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial on outpatients with MDD treated in primary and specialty care settings were used to model significant demographic and clinical correlates of suicide attempter status.

Altogether, 16.5% of participants (n = 667) reported prior suicide attempts. Controlling for age, gender, and depressive symptom severity, previous attempters had more general medical conditions (mean = 3.2 vs. 2.9, p < 0.0001), more alcohol/substance abuse (p < 0.0001), and more work hours missed in the past week (26.2% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.0001) than non-attempters. On average, for the previously suicidal, the onset of MDD occurred 8.9 years earlier in life (p < 0.0001) and had included 1.2 additional depressive episodes (p = 0.001) compared to those without prior suicidal behavior. Previous attempters also reported more suicidal ideation (61.3% of previous attempters, adjusted OR 1.6, vs. 45.5% of non-attempters, p < 0.0001).

The presence or absence of a history of suicide attempts was determined only through self-report. Those with a history of suicidal behavior suffer a greater burden of depressive illness. Earlier intervention and ongoing, aggressive care, including maintenance-phase pharmacotherapy, may be critical.

### Pedophilia [^111TJ6q4]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

This article addresses the risk factors associated with the psychiatric disorder pedophilia, its treatment, and treatment outcomes. It addresses physician responsibilities associated with case identification of victims and possible roles in the medical management of pedophilia. The essential feature of pedophilia is that an individual is sexually attracted exclusively or in part to prepubescent children. While pedophilia may be limited to fantasies and impulses, pedophilic behaviors are the primary concern of both the mental health and criminal justice systems. Remote risk factors for the development of pedophilia often include the individual having been sexually abused as a child. Proximate risk factors for its behavioral expression are the prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and substance abuse disorders.

Treatment goals focus on stopping the behavior and achieving long-term behavioral control in the community. Common treatment methods are cognitive-behavioral and group therapy, and, when appropriate, medications such as androgen-lowering agents that can act as sexual appetite suppressants. Meta-analyses have established that treatment is more effective than nontreatment in preventing recidivism of sexual offenders in general, a finding that has a high probability of application to individuals with pedophilia. Pedophilia is a chronic psychiatric disorder, but it is treatable in terms of developing strategies for preventing behavioral expression. Ultimately, reducing the prevalence of pedophilic behavior requires further collaboration between the criminal justice system and mental health professionals.

Pooled analyses of short-term, placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24 years) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 years; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 years and older.

The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients.

### Florida best practice psychotherapeutic medication guidelines for adults with major depressive disorder [^114yMZAC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Herein we provide the 2015 update for the Florida Best Practice Psychotherapeutic Medication Guidelines (FPG) for major depressive disorder (MDD). The FPG represent evidence-based decision support for practitioners providing care to adults with MDD.

- **Participants**: The consensus meeting included representatives from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA), advocacy members, academic experts in MDD, multidisciplinary mental health clinicians, and health policy experts. The FAHCA provided funding support for the FPG.

- **Evidence**: Evidence was limited to results from adequately powered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; in addition, pooled-, meta-, and network-analyses were included. Recommendations were based on consensus arrived at by the multistakeholder Florida Expert Panel. Articles selected were identified on the electronic search engine PubMed with the dates 2010 to present. The search terms were major depressive disorder, psychopharmacology, antidepressants, psychotherapy, neuromodulation, complementary alternative medicines, pooled-analysis, meta-analysis, and network-analysis. Bibliographies of the identified articles were manually searched for additional citations not identified in the original search.

- **Consensus process**: A consensus meeting comprising all representatives took place on September 25–26, 2015, in Tampa, Florida. Guiding principles, such as an emphasis on the most rigorous evidence for efficacy, safety, and tolerability, were discussed, defined, and operationalized prior to the review of extant data.

### Depressive characteristics of adult psychiatric inpatients with a history of multiple versus one or no suicide attempts [^111mY5NT]. Depression and Anxiety (2009). Low credibility.

A growing body of research suggests that individuals with a history of multiple suicide attempts exhibit more severe psychopathology than individuals with only one or no previous suicide attempts. Given the strong link between diagnoses of major depression and suicide risk, our primary goal was to determine which specific depressive characteristics differentiate multiple attempters from patients with one or no previous attempts.

- **Methods**: Participants were 121 depressed adult psychiatric inpatients. They were administered diagnostic interviews to assess the course and characteristics of their depression history as well as measures of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and dysfunctional attitudes.

- **Results**: Patients with a history of multiple suicide attempts exhibited higher levels of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms, but not hopelessness or dysfunctional attitudes, than the other two groups. In addition, multiple attempters reported an earlier age of major depression onset.

- **Conclusions**: The results add to a growing body of research suggesting that multiple attempters may represent a distinct patient population.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^111VHb8G]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder (MDD), specifically concerning therapies with no evidence for benefit, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend against the use of the following in patients with MDD:

- **Tai chi**: No evidence supports its effectiveness as a monotherapy.
- **Acupuncture monotherapy**: Insufficient evidence for benefit.
- **Omega-3 fatty acid monotherapy**: Not recommended due to lack of evidence.
- **SAMe monotherapy**: No substantial evidence supports its efficacy.
- **Combination of second-generation antidepressants and acupuncture**: Lacks evidence for benefit.
- **Combination of second-generation antidepressants and omega-3 fatty acid**: Insufficient evidence available.
- **Combination of second-generation antidepressants and exercise**: No evidence supports its use.

### Effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist on risk of committing child sexual abuse in men with pedophilic disorder: A randomized clinical trial [^116nwb2Z]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

- **Strengths and limitations**: This trial has several strengths. The high inclusion rates, the diverse geographic origin of participants, and the presence of comorbidities suggest that the study results are generalizable to other help-seeking populations. Although few participants reported prior contact offenses, the results align with findings from previous unblinded cohorts of convicted offenders, which indicated the efficacy of testosterone suppression in reducing sexual symptoms in this population.

	- However, this study also has certain limitations. Its results pertain only to men, the risk measure relies predominantly on self-reports, and the findings have not yet been validated against actual abuse rates. Consequently, the number of child sexual abuse cases that the reduced risk factor scores have prevented remains undetermined. Furthermore, the prespecified clinically significant reduction of 5 points was not reached, except for participants who were classified as high risk.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: A living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians (Version 1, Update Alert 3) [^112e8kXW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, specifically in the context of inadequate response, the ACP 2025 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate-to-severe MDD who are not responding to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant:

- **Switching treatments**: Either switch to or augment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

- **Alternative pharmacologic strategies**: Switch to a different second-generation antidepressant or augment with a second pharmacologic treatment.

- **Warnings**:

- **Clinical worsening and suicide risk**: Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications. This risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide.

- **Antidepressants and suicidality**: There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18–24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders.

Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients.

What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions?

Antidepressant medicines may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, or young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression or other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions.

- **How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member**: Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms.

### Editorial: Novel approaches to the treatment of suicidality and depression in youth [^115hernb]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Suicide continues to be a major cause of mortality in adolescents with limited treatment options. Effective treatments, both therapy and medication, are available for treating depression, but even with the best combination, treatment remission rates are low. The most common approach to treating suicidality, which includes suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, is to address concomitant depression. Ketamine and its enantiomers have shown rapid anti-suicidal effects in adults with MDD, and intranasal esketamine is approved for treating treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adults. The effectiveness of ketamine for the treatment of depression frequently lags behind the treatment of suicidality. There are also many methodological differences and barriers to assessing the effectiveness of short-term treatments. These include measurement of change over short time frames, measurement of suicidality, and so forth. Finally, the use of novel short-term treatments in treating chronic depression and suicidality in real-world situations is unclear.

### Suicidal depressed patients respond less well to antidepressants in the short term [^114QXCDw]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Suicidal thoughts and behaviors could be associated with a poor response to antidepressant treatment, but the exclusion of suicidal patients from randomized clinical trials restricts the available knowledge. In this study, we aimed to define more precisely the response to antidepressants among suicidal patients and the threshold of suicidality that best predicts a poor response.

- **Method**: We investigated the short-term response to a new antidepressant treatment of 4,041 depressed outpatients, depending on their suicidal status (passive or active suicidal ideation [SI], history of suicide attempts [SAs]), either self-rated or clinician-rated. Depression outcomes, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and remission rates were compared depending on suicidal status at baseline using logistic regression models.

- **Results**: Using either a qualitative or a quantitative approach to measure SI, we found that suicidal patients were less likely to improve or attain remission, but not more likely to worsen, than nonsuicidal patients. In the multivariate analyses, SI (odds ratio [OR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18–1.65) and a history of SA (OR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.16–1.66) were the best predictors of nonremission, independently of the class of antidepressant treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Antidepressant treatment seems to be less effective among those patients that need it most. Clinical trials including suicidal patients are needed to investigate specific treatment options.

### Treating major depression: Antidepressant algorithms [^117BnNis]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Clinicians currently have a large number of pharmaceutical options available for the treatment of depression, yet not one of these treatments is associated with especially high remission rates. Further complicating the treatment of depression is the fact that the more failed treatment trials a patient undergoes, the lower the odds that remission will be achieved. Therefore, choosing the drug that will be most effective for a particular patient early in the treatment process is essential. Antidepressant treatment algorithms are helpful in this regard.
