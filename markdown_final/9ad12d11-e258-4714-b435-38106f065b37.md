## Question

Most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which etiology is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how restrictive cardiomyopathy is defined and which entities it encompasses. Then, I should verify the major etiologic categories that lead to restrictive physiology. Next, I will examine epidemiologic and clinical data to compare the relative frequency of these causes. After that, I need to consider age-specific patterns, because pediatric and adult distributions differ. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence and state the most likely single most common cause, while acknowledging important caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't jump to conclusions. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by persistent restrictive pathophysiology with nondilated ventricles and biatrial enlargement, and importantly, the etiologies span infiltrative diseases, storage disorders, endomyocardial fibrosis, and idiopathic or genetic forms, which means I need to compare across these mechanistic buckets rather than assume a uniform distribution across ages and regions [^1169uMb7] [^117H46Bb].

> I will now examine the major etiologic categories to anchor the comparison. Wait, let me verify the canonical groupings: infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis, storage diseases such as hemochromatosis and Fabry disease, endomyocardial disorders such as endomyocardial fibrosis and hypereosinophilic syndromes, and primary or idiopathic/genetic restrictive cardiomyopathy including sarcomeric mutations, with the caveat that restrictive physiology can also emerge at late stages of other cardiomyopathies like HCM or DCM, which complicates attribution if I'm not careful [^114AFfJM] [^114BTkaA].

> Next, I should review epidemiologic signals that hint at which cause predominates. Hold on, I should verify whether contemporary series consistently implicate a particular entity. Multiple contemporary reviews and position papers emphasize that among infiltrative etiologies, cardiac amyloidosis — particularly transthyretin amyloidosis — has emerged as a leading and increasingly recognized cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in older adults, with rising detection linked to improved imaging and awareness, which supports the notion that amyloidosis is now the most common single cause in many adult cohorts [^115yFNQP] [^113cjLjn] [^116Y9uPk].

> But wait, what if I'm overgeneralizing from Western cohorts. I need to check geographic and age-specific patterns. In children and adolescents, idiopathic or genetic restrictive cardiomyopathy predominates, and endomyocardial fibrosis is notably more prevalent in certain tropical regions, whereas in older adults in many healthcare systems, ATTR cardiac amyloidosis has become the predominant identifiable cause, reflecting both demographics and diagnostic ascertainment, so the "most common" answer is context dependent [^116MVB9k] [^116ps3cX].

> Let me consider the genetic and familial angle to ensure I'm not missing a competing common cause. Sarcomeric mutations in genes like MYH7, TNNI3, and TNNT2 can cause primary restrictive cardiomyopathy, and familial clustering is well described, but the overall genetic yield in unselected RCM cohorts is lower than in HCM, and many cases remain idiopathic, which means that while genetic RCM is important, it does not eclipse amyloidosis as the leading single cause in adults when ascertainment is complete [^113DzLek] [^115yXqWL].

> I should double-check the role of other infiltrative and storage diseases so I don't prematurely crown amyloidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis and iron overload cardiomyopathy are important and sometimes present with restrictive physiology, but across contemporary series and expert statements, they are generally less common than amyloidosis as a cause of RCM in older adults, reinforcing that amyloidosis is the leading single etiology in that demographic [^113cjLjn] [^115byWSf].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my conclusion matches the weight of evidence. In adults, particularly those over 60, ATTR cardiac amyloidosis has become the most common identifiable cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy due to increased recognition and noninvasive diagnosis, whereas in children and in specific regions, idiopathic or genetic RCM and endomyocardial fibrosis are more prevalent. Therefore, the most accurate single answer is that cardiac amyloidosis — especially ATTR — is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in older adults, with the caveat that "most common" varies by age and geography [^116Y9uPk] [^116ps3cX] [^115yFNQP].

---

The most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is **cardiac amyloidosis**, particularly transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis in older adults [^115yFNQP] [^116Y9uPk]. Other frequent causes include **sarcoidosis** [^115byWSf], **hemochromatosis** [^113cjLjn], and **endomyocardial fibrosis**; genetic mutations (e.g. desmin, sarcomeric genes) and radiation injury are less common but important [^116SEeMd] [^112HnguX]. Diagnosis relies on echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and biomarkers, with **ATTR-RCM** increasingly recognized due to improved detection and targeted therapies [^112hmNPS] [^116ps3cX].

---

## Etiological classification of restrictive cardiomyopathy

RCM is broadly classified into **four categories** based on underlying mechanisms:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infiltrative diseases | - Cardiac amyloidosis (AL, ATTR) [^115yFNQP] <br/> - Sarcoidosis [^115byWSf] <br/> - Carcinoid syndrome |
| Storage diseases | - Hemochromatosis [^115byWSf] <br/> - Fabry disease [^116jwtHf] <br/> - Glycogen storage diseases |
| Endomyocardial disorders | - Endomyocardial fibrosis [^117H46Bb] <br/> - Hypereosinophilic syndrome [^117H46Bb] <br/> - Radiation-induced fibrosis [^112HnguX] |
| Genetic mutations | - Desmin (DES) [^114inzoZ] <br/> - Sarcomeric genes (MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3) [^113DzLek] <br/> - Lamin A/C (LMNA) [^1156m32a] |

---

## Most common cause: cardiac amyloidosis

Among these, **cardiac amyloidosis** — particularly ATTR amyloidosis — is the most common cause of RCM in older adults [^notfound]. Amyloid fibrils deposit in the myocardium, increasing stiffness and causing diastolic dysfunction with preserved systolic function early on [^116Y9uPk] [^112HnguX] [^116v6ckM]. ATTR amyloidosis is increasingly recognized due to improved diagnostic methods and targeted therapies [^116ps3cX].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach

RCM typically presents with **heart failure symptoms** (dyspnea, fatigue, edema) and **atrial fibrillation** [^112s9jgW]. Diagnosis relies on:

- **Echocardiography**: Bi-atrial enlargement, normal or mildly reduced ventricular volumes, and restrictive filling pattern [^1128Fk8n].
- **Cardiac MRI**: Tissue characterization, late gadolinium enhancement, and extracellular volume mapping [^1169xKtm].
- **Biomarkers**: Elevated natriuretic peptides, troponin, and specific markers for amyloidosis (e.g. serum free light chains) [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and management

RCM has a **poor prognosis**, particularly in idiopathic and genetic forms, with high mortality and frequent need for heart transplantation [^116KQqDS] [^114rDU3R]. Management includes:

- **Supportive care**: Diuretics, anticoagulation, and rhythm control [^notfound].
- **Disease-specific therapies**: Enzyme replacement for Fabry disease, iron chelation for hemochromatosis, immunosuppression for sarcoidosis [^114keufp].
- **Targeted therapies**: ATTR stabilizers (tafamidis) and gene-silencing agents for ATTR amyloidosis [^114keufp].

---

Cardiac amyloidosis, especially ATTR, is the **most common cause of RCM** in older adults, with diagnosis supported by echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and biomarkers; management is increasingly tailored to the underlying etiology [^115yFNQP] [^112hmNPS].

### Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: a paradigm for advancing precision medicine [^116ps3cX]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Development of specific therapies addressing the underlying diseases' mechanisms constitutes the basis of precision medicine. Those therapeutic advances are possible due to a better characterization of diseases, a better understanding of their natural history, and underlying pathophysiology along with advances in imaging techniques and breakthroughs in gene sequencing techniques. Although other medical specialties like oncology or haematology have embraced this precision medicine approach years ago, only recently has the cardiovascular community witnessed how a personalized approach is becoming part of mainstream cardiology. The field of heart failure (HF) and cardiomyopathies particularly exemplify the paradigm shift that will transform how we approach patients (and their families) in the next decades.

Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CM), once considered a rare cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy, is an exemplar of this new paradigm where tailored therapies are progressively replacing the 'one-fits-all' model that has predominated clinical practice over the last 30 years. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of transthyretin (TTR) amyloid formation, advances in imaging techniques that facilitated a more precise epidemiology of the disease, and the key driver of new specific and highly effective therapieshave revolutionized the field transforming what it used to be a rare disease with a devastating prognosis into a more common disease with several therapeutic alternatives (Figure 1). In this review, we describe the key advances in pathophysiology and epidemiology that have occurred in the last decades along with the different therapeutic alternatives available or under development for ATTR-CM to illustrate the role of precision medicine applied to cardiovascular disorders.

### Pediatric cardiomyopathies [^113pAofo]. Circulation Research (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric cardiomyopathies are rare diseases with an annual incidence of 1.1 to 1.5 per 100000. Dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies are the most common; restrictive, noncompaction, and mixed cardiomyopathies occur infrequently; and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is rare. Pediatric cardiomyopathies can result from coronary artery abnormalities, tachyarrhythmias, exposure to infection or toxins, or secondary to other underlying disorders. Increasingly, the importance of genetic mutations in the pathogenesis of isolated or syndromic pediatric cardiomyopathies is becoming apparent. Pediatric cardiomyopathies often occur in the absence of comorbidities, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, renal dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus; as a result, they offer insights into the primary pathogenesis of myocardial dysfunction. Large international registries have characterized the epidemiology, cause, and outcomes of pediatric cardiomyopathies. Although adult and pediatric cardiomyopathies have similar morphological and clinical manifestations, their outcomes differ significantly. Within 2 years of presentation, normalization of function occurs in 20% of children with dilated cardiomyopathy, and 40% die or undergo transplantation. Infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a 2-year mortality of 30%, whereas death is rare in older children. Sudden death is rare. Molecular evidence indicates that gene expression differs between adult and pediatric cardiomyopathies, suggesting that treatment response may differ as well. Clinical trials to support evidence-based treatments and the development of disease-specific therapies for pediatric cardiomyopathies are in their infancy. This compendium summarizes current knowledge of the genetic and molecular origins, clinical course, and outcomes of the most common phenotypic presentations of pediatric cardiomyopathies and highlights key areas where additional research is required.

### Restrictive cardiomyopathy: definition and diagnosis [^1169uMb7]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by restrictive left ventricular pathophysiology, i.e. a rapid rise in ventricular pressure with only small increases in filling volume due to increased myocardial stiffness. More precisely, the defining feature of RCM is the coexistence of persistent restrictive pathophysiology, diastolic dysfunction, non-dilated ventricles, and atrial dilatation, regardless of ventricular wall thickness and systolic function. Beyond this shared haemodynamic hallmark, the phenotypic spectrum of RCM is wide. The disorders manifesting as RCM may be classified according to four main disease mechanisms: (i) interstitial fibrosis and intrinsic myocardial dysfunction, (ii) infiltration of extracellular spaces, (iii) accumulation of storage material within cardiomyocytes, or (iv) endomyocardial fibrosis. Many disorders do not show restrictive pathophysiology throughout their natural history, but only at an initial stage (with an evolution towards a hypokinetic and dilated phenotype) or at a terminal stage (often progressing from a hypertrophic phenotype). Furthermore, elements of both hypertrophic and restrictive phenotypes may coexist in some patients, making the classification challenge. Restrictive pathophysiology can be demonstrated by cardiac catheterization or Doppler echocardiography. The specific conditions may usually be diagnosed based on clinical data, 12-lead electrocardiogram, echocardiography, nuclear medicine, or cardiovascular magnetic resonance, but further investigations may be needed, up to endomyocardial biopsy and genetic evaluation. The spectrum of therapies is also wide and heterogeneous, but disease-modifying treatments are available only for cardiac amyloidosis and, partially, for iron overload cardiomyopathy.

Cardiomyopathies

Definition, classification and aetiology

Cardiomyopathy is defined as a 'myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality'(figure 1). Cardiomyopathies can be either acquired or inherited and include different types, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), left-ventricular non-compaction, restrictive forms (RCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).DCM is a heterogenous group including idiopathic and inherited forms. DCM can be induced by viral infections, inflammatory diseases, tachycardia, storage diseases, toxic substances (alcohol, other drugs and medication) and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), which is the most common cardiomyopathy found in pregnancy, is often included in DCM.

Figure 1
General description of haemodynamic changes during pregnancy and their effect on different types of cardiomyopathy. DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; CO, cardiac output; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; LV, left ventricle; PPCM, peripartum cardiomyopathy; SV, stroke volume; SVR, systemic vascular resistance.; RCM, restrictive cardiomyopathy; LVOTP, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

Cardiomyopathies in pregnancy are generally not well described because they are relatively rare diseases. However, during the last decade, case series, case reports and a small number of controlled studies on cardiomyopathy in pregnancy have been published. In this review, different types of cardiomyopathies and pregnancy are described.

### Beta-thalassemia cardiomyopathy: history, present considerations, and future perspectives [^115iM8Re]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Beta-thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobin disorder resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia that typically requires life-long transfusion therapy. Although traditionally prevalent in the Mediterranean basin, Middle East, North India, and Southeast Asia, immigration of those populations to North America and Western Europe has rendered beta-thalassemia a global health problem. Cardiac complications represent the primary cause of mortality and one of the major causes of morbidity in those patients. Heart disease is mainly expressed by a particular cardiomyopathy that progressively leads to heart failure and death. The beta-thalassemia cardiomyopathy is mainly characterized by 2 distinct phenotypes, a dilated phenotype, with left ventricular dilatation and impaired contractility and a restrictive phenotype, with restrictive left ventricular filling, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. The pathophysiology of the disorder is multifactorial, with a central role of myocardial iron overload and the significant contribution of immunoinflammatory mechanisms. Patients' management is demanding and requires a multidisciplinary approach, preferably in specialized centers.

### Subtle echocardiogram findings requiring further investigation: restrictive cardiomyopathy in a rare genetic condition [^112FpXU1]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Despite this case's complexity, a structured anasarca workup guided final diagnosis, reducing the anchoring bias that may have played a role in Admission A. This demonstrates the importance of considering diastolic HF in any paediatric patient with anasarca, especially one with MN, even in the absence of overt echocardiographic findings as they lack sensitivity. While MN has mild effects on systolic function, most of its pathological changes lead to diastolic HF, the leading cause of mortality which cannot be missed.

The therapeutic decision regarding pericardiectomy versus transplantation was challenging due to remaining diagnostic uncertainty. While it was felt that restrictive cardiomyopathy was the most likely diagnosis, it was difficult to fully rule out some component of constrictive pericarditis, for which pericardiectomy has shown functional improvement. Others have aptly noted that in one-third of these cases, pericardiectomy is not curative as it merely prolongs onset of diastolic HF from restrictive cardiomyopathy, bolstering the argument for early cardiac transplantation. Nevertheless, with no prospective-controlled comparisons of transplant versus pericardiectomy there is a lack of consensus, with some arguing that benefit from pericardiectomy depends on time to total pericardial adhesion. Regarding hepatic involvement, this case is unique in that transplantation decision-making was complicated due to a high-risk profile for isolated heart transplant. To our knowledge, no previous MN case has required concurrent liver transplant. Similar bridging fibrosis and nodularity as our case was reported in two patients, a 2 and 3.5-year-old, as part of a large study of MN liver pathology. As these authors suggest, with sufficient right-sided pressures, congestive hepatopathy can develop rapidly, with characteristic fibrosis. Critically, a case of a 32-year-old woman, paired with multiple searches of biobank engines, suggested congestive hepatopathy is the primary determinant of liver cirrhosis in MN. Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider delaying liver transplant in those eligible for an isolated heart transplant, provided there is an expectation that their haemodynamics will improve.

### Heart transplantation outcomes in radiation-induced restrictive cardiomyopathy [^116Pd7VP]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Some cancer therapies can cause advanced heart failure requiring heart transplantation. Although dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common phenotype, those who receive radiation may develop restrictive cardiomyopathy. The characteristics and transplantation outcomes patients with radiation-induced restrictive cardiomyopathy are not established.

Methods and Results

We used United Network for Organ Sharing registry to identify adults who were listed for heart transplantation between 2000 and 2015 for radiation-induced restrictive cardiomyopathy (RT-RCM) and compared their characteristics and transplant outcomes to restrictive cardiomyopathies of other etiologies (RCM) and all other patients listed for heart transplantation (others). Of 45,041 adults, 87 (0.2%) of transplantations were due to RT-RCM, 1049 (2.3%) were due to RCM, and there were 44,805 others. Compared with patients with RCM and other etiologies, those with RT-RCM were younger, less likely male, more likely to be white, listed as status 2, and were also more likely to have had previous cardiac surgeries. Posttransplant, patients with RT-RCM had longer lengths of stay and higher early mortality; 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative survival were as follows for RT-RCM (76%, 66%, 58%), RCM (88%, 79%, 73%; p = 0.025 compared with RT-RCM), and other etiologies (88%, 82%, 76%; p = 0.012 compared with RT-RCM).

Conclusions

Patients with end-stage RT-RCM are predominantly younger females with previous cardiac surgeries. Posttransplantation survival in these patients appears to be lower than in those with other forms of restrictive cardiomyopathies and heart failure etiologies, mainly because of higher early postoperative mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children: first results from the pediatric cardiomyopathy genes study [^113ozjQm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing in children with hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, but practice variations exist. Robust data on clinical testing practices and diagnostic yield in children are lacking. This study aimed to identify the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children and to investigate clinical genetic testing practices. Methods and Results Children with familial or idiopathic cardiomyopathy were enrolled from 14 institutions in North America. Probands underwent exome sequencing. Rare sequence variants in 37 known cardiomyopathy genes were assessed for pathogenicity using consensus clinical interpretation guidelines. Of the 152 enrolled probands, 41% had a family history of cardiomyopathy. Of 81 (53%) who had undergone clinical genetic testing for cardiomyopathy before enrollment, 39 (48%) had a positive result. Genetic testing rates varied from 0% to 97% between sites. A positive family history and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype were associated with increased likelihood of genetic testing (P = 0.005 and P = 0.03, respectively). A molecular cause was identified in an additional 21% of the 63 children who did not undergo clinical testing, with positive results identified in both familial and idiopathic cases and across all phenotypic subtypes. Conclusions A definitive molecular genetic diagnosis can be made in a substantial proportion of children for whom the cause and heritable nature of their cardiomyopathy was previously unknown. Practice variations in genetic testing are great and should be reduced. Improvements can be made in comprehensive cardiac screening and predictive genetic testing in first-degree relatives. Overall, our results support use of routine genetic testing in cases of both familial and idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT01873963.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Heart failure data standards — cardiomyopathy subtype definitions define HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) as a disorder with increased and abnormal hypertrophy of the left ventricle not explained by loading changes and that can be with or without LV outflow obstruction, and describe restrictive cardiomyopathy as a rare form with restrictive filling of the ventricles where contractile function and wall thicknesses are usually normal but relaxation or filling is very abnormal; an Other category lists other types of cardiomyopathy.

### Novel phenotype-genotype correlations of restrictive cardiomyopathy with myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene mutations tested by next-generation sequencing [^116SEeMd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Compared with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a much more rare nonischemic myocardial disease. RCM is characterized by restrictive ventricular-filling physiology in the presence of normal or reduced diastolic and/or systolic volumes (of 1 or both ventricles), biatrial enlargement, and normal ventricular wall thickness. Although RCM was previously believed to be idiopathic or associated with inflammatory, infiltrative, or systemic disease, recent investigations revealed that sarcomere protein gene mutationsor desminopathyare responsible for primary RCM, especially in patients with familial RCM. It has been demonstrated that genetic mutations of cardiac troponin (TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2), β-myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7), α-cardiac actin (ACTC), and myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) were associated with RCM.

Previously, mutational screening of hereditary disease was performed mostly by direct Sanger capillary sequencing or with the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography/Sanger method; however, molecular testing with the traditional individual exon-by-exon and gene-by-gene sequencing method experienced several limitations in throughput, cost-effectiveness, and time. It is particularly difficult to use this technology for the genetic diagnosis of cardiomyopathies, which are multigenic diseases, so that only the most prevalent genes associated with the phenotype are assessed routinely in clinical/and or basic medical scientific investigations. In fact, > 50 genes have been reported to be related to cardiomyopathies, and most shared the same genotype groups.

The newly developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) method has made comprehensive genetic testing possible for all known genes of cardiomyopathies. It is expected to have stronger abilities to detect genetic changes in patients with primary cardiomyopathies and to explore novel genotype–phenotype correlations, aside from predicting clinical outcomes and developing individualized treatment. The basic principles of these techniques include generation of colonies after incorporation of target gene–specific adapters, with further sequencing, detection, and analysis. To date, the 3 best established benchtop high-throughput sequencing instruments — the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM, Life Technologies; Thermo Fisher Scientific), the 454 GS Junior (Roche), and the MiSeq (Illumina) — are available, and these NGS systems have exhibited excellent quantitative performance for throughput, reads, and indel errors. The objective of this study was to screen for all known genes of inherited cardiomyopathies in patients with RCM, using comprehensive libraries with NGS.

### Targeted therapies in genetic dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies: from molecular mechanisms to therapeutic targets. A position paper from the heart failure association (HFA) and the working group on myocardial function of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^114keufp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is currently unknown, but it is the least frequent amongst the cardiomyopathies. The aetiology of RCM is heterogeneous, including idiopathic, hereditary and acquired cases of non‐infiltrative and infiltrative myocardial disorders, storage diseases and endomyocardial disorders. HF occurs frequently (as high as 83%) in those patients, and the majority of patients present with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), while HFrEF usually occurs at a later stage (e.g. in amyloidosis or iron overload/haemochromatosis). Recently, new treatment insights with novel aetiology‐specific therapies were introduced, including transthyretin stabilizers in cardiac amyloidosis, and enzyme replacement therapies (Anderson–Fabryand Pompe disease).

In this review, we have focused on genetic HCM and DCM, and specifically highlighted genetic mutations in which strong scientific interest exist, with recent progress, resulting in potential targeted therapeutic modalities, either in development or entering the clinical arena. We clearly acknowledge that many more (rare) forms of cardiomyopathies exist and are subject to intensive study, with new treatments on the horizon. For some, e.g. myocardial amyloid disease, there is a very wide body of literature and recent reviews have covered this topic extensively, and given space restraints, we refer to this work. For other (very rare) diseases, such as RCM and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathies, recent progress is limited. Causes of RCM include genetic HCM, cardiac amyloidosis, chemotherapy or chest exposure to radiotherapy, cardiac haemochromatosis, and rarely cardiac sarcoidosis. The therapy as such will depend of the underlying cause, considering tafamidis or RNA silencing therapy in transthyretin amyloidosis and treating haemochromatosis and sarcoidosis lege artis. Left ventricular non‐compaction (LVNC), a classified form of cardiomyopathy, is a genetic disease characterized by excessive and unusual trabeculations within the mature left ventricle.

### Classification, epidemiology, and global burden of cardiomyopathies [^116AEknn]. Circulation Research (2017). Low credibility.

In the past 25 years, major advances were achieved in the nosography of cardiomyopathies, influencing the definition and taxonomy of this important chapter of cardiovascular disease. Nearly, 50% of patients dying suddenly in childhood or adolescence or undergoing cardiac transplantation are affected by cardiomyopathies. Novel cardiomyopathies have been discovered (arrhythmogenic, restrictive, and noncompacted) and added to update the World Health Organization classification. Myocarditis has also been named inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Extraordinary progress accomplished in molecular genetics of inherited cardiomyopathies allowed establishment of dilated cardiomyopathy as mostly cytoskeleton, force transmission disease; hypertrophic-restrictive cardiomyopathies as sarcomeric, force generation disease; and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy as desmosome, cell junction disease. Channelopathies (short and long QT, Brugada, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia syndromes) should also be considered cardiomyopathies because of electric myocyte dysfunction. Cardiomyopathies are easily diagnosed but treated only with palliative pharmacological or invasive therapy. Curative therapy, thanks to insights into the molecular pathogenesis, has to target the fundamental mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of these conditions.

### Cardiac MRI in restrictive cardiomyopathy [^1155mmVC]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a specific group of heart muscle disorders characterized by inadequate ventricular relaxation during diastole. This leads to diastolic dysfunction with relative preservation of systolic function. Although short axis systolic function is usually preserved in RCM, the long axis systolic function may be severely impaired. Confirmation of diagnosis and information regarding aetiology, extent of myocardial damage, and response to treatment requires imaging. Importantly, differentiation from constrictive pericarditis (CCP) is needed, as only the latter is managed surgically. Echocardiography is the initial cardiac imaging technique but cannot reliably suggest a tissue diagnosis; although recent advances, especially tissue Doppler imaging and spectral tracking, have improved its ability to differentiate RCM from CCP. Cardiac catheterization is the reference standard, but is invasive, two-dimensional, and does not aid myocardial characterization. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a versatile technique providing anatomical, morphological and functional information. In recent years, it has been shown to provide important information regarding disease mechanisms, and also been found useful to guide treatment, assess its outcome and predict patient prognosis. This review describes the CMR features of RCM, appearances in various diseases, its overall role in patient management, and how it compares with other imaging techniques.

### Cardiac amyloidosis: can advances in diagnostics and treatments improve survival? [^113Fb4Yq]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Amyloidosis is a generalised clinical disorder characterised by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils. Symptomatic cardiac amyloidosis is typically associated with light chain (AL) amyloidosis in the western world. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium causes restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac manifestations affect patient's performance status and limit therapeutic options. We present a case of rapidly progressing cardiac amyloid deposition due to AL amyloidosis presenting with typical features of restrictive cardiomyopathy. We also discuss the advances in non-invasive diagnostic techniques applied in this case and currently available novel treatments. Early diagnosis and better response to novel treatments could potentially improve the overall survival in this group of patients.

### 2021 ACC / AHA key data elements and definitions for heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards (writing committee to develop clinical data standards for heart failure) [^116BUCEB]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — cardiomyopathy-related risk factors are defined with permissible values and definitions. Dilated cardiomyopathy is defined as "Dilated, poorly contracting left ventricle in absence of coronary artery disease". Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is described as a "Disorder of the heart characterized by increased and abnormal hypertrophy of the left ventricle that cannot be explained by loading changes of the heart. It can be with or without left ventricular outflow obstruction", and notes state "Mutations in MYH7 and cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) are the most common. A mutation is identifiable in 50% to 75% of cases of familial HCM". ARVC or ARVD is defined as "ARVC or ARVD or arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy usually caused by genetic defects of desmosomes resulting in nonischemic cardiomyopathy that primarily involves the right ventricle". Restrictive cardiomyopathy is defined as "a rare genetic cardiomyopathy exhibiting restrictive physiology, usually with no or minimal left ventricular dilatation and no or minimal decrement in systolic function". Duchenne or other muscular dystrophy associated with cardiomyopathy is defined as "Genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, usually caused by a gene defect that affects the ability of the body to produce a protein called dystrophin". Fabry disease is defined as "An X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which results in the accumulation of glycolipids in the blood vessels and tissues. Signs and symptoms include hypertension, cardiomyopathy, angiokeratomas, neuropathy, hypohidrosis, keratopathy, proteinuria, and renal failure". An additional permissible value is "Other types of cardiomyopathy".

### Magnetic resonance imaging of cardiomyopathies in children: update by the European society of pediatric radiology cardiac imaging taskforce [^111NqiJh]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathies are rare diseases in children but are the primary indication for heart transplantation in this age group. Various causes of paediatric cardiomyopathies, ranging from gene-mediated to underlying infection or systemic disease, result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and imaging manifestations. Over the years, the classification and terminology of cardiomyopathy have evolved in children and are currently primarily based on the imaging phenotype (dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive) and then subdivided based on pathogenesis, organ involvement, genetic or familial inheritance pattern, and aetiology. Dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies are more common than non-compaction, restrictive, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. Echocardiography remains the first-line modality for functional and structural cardiac assessment. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging enhances diagnostic accuracy, provides serial cardiac functional evaluation and tissue characterization, and facilitates individual risk stratification and management in patients with heterogeneous phenotypes.

Discussion

Spectrum of Cardiomyopathy Phenotypic Presentation

Recent advances in high‐throughput sequencing have facilitated the identification of a number of novel cardiomyopathy‐associated genes, with the number identified as pathogenic increasing significantly over the last few years. 9 Because of the increased utilization of this technology, it is now possible to identify shared genetic variants among phenotypically dissimilar individuals, whose clinical presentations have not previously been associated with specific genes. 51 This has increased understanding of the role of genetic variants in the predisposing pathophysiological mechanisms of atypical forms of cardiomyopathy. 52 Here, we describe a variant associated with relatively mild hypertrophy and clear evidence of restrictive physiology consistent with RCM. It is well established that cardiomyopathic diseases, including RCM, have variable expressivity of disease frequently yielding a wide spectrum of phenotypes. 53, 54 This study is supportive of these previous findings.

We report on a family in which a single variant in TNNT2 is associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death. The TNNT2‐R94C variant was not observed in control populations and was predicted to be deleterious by in silico modeling, ClinVar, and current American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Our biochemical data show a clear molecular phenotype that would be consistent with hypercontractility and diastolic dysfunction, supporting the concept that this variant is causative for the disease. There are a total of 5 previous reports of the TNNT2‐R94C variant (National Center for Biotechnology Information ClinVar database), all with the designation of "pathogenic" or "likely pathogenic" and associated with familial HCM. 13, 55, 56, 57, 58 There has only been 1 previous report of a TNNT2 variant causing restrictive physiology by autosomal‐dominant inheritance. 13 Although the TNNT2‐R94C variant has been previously associated with HCM, the spectrum of phenotypic features associated with TNNT2‐R94C, including RCM, has not been well described.

### Genetic linkage of a novel autosomal dominant restrictive cardiomyopathy locus [^114H1SKh]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, non-syndromic idiopathic cardiomyopathies have increasingly been characterised as autosomal dominant conditions caused by single gene mutations. Loci have been identified for hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, and in some cases the same loci are associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). In a kindred with RCM that we previously reported, we ruled out the known cardiomyopathy loci and other candidate genes by linkage analysis and mutation screening.

Methods and Results

Here we report a genome-wide analysis in this family that has resulted in linkage to a region on chromosome 10.

Conclusions

There are no genes in the interval that are known to cause idiopathic cardiomyopathy, and thus this linkage represents localisation of a new RCM locus.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by stiffness of the ventricular walls, which can be caused either by myocardial infiltration (e.g. amyloid), or in the case of radiation-induced cardiomyopathy, myocardial replacement fibrosis.

The inherent risks of invasive cardiac biopsy tend to preclude its routine clinical use in the assessment of restrictive cardiomyopathy, but with tissue characterization sequences (LGE, T1 mapping, and ECV), CMR can assess the myocardium noninvasively. Amyloid light chain amyloid, in particular, can result in cardiac involvement leading to a form of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac amyloid is readily detectible by CMR due to the interstitial deposition of amyloid proteins (elevated native T1 and elevated ECV are typical). Patients with cardiac amyloidosis also have markedly abnormal gadolinium kinetics and a characteristic pattern of fibrosis (global subendocardial LGE), which may permit the discrimination of amyloid from other wall-thickening disorders. In addition, difficulty in obtaining myocardial nulling (myocardium appears black), despite a T1 scout, may suggest underlying amyloid. However, although these techniques are sensitive, they are not specific to amyloidosis and do not obviate the need for a definitive histologic diagnosis.

### Novel phenotype-genotype correlations of restrictive cardiomyopathy with myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene mutations tested by next-generation sequencing [^116mHpqq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

It has been presumed that primary RCM was more common in children and had an extremely ominous prognosis. In our study, all patients presented clinical manifestation in adulthood, whereas 2 children carrying the pathogenic mutations had not been clinically identified. Mutation-specific genetic testing is recommended as appropriate for family members following identification of an RCM-causative mutation in the index case. We believe it may help to differentiate affected patients early for evaluation and treatment. Long-term prognosis of MYBPC3 mutation in RCM patients is obscure. In patients with HCM, MYBPC3 gene mutations are considered to be related to late onset and to be clinically benign. Whether it is the same for patients with RCM is unknown.

Genetic screening of RCM patients has been extremely difficult, based on previous studies, and information on causative mutation was exiguous compared with DCM and HCM. First, RCM is perhaps the least common inherited cardiomyopathy, and many fewer studies of familial RCM patients have been conducted compared with other cardiomyopathies. It is possible that some patients from families with HCM caused by MYBPC3 mutations might present a restrictive phenotype but were unintentionally overlooked. The RCM patients in this study showed classically restrictive physiological patterns and no hypertrophic ventricular structure. In this case, unambiguous phenotype can provide more convincing evidence. Second, previous strategies based on polymerase chain reaction are insufficient for broad genomic investigations in RCM, considering the limited gene mutations reported and the difficulty in candidate gene selection. The MYBPC3 gene was not generally included in the candidate screen plan for RCM because it contained 35 exons that encoded a large multidomain protein and was not considered relevant to RCM. Nonetheless, the well-planned panel and high-throughput NGS applied in this study made it possible to screen all possible genetic variations associated with cardiomyopathy in both familial and sporadic patients. With this method, we detected the pathogenic MYBPC3 mutations and excluded defects in other cardiomyopathy-related genes.

### Prevalence, clinical significance, and genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with restrictive phenotype [^1114ik5B]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, clinical significance, and genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with "restrictive phenotype" characterized by restrictive filling and minimal or no left ventricular hypertrophy.

Background

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous myocardial disorder with a broad spectrum of clinical presentation and morphologic features. Recent reports indicated that some patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is an uncommon condition defined by restrictive filling and reduced diastolic volumes with normal or near normal left ventricular wall thickness and contractile function, have features suggestive of HCM with mutations in cardiac troponin I, myocyte disarray at explant/autopsy, and relatives with HCM. Systematic evaluation of the restrictive phenotype in HCM patients has not been performed.

Methods

We evaluated 1,226 patients from 688 consecutive HCM families to identify individuals who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for "restrictive phenotype".

Results

Nineteen of 1,226 affected individuals (1.5%) from 16 families (2.3%) had the "restrictive phenotype". During follow up (53.7 ± 49.2 months), 17 patients (89%) experienced dyspnea (New York Heart Association functional class ≥ 2). The 5-year survival rate from all-cause mortality, cardiac transplantation, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge was 56.4%. Mutation analysis for 5 sarcomere genes was feasible in 15 of 16 probands. Mutations were found in 8: 4 in beta-myosin heavy chain, and 4 in cardiac troponin I.

Conclusions

The "restrictive phenotype" in isolation is an uncommon presentation of the clinical spectrum of HCM and is associated with severe limitation and poor prognosis. This phenotype may be associated with beta-myosin heavy chain and cardiac troponin I mutations.

### Genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy – a Heart Failure Society of America practice guideline [^11511RSu]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Substantial progress has been made recently in understanding the genetic basis of cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathies with known genetic cause include hypertrophic (HCM), dilated (DCM), restrictive (RCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC). HCM, DCM, and RCM have been recognized as distinct clinical entities for decades, whereas ARVD/C and LVNC are relative newcomers to the field. Hence the clinical and genetic knowledge for each cardiomyopathy varies, as do the recommendations and strength of evidence.

### Genetics of BAG3: a paradigm for developing precision therapies for dilated cardiomyopathies [^114BrisJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of cardiac musclethat include dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, constrictive and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathies. Dilated cardiomyopathies (DCMs) have been historically separated into those that are secondary to ischemic heart disease (ischemic DCM) and those that are nonischemic, with ischemic DCM being somewhat more common. Genetic variants were first shown to be etiologic in the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and novel therapies have been developed, using gene therapyor small molecules. By contrast, the cause of DCM has remained more obscure. Recent studies have shown convincingly that both heritable and sporadic genetic variants play a pivotal role in the development of many forms of DCM, the most common being loss of function variants in Titin, the largest protein found in humans. The Titin myofilament is one of the 3 major myofilaments found in the cardiac sarcomere (in addition to actin and myosin) and is critical for restoring the ability of the cardiac sarcomere to maintain optimal function of the left ventricle during diastole. Truncating variants of Titin are the most common genetic variants, found in as many as 25% of patients with both heritable and sporadic forms of DCM, as well as in a significant number of patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy. The discovery of genetic mutations causing DCM has enhanced our knowledge regarding the pathobiology of the disease and has provided an opportunity for more precise diagnosis, better risk prediction, and potential for improved treatment outcomes using both gene therapy and small molecules.

### Subtle echocardiogram findings requiring further investigation: restrictive cardiomyopathy in a rare genetic condition [^1118FqYv]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this case, the presence of HF secondary to restrictive cardiomyopathy and/or constrictive pericarditis was notable, despite subtle findings of atrial enlargement on previous echocardiograms. This underscores the limitations of echocardiography in diagnosing diastolic dysfunction in paediatric patients with cardiomyopathy, as highlighted by Dragulescu et al. Typical markers of diastolic function in adults lack transferability to the paediatric population, suggesting that cardiac catheterisation or MRI is necessary to properly diagnose restrictive cardiomyopathy. While biatrial enlargement, a very subtle finding which likely predisposed to the development of ectopic atrial tachycardia, can suggest restrictive cardiomyopathy, additional testing is necessary. Specific to this case, providers may have overlooked such subtle biatrial enlargement as they were primed to focus on systolic function, especially given his partial dystrophin deletion which may have been thought to predict dilated cardiomyopathy. This illustrates the critical role of medical genetics in MN diagnosis and management.

### Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy in children and young adults [^1179bVZP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy (IRC) is a rare condition characterized by reduced ventricular compliance. Children with IRC have poor outcomes with most patients proceeding to cardiac transplantation. We sought to analyze our institutional experience and assess contemporary outcomes for children with IRC. We reviewed the medical record for patients (< 21 years old) evaluated for a primary diagnosis of IRC between 1975 and 2013 at our institution. Demographic, clinical, echocardiographic, and catheterization data were abstracted. The patients were divided into 2 groups comprising a historical cohort (HC) (diagnosis: 1975 to 1993, n = 8) and a contemporary cohort (CC) (diagnosis: 1994 to 2013, n = 12). Twenty children were identified with IRC (mean age at presentation 9.7 ± 6.5 years, 55% female). Mean length of follow-up was 6.5 ± 8.4 years (range 0.1 to 35.6 years). In the CC, 7 of 12 patients (58%) progressed to cardiac transplantation (mean age of 9 ± 4 years at transplant, mean interval from diagnosis of IRC: 1.5 ± 0.9 years). Overall survival was improved significantly in the CC compared with the HC (80% vs. 38%, p = 0.02), but transplantation free survival was no different between the CC and HC over 5 years (38% vs 38%, p = 0.65). In the CC, elevation of mitral valve Doppler E/e' ratio on echocardiography was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.01). In conclusion, IRC continues has a poor prognosis. Early referral for transplantation was associated with improved overall survival in the modern era. Patients with markedly elevated E/e' ratio may have increased risk of death.

### Genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children: first results from the pediatric cardiomyopathy genes study [^116GFoFQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing in children with hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, but practice variations exist. Robust data on clinical testing practices and diagnostic yield in children are lacking. This study aimed to identify the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children and to investigate clinical genetic testing practices.

Methods and Results

Children with familial or idiopathic cardiomyopathy were enrolled from 14 institutions in North America. Probands underwent exome sequencing. Rare sequence variants in 37 known cardiomyopathy genes were assessed for pathogenicity using consensus clinical interpretation guidelines. Of the 152 enrolled probands, 41% had a family history of cardiomyopathy. Of 81 (53%) who had undergone clinical genetic testing for cardiomyopathy before enrollment, 39 (48%) had a positive result. Genetic testing rates varied from 0% to 97% between sites. A positive family history and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype were associated with increased likelihood of genetic testing (P = 0.005 and P = 0.03, respectively). A molecular cause was identified in an additional 21% of the 63 children who did not undergo clinical testing, with positive results identified in both familial and idiopathic cases and across all phenotypic subtypes.

Conclusions

A definitive molecular genetic diagnosis can be made in a substantial proportion of children for whom the cause and heritable nature of their cardiomyopathy was previously unknown. Practice variations in genetic testing are great and should be reduced. Improvements can be made in comprehensive cardiac screening and predictive genetic testing in first‐degree relatives. Overall, our results support use of routine genetic testing in cases of both familial and idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

Diagnostic work-up: bridging the gap between the identification of restrictive cardiomyopathy and a specific aetiology

The starting point of the diagnostic work-up for RCM is the identification of a restrictive haemodynamic profile and its persistence over time (for example, over a 6-month period). Afterwards, a characterization of the echocardiographic phenotype and a 'red flag-based' approach may lead to the aetiological diagnosis(Figure 5). This approach does not include only cardiological exams, as cardiomyopathies represent a challenging interface between cardiology and many other medical specialities. Furthermore, each step of the diagnostic work-up is valuable and can orient subsequent examinations.

Figure 5
Proposed flowchart for contemporary diagnostic work-up of restrictive cardiomyopathy. CMR, cardiovascular magnetic resonance; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; ECG, electrocardiogram; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a highly informative test providing diagnostic clues and information about the nature of the cardiomyopathy process. While infiltrative cardiomyopathies are characterized by reduced QRS complex voltages due to interstitial space expansion, storage cardiomyopathies are present with normal or increased QRS complex voltages. The discrepancy between the degree of ventricular wall thickness and QRS complex voltages on surface ECG might aid in differentiating HCM or other storage diseases from CA.

Transthoracic echocardiography is a first-line examination and may orient toward a specific diagnosis (Figure 6). The following step is a search for red flags of specific conditions (Table 2) to further inform the diagnostic work-up and allow rational use of EMB and genetic testing.

### Differentiation of constriction and restriction: complex cardiovascular hemodynamics [^113BesDH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Differentiation of constrictive pericarditis (CP) from restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a complex and often challenging process. Because CP is a potentially curable cause of heart failure and therapeutic options for RCM are limited, distinction of these 2 conditions is critical. Although different in regard to etiology, prognosis, and treatment, CP and RCM share a common clinical presentation of predominantly right-sided heart failure, in the absence of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction or valve disease, due to impaired ventricular diastolic filling. Fundamental to the diagnosis of either condition is a clear understanding of the underlying hemodynamic principles and pathophysiology. We present a contemporary review of the pathophysiology, hemodynamics, diagnostic assessment, and therapeutic approach to patients presenting with CP and RCM.

### Spectrum of restrictive and infiltrative Cardiomyopathies: part 1 of a 2-part series [^115yFNQP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathies are the least common form of heart muscle disease. They are characterized as infiltrative and noninfiltrative, storage diseases, and endomyocardial disorders. Genetic diseases commonly present during childhood or adolescence. However, a growing percentage of elderly patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are being recognized as having forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy, particularly cardiac amyloidosis. Noninvasive evaluation has replaced endomyocardial biopsy in the diagnostic evaluation of most suspected etiologies. The detection of infiltrative cardiomyopathies, including lysosomal and glycogen storage disorders, iron overload, and amyloidosis (both light chain amyloidosis and transthyretin amyloidosis variants), as well as inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis has slowly led to improved outcomes via disease-specific therapies.

### State-of-the-art document on optimal contemporary management of cardiomyopathies [^111cY8Fw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathies represent significant contributors to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Over the past decades, a progress has occurred in characterization of the genetic background and major pathophysiological mechanisms, which has been incorporated into a more nuanced diagnostic approach and risk stratification. Furthermore, medications targeting core disease processes and/or their downstream adverse effects have been introduced for several cardiomyopathies. Combined with standard care and prevention of sudden cardiac death, these novel and emerging targeted therapies offer a possibility of improving the outcomes in several cardiomyopathies. Therefore, the aim of this document is to summarize practical approaches to the treatment of cardiomyopathies, which includes the evidence-based novel therapeutic concepts and established principles of care, tailored to the individual patient aetiology and clinical presentation of the cardiomyopathy. The scope of the document encompasses contemporary treatment of dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. It was based on an expert consensus reached at the Heart Failure Association online Workshop, held on 18 March 2021.

### Heart muscle disease management in aircrew [^113GELGW]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathies

Restricted cardiomyopathies (RCM) are usually classified into primary and secondary forms. Primary forms include Löffler's endocarditis, primary amyloid and endomyocardial fibrosis, and are usually associated with poor outcomes. Secondary forms of RCM are associated with infiltrative diseases (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis), storage diseases (eg, haemochromatosis, Andersen-Fabry disease) or post irradiation (for those with radiation to the chest for malignancy). Impaired diastolic function, hypertrophy and restrictive filling patterns are associated with all forms, regardless of underlying aetiology. Concern from an aeromedical perspective is the potential for conduction defects in infiltrative and storage forms of the disease. Therefore, in aircrew the aetiology of any restrictive cardiomyopathy should be elucidated, as it impacts on aeromedical disposition, risk assessment, treatment and prognosis.

In aircrew with an established or potential diagnosis of sarcoidosis, cardiac involvement must be investigated by CMR with gadolinium. The finding of cardiac sarcoid is a bar to flying, due to the potential for bradyarrhythmia and heart block resulting from infiltration affecting the conducting system. Haemochromatosis may result in iron overload in the liver, pancreas, joints and heart if not identified and treated. Phlebotomy and iron-chelating agents mean that cardiac involvement is uncommon. The use of MRI to assess hepatic and cardiac iron loading is now standard practice. Any evidence of cardiac iron overload should result in restriction of flying privileges.

Arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy

The most common clinical presentation of arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy (AVC) is with exercise-triggered, symptomatic VT. Although the right ventricle is classically affected in AVC, a significant proportion of cases involve the LV or both ventricles. Localised or diffuse atrophy of the myocardium occurs, with fibrous or adipose tissue infiltration seen on histology. AVC is associated with ventricular dysfunction, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias which may result in SCD. It is recognised as being one of the leading causes of SCD in those aged ≤ 35 years and may be responsible for up to 1 in 10 cases of SCD in those aged ≤ 65 years. The incidence of sudden death in AVC due to ventricular arrhythmias is thought to be 1%–2% per annum. Therefore, a diagnosis of AVC in aircrew is considered disqualifying. Due to the potential for familial transmission, aircrew with a first-degree relative who have a diagnosis of AVC should be fully investigated for the condition.

Proposal for a new definition and classification of restrictive cardiomyopathy

The approach we followed was first of all to refine and enhance the nosographic aspect of the classification and, subsequently, to provide useful insights for the diagnosis of individual diseases. The definition of RCM can be slightly modified as follows: RCM is characterized by the coexistence of persistent restrictive pathophysiology, commonly with atrial dilatation, and nondilated ventricles, regardless of ventricular wall thickness and systolic function. Several forms of RCM are predominantly due to endocardial involvement, leading to a similar haemodynamic patterns as for isolated myocardial diseases.

The ESC classification system does not consider the myocardial substrate, which is extremely heterogeneous (Figure 2). Indeed, the histological abnormalities may involve the endocardium and/or the myocardium, and myocardial disorders may affect either the interstitial space or cardiomyocytes. Some cases even lack gross morphological abnormalities because the problem lies in cardiomyocyte functioning.

The classification of RCM could then be usefully implemented by consideration of the histological substrate, either through tissue sampling examination or, non-invasively, through CMR and/or nuclear medicine, the latter with regard to CA. From a conceptual standpoint, including the histological substrate in the classification scheme is relevant but does not represent a mandatory initial step of the diagnostic workup.

Other levels of classification concern the differentiation between familial/genetic and non-familial/non-genetic forms, and between disorders characterized by transient or permanent restriction (Graphical Abstract).

### Genetic therapies for cardiomyopathy: survey of attitudes of the patient community for the cureHeart project [^1175zDzW]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiomyopathies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of conditions affecting the structure and function of the heart. They include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), arrhythmogenic (right ventricular) cardiomyopathy ARVC/ACM and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Up to one in 250 people are affected. Symptoms result from impaired cardiac function or cardiac arrhythmia and can include dyspnea (shortage of breath), chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, syncope (cardiac faints), and cardiac arrest, although many patients have no or only mild symptoms. Complications including cardiac death, stroke, and heart failure, can occur at any age including in children and young people. Cardiomyopathies account for half of all cardiac transplants. Symptoms can onset across the lifespan, however risk of dangerous arrhythmias and cardiac arrest are possible in the absence of symptoms. Risk management interventions and lifestyle restrictions such as avoidance of intense activity may be recommended for patients at any age and regardless of symptoms, and they may be excluded from competitive sport or regulated occupations.

In families affected by cardiomyopathy, individuals may progress at any age from becoming aware of their potential risk, being well but at known genetic risk of disease development, being clinically affected but asymptomatic, to requiring medical intervention to alleviate symptoms or life-threatening arrythmia. Individuals with an inherited cardiomyopathy may have impaired quality of life; cardiomyopathy can significantly impact patients' employment, life planning, physical functioning and mental health. Patients may experience anxiety, a sense of isolation, and guilt about transmission; younger age and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shock increase risk for psychosocial difficulties. A sudden death — often in a young apparently healthy person — may be the first indication of an inherited cardiomyopathy. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) has a major impact on families; grief is often profound and long term, with around half of first-degree relatives suffering clinically significant post-traumatic stress symptoms or prolonged grief. The need of relatives to understand the cause of death, and prevent a further SCD, motivates initiation of post mortem genetic testing, but psychosocial consequences of grief may complicate adaptation to findings.

### Cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology in sickle cell disease [^111NBmhg]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to identify a unifying cardiac pathophysiology that explains the cardiac pathological features in sickle cell disease (SCD).

Background

Cardiopulmonary complications, the leading cause of adult death in SCD, are associated with heart chamber dilation, diastolic dysfunction, elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV), and pulmonary hypertension. However, no unifying cardiac pathophysiology has been identified to explain these findings.

Methods

In a 2-part study, we first examined patients with SCD who underwent screening echocardiography during steady state at our institution. We then conducted a meta-analysis of cardiac studies in SCD.

Results

In the 134 patients with SCD studied (median age 11 years), significant enlargement of the left atrial volume was present (z-score 3.1, p = 0.002), shortening fraction was normal (37.6 ± 4.7%), and lateral and septal ratios of mitral velocity to early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus (E/e') were severely abnormal in 8% and 14% of patients, respectively, indicating impaired diastolic function. Both TRV and lateral E/e' correlated with enlarged left atrial volume in SCD (p = 0.003 and p = 0.006, respectively). Meta-analysis of 68 studies confirmed significant left atrial diameter enlargement in patients with SCD compared with controls, evidence of diastolic dysfunction and enlarged left ventricular end-diastolic dimension with normal shortening fraction. The majority of patients with catheter-confirmed pulmonary hypertension had mild pulmonary venous hypertension consistent with restrictive cardiac physiology.

Conclusions

Patients with SCD have a unique form of cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology that is superimposed on hyperdynamic physiology and is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, left atrial dilation, and normal systolic function. This combination results in mild, secondary, pulmonary venous hypertension and elevated TRV. Sudden death is common in other forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Our finding of this unique restrictive cardiomyopathy may explain the increased mortality rates and sudden death seen in patients with SCD with mildly elevated TRV.

Table 2
Examples of signs, symptoms and routine laboratory tests that raise the suspicion of specific aetiologies

Whenever feasible, CMR should be part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected RCM. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance represents the gold standard non-invasive technique to quantify biventricular volumes, mass, and EF, with cine steady-state free-precession sequences. Furthermore, CMR allows to characterize myocardial tissue properties: myocardial oedema is typically detected by T2-weighted imaging, intraventricular thrombosis with early gadolinium enhancement, and myocardial interstitial expansion with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE, usually due to fibrosis or amyloid extracellular deposition, sometimes also to myocyte necrosis or extracellular oedema). Native (i.e. pre-contrast) T1- and T2-mapping sequences provide a quantitative assessment of myocardial tissue changes; after gadolinium injection, myocardial perfusion mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) mapping provide a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion and of the extracellular space, respectively. Some CMR red flags are listed in Table 3. As some examples, we can cite the evidence of subendocardial involvement in endomyocardial fibrosis or related disorders (Figure 7), and the circumferential subendocardial LGE pattern of LGE as rather characteristic of early and intermediate stages of CA, while the LGE pattern may become transmural in advanced stages (Figure 8). When iron overload cardiomyopathy is suspected, native T1 and T2✱ mapping is crucially important to detect and quantify iron accumulation as well as monitor the response to treatment. Similarly, in patients with overt cardiac hypertrophy, a low native T1 is characteristic of Fabry disease, while an increased native T1 and ECV are characteristic of CA (Figure 9).

### Amyloid cardiomyopathy in the emergency department [^113NKExf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac amyloidosis is an underdiagnosed cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy resulting from the infiltration of the myocardium by amyloid proteins.

Case Report

We report the case of an 83-year-old woman who presented with increasing dyspnea and lower-extremity swelling. She reported a medical history of unspecified heart failure. Evaluation in the Emergency Department (ED) revealed evidence of heart failure on physical examination, low-voltage electrocardiogram, chest x-ray study with mild pulmonary edema, and laboratory evaluation with elevated brain natriuretic peptide and troponin. Bedside cardiac ultrasound illustrated severe concentric ventricular hypertrophy and interventricular septal wall thickening with "sparkling" hyperechoic appearance of the myocardium, mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and small pericardial effusion. Inpatient comprehensive echocardiogram and follow-up nuclear medicine cardiac amyloid pyrophosphate study were suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians commonly treat acute on chronic systolic heart failure with diuresis and reductions in preload and afterload with nitrates. Identifying amyloid cardiomyopathy in the ED is of clinical significance because treatment should include loop diuretics but should avoid β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. Atrioventricular nodal blocking agents may have detrimental effects in cardiac amyloidosis because the cardiac output in this patient population is dependent on heart rate due to a significantly reduced stroke volume from the concentric hypertrophy minimizing diastolic filling. Also, caution should be taken when initiating nitrates in amyloid cardiomyopathy because further reducing preload in an already preload-depleted state can result in hypotension.

### Restrictive cardiomyopathy: definition and diagnosis [^114z31kf]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Definition of restrictive cardiomyopathy

All classification systems serve two main purposes:(i) to provide nosographic schemes where disorders are classified according to their specific features;(ii) to suggest criteria that help the diagnostic workup. Rarely is a single classification scheme fully functional for both purposes. The classification of cardiomyopathies proposed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) position statement(2008) (i) has been widely accepted by the cardiological community because it is easily applicable in clinical practice and immediately translates into a diagnostic algorithm. This classification system requires to assess the cardiac phenotype (first of all through transthoracic echocardiogram), to search for family history of the disease (and then a possible genetic basis), and to reach the final specific diagnosis (Figure 1). Although this probably remains the best classification system to categorize cardiomyopathies, it may be suboptimal when applied to RCM. First, hypertrophic, dilated, and many cases of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy share morphological and/or functional characteristics that are easily identifiable through a routine echocardiogram. Conversely, the main unifying feature of RCM is strictly haemodynamic and consequently not immediately evident on the echocardiogram. Restrictive left ventricular (LV) physiology is produced by an increased myocardial stiffness, causing a rapid rise in ventricular pressure at the beginning of the diastolic phase with only small increases in filling volumes or a critical reduction of ventricular volumes up to a near obliteration, caused by massive wall hypertrophy or endomyocardial proliferation. According to the ESC definition, the other features of RCM are 'normal or reduced systolic and diastolic volumes (of one or both ventricles)' and 'normal ventricular wall thickness'. While this definition is conceptually accurate, its literal interpretation would lead to the exclusion of many disorders with a common restrictive physiology, including several forms of RCM listed in the same document (Table 1).

### Atrial fibrillation in patients with cardiomyopathy: prevalence and clinical outcomes from real-world data [^117M5nCr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Cardiomyopathy is a common cause of atrial fibrillation (AF) and may also present as a complication of AF. However, there is a scarcity of evidence of clinical outcomes for people with cardiomyopathy and concomittant AF. The aim of the present study was therefore to characterize the prevalence of AF in major subtypes of cardiomyopathy and investigate the impact on important clinical outcomes. Methods and Results A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records from a global federated health research network, with data primarily from the United States. The TriNetX network was searched on January 17, 2021, including records from 2002 to 2020, which included at least 1 year of follow-up data. Patients were included based on a diagnosis of hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy and concomitant AF. Patients with cardiomyopathy and AF were propensity-score matched for age, sex, race, and comorbidities with patients who had a cardiomyopathy only. The outcomes were 1-year mortality, hospitalization, incident heart failure, and incident stroke. Of 634 885 patients with cardiomyopathy, there were 14 675 (2.3%) patients with hypertrophic, 90 117 (7.0%) with restrictive, and 37 685 (5.9%) with dilated cardiomyopathy with concomitant AF. AF was associated with significantly higher odds of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [95% CI]) for patients with hypertrophic (1.26 [1.13–1.40]) and dilated (1.36 [1.27–1.46]), but not restrictive (0.98 [0.94–1.02]), cardiomyopathy. Odds of hospitalization, incident heart failure, and incident stroke were significantly higher in all cardiomyopathy subtypes with concomitant AF. Among patients with AF, catheter ablation was associated with significantly lower odds of all-cause mortality at 12 months across all cardiomyopathy subtypes. Conclusions Findings of the present study suggest AF may be highly prevalent in patients with cardiomyopathy and associated with worsened prognosis. Subsequent research is needed to determine the usefulness of screening and multisdisciplinary treatment of AF in this population.

### Hemodynamics of constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy [^1113NYhp]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) are indolent disabling diseases of diastolic function. The two conditions share common pathophysiologic features, resulting in similar and overlapping clinical presentations, echocardiographic findings, and hemodynamic characteristics. However, their clinical course differs, as CP is surgically curable whereas RCM is a chronic condition managed medically. Separating these two entities is based on delineation of anatomic and physiologic derangements employing multimodality hemodynamic interrogation by advanced imaging techniques (Echo-Doppler, CT, and especially MRI) combined with sophisticated invasive hemodynamics.

### Conduction abnormalities in pediatric patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy [^112J6tUr]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy carries a poor prognosis secondary to a high risk of sudden death previously attributed to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The extent of conduction abnormalities in this population and their relationship to life-threatening events has not been previously reported.

Methods and Results

A retrospective study of pediatric patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy diagnosed between April 1994 and May 2011 was performed. Demographic, cardiac, and ECG characteristics and the mechanisms of serious arrhythmic events (death or episode of acute hemodynamic compromise thought to be secondary to arrhythmia) were evaluated. Sixteen patients (1–17 years of age) were reviewed, with 5 sudden cardiac events noted, including 4 deaths. Two deaths were caused by development of acute heart block; another patient with syncope had intermittent heart block and survived as the result of pacing features of an implanted defibrillator system. The median PR interval (222 versus 144 ms; P < 0.01) and the QRS duration (111 versus 74; P = 0.01) were significantly longer in those who had an acute cardiac event. Older age at presentation was associated with sudden cardiac events (P < 0.01). No other functional or echocardiographic variables were associated with a sudden cardiac event.

Conclusions

Pediatric patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy are at risk for acute high-grade heart block, and, in this cohort, bradycardic events represented a significant portion of all arrhythmic events. Aggressive ECG monitoring strategies looking for conduction system disease should be ongoing in all patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. Implantation of a defibrillator/pacemaker should be considered as prophylactic management.

### Updates in cardiac amyloidosis: a review [^116v6ckM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical Features

Cardiac amyloidosis, irrespective of type, presents as a restrictive cardiomyopathy characterized by progressive diastolic and subsequently systolic biventricular dysfunction and arrhythmia. Key "red flags" to possible systemic amyloidosis include nephrotic syndrome, autonomic neuropathy (eg, postural hypotension, diarrhea), soft-tissue infiltrations (eg, macroglossia, carpal tunnel syndrome, respiratory disease), bleeding (eg, cutaneous, such as periorbital, gastrointestinal), malnutrition/cachexia and genetic predisposition (eg, family history, ethnicity). Initial presentations may be cardiac, with progressive exercise intolerance and heart failure. Other organ involvement, particularly in AL amyloidosis, may cloud the cardiac presentation (eg, nephrotic syndrome, autonomic neuropathy, pulmonary or bronchial involvement). Pulmonary edema is not common early in the disease process, but pleural and pericardial effusions and atrial arrhythmias are often seen. Syncope is common and a poor prognostic sign. It is typically exertional or postprandial as part of restrictive cardiomyopathy, sensitivity to intravascular fluid depletion from loop diuretics combined with autonomic neuropathy, or conduction tissue involvement (atrioventricular or sinoatrial nodes) or ventricular arrhythmia. – The latter may rarely cause recurrent syncope. Disproportionate septal amyloid accumulation mimicking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with dynamic left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction – is rare but well documented. Myocardial ischemia can result from amyloid deposits within the microvasculature. Atrial thrombus is common, particularly in AL amyloidosis, sometimes before atrial fibrillation occurs. Intracardiac thrombus can embolize, causing transient ischemic attacks or strokes, and may be an early or even presenting feature. Anticoagulation is therefore important in the appropriate clinical situation, but careful consideration must be given to patients with extensive systemic AL amyloidosis who may have an elevated bleeding risk due to factor X deficiency or in some cases with gastrointestinal involvement. The Table gives an outline of the clinical phenotypes of the common amyloid subtypes.

### Subtle echocardiogram findings requiring further investigation: restrictive cardiomyopathy in a rare genetic condition [^117A5oLy]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Summary

Mulibrey nanism (MN) is a extremely rare genetic condition first described in 1973, with around 150 cases reported worldwide. MN is characterised by growth delay and multiorgan manifestations, the most fatal being a combination restrictive-constrictive, perimyocardial heart disease that results in diastolic heart failure. We present a male toddler with MN who presented with recurrent episodes of hypoxia, feeding intolerance, and generalised swelling (anasarca) in the setting of subtle echocardiographic findings. A multidisciplinary and systematic diagnostic approach was used to determine the underlying aetiology. Invasive cardiac testing via right heart catheterisation revealed the final diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Transplant decision-making was limited due to hepatic involvement. This case highlights the limitations of echocardiography in diagnosing restrictive cardiomyopathy, which has a preserved ejection fraction, as well the need for multidisciplinary involvement and a family-centred approach in treating patients with this rare condition.

### An unusual case of cardiac amyloidosis [^111v6SY3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis can result from any of the systemic amyloidoses. The disease is often characterized by a restrictive cardiomyopathy although the particular signs and symptoms depend in part on the underlying cause. In addition to managing the symptoms of heart failure, treatment options vary depending on the etiology of amyloid deposition. It is therefore critical to identify the cause of cardiac amyloidosis before initiating definitive therapy. We present a patient with presumed immunoglobulin (AL) amyloidosis who had a circulating lambda monoclonal protein, but a bone marrow biopsy with kappa predominant plasma cells. This unusual finding called into question the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis and highlights the importance and difficulty of determining the cause of cardiac amyloid deposition before initiating treatment. We review the different forms of cardiac amyloidosis and propose a diagnostic algorithm to help identify the etiology of cardiac amyloid deposition before beginning therapy.

### Restrictive cardiomyopathy: definition and diagnosis [^116jwtHf]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Storage disorders

This group is composed of different genetic disorders characterized by an intracellular accumulation of different substances. Iron overload cardiomyopathy is also characterized by interstitial inflammation contributing to myocardial damage. Storage disorders affect a wide spectrum of ages, including children or young adults.

Anderson–Fabry disease is the most common storage disorder and an occasional cause of RCM. It is an X-linked recessive disorder due to reduced or absent activity of α-galactosidase A (GLA) caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which results in progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide within tissues. Two main disease subtypes emerge: the classic multisystemic disease and the later-onset, usually associated with isolated cardiac involvement. Early cardiac involvement in males typically includes HF, arrhythmias (bradycardia, chronotropic incompetence, various degrees of atrioventricular block, AF, and ventricular arrhythmias) and mitral regurgitation, together with increased LV mass, and myocardial fibrosis. The later-onset phenotype displays similar heart manifestations developing at older ages and may be first diagnosed in patients with increased LV mass or HCM. Heterozygous females can develop increased LV mass progressing to HCM and HF, usually at an older age when compared with male patients carrying the same mutation. Their disease severity may depend on the X chromosome inactivation pattern. The classical phenotype can be identified by recognizing the characteristic findings of episodic pain in the extremities, absent or decreased sweating, typical skin lesions, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and corneal dystrophy in childhood or adolescence. The disease progresses to renal, cardiac and/or cerebrovascular disease in adulthood. In later-onset phenotype males, the diagnosis is often missed, and may be made in adulthood when cardiac and/or kidney involvement becomes manifest. The diagnosis in males is confirmed by demonstrating the enzyme deficiency and by identifying the specific GLA gene mutation. Female heterozygotes can have α- GLA A enzymatic activity markedly decreased to values in the normal range. Therefore, heterozygous females are only accurately diagnosed by demonstrating the specific α- GLA gene mutation. Pathogenic mutations are associated with elevated Lyso-Gb3 a Fabry disease specific biomarker. Available treatments include enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) (agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta) and migalastat, which in patients with amenable mutations binds the catalytic domain of α- GLA A promoting its proper folding and trafficking to the lysosome. These therapies have improved patient outcomes largely due to their renal effects. Although the cardiac positive effects are less clear, ERT may reduce the rate of cardiovascular events, reduce, or stabilize LV mass, and blunt the reduction in native T1, an early CMR marker of disease. New therapies for Fabry disease include second-generation ERTs, substrate reduction therapies, and gene and mRNA therapies.

### Etiology and phenotypes of cardiomyopathy in Southern Africa: the IMHOTEP multicenter pilot study [^117YLw6H]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiomyopathies are an important cause of heart failure in Africa yet there are limited data on etiology and clinical phenotypes.

Objectives

The IMHOTEP (African Cardiomyopathy and Myocarditis Registry Program) was designed to systematically collect data on individuals diagnosed with cardiomyopathy living in Africa.

Methods

In this multicenter pilot study, patients (age ≥ 13 years) were eligible for inclusion if they had a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Cases were grouped and analyzed according to phenotype; dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) including myocarditis and peripartum cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM).

Results

A total of 665 unrelated index cases (median age 35 [27–44] years; 51.1% female) were recruited at 3 centers in South Africa and 1 center in Mozambique. DCM (n = 478) was the most common type of cardiomyopathy, accounting for 72% of the cohort; ACM (n = 78), HCM (n = 70), and RCM (n = 39) were less frequent. While the age of onset and sex distribution of HCM and ACM were similar to European and North American populations, DCM and RCM had a younger age of onset and occurred more frequently in women and those with African ancestry. Causes of cardiomyopathy were diverse; familial (27%), nonfamilial/idiopathic (36%), and secondary (37%) etiologies were observed.

Conclusions

In the largest study of cardiomyopathy to-date on the African continent, we observe that DCM is the dominant form of cardiomyopathy in Southern Africa. The age of onset was significantly younger in African patients with notable sex and ethnic disparities in DCM.

### HRS / EHRA expert consensus statement on the state of genetic testing for the channelopathies and cardiomyopathies this document was developed as a partnership between the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) [^1156m32a]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

HRS/EHRA — therapeutic implications of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) genetic testing explain that while direct therapeutic application of a genetic test result for RCM has not been definitively demonstrated, such results may impact the assessment of arrhythmia; for disorders with multi-system involvement, recognition of an underlying syndrome that results in restrictive cardiac physiology can lead to disease-specific therapy, such as transplantation for TTR-amyloidosis or replacement enzyme infusions for some storage diseases; the combination of RCM with elevated serum creatine kinase suggests a mutation in genes encoding desmin (DES) or lamin A/C (LMNA); and because these are associated with relatively high rates of sudden cardiac death, RCM secondary to DES or LMNA should prompt consideration of a prophylactic ICD, particularly in the setting of AV block or bundle branch block.

### Constrictive pericarditis versus restrictive Cardiomyopathy? [^1178nFeT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

About one-half of the patients with congestive heart failure have preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although the etiology of HFpEF is most commonly related to long-standing hypertension and atherosclerosis, a significant number of suspected HFpEF patients have a restrictive cardiomyopathy or chronic pericardial disease. Recognizing these syndromes is important because early diagnosis may lead to instituting specific therapy that may prolong survival, improve quality of life, and/or recognize and treat an underlying systemic disorder. Advances in diagnostic imaging, biomarkers, and genetic testing today allow identification of the specific etiology in most cases. Novel pharmacological, immunologic, and surgical therapies are leading to improved quality of life and survival.

### Restrictive cardiomyopathy: definition and diagnosis [^116sdybG]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac sarcoidosis, often included among RCMs, is a multi-system inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas. The disease evolves toward ventricular dilatation and hypokinesia but can initially display a restrictive physiology in a ventricle with regional contractile abnormalities. Cardiac involvement is almost always associated with lung disease, but the absence of overt lung disease should not exclude cardiac sarcoidosis. The proposed diagnostic criteria refer to cardiac sarcoidosis with a dilated and hypokinetic phenotype. Immunosuppression with corticosteroids remains the standard therapy for the acute inflammatory phase, but steroid-sparing agents are being increasingly used. Patients with cardiac sarcoidosis should also receive guideline-directed therapies for HF and arrhythmias.

Interstitial fibrosis/intrinsic myocyte dysfunction

Primary RCMs include idiopathic and genetic RCMs. In idiopathic forms, familial aggregation or the absence of any identifiable cause may suggest a genetic disorder, but the search for gene mutations is negative. Familial cases generally display a pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. Mutations have been described in several genes encoding sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric proteins. In both idiopathic and genetic RCMs, disease mechanisms likely include abnormal functioning of sarcomere proteins and the activation of fibrotic pathways following tissue damage. Most patients are diagnosed at paediatric age due to severe chronic HF. Skeletal myopathy and atrioventricular block are present in some familial cases. Considerable genotypic and phenotypic overlap exists between restrictive RCM and HCM. The two different phenotypes can be expressed by the same mutations; in a number of cases, the phenotype is mixed from the beginning (overtly restrictive haemodynamics with generally modestly increased LV mass); in others, there is an evolution from classical HCM to RCM. HCM associated with thin-filament mutations is characterized by less prominent and atypically distributed hypertrophy, increased fibrosis, and more adverse remodelling (hypokinetic or restrictive evolution), leading to congestive symptoms and more severe diastolic dysfunction, compared with thick-filament HCM. Preclinical studies, using transgenic mouse lines with thin-filament genes demonstrated a markedly increased myofilament calcium sensitivity, leading to development of restrictive diastolic patterns and systolic dysfunction over time. The early impairment in excitation-contraction coupling, energetic derangement, abnormal cardiomyocyte signalling, and intrinsic abnormalities of sarcomere relaxation caused by thin-filament mutations may drive progressive remodelling at the cellular and extracellular levels, resulting in impaired contractile and relaxation properties of the myocardium. No disease-modifying therapy is currently available.

### Higher body mass index in adolescence predicts cardiomyopathy risk in midlife [^114v54ku]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Heart failure among young people is rare, but in contrast to decreasing incidence rates overall, some studies have found increasing rates among younger people. Although coronary heart disease and hypertension are the most frequent causes of heart failure in older patients, cardiomyopathy is a more common underlying condition in the young. The incidence of hospitalizations for heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy in Sweden more than doubled from 1987 to 2006.

The classification of cardiomyopathy is challenging because of the marked heterogeneity and differences in definitions over the years. The latest classification from the European Society of Cardiology, from 2008, defines cardiomyopathy as "a myocardial disease in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality". Five categories are presented; dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, and unclassified cardiomyopathy. In a validation study of cardiomyopathy diagnoses in the Swedish National Hospital Register, dilated cardiomyopathy was the most common diagnosis (67%), followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (16%), whereas other types were rare. Modifiable causes listed for dilated cardiomyopathy include myocarditis, drugs, alcohol, endocrine disorders, and nutritional deficiencies, with ≈25% estimated to have genetic causes resulting from specific genetic defects linked to cardiac muscle development. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is mostly a familial dominant inheritable disease, with obesity and athletic training listed as potential acquired causes.

### Restrictive cardiomyopathy: definition and diagnosis [^112hmNPS]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) has been considered the least common form of heart muscle disease, and also the one most difficult to define and classify, encompassing a group of disorders whose classification and diagnosis pose unique challenges. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is undoubtedly the cardiomyopathy with the widest spectrum of aetiologies and histological features and the one most often requiring cardiac catheterization or endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) to achieve a definite diagnosis. To add further complexity, the boundaries of RCM are becoming increasingly blurred because many disease-causing genes are shared with other cardiomyopathies, and cardiac phenotypes may change over time. Although the haemodynamic definition of restrictive pathophysiology is undisputable, the pressure-volume relations can vary, and the cut-offs to diagnose restriction are not unequivocal. Moreover, novel imaging techniques including cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), scintigraphy with bone tracers, and positron emission tomography help to establish specific causes of tissue damage (e.g. amyloidosis, Anderson–Fabry disease, haemochromatosis, sarcoidosis), even when typical restrictive pathophysiology has not fully developed yet.

### Restrictive cardiomyopathy: genetics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and therapy [^115byWSf]. Circulation Research (2017). Low credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is characterized by nondilated left or right ventricle with diastolic dysfunction. The restrictive cardiomyopathies are a heterogenous group of myocardial diseases that vary according to pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation and criteria, treatment, and prognosis. In this review, an overview of RCMs will be presented followed by a detailed discussion on 3 major causes of RCM, for which tailored interventions are available: cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and cardiac hemochromatosis. Each of these 3 RCMs is challenging to diagnose, and recognition of each disease entity is frequently delayed. Clinical clues to promote recognition of cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and cardiac hemochromatosis and imaging techniques used to facilitate diagnosis are discussed. Disease-specific therapies are reviewed. Early recognition remains a key barrier to improving survival in all RCMs.

### Clinical and mechanistic insights into the Genetics of cardiomyopathy [^111hG4Dp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Over the last quarter-century, there has been tremendous progress in genetics research that has defined molecular causes for cardiomyopathies. More than a thousand mutations have been identified in many genes with varying ontologies, therein indicating the diverse molecules and pathways that cause hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. Translation of this research to the clinic via genetic testing can precisely group affected patients according to molecular etiology, and identify individuals without evidence of disease who are at high risk for developing cardiomyopathy. These advances provide insights into the earliest manifestations of cardiomyopathy and help to define the molecular pathophysiological basis for cardiac remodeling. Although these efforts remain incomplete, new genomic technologies and analytic strategies provide unparalleled opportunities to fully explore the genetic architecture of cardiomyopathies. Such data hold the promise that mutation-specific pathophysiology will uncover novel therapeutic targets, and herald the beginning of precision therapy for cardiomyopathy patients.

### Atrial fibrillation in patients with cardiomyopathy: prevalence and clinical outcomes from real-world data [^113KVQWk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with various cardiovascular risk factors, which in turn contribute to the risk of AF‐related complications. In contemporary anticoagulated AF populations, the majority of deaths are related to causes other than stroke. For example, the RE‐LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long‐Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trialreported that progressive heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death accounted for 15% and 22% of deaths in patients with AF, respectively, whereas stroke accounted for 7%. Further studies have also reported a high risk of cardiovascular adverse events, aside from stroke and despite anticoagulation use, in patients with AF. These findings emphasize the need for a more holistic or integrated care approach to AF management to further reduce mortality in patients with AF.

Cardiomyopathies are myocardial disorders that are not secondary to coronary disease, hypertension, and congenital, valvular, or pericardial abnormalities. Four main subtypes of cardiomyopathy are hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, and less commonly, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy is a common cause of new onset AF and may also present as a sequela of AF. When presented together, patients suffer from worse symptoms and poorer prognosis. However, evidence‐based evaluation and management of this complex patient group is lacking.

The majority of previous real‐world data have typically comprised small samples, especially when investigating population subgroups and outcomes such as mortality. Also, although several studies have focused on AF with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, there are limited published data on dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathies, especially with regard to the impact of AF on important clinical outcomes in these populations. To address this, we investigated the prevalence and clinical impact of AF in patients with cardiomyopathy across patient characteristics and different cardiomyopathy subtypes.

### Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy in children [^116KQqDS]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the natural history of idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy in a paediatric population and to identify any factors predictive of outcome.

Design

Retrospective analysis of patients born between 1970 and 2002 were identified from the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh cardiology database. Demographic data, mode of presentation, echocardiographic and haemodynamic findings at diagnosis, survival time, and manner of death were evaluated.

Setting

Tertiary referral and transplant centre for paediatric patients with cardiac disease.

Patients

All local and referred patients with idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy born after 1970 and under 21 years of age at time of diagnosis.

Results

21 patients were identified. Probability of survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 80.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 58 to 100), 39% (95% CI 17 to 61), and 20% (95% CI 0 to 42), respectively. Median age of presentation was 3.8 years (mean (SD) 5.7 (6.1) years). Median survival without transplantation was 2.2 years (mean (SD) 4.6 (5.4) years). Age at presentation, sex, and presence or absence of heart failure symptoms at presentation were not associated with clinical course. Right (p = 0.05) and left ventricular end diastolic pressures (p = 0.04) and ratio of left atrial to aortic root dimensions (LA:Ao) (p = 0.03) at presentation had a significantly negative correlation with survival time after diagnosis.

Conclusions

Without transplantation, most children with restrictive cardiomyopathy have a very poor prognosis. Longer survival from diagnosis was correlated with lower LA:Ao and cardiac filling pressures at diagnosis. Survival time was not influenced by the symptoms present at diagnosis.

### Advancing understanding and addressing disparities in cardiomyopathy care in Southern Africa [^1124Mc3U]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathy, encompassing a wide range of heart muscle disorders, presents a global health challenge. Despite remarkable strides in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac conditions, significant disparities persist, particularly in regions often categorized as the Global South. Southern Africa, among other areas, grapples with limited data on the prevalence and management of cardiomyopathy, exacerbating existing health care inequalities. These disparities are multifaceted, arising from challenges such as restricted access to health care resources, poor screening programs, and an unequal distribution of treatment modalities. Consequently, cardiomyopathy patients in these regions face worse health outcomes than those in more affluent countries, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions and equitable health care initiatives.

The African Cardiomyopathy and Myocarditis Registry Program (IMHOTEP) addresses a critical gap in understanding cardiomyopathies' etiology and clinical phenotypes in the region. The Kraus et alstudy, published in JACC: Advances, provides valuable insights for regional health care and public health. The primary finding highlights the predominance of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in Southern Africa, accounting for 72% of cases. This underscores the significant burden of DCM in the region and emphasizes the need for tailored interventions and management strategies specific to this subtype. Notable demographic patterns emerge, with DCM and restrictive cardiomyopathy showing a younger age of onset and higher frequency among women and individuals of African ancestry, indicating potential genetic and environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies. The study also reveals etiological diversity, including familial, nonfamilial/idiopathic, and secondary causes, with familial factors being significant in over a quarter of cases. This emphasizes the importance of comprehensive evaluation, genetic screening, and counseling initiatives for cardiomyopathy patients to guide management decisions. Sex and ethnic disparities in cardiomyopathy, particularly evident in DCM, underscore the need for targeted approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment that address the unique characteristics and needs of diverse patient populations. The findings have significant clinical implications for health care providers in Africa, emphasizing the importance of increased awareness and resources for accurate diagnosis and management of cardiomyopathies. This includes early detection, risk stratification, and personalized management strategies tailored to the specific subtype and demographic profile of cardiomyopathy patients. A schematic providing summary of key insights and implications from the perspective of understanding cardiomyopathy in Africa is provided in Figure 1.

### Does atrioventricular ring motion always distinguish constriction from restriction? A Doppler myocardial imaging study [^116ocpC2]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2001). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy can be difficult to differentiate on clinical examination. Cardiac ultrasonography is increasingly being used as the noninvasive method of choice for confirming the specific morphologic and hemodynamic abnormalities associated with either condition. Interrogation of atrioventricular valve plane motion by Doppler myocardial imaging (DMI) has been suggested as a valuable new approach that can help differentiate one from the other. We report the color DMI, pulsed DMI, and strain rate findings in 2 cases of constrictive pericarditis in which consideration of the annular motion pattern alone would not have allowed such differentiation.

### HRS / EHRA expert consensus statement on the state of genetic testing for the channelopathies and cardiomyopathies this document was developed as a partnership between the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) [^115yXqWL]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing across heritable arrhythmia syndromes and cardiomyopathies — scope, yield, and use: Genetic testing must not be viewed as a one-size-fits-all solution, and there are more than 50 distinct channelopathy/cardiomyopathy-associated genes; Table 2 summarizes only the common disease-associated genes responsible for ≥ 5% of a given disease. The yield is disease dependent, ranging among the channelopathies from < 20% for short QT syndrome to 75% for the current generation long QT syndrome genetic test, and among the cardiomyopathies from < 20% for restrictive cardiomyopathy to 60% for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Consequently, a negative genetic test can never, by itself, rule out disease. It can be helpful for pre-genetic test counseling, genetic testing, and interpretation to be performed in centers experienced in genetic evaluation and family-based management, and treatment decisions should not rely solely on the patient's genetic test result but should be based on results from his/her comprehensive clinical evaluation.

Figure 4
Echocardiography in restrictive cardiomyopathies. (A) Small left ventricular cavity size in presence of significantly increased wall thickness and severe left atrial dilatation; (B) biventricular wall thickening in absence of pulmonary hypertension; (C and D) restrictive filling pattern with elevated E / E ′ ratio in keeping with increased left ventricular filling pressures; (E) myocardial strain analysis showing an apical sparing pattern in a patient with cardiac amyloidosis.

The characteristic alterations of each disorder are superimposed on this common morphological and functional phenotype, leading to a highly heterogeneous picture. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance and myocardial histology allow to investigate the extremely heterogeneous myocardial substrate. Even the electrocardiographic picture may differ widely across the spectrum of RCM. A possible specific marker of RCM, albeit not sensitive, is the evidence of marked biatrial enlargement. The clinical picture of RCM may be highly variable. Heart failure and AF are still the most common findings. Heart failure is most often right-sided or biventricular, with liver enlargement, lower limb oedema, and ascites.

### Spectrum of restrictive and infiltrative Cardiomyopathies: part 2 of a 2-part series [^113cjLjn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathies are the least common form of heart muscle disease. They are characterized as infiltrative and noninfiltrative, storage diseases, and endomyocardial disorders. Genetic diseases commonly present during childhood or adolescence. However, a growing percentage of elderly patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are being recognized as having forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy, particularly cardiac amyloidosis. Noninvasive evaluation has replaced endomyocardial biopsy in the diagnostic evaluation of most suspected etiologies. The detection of infiltrative cardiomyopathies, particularly primary and secondary forms of iron overload, as well as inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis has slowly led to improved outcomes via disease-specific therapies.

### Extracardiac medical and neuromuscular implications in restrictive cardiomyopathy [^112hE1PT]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCMP) is characterized by restrictive filling and reduced diastolic volume of either or both ventricles with normal or near-normal systolic function and wall thickness. It may occur idiopathically or as a cardiac manifestation of systemic diseases such as scleroderma, amyloidosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cystinosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, Gaucher's disease, hemochromatosis, Fabry's disease, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, hypereosinophilic syndrome, carcinoid, Noonan's syndrome, reactive arthritis, or Werner's syndrome and various neuromuscular disorders. Whereas in idiopathic RCMP the therapeutic options are only treatment of cardiac congestion, in cases with an underlying disorder, a causal therapy may be available. Patients with RCMP should be investigated as soon as the cardiac diagnosis is established for extracardiac diseases to detect a possibly treatable cause of RCMP before the disease becomes intractable. These investigations include a diligent clinical history and examination, blood tests, and ophthalmologic, otologic, dermatologic, gastroenterologic, nephrologic, hematologic, and neurologic examinations. If extracardiac examinations do not reveal a plausible cause for RCMP, endomyocardial biopsy is indicated.

### Early-onset restrictive cardiomyopathy with life-threatening arrhythmia caused by a homozygous desmin mutation: a case report [^114inzoZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Desmin is a muscle-specific intermediate filament protein expressed by the DES gene in the heart, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle tissue. Desmin accumulation in myocyte cytoplasm is associated with cardiac involvement and skeletal muscle lesions due to gene mutation. Cardiovascular involvement has been observed in more than 70% of harmful DES gene variants, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, and, rarely, the mixed phenotype of restrictive cardiomyopathy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (RCM-HCM). Autosomal dominant genetic cardiomyopathy is commonly seen in children, while autosomal recessive cases are rare. This case report presents the details of a pediatric patient with a phenotype of RCM-HCM and a life-threatening arrhythmia caused by a homozygous mutation in DES. It is worth noting that this patient's onset was earlier and more severe than what has been reported in previous cases. This case further expands our knowledge of desmin-related cardiomyopathy in children.

More than 70 cases have been reported, cardiotoxicity manifests as restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy or with atrioventricular and bundle-branch block, prognosis may improve within 1 month to 1 year after drug discontinuation, and risk factors include older age, female sex, longer duration of therapy (3 months–27 years; mean > 10 years), elevated milligram per kilogram daily dose, preexisting cardiac disease, and renal insufficiency.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: causes, mechanisms, and current and future treatment approaches [^115JSDer]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is conventionally defined as the presence of left ventricular or biventricular dilatation or systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions (eg, primary valve disease) or significant coronary artery disease sufficient to cause ventricular remodelling. This definition has been recognised as overly restrictive, as left ventricular hypokinesis without dilation could be the initial presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy. The causes of dilated cardiomyopathy comprise genetic (primary dilated cardiomyopathy) or acquired factors (secondary dilated cardiomyopathy). Acquired factors include infections, toxins, cancer treatment, endocrinopathies, pregnancy, tachyarrhythmias, and immune-mediated diseases. 5–15% of patients with acquired dilated cardiomyopathy harbour a likely pathogenic or pathogenic gene variant (ie, gene mutation). Therefore, the diagnostic tests and therapeutic approach should always consider both genetic and acquired factors. This Seminar will focus on the current multidimensional diagnostic and therapeutic approach and discuss the underlying pathophysiology that could drive future treatments aiming to repair or replace the existing gene mutation, or target the specific inflammatory, metabolic, or pro-fibrotic drivers of genetic or acquired dilated cardiomyopathy.

Table 1
Causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy listed in the 2008 European Society of Cardiology document

Four main violations of ESC diagnostic criteria should be admitted:

LV (and eventually right ventricle, RV) wall thickness is increased in many conditions due to: (i) cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, (ii) interstitial infiltration [as in cardiac amyloidosis (CA)], (iii) intracellular storage (as in glycogenosis, haemochromatosis, or sphingolipidoses).
A restrictive physiology may be found either at an early stage (possibly evolving to a hypokinetic and dilated phenotype) or at an advanced stage (often preceded by a hypertrophic phenotype). This is the case of iron-overload cardiomyopathy and cardiac sarcoidosis, which can display a restrictive physiology in an initial phase, while overt cardiac disease has a hypokinetic and dilated phenotype.
The presence of a restrictive LV physiology does not always imply an RCM. A restrictive pathophysiology may develop at the end stage of any type of cardiomyopathy. The restrictive diastolic filling may be transiently identified in cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy (HCM/DCM) in the presence of severe congestion and disappear following optimization of fluid balance.
The evolution of the phenotypes over time is not considered in the ESC classification. Although restrictive pathophysiology is the essence of RCMs, some primitive, genetically determined DCMs with mild or no ventricular dilatation and HCMs without significant hypertrophy may initially present with restrictive physiology, but they behave and evolve as DCMs and HCMs and should be considered and treated accordingly. An HCM with systolic dysfunction approaching the late stage of disease that develops a restrictive filling pattern poses a diagnostic dilemma between RCM and HCM, depending on the stage of disease. It could manifest as RCM if encountered at the end-stage of the natural history with ventricular wall thinning, systolic dysfunction, and restrictive filling pattern. However, if diagnosed in non-advanced stages, it is considered a 'characteristic' HCM that eventually develops systolic dysfunction and restrictive pathophysiology as the cardiomyopathic process progresses. Cardiac amyloidosis is traditionally considered the paradigm of RCM, but a restrictive filing pattern might be variably present. Cardiac amyloidosis caused by amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis may be present at an early stage, with mild or absent ventricular wall thickening with restrictive pathophysiology, regressing following effective chemotherapy. Conversely, CA due to transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis may present with mild diastolic dysfunction and develop a restrictive filling pattern in later stages when significant LV wall thickening develops.

We reviewed the clinical spectrum and possible prognostic factors in 14 children with restrictive cardiomyopathy. The patients were not homogeneous in clinical presentation or morphology. The mortality rate was high: 21.4% at 1 year and 50% at 2 years after presentation. Younger patients with respiratory symptoms, thromboembolism, increased cardiothoracic ratio on chest radiogram or patients with endocardial fibroelastosis appear to have a worse prognosis and orthotopic cardiac transplantation may be indicated.

### Variant R94C in-encoded troponin T predisposes to pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy and sudden death through impaired thin filament relaxation resulting in myocardial diastolic dysfunction [^115zYoiR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a primary disorder of increased myocardial stiffness and diastolic dysfunction with often normal to slightly hypertrophied ventricular wall thickness. 1 This disease typically manifests with marked atrial dilation, attributable to transmission of elevated pressures during ventricular relaxation, with preserved ventricular systolic function. The etiologies of RCM are broad, including inherited and acquired causes, and the prognosis is poor. 2, 3 RCM comprises one of a group of primary muscle diseases of the heart collectively called cardiomyopathies. Once thought to be separate entities, cardiomyopathies are now thought to be a spectrum of diseases with the presence of restrictive and hypertrophic features varying across the phenotypes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is common and is associated with mutations in sarcomere protein‐encoding genes. 4, 5, 6, 7 RCM and HCM patients often share the feature of diastolic dysfunction, and a subset of patients with RCM demonstrate mild ventricular hypertrophy. The genetic mechanisms underlying RCM, corresponding clinical phenotypes, and subclass of RCM with hypertrophic features have not been well described.

To date, > 1000 variants associated with cardiomyopathy have been identified in sarcomeric genes, including TNNT2‐ encoded cardiac troponin T (TNNT2). 7, 8 TNNT2 combines with the calcium‐binding proteins troponin C and troponin I to form the troponin complex. This troponin complex is integrated into the thin filament of the sarcomere and, in combination with tropomyosin, coordinates contraction of the cardiac muscle by regulating the calcium‐dependent interaction between myosin and the thin filament. TNNT2‐ specific gene variants are a known, rare cause of HCM, found in 3% to 5% of patients with HCM. 9 They have also been associated with the development of ventricular arrhythmias. 10, 11, 12, 13 Recent studies have suggested that variants in TNNT2 may also be associated with development of RCM. 14, 15, 16 For example, the TNNT2 variant, I79N, has been shown to cause RCM and HCM within the same family. 17 Previous biochemical studies have suggested that TNNT2 variants identified in patients with HCM and dilated cardiomyopathy result in alterations in calcium sensitivity, leading to systolic dysfunction. 18, 19 Based on these findings, this molecular mechanism has been extrapolated to disorders of diastolic dysfunction. To confirm this hypothesis, variants known to produce a clinical phenotype of primary diastolic dysfunction and RCM should be studied to confirm the underlying molecular mechanisms.

### Sex-related differences in genetic cardiomyopathies [^115KCqJx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous collection of diseases that have in common primary functional and structural abnormalities of the heart muscle, often genetically determined. The most effective categorization of cardiomyopathies is based on the presenting phenotype, with hypertrophic, dilated, arrhythmogenic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy as the prototypes. Sex modulates the prevalence, morpho-functional manifestations and clinical course of cardiomyopathies. Aspects as diverse as ion channel expression and left ventricular remodeling differ in male and female patients with myocardial disease, although the reasons for this are poorly understood. Moreover, clinical differences may also result from complex societal/environmental discrepancies between sexes that may disadvantage women. This review provides a state-of-the-art appraisal of the influence of sex on cardiomyopathies, highlighting the many gaps in knowledge and open research questions.

### Cardiac MR imaging of nonischemic cardiomyopathies [^112MR9BN]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiomyopathies, diseases of the myocardium associated with cardiac dysfunction, include hypertrophic, restrictive, and dilated forms and rare entities, such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, ventricular noncompaction, and apical ballooning syndrome. Many have similar presentations, but the underlying condition determines prognoses and treatment. Cardiac MR imaging plays a role in characterizing the range of entities and is crucial for evaluation and management. In addition, delayed enhanced imaging can allow differentiation among the forms of cardiomyopathy and offer prognostic information. As the speed and technical ease of cardiac imaging improve, MR imaging will assume an increasing role in the care of patients who have cardiomyopathy.

Cardiac Amyloidosis

Historical Perspectives

ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, the most common type of systemic amyloidosis, an underdiagnosed cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the aging population (> 60 years), has been historically regarded as untreatable, with a rapidly progressive clinical course. Although cardiac amyloidosis is not a new disease and has been recognized for at least 50 years, only in the past decade have noninvasive diagnosis and disease‐specific therapy been accessible to increasing numbers of patients. Of the 3 diseases discussed here, ATTR cardiac amyloidosis is the most recent to emerge as a treatable condition (Figures 2).,

Cardiac amyloidosis is caused by aggregation and deposition of the misfolded transthyretin amyloid protein and fibrils (synthesized in the liver) deposited within the extracellular myocardium, resulting in increased left ventricular wall thickness. The disease process derives either from inherited mutations (eg, ATTRv, variant) or an acquired aging form (eg, ATTRwt, wild type; previously termed senile cardiac amyloidosis), leading to debilitating heart failure symptoms with diffuse fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, conduction system disease, or peripheral polyneuropathy,(Figure 6).

Figure 6
ATTR (transthyretin).

Pathophysiology of ATTR amyloid cardiomyopathy.

ATTR cardiac amyloidosis has been universally associated with poor survival and prognosis (median survival 3.6 years after diagnosis), dependent on the extent of cardiac involvement. Although ATTR cardiac amyloidosis has been generally considered uncommon, recognition is increasing and its precise prevalence is unresolved. Deposits of ATTR‐amyloid have been identified at autopsy in 25% of hearts from patients > 80 years old, 13% of those hospitalized for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, 16% with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and 5% of those diagnosed with HCM.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy in a 3-year-old patient [^116MVB9k]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare form of cardiomyopathy in children, representing only 2.5%-3% of all pediatric cardiomyopathies, and is typically diagnosed between the ages of 6 and 10. The underlying etiology varies depending on age and region; however, idiopathic, genetic, and endomyocardial fibrosis are among the most common. Cohort studies have demonstrated mortality as high as 50% within 2 years of diagnosis, as well as high rates of adverse events including thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, and sudden cardiac death. There is a paucity of literature on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for the diagnosis of pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy. We present a case of a 3-year-old female whose diagnosis of heart failure was rapidly identified via POCUS which subsequently expedited life-saving treatment.

### Treatment strategies for cardiomyopathy in children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112Tir36]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

This scientific statement from the American Heart Association focuses on treatment strategies and modalities for cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease) in children and serves as a companion scientific statement for the recent statement on the classification and diagnosis of cardiomyopathy in children. We propose that the foundation of treatment of pediatric cardiomyopathies is based on these principles applied as personalized therapy for children with cardiomyopathy: (1) identification of the specific cardiac pathophysiology; (2) determination of the root cause of the cardiomyopathy so that, if applicable, cause-specific treatment can occur (precision medicine); and (3) application of therapies based on the associated clinical milieu of the patient. These clinical milieus include patients at risk for developing cardiomyopathy (cardiomyopathy phenotype negative), asymptomatic patients with cardiomyopathy (phenotype positive), patients with symptomatic cardiomyopathy, and patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. This scientific statement focuses primarily on the most frequent phenotypes, dilated and hypertrophic, that occur in children. Other less frequent cardiomyopathies, including left ventricular noncompaction, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, are discussed in less detail. Suggestions are based on previous clinical and investigational experience, extrapolating therapies for cardiomyopathies in adults to children and noting the problems and challenges that have arisen in this experience. These likely underscore the increasingly apparent differences in pathogenesis and even pathophysiology in childhood cardiomyopathies compared with adult disease. These differences will likely affect the utility of some adult therapy strategies. Therefore, special emphasis has been placed on cause-specific therapies in children for prevention and attenuation of their cardiomyopathy in addition to symptomatic treatments. Current investigational strategies and treatments not in wide clinical practice, including future direction for investigational management strategies, trial designs, and collaborative networks, are also discussed because they have the potential to further refine and improve the health and outcomes of children with cardiomyopathy in the future.

### Cardiac transplantation for pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy: presentation, evaluation, and short-term outcome [^114rDU3R]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Because of the poor prognosis of pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy, transplantation has been proposed as the treatment of choice for this disease.

Methods

We reviewed our experience with the presentation, evaluation, and short-term outcome in 8 pediatric patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy referred for transplantation. Potential reversibility of elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance was tested before transplantation with nitroprusside and nitric oxide, with follow-up cardiac catheterization performed 6 to 12 months after transplantation.

Results

The mean age of diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy was 6.3 years and the mean interval from diagnosis to referral for transplantation was 3.6 years. Elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance was common and tended to progress with longer follow-up. Three of the 8 patients had pulmonary vascular resistance indices greater than 10 Woods unit/m(2) and transpulmonary gradients greater than 20 mm Hg. The administration of nitroprusside and nitric oxide reversed elevated pulmonary resistance and transpulmonary gradients in all patients. Nitric oxide successfully reversed pulmonary vascular resistance in patients unresponsive to nitroprusside. All patients underwent successful transplantation and follow-up catheterization revealed normal pulmonary hemodynamics in each patient.

Conclusions

Pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy can be associated with marked elevation in the pulmonary vascular resistance, which may contribute to the poor prognosis in these patients and potentially make cardiac transplantation problematic. Orthotopic cardiac transplantation can be successfully performed in patients who demonstrate reversibility of pulmonary vascular resistance. Nitric oxide appears to be the best agent to demonstrate reversibility of pulmonary resistance in these patients.

### Cardiomyopathy: an overview [^113VRbbf]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The definition and classification of cardiomyopathy have evolved considerably in recent years. Cardiomyopathy can be separated into primary (genetic, mixed, or acquired) and secondary categories, which result in varied phenotypes including dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive patterns. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common primary cardiomyopathy and can cause exertional dyspnea, presyncope, atypical chest pain, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Dilated cardiomyopathy can be genetic or acquired and typically presents with classic symptoms of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is much less common and often associated with systemic disease. Family physicians should be alert for acquired variants of cardiomyopathy, including peripartum and stress-induced cardiomyopathy, as well as rare variants, such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia and left ventricular noncompaction. In addition to history and physical examination, diagnosis of cardiomyopathy includes electrocardiography and echocardiography testing. Treatment may include appropriately staged therapy for heart failure, appropriate activity restriction, evaluation for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, and consideration of heart transplantation in refractory cases. Genetic testing of families is an emerging modality with some potential to augment traditional screening performed by family physicians.

Simultaneous right and left ventricular haemodynamic assessment in constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. (Top) Left ventricular (blue) and right ventricular (orange) hemodynamic pressure tracings in constrictive pericarditis. End-diastolic filling pressures are elevated, and a 'square root' sign is present on both tracings (*). Enhanced ventricular interdependence is present, demonstrated by visualization of the systolic area index, right ventricular (light grey) and left ventricular (dark grey) areas under the curve for both inspiration (Insp) and expiration (Exp). During inspiration, there is an increase in the area of the right ventricular pressure curve and a decrease in the area of the left ventricular pressure curve. (Bottom) left ventricular and right ventricular pressure tracings in restrictive cardiomyopathy. End-diastolic pressures are elevated and a square root sign (*) is seen; there is no evidence of enhanced ventricular interdependence, with parallel changes in LV and RV pressure curve areas. Reprinted with permission from Geske et al.

This haemodynamic profile shared by all forms of RCM can be characterized quite accurately by a transthoracic echocardiogram. The first clue of restrictive pathophysiology is the combination of biatrial enlargement (which cannot be attributed to specific causes such as valve disease or AF), normal or mildly reduced LV and RV ejection fraction and non-dilated ventricles. Doppler imaging can then show a restrictive filling pattern of transmitral flow with increased early diastolic filling velocity (E wave) due to elevated left atrium (LA) pressure, and decreased atrial filling velocity (A wave) due to the high ventricular diastolic pressure, reduction of mitral deceleration time, and isovolumetric relaxation time. Additionally, the ratio between systolic and diastolic pulmonary venous flow ratios is markedly reduced because of high LA pressures. Tissue Doppler typically shows reduced early diastolic myocardial velocity (e ′) leading to an elevated E / e ′ ratio (Figure 4). Congestion of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins and diastolic flow reversal in the hepatic veins during inspiration are common, following the inability of a non-compliant RV to accommodate the increased venous return.

### Restrictive cardiomyopathy: definition and diagnosis [^113RhCaA]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The current classification of cardiomyopathies has deeply transformed our approach to the diagnosis of disease and has improved our understanding of this heterogeneous field. The attempt to dissect the heterogeneous variety of cardiomyopathies with a clinically relevant and feasible approach represents one of the hardest challenges of the contemporary era. Based on these premises, we carried out a critical revision of the current definition of RCM, starting from the ESC recommended approach, to shed light upon the grey zone of this cardiomyopathy model, following major advances in knowledge achieved over recent years.

The essence of RCM is the coexistence of persistent restrictive physiology, commonly with atrial dilatation, and nondilated ventricles, regardless of ventricular wall thickness and systolic function. A restrictive filling pattern on echocardiography at a single time is not sufficient to diagnose RCM, as this finding might result from transient haemodynamic alterations. Unlike the ventricular thickness and dilatation that define HCM and DCM, respectively, the restrictive filling pattern can be dynamic and reversible over short time intervals (i.e. severe congestion relieved with diuretics). Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider 'persistent' restrictive pathophysiology as the presence of a restrictive filling pattern on at least two repeated Doppler echocardiograms: (i) at clinical presentation and (ii) after an appropriate period (e.g. at least six months). In the time window between clinical presentation and confirmation of a persistent restrictive pathophysiology, patients might be defined as having a 'possible RCM', and undergo a search for the disease substrate. In general, we believe that a useful and clinically feasible classification based on cardiac phenotype on echocardiogram should simply provide a 'nosographic box' for each patient rather than a presumptive diagnosis. In this perspective, the identification of the predominant phenotype at presentation should be considered to classify patients in one of the following 'boxes': dilated phenotype, hypertrophic phenotype, or restrictive phenotype. This approach would provide a clinical guide but would also maintain a broad and open horizon of the possible final diagnosis. A clear example is provided by 'restrictive pathophysiology' which can be the very essence of cardiomyopathy (RCM) or an accompanying feature (HCM or DCM with restrictive pathophysiology). Patients with mild increases in ventricular wall thickness and restrictive filling pattern should be considered as possible RCM rather than HCM at first clinical evaluation, as the predominant feature is diastolic impairment. On the other hand, patients with severe increase in ventricular wall thickness and restrictive filling pattern should be considered as HCM with restrictive pathophysiology as 'cardiac hypertrophy' is the predominant feature. This approach might be reasonable and provide an initial nosographic box to classify patients without the claim that a definitive diagnosis can be made at the first clinical evaluation (Figure 5).

### Multimodality imaging in differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy: a comprehensive overview for clinicians and imagers [^117F8sbd]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). Medium credibility.

In the evaluation of heart failure, 2 differential diagnostic considerations include constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The often outwardly similar clinical presentation of these 2 pathologic entities routinely renders their clinical distinction difficult. Consequently, initial assessment requires a keen understanding of their separate pathophysiology, epidemiology, and hemodynamic effects. Following a detailed clinical evaluation, further assessment initially rests on comprehensive echocardiographic investigation, including detailed Doppler evaluation. With the combination of mitral inflow characterization, tissue Doppler assessment, and hepatic vein interrogation, initial differentiation of constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy is often possible with high sensitivity and specificity. In conjunction with a compatible clinical presentation, successful differentiation enables both an accurate diagnosis and subsequent targeted management. In certain cases, however, the diagnosis remains unclear despite echocardiographic assessment, and additional evaluation is required. With advances in noninvasive tools, such evaluation can often continue in a stepwise, algorithmic fashion noninvasively, including both cross-sectional and nuclear imaging. Should this additional evaluation itself prove insufficient, invasive assessment with appropriate expertise may ultimately be necessary.

Here we report the work of ClinGen's Inherited Cardiomyopathy Expert Panel (CMP-EP), which adapted the ACMG/AMP framework for use in myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7)-associated cardiomyopathies with the aim of improving consistency for variant interpretation and expert curation of reported MYH7 variants for submission to ClinVar (3 star). These disorders include hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathy (HCM, DCM, and RCM), which are collectively among the most prevalent Mendelian conditions and affect 1 in 200–500 individuals. MYH7 is the second most common inherited cause of HCM and third most common inherited cause of DCM, primarily due to missense variants that are dominantly inherited, although de novo variants have been reported.

Including the histological substrate may be useful to categorize the disorders classified as RCM rather than from a diagnostic perspective, as the EMB is performed near the end of each diagnostic work-up and is not always required. The diagnostic approach proposed in Figure 5 should be applied to a patient with RCM, defined as above. The final diagnosis will be the specific disorder (with the features of RCM), or 'primary RCM' when other disorders are excluded.

The main messages for clinicians are recapitulated in Box 1.

### Subtle echocardiogram findings requiring further investigation: restrictive cardiomyopathy in a rare genetic condition [^111EGnxs]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

With the subtle findings on echocardiogram, a high degree of suspicion for a variable combination of restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis was at the top of the differential diagnosis. Nevertheless, the complex and multisystem findings of MN required systematic consideration and rule-out of alternative causes for anasarca. After cardiac catheterisation, some variable combination of restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis was suspected, complicated by pulmonary hypertension due to the restrictive cardiomyopathy and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. It was felt that the restrictive cardiomyopathy was primary due to minimal respiratory variation in pressures during cardiac catheterisation. Some contribution to his anasarca was felt to arise from a left-to-right shunting mechanism from his liver haemangiomas.

### Heart failure in β-thalassemia syndromes: a decade of progress [^111rMTUw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The thalassemias are common monogenic disorders of hemoglobin synthesis. beta-thalassemias are the most important among the thalassemia syndromes and have become a worldwide clinical problem due to an increasing immigrant population. In beta-thalassemia major, regular blood transfusions are necessary early in life. Beta-thalassemia intermedia refers to a less severe phenotype, whereas beta-thalassemia/hemoglobin E disease encompasses a broad phenotypic spectrum. Blood transfusions and increased gastrointestinal iron absorption result in iron overload and tissue damage. Among patients with beta-thalassemia major, biventricular, dilated cardiomyopathy remains the leading cause of mortality. In some patients, a restrictive type of left ventricular cardiomyopathy or pulmonary hypertension is noted. The clinical course, although variable and occasionally fulminant, is more benign in recent than in older series. Myocarditis has been described as a cause of left-sided heart failure in younger patients. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is the principal cause of heart failure in beta-thalassemia intermedia. Chelation therapy has improved prognosis in beta-thalassemia major both by reducing the incidence of heart failure and by reversing cardiomyopathy. Estimation of the patient's cardiac risk is mainly based on clinical criteria and serial echocardiography. A new cardiovascular magnetic resonance technique will probably fulfill the need for more precise risk stratification in beta-thalassemia syndromes. By increasing the proportion of patients on optimal chelation, survival in beta-thalassemia major may further improve. Recent advances in gene therapy are expected to result in the long-awaited cure of this disease.

### Heart failure in cardiomyopathies: a position paper from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^114FoJZz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of heart muscle diseases and an important cause of heart failure (HF). Current knowledge on incidence, pathophysiology and natural history of HF in cardiomyopathies is limited, and distinct features of their therapeutic responses have not been systematically addressed. Therefore, this position paper focuses on epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history and latest developments in treatment of HF in patients with dilated (DCM), hypertrophic (HCM) and restrictive (RCM) cardiomyopathies. In DCM, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has high incidence and prevalence and represents the most frequent cause of death, despite improvements in treatment. In addition, advanced HF in DCM is one of the leading indications for heart transplantation. In HCM, HF with preserved ejection (HFpEF) affects most patients with obstructive, and ∼10% of patients with non-obstructive HCM. A timely treatment is important, since development of advanced HF, although rare in HCM, portends a poor prognosis. In RCM, HFpEF is common, while HFrEF occurs later and more frequently in amyloidosis or iron overload/haemochromatosis. Irrespective of RCM aetiology, HF is a harbinger of a poor outcome. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of HF in cardiomyopathies have significant implications for therapeutic decision-making. In addition, new aetiology-specific treatment options (e.g. enzyme replacement therapy, transthyretin stabilizers, immunoadsorption, immunotherapy, etc.) have shown a potential to improve outcomes. Still, causative therapies of many cardiomyopathies are lacking, highlighting the need for the development of effective strategies to prevent and treat HF in cardiomyopathies.
