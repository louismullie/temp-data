## Question

Vitamin C and hydrocortisone in septic shock management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intravenous vitamin C, with or without hydrocortisone and thiamine, improves clinically meaningful outcomes in septic shock, and what the evidence shows about benefits, harms, dosing, timing, and current recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological rationale for vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine in sepsis. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized trials and their primary outcomes. Next, I will review meta-analyses and component network meta-analyses for consistency and dose-response signals. After that, I need to check safety signals, including potential harm. I will then examine unresolved questions like timing, duration, and patient selection. Finally, I should align with current guidelines and synthesize a practical, clinically grounded bottom line with caveats for research or exceptional scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the biological rationale so I don't jump to conclusions based on mechanistic plausibility alone. Vitamin C is depleted in critical illness and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, supports endothelial integrity, and is a cofactor for catecholamine and vasopressin synthesis, which could theoretically reduce vasopressor needs; hydrocortisone suppresses inflammation and may shorten shock duration; thiamine supports mitochondrial metabolism and may mitigate lactate accumulation and oxalate risk when high-dose vitamin C is used, though the clinical translation of these mechanisms remains uncertain [^1179jZdH] [^112dvXKG] [^113pHL7z] [^117LWTfC].

> Next, I should review the pivotal randomized trials. The VITAMINS trial in septic shock found no improvement in time alive and free of vasopressors with vitamin C plus hydrocortisone and thiamine versus hydrocortisone alone, and no mortality benefit, which directly challenges the added value of vitamin C and thiamine on top of steroids [^1161RWTh]. The VICTAS trial in sepsis with respiratory or circulatory failure was terminated early and showed no improvement in ventilator- or vasopressor-free days or 30-day mortality with the triple therapy versus placebo, although open-label steroid use was common and may have attenuated any signal [^115UfHdb]. The ACTS trial likewise found no significant reduction in 72-hour SOFA change, kidney failure, or 30-day mortality with the combination versus placebo, reinforcing the lack of benefit signal [^115jsrFK]. Multiple additional RCTs of the triple regimen report no mortality benefit, including studies from China and elsewhere, which aligns with the larger trials [^111MBtwU] [^117RgoPV].

> Hold on, I should verify whether vitamin C monotherapy fares any better. The CITRIS-ALI trial in sepsis with ARDS reported lower 28-day mortality with high-dose vitamin C, but this was a secondary outcome and the primary SOFA endpoint was not met, so this cannot be used to recommend routine use [^111ZnEXk]. A multicenter vitamin C monotherapy RCT in septic shock did not meet its primary mortality endpoint and raised a safety concern with more RRT use in the vitamin C arm, which tempers enthusiasm for monotherapy as well [^115W4WA8]. Smaller monotherapy trials have generally been neutral for vasopressor duration and clinical outcomes, reinforcing the absence of a consistent benefit signal [^115k8Cdx].

> I will now examine meta-analyses and component network meta-analyses to see if pooled data change the picture. Meta-analyses consistently show that vitamin C, alone or in combination, improves delta SOFA modestly and shortens vasopressor duration by roughly 15–30 hours, but does not reduce short-term mortality, which is the patient-centered endpoint we care about most [^115bXB4c] [^115cXGvY]. Component network meta-analyses indicate no significant mortality reduction for vitamin C or thiamine, while glucocorticoids shorten vasopressor duration and ICU stay without a clear mortality benefit, and intriguingly suggest possible harm when thiamine is added to vitamin C and steroids, which I need to keep in mind [^113peqJK] [^114NYpVE] [^1156oip1].

> Wait, let me verify safety signals before concluding. Several trials and meta-analyses report more hypernatremia and hyperglycemia with the combination, and some monotherapy trials observed increased RRT use, although causality is uncertain and may reflect baseline severity or fluid practices rather than direct toxicity [^115jsrFK] [^115bXB4c] [^115W4WA8]. The LOVIT trial raised particular concern that high-dose vitamin C increased the risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days, a signal that shifted the risk-benefit discussion toward caution outside trials [^1148jzBF]. I should also remember theoretical risks like oxalate nephropathy, hemolysis in G6PD deficiency, and assay interference, even though clinical signals have been inconsistent and often context dependent [^113LibG9].

> But wait, what if timing, duration, or dose explain the null results. Observational and hypothesis-generating analyses suggest that very high-dose vitamin C or treatment for at least 5 days might associate with better outcomes in selected subgroups, yet these are not randomized comparisons and are vulnerable to confounding, so I should not over-interpret them [^114qf8f3] [^115GxPza]. Preclinical data and small physiologic studies hint that continuous infusion or very high bolus dosing could have different pharmacokinetics and effects, but large, rigorously designed trials testing these dimensions are still needed before changing practice [^113mFcNS] [^117TeEFp].

> Next, I should review current guideline positions to ensure my conclusions align with consensus. Contemporary sepsis guidance issues only a weak recommendation for hydrocortisone in septic shock, largely for faster shock resolution rather than mortality benefit, and does not recommend routine use of vitamin C or thiamine, reflecting the neutral mortality data and potential harms seen in recent trials [^113pHL7z] [^1148jzBF]. This supports a conservative stance pending stronger evidence.

> Let me synthesize the totality of evidence. High-quality RCTs show no consistent improvement in mortality or major patient-centered outcomes with vitamin C, alone or combined with hydrocortisone and thiamine, despite modest improvements in organ dysfunction scores and vasopressor duration. Safety concerns, particularly with high-dose regimens, further argue against routine adoption outside research settings [^1161RWTh] [^115UfHdb] [^115jsrFK] [^115bXB4c]. Hydrocortisone may still be considered for faster shock resolution in refractory cases, but vitamin C and thiamine should not be standard adjuncts based on current data [^113pHL7z].

> I should double-check pediatric implications because practice sometimes diverges. Pediatric pilot work suggests feasibility of early vitamin C plus hydrocortisone protocols, but these studies were not powered for clinical outcomes, and ongoing trials like RESPOND will clarify whether there is a pediatric-specific benefit signal. Until then, routine pediatric use is not supported by randomized evidence [^112SX6sK] [^111FXjsp] [^1121ozoo].

> In practical terms, I need to ensure we prioritize core sepsis care: rapid antibiotics, source control, appropriate fluids, and norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor, with hydrocortisone considered for refractory shock per guideline-directed practice. Vitamin C and thiamine should be reserved for clinical trials or carefully selected scenarios where potential thiamine deficiency is suspected, rather than used routinely [^113pHL7z] [^1148jzBF]. If a center is using vitamin C outside a trial, I should confirm dosing, duration, monitoring for hypernatremia and glucose effects, and awareness of assay interference, while acknowledging that the evidence base does not support mortality benefit and may suggest harm in some contexts [^115jsrFK] [^113LibG9] [^1148jzBF].

> Bottom line, after verifying the highest-quality trials and meta-analyses, I conclude that intravenous vitamin C, whether alone or combined with hydrocortisone and thiamine, does not improve survival or other key patient-centered outcomes in septic shock and should not be used routinely. Hydrocortisone may be used selectively to hasten shock resolution, but the addition of vitamin C and thiamine lacks supportive mortality evidence and carries potential safety concerns, so these agents should be limited to research protocols or exceptional, individualized circumstances pending further definitive trials [^1161RWTh] [^115UfHdb] [^115jsrFK] [^113peqJK].

---

Vitamin C and hydrocortisone are not recommended as routine adjuncts in septic shock because large, high-quality RCTs show **no mortality benefit** and only modest, inconsistent effects on vasopressor duration and organ dysfunction [^1161RWTh] [^115UfHdb] [^115jsrFK]. Hydrocortisone may be considered for refractory shock to **shorten vasopressor use**, but vitamin C should not be used outside trials due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^113peqJK] [^1148jzBF]. Current guidelines advise standard sepsis care with fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics; reserve hydrocortisone for refractory cases and avoid routine vitamin C.

## Clinical evidence for vitamin C and hydrocortisone in septic shock

### Vitamin C

- **VITAMINS trial**: No improvement in time alive and free of vasopressors vs hydrocortisone alone; no mortality benefit [^1161RWTh].
- **VICTAS trial**: No increase in ventilator- or vasopressor-free days; no mortality benefit [^115UfHdb].
- **ACTS trial**: No significant reduction in SOFA score or 30-day mortality vs placebo [^115jsrFK].
- **LOVIT trial**: Higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction with high-dose vitamin C vs placebo [^1148jzBF].

---

### Hydrocortisone

- **ADRENAL trial**: Reduced vasopressor duration and ICU stay; no mortality benefit.
- **APROCCHSS trial**: Reduced 90-day mortality with hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone vs placebo.
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistent reduction in vasopressor duration; mortality benefit is modest and inconsistent [^113peqJK].

---

## Mechanisms of action

### Vitamin C

Vitamin C provides **antioxidant effects** that reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, supports **catecholamine synthesis** as a cofactor for norepinephrine and vasopressin, and enhances **immune function** through improved neutrophil and lymphocyte activity.

---

### Hydrocortisone

Hydrocortisone exerts **anti-inflammatory effects** by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines and stabilizing the endothelium, and it has **hemodynamic effects** — improving vascular tone and catecholamine responsiveness — and may have **immunomodulatory effects** that reduce dysregulated inflammation.

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

| **Outcome** | **Vitamin c** | **Hydrocortisone** |
|-|-|-|
| Mortality | No consistent benefit [^1161RWTh] [^115UfHdb] | Modest, inconsistent benefit [^113pHL7z] |
| Vasopressor duration | Modest, inconsistent reduction [^115bXB4c] | Consistent reduction [^113peqJK] |
| Organ dysfunction | Modest, inconsistent improvement [^115cXGvY] | Consistent improvement [^notfound] |
| ICU length of stay | No consistent benefit [^113peqJK] | Consistent reduction [^113peqJK] |

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

### Vitamin C

- **Hypernatremia**: Increased risk, especially with high doses.
- **Oxalate nephropathy**: Rare but serious risk with prolonged high-dose use.
- **Glucose monitoring interference**: False elevations with certain glucometers.

---

### Hydrocortisone

- **Hyperglycemia**: Common, requiring insulin management.
- **Immunosuppression**: Increased infection risk.
- **Muscle weakness**: Particularly with prolonged use.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **standard care** — early antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors — as the foundation of septic shock management. Hydrocortisone may be considered for refractory shock to reduce vasopressor requirements, whereas **vitamin C is not recommended** outside clinical trials due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^1148jzBF].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and future research

Ongoing trials are evaluating **higher vitamin C doses**, prolonged duration, and earlier initiation, as well as **patient selection** using biomarkers or phenotypes to identify responders. Future research should prioritize **large, multicenter RCTs** with clear endpoints and standardized protocols.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Vitamin C and hydrocortisone are **not recommended as routine adjuncts** in septic shock. Hydrocortisone may be used for refractory shock to reduce vasopressor needs, but vitamin C should be limited to trials given the lack of benefit and potential harm. Management should continue to focus on **early antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors**, with steroids reserved for refractory cases.

### Intravenous vitamin C administration to patients with septic shock: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^115k8Cdx]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous vitamin C administration in septic shock may have a sparing effect on vasopressor requirements, and vitamin C's enzyme cofactor functions provide a mechanistic rationale. Our study aimed to determine the effect of intravenous vitamin C administration on vasopressor requirements and other outcomes in patients with septic shock.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial in 40 patients with septic shock who were randomised (1:1) to receive intravenous vitamin C (at a dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight every 6 h) or placebo (intravenous 5% dextrose) for up to 96 h, or until death or discharge. The primary outcome was intravenous vasopressor requirements (dose and duration), and secondary outcomes included Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and mortality. In addition, blood samples were collected to determine vitamin C kinetics and inflammatory marker concentrations.

Results

Median plasma vitamin C concentrations were deficient at baseline (9.2 [4.4, 12] µmol/L) and increased to 408 (227, 560) µmol/L following 72 h of intervention. The mean duration of intravenous vasopressor infusion in the vitamin C group was 48 (95% CI 35–62) hours and in the placebo group was 54 (95% CI 41–62) hours (p = 0.52). The dose of vasopressor delivered over time was comparable between the two groups, as were SOFA scores (p > 0.05). The median ICU length of stay in the intervention group was 3.8 (2.2, 9.8) days versus 7.1 (3.1, 20) days in the placebo group (p = 0.12). The median hospital length of stay for the vitamin C group was 18 (11, 35) days versus 22 (10, 52) days for the placebo group (p = 0.65). Mortality was comparable between the two groups (p > 0.05). Of the inflammatory markers, neutrophil counts were elevated in the vitamin C group relative to placebo by 72 h (p = 0.01). C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase concentrations were elevated at baseline, however, the two groups were comparable over time (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Our pilot study indicated that intravenous vitamin C did not provide significant decreases in the mean dose or duration of vasopressor infusion. Further research that takes into account the potential impact of intervention timing, dose and duration, and location of trial, may provide more definitive evidence.

### Effects of thiamine on vasopressor requirements in patients with septic shock: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^115Cbjs8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths of our study. First, the design of this study used double blind randomization in that we blinded both the patients and investigators to reduce selection bias. Second, we included patients early and limited the time to randomization. Third, this trial measured thiamine levels at the time of randomization before administering the intervention, which showed a background of thiamine levels in our population with septic shock.

Our study did have limitations. First, it had a small sample size and an early stopping point and was insufficiently powered; this limited validity of the results may have led to selection bias. Moreover, the risk of type I and II errors should be taken into consideration and the results of post hoc analyses should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of thiamine on vasopressor requirements. Second, we did not compare differing dosage levels of thiamine. The dosage of thiamine in our study was 200 mg IV every 12 h for 7 days, which was different from that in a study by Woolum JA. et al. in that nearly two-thirds of their thiamine group received high doses of thiamine (500 mg IV) every 8 h for 3 days. In their study, it was found that such levels could decrease mortality. Higher thiamine doses may offer the advantage of improved, passive absorption into the CNS along with improvements in thiamine exposure due to the rapid elimination of thiamine from the serum into urine. Additionally, we did not perform analyses or control the effects of volume resuscitation and other drugs in the septic shock cocktails, consisting of thiamine, hydrocortisone and vitamin C. In our study, more than 60% of the patients from both groups received hydrocortisone, which has potent effects on resolution of shock, and the patient characteristics were severe, similar to the study by Fujii and colleagues in that hydrocortisone might mask the effects of thiamine.

### Early administration of vitamin C in patients with sepsis or septic shock in emergency departments: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial: the C-EASIE trial [^114T55Q6]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The data and safety monitoring board reviewed the results after a planned blinded interim analysis for sample size recalculation (after 203 patients had completed follow-up for the primary outcome). The power level was at least 80% with the observed values, resulting in an unaltered sample size.

In accordance with the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle, the full analysis set (FAS) contained all randomized patients according to their randomized treatment. However, some randomized patients who did not receive any medication were excluded from the FAS, as decided during the Blind Review Meeting. Patients from the FAS with substantial protocol deviations (7 h or more between hospital admission and first administration of study medication, 2 or more successive doses missed, all planned doses missing on the first day) were excluded from the per protocol set (PPS). Both FAS and PPS were used for the evaluation of all efficacy endpoints. Only the FAS was used for the evaluation the safety endpoints.

Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome according to baseline SOFA and NEWS score were prespecified in the FAS. The aim was to investigate whether there was a distinct treatment effect across patients with mild organ dysfunction and patients with moderate to severe organ dysfunction. For the baseline SOFA score, subgroups were initially defined as SOFA < 8 vs SOFA ≥ 8. However, based on interim blinded descriptive data, the members of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) deemed there would be too few patients in the SOFA ≥ 8 group when using a cutoff equal to 8. Therefore, the cut off was changed to SOFA < 6 vs SOFA ≥ 6 in the SAP (Statistical Analysis Plan: see Supplementary Material file 6).

A cLDA model was used to compare the average SOFA score (D2–D5) between both groups based on a two-sided test with α = 5% (Supplementary Material file 3). Due to the right-skewed distribution of the SOFA score, a transformation was applied on the SOFA values yielding a ratio when the difference between groups was back transformed.

Linear models, Kaplan–Meier estimates, competing risks methodology, generalised linear mixed models were used for the comparison of the secondary outcomes (Supplementary Material file 3).

### Ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine in sepsis: a review of the biologic rationale and the present state of clinical evaluation [^116SnmmP]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone has recently emerged as a potential adjunctive therapy to antibiotics, infectious source control, and supportive care for patients with sepsis and septic shock. In the present manuscript, we provide a comprehensive review of the pathophysiologic basis and supporting research for each element of the thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone drug combination in sepsis. In addition, we describe potential areas of synergy between these therapies and discuss the strengths/weaknesses of the two studies to date which have evaluated the drug combination in patients with severe infection. Finally, we describe the current state of current clinical practice as it relates to the thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone combination and present an overview of the randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center Ascorbic acid, Corticosteroids, and Thiamine in Sepsis (ACTS) trial and other planned/ongoing randomized clinical trials.

### The outcome of IV vitamin C therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115ieC2m]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The outcome analysis revealed IVVC in sepsis or septic shock patients was not associated with improved short-term mortality. In addition, the conclusion could be reached without incorporating additional RCTs based on the result of TSA. There was no statistically difference between IVVC combination therapy and monotherapy. The outcome was contrary to the study of Marik et al. which suggested that combined treatment could decrease hospital mortality.

Triple therapy of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine has biological rationality in sepsis; however, our outcome was insignificant in contrast with studies which concluded that coadministration offered acceptable outcomes in sepsis or septic shock patients. On the other hand, several large RCTs of vitamin C in sepsis or septic shock did not produce a remarkable reduction in mortality. Despite the large multicenter trial of VITAMINS, there was a concern about the time of combined therapy initiation. Individual trial of combination treatment had shown a decrease in 28-day mortality in the prespecified subgroup of sepsis patients within 48 h speculate that administering vitamin C as soon as possible may be meaningful. However, this result has not been replicated. As sepsis is a very time-sensitive disease, earlier intervention is associated with better outcomes. It is possible that a shorter time from ICU admission or vasopressor initiation to intervention may have improved outcomes. However, there are only 9 RCTs presenting time to intervention initiation in our meta-analysis, resulting in difficulty in judgement the effect of initiation time. Recent meta-analyses also failed to find improved mortality among patients with sepsis, no matter combined therapy or monotherapy. Different inclusion criterion, duration, patient populations and timing of administration explain the heterogeneity of different research results to some extent.

### Vitamin C for ≥ 5 days is associated with decreased hospital mortality in sepsis subgroups: a nationwide cohort study [^115GxPza]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous randomized trials of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine on sepsis were limited by short-term vitamin C administration, heterogeneous populations, and the failure to evaluate each component's effect. The purpose of this study was to determine whether vitamin C alone for ≥ 5 days or in combination with corticosteroids and/or thiamine was associated with decreased mortality across the sepsis population and subpopulation.

Methods

Nationwide population-based study conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. A total of 384,282 adult patients with sepsis who were admitted to the intensive care unit were enrolled from January 2017 to December 2019. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, while the key secondary outcome was 90-day mortality.

Results

The mean [standard deviation] age was 69.0 [15.4] years; 57% were male; and 36,327 (9%) and 347,955 did and did not receive vitamin C, respectively. After propensity score matching, each group involved 36,327 patients. The hospital mortality was lower by - 0.9% in the treatment group (17.1% vs 18.0%; 95% confidence interval, - 1.3 to - 0.5%; p < 0.001), a significant but extremely small difference. However, mortality decreased greater in patients who received vitamin C for ≥ 5 days (vs 1–2 or 3–4 days) (15.8% vs 18.8% vs 18.3%; p < 0.001). Further, vitamin C was associated with a lower hospital mortality in patients with older age, multiple comorbidities, pneumonia, genitourinary infection, septic shock, and mechanical ventilation. Consistent findings were found for 90-day mortality. Moreover, vitamin C alone or in combination with thiamine was significantly associated with decreased hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Intravenous vitamin C of ≥ 5 days was significantly associated with decreased hospital and 90-day mortality in sepsis patients. Vitamin C combined with corticosteroids and/or thiamine in specific sepsis subgroups warrants further study.

### Vitamin C for ≥ 5 days is associated with decreased hospital mortality in sepsis subgroups: a nationwide cohort study [^114qf8f3]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life-threating organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Importantly, sepsis results in more than 5 million deaths globally each year, thus making it a major public health concern. Accordingly, novel therapeutic interventions for sepsis have been explored over the last several decades. However, these have demonstrated inconsistent benefits.

Vitamin C downregulates proinflammatory cytokines; maintains the endothelial barrier; and facilitates the production of catecholamines, vasopressin, and cortisol. A recent retrospective study showed that the combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine has a substantial survival benefit in patients with sepsis. As such, numerous randomized trials of vitamin C alone or in combination with hydrocortisone and thiamine for sepsis have been conducted, although neither treatment was associated with significantly improved outcomes. However, these trials had insufficient power for detecting differences in mortality and limited the use of vitamin C to a maximum of 4 days. Low-dose corticosteroids have been shown to reverse septic shock, although the use of hydrocortisone was not controlled in most of these trials. A recent network meta-analysis evaluated larger samples to estimate the effect of vitamin C, corticosteroids, and thiamine alone or in combination on mortality and other outcomes. However, this analysis did not assess the treatment duration and may be limited by heterogeneity of the published studies.

To address current knowledge gaps, this study aimed to investigate whether vitamin C for ≥ 5 days was associated with improved hospital mortality across populations with sepsis. Toward this goal, data using the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database were analyzed. Various subgroup analyses were also performed to analyze mortality differences according to sepsis subpopulation and combination with corticosteroids and/or thiamine.

### Reply to yoshihiro and taito: true effect of fludrocortisone for septic shock: baseline risk and transitivity concerns [^1113ASMp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We wish to respond to the thoughtful letter submitted by Yoshihiro and Taito, describing additional considerations for interpretation of our paper. In their letter, the authors suggest including studies in our network analysis that examined the coadministration of vitamin C with hydrocortisone. To the best of our knowledge, two studies have examined the effects of vitamin C alongside hydrocortisone in septic shock. The VITAMINS trial (Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone and Thiamine in Patients with Septic Shock Trial) referenced by Yoshihiro and Taito was a multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial comparing coadministration of hydrocortisone with vitamin C and thiamine with hydrocortisone alone. Without the inclusion of a placebo or fludrocortisone-hydrocortisone arm, this trial does not permit comparison of the effects of hydrocortisone alone on mortality in sepsis and, as a result, does not meet our inclusion criteria. The VICTAS (Vitamin C, Thiamine, and Steroids in Sepsis) trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating hydrocortisone combined with vitamin C and thiamine versus placebo. Although this trial includes a placebo arm, including bundled treatments (i.e. vitamin C and thiamine) in our analysis is also inappropriate because it is impossible to ascribe a treatment effect to any one part of the treatment bundle. Inclusion of studies such as the APPROCCHSS (Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock) trial is appropriate because randomization using a 2 × 2 design allowed us to compare the effects of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone with placebo directly. Because neither of the vitamin C trials included comparisons of interest that could be isolated from other treatments, we stand by the decision to exclude these studies from our analysis.

Recruitment, Randomization, and Flow of Participants in the VICTAS Study

a Participants could meet multiple criteria; thus, exclusions were not mutually exclusive.

The final sample included 213 participants, of whom 108 were randomized to the intervention group and 105 were randomized to the control group. The characteristics of the included participants are described in Table 1 and eTable 1 in Supplement 1, along with participants who died and those for whom outcomes were unavailable (eg, due to withdrawal or loss to follow-up). The included participants had a median (IQR) age of 57 (47–67) years and comprised 101 females (47.4%) and 112 males (52.6%). Data were reported by participant representatives only in 39 cases (18.3%). The intervention and control groups had comparable characteristics (Table 2) except that the intervention group included more White participants than the control group (72 [66.7%] vs 57 [54.3%]). One hundred fifty-seven participants (73.7%) in the follow-up cohort, 72 (68.6%) in the control group, and 85 (78.7%) in the intervention group received parenteral norepinephrine. Sixty-six patients (31.0%) in the follow-up cohort (32 patients [30.5%] from the control group and 34 [31.5%] from the intervention group) received open-label corticosteriods while in the ICU.

Primary outcome

In the ITT population, the primary outcome of 90-day mortality was 40.4% (86/213) and 39.0% (83/213) in the intervention and the placebo groups, respectively, and was not significantly different (P = 0.77) (Table 3). In addition, the Kaplan–Meier survival curve demonstrated that the 90-day survival was not significantly different between the two groups (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.80–1.46; P = 0.62) (Fig. 2).

Component NMA was performed for the networks where the effects of vitC (very high dose), vitC (high dose), vitC, glucocorticoid, and vitB1 were available separately. None of the components was shown to reduce mortality at the longest follow-up or SOFA score (Table 1). However, the addition of vitC (very high dose) was associated with decreased mortality in studies published in 2010 or after (iOR, 0.5 [95% CI 0.27–0.92]). In contrast, with the addition of vitB1, the iOR for the mortality was 1.63 (95% CI 1.03–2.58) (Table 1). For secondary outcomes, component NMA demonstrated a decrease in the mean duration of vasopressor therapy of − 29.8 h (95% CI − 44.1 to − 15.5) and a decrease in mean ICU length of stay of − 1.3 days (95% CI − 2.2 to − 0.3) when glucocorticoid therapy was added (Table 1).

a 95% confidence intervals or 95% prediction intervals do not cross null effect (1 for iOR/iROM, 0 for i(S)MD). In the model of component NMA, adding a component x to an intervention A (which includes components other than x) leads to an increase of the effects of the intervention A that will only depend on x, but not on the other components included in A. For the case of a binary outcome (e.g. death), this model estimates component-specific iOR, defined as the odds ratio between interventions (A + x) and A. Likewise, for continuous outcomes (e.g. organ dysfunction, duration of vasopressor therapy, and ICU length of stay), the model estimates component-specific iSMDs, iMDs, or iROMs defined as the difference or ratio between interventions (A + x) and A

### The outcome of IV vitamin C therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114ZziBf]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated host response to infection, and septic shock is a type of sepsis with a higher risk of mortality. This disorder contributes to 11 million deaths worldwide every year, which is considered as a primary health threat by the World Health Organization. Despite significant advances in sepsis, no other treatment beyond basic therapy such as source of infection control, fluid resuscitation and vasoactive drugs has sufficient evidence to support to improve mortality, and sepsis survivors often suffer from residual organ injury. Consequently, it is very necessary to find effective, safe and economical adjuvant treatments to reduce mortality and financial burden for sepsis.

Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant drug and a cofactor in the production of numerous biosynthetic enzymes needed for the survival of shock, which participates in the synthesis of intrinsic vasopressin and norepinephrine. Vitamin C cannot be synthesized by the human, and the levels are low in many critically ill patients. As a readily available, inexpensive and few side effects of treatment option, vitamin C supplementation during sepsis has specifically gained increasing interest for years. Early studies confirmed IV vitamin C (IVVC) is associated with decreased inflammatory response and ameliorated outcomes in sepsis. In addition, favorable outcomes in the vitamin C group were reported in some meta-analyses. However, the available evidence remains inconsistent. In another recent meta-analysis, it was reported that IVVC suggested no efficacy in sepsis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign of 2021: International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock suggest IVVC for patients with sepsis or septic shock was not recommended, only as a weak recommendation according to the low quality of evidence. Although systematic reviews and meta-analyses discussing IVVC in patients with sepsis were recently published, these studies did not include the newer randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a larger population of patients to provide better evidence.

Because of increasing updated trials and inconsistent results in many studies, it is essential to reassess the present evidence about the efficacy and safety of IVVC in sepsis or septic shock patients. The purpose of this meta-analysis of RCTs is to research the impact of IVVC in sepsis patients and carry out subgroup analyses to further explore the efficacy of IVVC with different dose, type of therapy, duration and patient populations.

### Is the VITAMINS RCT indicating potential redundancy between corticosteroids and vitamin C? [^114QV3ZC]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Since the publication of the retrospective before and after study by Dr. Marik and colleagues, in which administration of hydrocortisone, intravenous (IV) vitamin C, and thiamine was indicated to provide a survival advantage in septic patients, there has been a prevalence of clinical trials of variable quality and subsequent meta-analyses indicating variable outcomes. Unlike previous combination trials, which did not control for corticosteroid use in the control arm, the recently published VITAMINS randomized clinical trial standardized corticosteroid administration in the control arm to determine if IV vitamin C and thiamine could provide an additional survival advantage over hydrocortisone alone. This trial showed no benefit of the combination of hydrocortisone, IV vitamin C, and thiamine in comparison to hydrocortisone alone.

Although the accompanying editorial by Dr. Kalil suggested that in light of this finding, IV vitamin C has no place in critical care, limitations of the VITAMINS trial preclude this view. It is well established that septic patients exhibit a high prevalence of vitamin C deficiency, and a recently published clinical trial in JAMA indicated that IV vitamin C may provide a survival advantage in these patients. Since the VITAMINS trial did not include an arm with IV vitamin C monotherapy, this trial does not provide any information as to whether IV vitamin C is of benefit to septic patients in the absence of corticosteroid administration. This trial simply indicated that short-term IV vitamin C administration (mean of 3.4 days) may not be of additional benefit if corticosteroids are being administered to the patients. However, routine corticosteroid administration to septic patients is not a common clinical practice in all intensive care units.

Indeed, the VITAMINS trial may in fact indicate redundancy between vitamin C and corticosteroids. Vitamin C is thought to play a role in the stress response as evidenced by its very high concentrations in the adrenal glands and its release in response to ACTH. Furthermore, animals that cannot synthesize vitamin C have significantly elevated cortisol release in response to stress compared with animals that can synthesize vitamin C endogenously (reviewed in). Thus, administration of corticosteroids to septic patients may help compensate for deficient vitamin C concentrations in these patients. Alternatively, in the absence of corticosteroid administration, supplementation of deficient patients with vitamin C may help with their stress response and could potentially provide a survival advantage, particularly in patients with HPA axis dysregulation.

### Early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine in adult patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^112bbm7C]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection

The following information was collected and analyzed for every enrolled patient: age, sex, locale before ICU admission (ED/general ward), chronic medical histories (hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and malignancy), primary site of infection, laboratory results (complete blood count, coagulation profile, arterial blood gas analysis, blood biochemistry), LOS prior to randomization, time from diagnosis of septic shock to randomization, time from randomization to first study drug administration, time from randomization to first antibiotic administration, proportion of antibiotic administration before randomization, appropriateness of antimicrobials, open-label corticosteroid administration, amount of fluid administered before vasopressor, ventilator support (invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula), and renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirements. Blood culture and cultures of specimens from the site of infection were routinely performed. Disease severity was assessed by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and SOFA scores.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at day 90 after randomization. The key secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at day 28, ICU discharge, and hospital discharge. Additional secondary outcomes included shock reversal rate; time to shock reversal; 72-h delta SOFA score; ICU-free days, vasopressor-free days and ventilator support-free days up to day 28 (patients who died before day 28 were assigned zero free days); ICU length of stay (LOS) and hospital LOS. The 90-day mortality and 28-day mortality were assessed by review of the medical records of the participant, or by contacting the participant by phone.

### Evaluating vitamin C in septic shock: a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C monotherapy [^115W4WA8]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether IV vitamin C therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock.

Design

Multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

One academic medical ICU and four community ICUs.

Patients

Of 167 adult patients within 24 hours of vasopressor initiation for septic shock, 126 consented to participation, and 124 received study drug and were included in analysis.

Interventions

IV vitamin C (10mg/mL in normal saline) administered as a 1,000-mg bolus over 30 minutes followed by continuous infusion of 250mg/hr for 96 hours or placebo of equal volumes of normal saline.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 124 subjects receiving study drug and included in analysis, 60 received vitamin C and 64 placebo. The primary outcome of all-cause 28-day mortality (vitamin C, 26.7%; placebo, 40.6%; p = 0.10) was lower in the vitamin C arm but did not reach statistical significance. Initiation of renal replacement therapy was higher in the vitamin C arm (vitamin C, 16.7%; placebo, 3.3%; p = 0.015), as was volume of fluid administration within 6 hours of study drug initiation (vitamin C, 1.07L; placebo, 0.76L; p = 0.03). There were no statistically significant differences in other secondary outcomes. In post hoc subgroup analysis, there was a decrease in 28-day mortality in the vitamin C arm among patients requiring positive-pressure ventilation at the time of enrollment (vitamin C, 36.3%; placebo, 60.0%; p = 0.05). This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT03338569.

Conclusions

Vitamin C monotherapy failed to significantly reduce mortality in septic shock patients as hypothesized. Our findings do not support its routine clinical use for this purpose.

### Resuscitation in paediatric septic shock using vitamin C and hydrocortisone (RESPOND): the RESPOND randomized controlled trial protocol [^111FXjsp]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pediatric sepsis results in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is an urgent need to investigate adjunctive therapies that can be administered early. We hypothesize that using vitamin C combined with hydrocortisone increases survival free of inotropes/vasopressors support until day 7 compared with standard care. Here we describe the Resuscitation in Paediatric Septic Shock using Vitamin C and Hydrocortisone (RESPOND) trial protocol, which aims to address this hypothesis.

Design

Randomized, open label, controlled, parallel-group, three-arm trial with integrated economic evaluation.

Setting

Nine Australia and New Zealand PICUs, with interest from additional international sites.

Patients

Children between 7 days and younger than 18 years old who are treated for suspected or confirmed sepsis and receiving inotropes/vasopressors for greater than 1 hour.

Interventions

IV vitamin C (100mg/kg [maximum 5 g] every 6hr) and hydrocortisone (1mg/kg [maximum 50 mg] every 6hr), or IV hydrocortisone alone (1mg/kg [maximum 50 mg] every 6hr) or standard care.

Measurements and Main Results

Three hundred eighty-four children will be randomly assigned to receive the interventions, or standard care in a 1:1:1 ratio with stratification by steroid administration pre-randomization and hospital site. The primary outcome is time alive and free of inotropes/vasopressors, censored at 7 days. Secondary outcomes include 28-day mortality, survival free of organ support, PICU length of stay, quality of life, functional status and neurodevelopmental vulnerability at 6 months post-enrollment, and hospitalization-related costs. Statistical analysis will be based on an intention-to-treat principle. The study has ethical approval (HREC/20/QCHQ/69922, dated December 21, 2020), is registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12621000247875), commenced recruitment on December 8, 2021, and is expected to finish recruitment by mid-2026.

Conclusions

Dissemination of the results will occur through publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at international conferences, and additional consumer-informed pathways.

### Early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine in adult patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^111MBtwU]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The combination therapy of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine has been proposed as a potential treatment in patients with sepsis and septic shock. However, subsequent trials have reported conflicting results in relation to survival outcomes. Hence, we performed this randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early combination therapy among adult patients with septic shock.

Methods

This single-center, double-blind RCT enrolled adult patients with diagnosis of septic shock within 12 h from Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital between February 2019 and June 2021. Recruited patients were randomized 1:1 to receive intervention (hydrocortisone 200 mg daily, vitamin C 2 g every 6 h, and thiamine 200 mg every 12 h) or placebo (0.9% saline) for 5 days or until ICU discharge. The primary endpoint was 90-day mortality. The secondary endpoints included mortality at day 28, ICU discharge, and hospital discharge; shock reversal; 72-h Delta SOFA score; ICU-free days, vasopressor-free days, and ventilator support -free days up to day 28; ICU length of stay (LOS) and hospital LOS.

Results

Among 426 patients randomized, a total of 408 patients with septic shock were included in the per-protocol (PP) analysis, of which 203 were assigned to the intervention group and 205 to the placebo group. In the PP population, the primary outcome of 90-day mortality was 39.9% (81/203) and 39.0% (80/205) in the intervention and the placebo groups, respectively, and was not significantly different (P = 0.86). There was no significant difference between two groups in 28-day mortality (36.5% vs. 36.1%, P = 0.94) or the ICU mortality (31.5% vs. 28.8%, P = 0.55) and hospital mortality (34.5% vs. 33.2%, P = 0.78). No other secondary outcomes showed significant differences between two groups, including shock reversal, vasopressor-free days, and ICU LOS. Intention-to-treat analysis included all the 426 patients and confirmed these results (all P > 0.05).

Conclusion

Among adult patients with septic shock, early use of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine combination therapy compared with placebo did not confer survival benefits. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03872011, registration date: March 12, 2019.

### Ascorbate-dependent vasopressor synthesis: a rationale for vitamin C administration in severe sepsis and septic shock? [^111gXvna]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Ascorbate enhances the synthesis of the vasopressors norepinephrine and vasopressin by acting as a cofactor for their respective biosynthetic enzymes. As such, we hypothesise that administration of high-dose ascorbate in conditions of hypovitaminosis C (e.g. severe sepsis and septic shock) may support the endogenous synthesis of these vasoactive compounds and thus ameliorate the need for exogenously administered vasopressors. Ascorbate-dependent vasopressor synthesis represents a plausible physiological mechanism whereby ascorbate could act as an adjuvant therapy for severe sepsis and septic shock. Whether this mechanism translates into improved patient outcomes requires testing in well-designed clinical trials.

### Evaluating vitamin C in septic shock: a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C monotherapy [^111DFRki]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sample Size

Based on a prior retrospective study showing a greater than 30% mortality reduction (risk difference) with vitamin C therapy, we anticipated at least a 20% reduction in absolute mortality between the groups at 28 days. Institutional data from participating centers suggested historical mortality rates for septic shock of approximately 30%. Using this baseline mortality rate and employing a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, we calculated that 124 subjects (an average of 62 per group) would be needed to detect a 20% decrease in absolute mortality with 80% power.

Randomization and Blinding

Participants, their families, study staff, and treatment teams were all blinded to group allocation. Site stratified randomization strategy and criteria for unblinding are given in the Supplemental Methods section.

Data Collection and Statistical Analysis

Analysis was performed based on intention to treat. For categorical values, statistical significance was assessed using a chi-square test or Fisher exact test. For continuous variables, the median test was used. Full details of data collection, statistical analysis, and subgroup analyses are provided in the Supplemental Methods section.

Oversight and Data Availability

This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Minnesota, as well as the institutional review boards pertaining to each individual study site (Table S1). An independent data and safety monitoring board consisting of two intensive care physicians and one statistician who were not otherwise involved with the study met at least every 6 months and oversaw study activities. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under identifier NCT03338569. Full details of plans for data sharing can be found in the Supplemental Methods section.

### Adjuvant vitamin C for sepsis: mono or triple? [^117LWTfC]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Thiamine levels are reduced in 20–70% of the septic patients due to increased metabolic consumption, decreased intake, and increased loss. Low thiamine status in critically ill patients is associated with worse outcome. Deficiency reduces the activity of thiamine-dependent enzymes, linked to (mitochondrial) energy production (aerobic glycolysis, Krebs cycle) and maintenance of NADPH (pentose phosphate pathway). Deficiency promotes the production of lactate and hampers the production of ATP. NADPH is essential for the maintenance of cellular pH. Thiamine is also cofactor in the production of glucose-derived neurotransmitters and of acetylcholine and myelin, thereby maintaining neuronal activity. The main role of non-phosphorylated thiamine is being an antioxidant. Furthermore, adequate thiamine status stimulates the conversion of glyoxylate into glycine instead of oxalate. This reduces the risk of oxalate nephropathy due to high-dose vitamin C. The only human RCT with thiamine (200 mg/12 h) in septic shock had no impact on mortality, but post hoc analysis showed improvement of renal function with thiamine.

Hydrocortisone and vitamin C have several functions in common, including attenuation of nuclear factor-κB activation and subsequent generation of pro-inflammatory mediators with improvement of the endothelial barrier and microcirculatory patency. Both are necessary for the synthesis of catecholamines and improve vasopressor sensitivity. During sepsis, high amounts of ROS hamper glucocorticoid binding to its receptor and the cellular uptake of vitamin C by the sodium-vitamin C transporter2 (SVCT2). Synergy is therefore possible: vitamin C can restore glucocorticoid receptor function, and glucocorticoids can increase expression of the vitamin SVCT2 transporter. In vitro, the combination showed a superior barrier-protective effect after lipopolysaccharide exposure compared to either agent alone.

In line with the study of Marik et al. two other small retrospective studies in patients with septic shock and severe pneumonia showed reduced mortality with HAT-therapy, whereas another retrospective study in septic shock did not. Large RCTs are currently being performed.

So, the CITRIS-ALI results support a potential role for adjuvant high-dose i.v. vitamin C for sepsis. Large RCTs are under way to confirm these results. Whether HAT-therapy induces additional beneficial effect when vitamin C is dosed sufficiently high remains to be demonstrated, although hydrocortisone and thiamine are certainly indicated in specific patient groups.

### Effect of adjunctive vitamin C, glucocorticoids, and vitamin B1 on longer-term mortality in adults with sepsis or septic shock: a systematic review and a component network meta-analysis [^113peqJK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We aimed to compare the effects of vitamin C, glucocorticoids, vitamin B1, combinations of these drugs, and placebo or usual care on longer-term mortality in adults with sepsis or septic shock. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP were searched. The final search was carried out on September 3rd, 2021. Multiple reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing very-high-dose vitamin C (≥ 12 g/day), high-dose vitamin C (< 12, ≥ 6 g/day), vitamin C (< 6 g/day), glucocorticoid (< 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone), vitamin B1, combinations of these drugs, and placebo/usual care. We performed random-effects network meta-analysis and, where applicable, a random-effects component network meta-analysis. We used the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis framework to assess the degree of treatment effect certainty. The primary outcome was longer-term mortality (90-days to 1-year). Secondary outcomes were severity of organ dysfunction over 72 h, time to cessation of vasopressor therapy, and length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU). Forty-three RCTs (10,257 patients) were eligible. There were no significant differences in longer-term mortality between treatments and placebo/usual care or between treatments (10 RCTs, 7,096 patients, moderate to very-low-certainty). We did not find any evidence that vitamin C or B1 affect organ dysfunction or ICU length of stay. Adding glucocorticoid to other treatments shortened duration of vasopressor therapy (incremental mean difference, -29.8 h [95% CI -44.1 to -15.5]) and ICU stay (incremental mean difference, -1.3 days [95% CI -2.2 to -0.3]). Metabolic resuscitation with vitamin C, glucocorticoids, vitamin B1, or combinations of these drugs was not significantly associated with a decrease in longer-term mortality.

### Resuscitation in paediatric septic shock using vitamin C and hydrocortisone (RESPOND): the RESPOND randomized controlled trial protocol [^112x3yKY]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions

All eligible children will undergo standard initial shock management including fluids and a first IV inotrope/vasopressor as per institutional practice and be randomized to one of three treatment arms (Table 2). Regardless of whether full study treatment is continued or not, the follow-up schedule will continue unchanged for all randomized participants.

TABLE 2.
Study Interventions

The drug protocol for the RESPOND trial was changed from the previously published adult metabolic resuscitation protocol and our pilot study. Informed by component network analyses indicating a dose-response relationship, this study uses a higher vitamin C dose compared with most published adult trials. The dosing of 100 mg/kg/dose (maximum 20 g/d, 30 mg/kg/dose/every 6 hr for 7 d used in RESPOND pilot) for vitamin C was informed by the safety data from our systematic review. Thiamine that was part of the pilot study protocol has been removed for this trial because of the signal for potential associated harm in the component network meta-analysis.

The ANZ sites will use a sodium ascorbate formulation provided by Biological Therapies (Braeside, VIC, Australia). The same product will be used in international sites if approved by the respective regulatory bodies. Sites in India will use locally sourced ascorbic acid due to the drug import restrictions. Locally available hydrocortisone product formulations will be used.

Treatment Duration

Study treatments will be discontinued after shock resolution — defined as cessation of inotropes/vasopressors for at least 4 hours — or after a maximum of 72 hours. Attending clinicians are allowed to wean hydrocortisone as per individual PICU practice. We chose this duration of therapy as the severity of pediatric shock and associated metabolic perturbations is highest during the initial 72 hours and given that side-effects related to treatments may increase with prolonged treatment. All other care is provided at the discretion of the treating attending physician.

### Early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine in adult patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^114mUhXM]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

We determined that a population of 406 patients (203 patients in each group) would provide the trial with 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 15 percentage points (a conservative estimate based on about 32% benefit observed in the study by Marik et al.) in 90-day all-cause mortality from an estimated baseline mortality of 40%, at an alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a dropout rate of 5%, the sample size was calculated as 426 patients.

Due to the fact that most of our data were not normally distributed, which was proved by Shapiro–Wilk test and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we presented the data as median with interquartile range (IQR) for numerical data and numbers with percentages for categorical data. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. Patient survival time was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, with results reported as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and presented using Kaplan–Meier curves with a log-rank test for comparison. Proportional hazards assumptions were confirmed by Schoenfeld residuals.

Post hoc subgroup analysis for the primary outcome was performed on four subgroups determined from baseline variables, namely abdominal cavity infection, APACHE II score, age and LOS prior to randomization, with the latter three subgroups created by splitting each variable at the median level to create high and low subgroups. Every factor in subgroup analyses was analyzed with rates of the primary endpoint by testing the treatment by factor interaction with the use of Cox models.

For patients lost to follow-up, a "last status carried forward" approach would be used. And the sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were chosen to model "Worst–Best" and "Best–Worst" scenarios: (1) Only patients lost to follow-up in the intervention group were considered to be dead; (2) only patients lost to follow-up in the placebo group were considered to be dead. Moreover, we performed the sensitivity analyses of 72-h SOFA scores to model "worst-possible" and "best-possible" scenarios: (1) The worst-possible SOFA score (score of 24) was imputed for those participants who discharged within 72 h; (2) only those patients who survive 72 h were included (Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.0.

### Resuscitation with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin in children with septic shock: a multicenter randomized pilot study [^1162umTa]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Relationship to Previous Studies

In adults, a major controversy has surrounded high-dose vitamin C, thiamin, and hydrocortisone treatment following conflicting results of recent RCTs. Initial promising reports had led to the adoption of HAT in many international adult and pediatric ICUs. The latest data provide additional controversy to redesign trials on vitamin C in sepsis. First, an ovine sepsis model demonstrated dramatic improvements in cardiac output, blood pressure, and renal perfusion, reduced fever, lower inotrope requirement, and restored urine output and hyperlactatemia after treatment with much higher (> 1 g/kg) vitamin C doses than applied in the published RCTs. Second, a component network meta-analysis on 32 RCTs including 9,224 adult patients with septic shock identified lower mortality associated with very high doses of vitamin C than with standard care, and potential for harm associated with thiamin which thus should be dropped from a future full RCT. Adding glucocorticoid treatment shortened the duration of vasopressor therapy and ICU stay. Third, the recent LOVIT trial observed an increased incidence of the composite outcome of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days in adults with infection requiring vasopressors treated with 50 mg/kg vitamin C compared to placebo. More recent meta-analyses indicate a low certainty for early mortality benefit of high-dose vitamin C in adults, but moderate certainty for harm at 90 days. Further complexity to this controversy stems from pharmacological formulations, with some trials using sodium ascorbate (as in this trial) and others using ascorbic acid which has a much lower pH.

Until now, only observational data on the combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin in pediatric age groups has been published. Critically ill children with sepsis have very high metabolic turnover and deplete their vitamin C stores rapidly. Very-low vitamin C serum levels on admission to the PICU were inversely correlated with multiple organ dysfunction at 24 hours (aOR 3.38; 95% CI, 1.53–7.47). Systematic reviews indicate an excellent safety profile of vitamin C even at doses up to 100 mg/kg/dose and higher.

Study randomization and intervention

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive intervention or placebo. The randomization was stratified according to a table of computer-generated random numbers. Throughout the study, patients, investigators, clinical staff, and research staff remained blinded to the allocated therapy, with the exception of designated nurses who were responsible for the preparation of both study drug and placebo. The designated nurses were not involved with clinical care or outcome evaluation. Blinding regarding the trial regimen was ensured by the supply of study drug and placebo in identical, masked bags.

When the patients were diagnosed as septic shock, they were primarily treated with aggressive fluid challenge, adequate antibiotics, and vasoactive agents, according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. For the use of vasoactive drugs, norepinephrine was the first choice. At least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid was given within the first 3 h. If target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg could not be achieved, norepinephrine would be initiated within first hour of hypotension during or after 1-h fluid resuscitation. Patients in the intervention group received hydrocortisone (200 mg daily), vitamin C (2 g every 6 h), and thiamine (200 mg every 12 h) for 5 days or until ICU discharge, whichever occurred first. Vitamin C and thiamine were diluted in 100 mL 0.9% sodium chloride, respectively, and intravenously administered to patients over 60 min. Hydrocortisone was administered as a continuous infusion over 24 h. In the placebo group, an identical volume of 0.9% saline from the placebo drug bag was administered to patients using the same protocol. Attending ICU clinicians were allowed to order open-label corticosteroid therapy in place of study hydrocortisone or placebo for patients as deemed necessary (e.g. hydrocortisone for refractory shock, methylprednisolone for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). However, the vitamin C and thiamine or matching placebo would remain randomized and blinded. These participants would remain in the study and be followed for outcomes. Other monitoring and interventions during and after the intervention period could be used in both groups at the discretion of the attending physicians.

### Resuscitation in paediatric septic shock using vitamin C and hydrocortisone (RESPOND): the RESPOND randomized controlled trial protocol [^113p3Be5]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

This is the first multicenter, multinational randomized controlled trial, informed by a pilot trial and adult studies, powered for clinical endpoints that investigate the effect of vitamin C combined with hydrocortisone in pediatric septic shock.
Trial outcomes include survival free of inotropes/vasopressors as a combined measure of severity relevant for patients and families, survival, and duration of treatments in hospital, direct healthcare costs, and quality of life and measures of functional status and neurodevelopment 6 months after randomization.
This multinational collaboration, including high-, low- and middle-income settings, will ensure that the results translate to clinical practice quickly.

Sepsis is a leading cause of childhood death. Half of sepsis deaths in children occur within 48 hours of presentation, implying a need for rapidly applicable interventions to alter the disease trajectory in the pediatric host observed during septic shock. Although outcomes for childhood sepsis have gradually improved, one in six children with septic shock admitted to a PICU will die, with even higher numbers in children in less resourced settings.

Implications for clinical practice and future research

Most vitamin C trials examined the effect of high dose vitamin C in a specific triple-drug regimen, i.e. 6 g/day of vitamin C in combination with glucocorticoid and vitamin B1, and only two arms included very high dose vitamin C or vitamin C. Although data are scarce, our component NMA findings imply that there may be a dose–response relationship between vitamin C therapy and mortality. These observations offer indirect support for further exploration of higher doses of vitamin C therapy in RCTs. Given the sporadic reports of harms related to intravenous high dose vitamin C therapy indicated in a recent scoping review on the adverse effects related to intravenous vitamin C therapy, caution should be exercised in using high dose vitamin C outside the context of a clinical trial. Although of great uncertainty, the apparent harm from vitamin B1 suggests that, outside of clinical trials, this therapy should be restricted to septic patients suspected of having beri beri.

Our component NMA finding that glucocorticoid therapy was associated with a shorter duration of vasopressor therapy and ICU stay is consistent with large RCTs providing evidence of higher certainty. As glucocorticoid therapy appears to be safe and well-tolerated, these findings provide further evidence for the use of glucocorticoids in patients with septic shock.

### Evaluating vitamin C in septic shock: a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C monotherapy [^112T7bxY]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this trial of IV vitamin C therapy for septic shock, the observed reduction in absolute risk of 28-day mortality in the experimental arm of 13.9% (p = 0.10) did not meet the primary endpoint of reducing absolute 28-day mortality by 20% as hypothesized. Analysis of our secondary outcomes showed a modest increase in fluid administered within 6 hours of study drug initiation in the vitamin C arm that reached statistical significance but is of unclear clinical significance and statistically higher incidence of RRT use in the vitamin C arm. Post hoc analysis examining the relative times of study drug initiation and RRT initiation indicates that the majority of patients requiring RRT in the vitamin C group had it initiated or planned prior to study drug initiation. This suggests that vitamin C was noncausal; however, we cannot assess the extent to which this difference between the groups may have influenced other outcomes.

We did not note any statistically significant differences in ICU mortality, improvements in SOFA or APACHE II scores between the groups, time to resolution of shock, time to lactate clearance, or duration of ICU or hospital stay; however, attrition bias due to uneven mortality between the groups may have reduced any potential differences in the latter four outcomes. Also, because SOFA and APACHE II scores are routinely only determined once per day, this metric may not fully appreciate precipitous deterioration of status leading to death.

We attempted to determine whether there may be some synergistic effect between vitamin C and steroids by performing a subgroup analysis comparing mortality between arms in subgroups of patients receiving or not receiving steroids. In the subgroup of patients receiving steroids, the observed reductions in absolute 28-day and ICU mortality were greater than those in the full study cohort (14.3% and 11.4%, respectively); however, statistical significance was not reached. Additionally, the use of steroids was not protocolized but rather at the discretion of the treating provider, which may introduce selection bias.

### Combined treatment with hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine for sepsis and septic shock: a randomized controlled trial [^117RgoPV]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine treatment can reduce the mortality of patients with sepsis is controversial.

Research Question

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine combination treatment for patients with sepsis or septic shock (HYVCTTSSS).

Study Design and Methods

This single-blind, randomized controlled trial evaluated treatment with hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 h for 7 days), vitamin C (1.5 g every 6 h for 4 days), and thiamine (200 mg every 12 h for 4 days) vs placebo (normal saline) in patients with sepsis. The intention-to-treat analysis was used. Primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes were organ protection, procalcitonin reduction, and adverse events related to hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine.

Results

Eighty patients were randomized to receive combination treatment (n = 40) or normal saline (n = 40). No difference in 28-day all-cause mortality was observed (27.5% vs 35%, respectively; p = 0.47); however, treatment was associated with a significant improvement of 72-h change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (P = .02). In adverse events analysis, the treatment group exhibited more incidents of hypernatremia (P = .005). In prespecified subgroup analysis, patients of the treatment subgroup diagnosed with sepsis within 48 h showed lower mortality than those in the control subgroup (P = .02). The study was terminated after the midterm analysis.

Interpretation

Among patients with sepsis or septic shock, the combination of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine did not reduce mortality compared with placebo.

### Intravenous vitamin C administration to patients with septic shock: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^11578gxn]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition comprising organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis is a growing global health issue, with an estimated 49 million cases worldwide resulting in 11 million deaths. As such, sepsis is responsible for 20% of annual global deaths. Septic shock is a more severe clinical presentation characterised by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities and is associated with mortality rates greater than 40%. Sepsis is managed through empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy, source control of infection, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor administration. Additionally, organ support is provided via mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Intravenous norepinephrine is usually the first-choice vasopressor to increase the mean arterial blood pressure ≥ 65 mmHg for patients with sepsis who remain hypotensive after adequate fluid resuscitation. At times, intravenous vasopressin is also commenced to aid mean arterial pressure target or decrease norepinephrine dosage.

Since the publication of several early trials indicating possible beneficial effects of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock, as monotherapy and in combination with thiamine and hydrocortisone, there has been an upsurge in clinical trials investigating its potential benefits in these patients. Various trials administering intravenous vitamin C to patients with sepsis and septic shock have indicated decreased vasopressor requirements, improved sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, decreased ICU length of stay, and decreased mortality. However, some trials showed no effects of vitamin C intervention on SOFA scores, ICU length of stay, or mortality, so the evidence is currently mixed with regard to these outcomes. Since the emergence of severe coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), research into the potential treatments of sepsis, a major complication of severe COVID-19, has become even more important. Early trials have indicated some potentially beneficial effects of intravenous vitamin C in severe COVID-19. In addition, the World Health Organisation has highlighted vitamin C as a potential adjunctive therapy with biologic plausibility for patients with critical COVID-19.

### Ascorbate-dependent vasopressor synthesis: a rationale for vitamin C administration in severe sepsis and septic shock? [^112dvXKG]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Ascorbate requirements in sepsis

Ascorbate is an essential micronutrient with numerous important enzyme cofactor functions in the body, as well as potent antioxidant properties. Humans have lost the ability to synthesise ascorbate due to mutations in the gene encoding the terminal biosynthetic enzyme, and ascorbate must therefore be obtained regularly through the diet to prevent hypovitaminosis C and the potentially fatal deficiency disease scurvy. Recommended dietary intakes for ascorbate are typically in the range of 75–110 mg/day. Enteral or parenteral nutrition administered to critically ill patients provides ~100 mg/day ascorbate. However, critically ill patients probably require significantly higher intakes of ascorbate due to enhanced metabolic turnover of vitamin C during the severe inflammatory response. It should also be noted that parenteral rather than enteral nutrition may be required for optimal ascorbate status in critically ill patients because intravenously administered ascorbate bypasses the rate-limiting intestinal uptake of orally administered ascorbate.

In healthy fasting humans, circulating levels of ascorbate are typically in the range of 50–70 μmol/l, whereas levels < 23 μmol/l are considered marginally deficient (or hypovitaminosis C) and levels < 11 μmol/l are considered severely deficient and potentially scorbutic. Several studies have shown that ascorbate levels are low in critically ill patients (i.e. < 23 μmol/l), including those with acute respiratory infections and sepsis, and are particularly low (i.e. < 11 μmol/l) in patients who progress to multiple organ failure. In some studies, ascorbate levels remained lower than those in controls, despite the patients receiving 100–500 mg/day ascorbate either enterally or parenterally. Long et al. demonstrated that up to 3000 mg/day ascorbate was required to return plasma levels of critically ill patients to normal (i.e. 68 μmol/l).

### Resuscitation with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin in children with septic shock: a multicenter randomized pilot study [^112SX6sK]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

Adjunctive therapy with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin has been evaluated in adults, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) data in children are lacking. We aimed to test the feasibility of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin in PICU patients with septic shock; and to explore whether the intervention is associated with increased survival free of organ dysfunction.

DESIGN:

Open-label parallel, pilot RCT multicenter study. The primary endpoint was feasibility. Clinical endpoints included survival free of organ dysfunction censored at 28 days and nine secondary outcomes, shock reversal, and two proxy measures of intervention efficacy.

SETTING:

Six PICUs in Australia and New Zealand.

PATIENTS:

Children of age between 28 days and 18 years requiring vasoactive drugs for septic shock between August 2019 and March 2021.

INTERVENTIONS:

Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive 1 mg/kg hydrocortisone every 6 hours (q6h), 30 mg/kg ascorbic acid q6h, and 4 mg/kg thiamin every 12 hours (n = 27), or standard septic shock management (n = 33).

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:

Sixty of 77 (78%) eligible patients consented with 91% of approached parents providing consent. The median time from randomization to intervention was 44 (interquartile range [IQR] 29–120) min. Seventy of seventy-seven (28%) patients had received IV steroids before randomization. Median survival alive and free of organ dysfunction was 20.0 (0.0–26.0) days in the intervention and 21.0 (0.0–25.0) days in the standard care group. Median PICU length of stay was 5.3 (2.5–11.3) days in the intervention group versus 6.9 (3.0–11.5) days in the control group. Shock reversal occurred at a median of 35.2 (14.6–101.2) hours in the intervention group versus 47.3 (22.4–106.8) hours in the standard care group (median difference –12 hr; 95% CI, –56.8 to 32.7 hr).

CONCLUSIONS:

In children requiring vasopressors for septic shock, a protocol comparing adjunctive treatment with high-dose vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin versus standard care was feasible. These findings assist in making modifications to the trial protocol to enable a better-designed larger RCT.

### Resuscitation with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin in children with septic shock: a multicenter randomized pilot study [^117Niqw7]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications

Our findings suggest that an RCT of this intervention would be feasible with a high rate of consent and that the intervention could be delivered rapidly. Although this study was not powered for safety outcomes, we did not identify a clear signal towards increased adverse events likely or possibly related to the intervention. The median pSOFA at enrollment was 9 in our study which is comparable to the VITAMINS trial, but even earlier enrollment may be facilitated by predefined Vasoactive Inotrope Score eligibility thresholds. The observed use of hydrocortisone pre-randomization and post-randomization, in particular in the control arm, provides rationale for a three-arm trial design. Although the pragmatic design enabled high recruitment and consent rates in our pilot, violations in a full trial as a result of provider preference in the absence of blinding may expose the trial to risks of bias and contribute to dilution or contamination of the study arms. Furthermore, only 82% of parents completed the surveys at 28 days, necessitating targeted education and follow-up strategies.

Based on our data, and powering for a clinically relevant increase in the time alive and free of vasopressors of at least 1 day, we estimate that 384 patients would be needed for a trial comparing vitamin C with hydrocortisone, and hydrocortisone alone, versus controls (128 participants per group) along with 80% power, a corrected type I error of 0.025 to allow for two primary comparisons, attrition of 5% and inflation for a non-normally distributed outcome. We estimate that it would take up to 4 years to recruit for such a powered trial assuming participation of 15–20 PICUs.

Limitations

Several limitations of this feasibility trial need to be considered. First, due to the difficulties in blinding three drugs, and the characteristic color of vitamin C, treatment concealment was not performed. This leaves risk of bias in outcome ascertainment for the interventions, and frontline clinicians may not have equipoise on vitamin C or hydrocortisone. Second, the study protocol allowed the use of steroids in the control arm, which makes it impossible to assess the confounding of severity on the impact of steroids on outcomes. Third, recruitment occurred at ANZICS PSG sites, which does not allow us to define feasibility in low-income and middle-income countries where different baseline risks, pathogens, and comorbidities may introduce further heterogeneity. Fourth, the clinical outcome of organ dysfunction-free adjudicated a zero rather than a negative value to death and did not consider new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction.

### Ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine in sepsis: a review of the biologic rationale and the present state of clinical evaluation [^113LibG9]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

While the high doses of ascorbic acid given in the above clinical studies were not associated with any identified harms specific to the drug, one theoretical concern regarding the routine use of ascorbic acid in sepsis is the potential for increased oxalate excretion and the development of oxalate renal calculi. Thiamine pyrophosphate is a key co-enzyme necessary for the function of glyoxylate aminotransferase, which catalyzes the breakdown of glyoxalate to carbon dioxide instead of oxalate. Thiamine deficiency states, therefore, may predispose to increased oxalate excretion. It should be further noted that short-term, intravenous ascorbic acid — even at high doses — has not been found to increase the risk of renal calculi in controlled trials to date. Other potential adverse effects of vitamin C include abdominal pain/bloating, increased iron absorption, hemolysis in patients with G6PD enzyme deficiency, and false negative results on fecal occult blood testing. At very high doses, ascorbic acid may act as a pro-oxidant, although this has not been found to be the primary effect in vivo. Finally, high doses of ascorbic acid may falsely elevate glucose level readings when measured with certain point-of-care glucometers employing glucose dehydrogenase-pyrroloquinoline quinone amperometric methods.

Corticosteroids and ascorbic acid

A number of large, randomized trials have assessed the added benefit of corticosteroids when included as part of general septic shock management. These studies have generally shown corticosteroids to improve various clinical outcomes in septic shock (e.g. time to shock reversal, ventilator-free days), but there have been mixed results with respect to mortality. Whether the routine administration of hydrocortisone to patients with septic shock should be standard remains a matter of debate.

The biologic basis for the inclusion of hydrocortisone in the drug combination, however, is based on potential synergy between ascorbic acid and hydrocortisone. Glucocorticoid binding to glucocorticoid receptors is negatively affected by oxidizing molecules. This may be reversed by the administration of ascorbic acid, which has been shown to restore glucocorticoid receptor function. The cellular uptake of ascorbic acid is mediated by the sodium-vitamin C transporter (SVCT2), which is downregulated during inflammatory states. The administration of glucocorticoids has been shown to increase expression of the transporter. In a study examining the barrier function of human lung microvascular epithelial cells, the combination of ascorbic acid and hydrocortisone showed a synergistic barrier-protective effect after lipopolysaccharide exposure — above the combined effect of either agent when given alone.

### Early administration of vitamin C in patients with sepsis or septic shock in emergency departments: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial: the C-EASIE trial [^1173g17Z]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter, double-blind RCT including patients with sepsis or septic shock, early administration of vitamin C did not significantly decrease the average post-baseline patient SOFA score. This contrasts with recent meta-analyses which showed that vitamin C (alone or in combination with thiamine and hydrocortisone) may improve organ failure recovery, as suggested by the decrease in SOFA score within 72 h. This difference may be due to the fact that the RCT's used for the meta-analyses had small sample sizes (< 110 patients per group) with the exception of the VICTAS trial. Moreover, SOFA scores from discharged or deceased patients before 72 h were managed differently across studies which may also cause survival bias.

Further, the early administration of vitamin C was assumed to be associated with patients' survival improvement, however it did not result in a survival benefit in our trial. This is similar to the report of another recent trial that focused on early administration, except they investigated the potential benefit of HAT therapy and included only patients with septic shock, as in most other preceding trials. Important to mention is that they only started randomizing patients in this study once admitted to the ICU after a median length of stay of 0,5 days. Moreover, they reported a 2-h median time from randomisation to 1 st administration of study drug.

### Evaluating vitamin C in septic shock: a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C monotherapy [^112S9GqB]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Several trials of vitamin C-based therapies for sepsis and septic shock have recently been completed. Among trials of HAT therapy or vitamin C and thiamine, the maximum reduction in 28- or 30-day absolute mortality observed has been 7.5%, and none have shown a statistically significant reduction in mortality (,–). Individual trials of HAT therapy have suggested a reduction in 28-day mortality when the therapy is initiated within 48 hours of onset of sepsis, and quicker resolution of shock associated with HAT therapy; however, these findings have not been uniformly reproduced.

The CITRIS-ALI trial of vitamin C monotherapy for patients with sepsis and acute lung injury demonstrated a reduction in 28-day absolute mortality of 16.6% (p = 0.03); however, this was one of multiple secondary outcomes that obfuscates its statistical significance, and the primary outcomes of reductions in SOFA score and plasma inflammatory markers were not met. Subgroup analysis of patients requiring positive-pressure ventilation in our study similarly suggested a heightened mortality benefit for this group relative to the general study population, but potential conclusions from this analysis are tempered by its post hoc nature. Additional trials of vitamin C for patients with septic shock and sepsis-induced respiratory dysfunction employing short-term mortality as a primary outcome could further inform whether vitamin C carries an enhanced therapeutic effect for this population.

### Towards personalized medicine: a scoping review of immunotherapy in sepsis [^1123UVbq]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

RCTs without a personalized approach

Corticosteroids have been studied in sepsis patients in over 30 RCTs with contradicting results. In septic shock patients receiving hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone compared to placebo, mortality was lower (43% vs. 49%, n = 1241), however hydrocortisone alone in septic shock patients undergoing mechanical ventilation did not result in the same effect (28% vs. 29%, n = 3658). A recently published RCT showed a lower 28-day mortality among ~ 800 patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia treated in the ICU with hydrocortisone (12% vs. 6%). In an RCT in sepsis patients receiving vasopressors those who received intravenous vitamin C had a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction (44.5% vs 38.5%, n = 872). Trials investigating the combination of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone did not find positive results on ventilator-free-days or mortality SPS:refid::bib53|bib54(53, 54). Treatment with clarithromycin, next to standard-of-care antimicrobial treatment, resulted in contradicting findings, the latest large trial did, however, found an association with a decreased 90-day mortality compared to placebo (43% vs. 60%, n = 200).

### The outcome of IV vitamin C therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114CAdRH]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Trial sequential analysis

Cumulative meta-analysis updating with new RCTs may lead to false positive results (type I error) due to an increased risk of random error from sparse data. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) can reduce the risks of random error because of inadequate sample size or repetitive testing and estimate the required information size (RIS) for meta-analysis. Type I error and power were set as 5% and 80%, respectively. We performed TSA for both delta SOFA score and short-term mortality outcomes by applying TSA version 0.9.5.10 beta software.

### Effect of high-dose intravenous ascorbic acid on microcirculation and endothelial glycocalyx during sepsis and septic shock: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^114UGfx1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Potentially beneficial ascorbic acid's role was challenged by a recently published LOVIT trial. In contrast to numerous previous studies, the authors of this study reported higher incidence of death and persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days in adult septic patients treated with high dose of ascorbic acid. The result of this trial makes it clear that high dose of ascorbic acid should not be routinely administered for all septic patients. Sepsis is however particularly complex and heterogeneous pathology combining different mechanisms. Different clinical phenotypes of sepsis, characterized by different response to the same treatment are more and more often discussed. What is found to be effective in one phenotype, in other cases might even have deleterious effect This might explain such conflicting results.

This hypothesis is supported by Sun-Young Jung and collegues. The authors evaluated 36 327 patients treated with ascorbic acid and control group of the same size. It was found that AA alone and in combination with thiamine reduced mortality in patients older than 70 years with more comorbidities, for those whose predominant source of infection was pneumonia and urinary tract as well in patients with septic shock requiring mechanical ventilation. In opposite there was no improvement in the mortality of the patients with abdominal sepsis and those requiring renal replacement therapy. Duration of treatment must be also taken into consideration. Interesting insights were made by Hyun Jung Lee in an experimental peritonitis study with mice. AA (45 mg/kg), thiamine and hydrocortisone was administered alongside the usual sepsis treatment for four days. 50% of mice in the control group have died within 3 days meanwhile no deaths during this period occurred in the experimental group. When adjunctive treatment was terminated, animals began to die. Similar pattern was demonstrated in CITRIS - ALI study.

### Effect of adjunctive vitamin C, glucocorticoids, and vitamin B1 on longer-term mortality in adults with sepsis or septic shock: a systematic review and a component network meta-analysis [^112f5NHL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, contamination due to co-interventions with other components might have occurred via the network. For example, if a trial allowed glucocorticoid as usual care in comparing vitC versus control, the trial results might have partially reflected the comparison of vitC + glucocorticoid versus glucocorticoid. Such contamination could lead to bias toward the null effect of each intervention. Second, a limited number of RCTs were available for the primary outcome. In particular, RCTs with low risk of bias were scarce. We prespecified longer-term mortality as our primary outcome. We did this because the mortality of patients with sepsis increases steeply in the first 90 days and then gradually plateaus until one year thereafter. Thus, the pre-planned sensitivity analysis using all available mortality data at the last follow-up only provides hypotheses for future trials to examine. Third, missing SOFA scores due to competing risks were not imputed for the analysis. Such missingness tends to occur when patients die or survive to discharge from the ICU before the timepoint of SOFA score assessment, and, as such, missingness does not occur at random. Fourth, we performed multiple comparisons. The statistical significance defined by 95%CI is prone to overemphasizing chance findings; however, there are no formal methods to account for such multiplicity in a NMA. Therefore, we limited changes from those pre-specified in the protocol and did not add new analyses without a strong justification. Fifth, heterogeneity was observed in some comparisons. To account for this, we presented the results of the NMA with prediction intervals incorporating the magnitude of heterogeneity. In doing so, we sought to avoid overreliance on the estimated effect measures and the confidence intervals. Sixth, the power and the confidence in the inconsistency tests are low because of the small number of closed loops in all NMAs. Finally, NMA and component NMA should not be considered to provide direct evidence of causal relations between treatments and outcomes because participants in the included trials were not directly randomized in the network.

### Mega-dose sodium ascorbate: a pilot, single-dose, physiological effect, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [^117TeEFp]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In this double-blind, randomized, controlled study in septic shock patients, we compared the physiological effects of a single 60-g dose of NaAscorbate infused over 6 h with placebo. We found that the difference in total 24-h urine output was not statistically different. However, NaAscorbate induced a greater cumulative increase in urine output over time. Moreover, it led to a greater decrease in vasopressor dose and SOFA score over time. Finally, we showed a dramatic effect on plasma ascorbate levels but no significant effect on biomarkers of inflammation.

Relationship with previous studies

Our findings appear to differ from those of recent randomized controlled trials, which assessed the effect of very high dose vitamin C in patients with sepsis. In the Lessening Organ Dysfunction With VITamin C (LOVIT) trial and the Vitamin C Infusion for Treatment in Sepsis Induced Acute Lung Injury (CITRIS-ALI) trial, 50 mg/kg of ascorbic acid (4 g in an 80 kg person) or placebo was given to patients every 6 h. In the LOVIT trial, the risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction, including vasopressor use, at 28 days was higher in the vitamin C group than in the placebo group and urine output was similar between groups. In the CITRIS-ALI trial, the same infusion regimen was given to patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and did not significantly improve organ dysfunction scores or alter markers of inflammation and vascular injury. In addition, a lack of effect was also seen in another randomized trial in septic shock patients where vitamin C was combined with hydrocortisone and thiamine. Similarly, another study, that administered a one gram bolus of ascorbic acid followed by 250 mg/hr of continuous infusion for 96 h to patients with sepsis, demonstrated a higher renal replacement therapy rate in the ascorbic acid group. Finally, current guidelines recommend not to use intravenous vitamin C in patients with sepsis because of possible harm.

### Effect of adjunctive vitamin C, glucocorticoids, and vitamin B1 on longer-term mortality in adults with sepsis or septic shock: a systematic review and a component network meta-analysis [^116brPQD]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

On NMA, metabolic resuscitation with vitamin C, glucocorticoids, vitamin B1, or combinations of these drugs was not proven to reduce longer-term mortality. However, NMA and component NMA suggested an association of high dose and very high dose vitamin C and decreased mortality with low certainty. Glucocorticoid therapy was associated with a decreased duration of vasopressor support and ICU therapy. Further RCTs evaluating very high dose intravenous vitamin C therapy appear justified.

JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study Procedures

Details of the VICTAS trial protocol and analysis have been reported. Briefly, adult patients with acute respiratory and/or cardiac dysfunction due to sepsis who required ventilator or vasopressor support were recruited at 43 hospitals across the US. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the intervention or control group. Participants, investigators, and study team personnel responsible for outcomes assessment were blinded to treatment allocation. The VICTAS trial, including this prespecified secondary analysis, was approved by the institutional review board of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Participants or their legally authorized representatives provided written informed consent prior to enrollment and randomization. We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

The intervention consisted of intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g), thiamine hydrochloride (100 mg), and hydrocortisone sodium succinate (50 mg) administered within 4 hours of randomization and every 6 hours thereafter for up to 96 hours or until death or ICU discharge (whichever occurred first). Participants in the control group received placebo injections of normal saline matched by volume at the same frequency. Participants could be treated with open-label corticosteroids as deemed appropriate by the clinicians; in cases of daily doses greater than or equal to 200 mg of hydrocortisone (or equivalent), investigational hydrocortisone or matching placebo was withheld by the pharmacy. Trained research personnel assessed participants for delirium daily during the intervention period using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU in conjunction with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. All other clinical management of participants, including enteral vitamin supplementation and nutrition, was at the discretion of the clinicians.

In 2018, the ADRENAL (Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy in Patients with Septic Shock) and the APROCCHSS (Hydrocortisone Plus Fludrocortisone for Adults with Septic Shock) trials were published. Both trials compared the use of hydrocortisone versus placebo in adults with septic shock and found that hydrocortisone reduced time on mechanical ventilation, time to resolution of shock, and time in the ICU. Although the APROCCHSS trial showed a reduction in mortality with hydrocortisone use, this was not confirmed in the ADRENAL trial. Data from APROCCHSS and ADRENAL were subsequently included in updated systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which confirmed the findings from the two large trials. Based on this, an international clinical practice guideline proposed a weak recommendation in favor of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis, including septic shock. Although most clinicians — based on the results of the trials and systematic reviews and on the proposed weak recommendation in the clinical practice guideline — may consider using hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock, especially in those with refractory shock, there is more uncertainty about the value of treatment with hydrocortisone based on plasma biomarker levels.

In this issue of the Journal, Cohen and colleagues (pp.) report the results of a cohort study nested within the ADRENAL trial. The authors assessed whether prerandomization baseline levels of the plasma biomarkers cortisol, aldosterone, and ascorbic acid modified the effect of hydrocortisone among 529 patients with septic shock from 22 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. The authors observed no statistically significant interaction between plasma concentrations of the biomarkers and adjunctive hydrocortisone on 90-day mortality (primary outcome measure), shock reversal, or any other of the clinically relevant secondary outcomes, suggesting that the treatment effect of hydrocortisone is not dependent on the baseline plasma concentrations of cortisol, aldosterone, or ascorbic acid. There was an indication of interaction for free and total plasma concentrations of cortisol for some secondary outcomes and analyses; however, those analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing and therefore should be interpreted with caution, as acknowledged by the authors.

### Beyond the bundle: clinical controversies in the management of sepsis in emergency medicine patients [^114GUdRy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a condition characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The emergency department (ED) serves as a crucial entry point for patients presenting with sepsis. Given the heterogeneous presentation and high mortality rate associated with sepsis and septic shock, several clinical controversies have emerged in the management of sepsis. These include the use of novel therapeutic agents like angiotensin II, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, thiamine ("HAT") therapy, and levosimendan, Additionally, controversies with current treatments in vasopressor dosing, and the use of and balanced or unbalanced crystalloid are crucial to consider. The purpose of this review is to discuss clinical controversies in the management of septic patients, including the use of novel medications and dosing strategies, to assist providers in appropriately determining what treatment strategy is best suited for patients.

### Hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine for the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock: a retrospective before-after study [^112YYZHL]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The global burden of sepsis is estimated as 15 to 19 million cases annually, with a mortality rate approaching 60% in low-income countries.

Methods

In this retrospective before-after clinical study, we compared the outcome and clinical course of consecutive septic patients treated with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine during a 7-month period (treatment group) with a control group treated in our ICU during the preceding 7 months. The primary outcome was hospital survival. A propensity score was generated to adjust the primary outcome.

Results

There were 47 patients in both treatment and control groups, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The hospital mortality was 8.5% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared with 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (P < .001). The propensity adjusted odds of mortality in the patients treated with the vitamin C protocol was 0.13 (95% CI, 0.04–0.48; p = 0.002). The Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score decreased in all patients in the treatment group, with none developing progressive organ failure. All patients in the treatment group were weaned off vasopressors, a mean of 18.3 ± 9.8 h after starting treatment with the vitamin C protocol. The mean duration of vasopressor use was 54.9 ± 28.4 h in the control group (P < .001).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine, are effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, and in reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings.

### Ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine in sepsis: a review of the biologic rationale and the present state of clinical evaluation [^111SBRKi]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticosteroids is a promising new therapy for sepsis resuscitation but currently lacks robust evidence to support its widespread use. The potential effectiveness of this medication combination is rooted in biologic plausibility and supported by small clinical trials of the various individual components. Randomized data to confirm or refute the observational evidence for the drug combination are needed, and several clinical trials are ongoing or planned in the near future. We therefore anticipate a timely answer to the question of whether thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticosteroids will play a role in the evolution of sepsis therapies.

### Adjuvant vitamin C for sepsis: mono or triple? [^111ZnEXk]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Recently, the largest randomized clinical trial (RCT) of intravenous vitamin C in septic patients until now, the CITRIS-ALI trial, showed a 16.5% lower mortality in the vitamin C group compared to placebo, while the primary endpoint deltaSOFA-score after 96 h was negative. Mortality curves parted from day 2, which may be due to early circulatory stabilization by vitamin C. Many comments on this trial addressed the methodological problem due to the exclusion of deceased and discharged patients from the deltaSOFA-score. Given the early mortality reduction in favor of vitamin C, recalculation with assignment of the worst SOFA score to deceased patients and the best score to discharged patients will undoubtedly show less organ dysfunction. So, the results of the CITRIS-ALI study support the promising role of adjuvant high-dose intravenous vitamin C for septic patients.

The CITRIS-ALI trial differed in two important aspects from the groundbreaking before-after study of Marik et al. which showed a 30% absolute mortality reduction, but had the limitation of not being randomized. First, the i.v. dose of 200 mg/kg/day vitamin C (i.e. 16 g/day for 80 kg BW) was higher than the 6 g/day of the HAT-therapy. Second, vitamin C was administered as monotherapy and not in combination with hydrocortisone and thiamine (HAT-therapy, based on the hypothesis that hydrocortisone and thiamine have potentially synergistic effects with vitamin C). Although the positive results of the CITRIS-ALI study on mortality question the necessity of co-administration of hydrocortisone and thiamine when vitamin C is dosed sufficiently high, notably 66% of patients in CITRIS-ALI study received corticosteroids.

### Early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine in adult patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^116txiKL]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Key secondary outcomes

In the ITT population, there was no significant difference between the intervention and placebo groups in 28-day mortality (37.1% vs. 36.2%, respectively, P = 0.84) or the ICU mortality (31.9% vs. 29.1%, respectively, P = 0.53) and hospital mortality (35.2% vs. 33.3%, respectively, P = 0.68) (Table 3).

In the PP population, there was no significant difference between the intervention and placebo groups in 28-day all-cause mortality (36.5% vs. 36.1%, respectively, P = 0.94) or in the mortality of ICU discharge (31.5% vs. 28.8%, respectively, P = 0.55) and hospital discharge (34.5% vs. 33.2%, respectively, P = 0.78) (Table 3).

Additional secondary outcomes

In the ITT population, the proportion of patients with reversal of shock was similar in the intervention and placebo groups (80.8% vs. 81.7%, respectively, P = 0.80). No significant differences were found in the time from randomization to shock reversal (3.0 vs. 2.0, respectively, P = 0.30); 72-h Delta SOFA score between the intervention and placebo groups (2.0 vs. 2.0, respectively, P = 0.59). Similarly, there was no statistically significant between-group difference in terms of 28-day cumulative ICU-free days (13.0 vs. 14.0, P = 0.67), vasopressor-free days (23.9 vs. 25.0, P = 0.26), or ventilator support–free days (17.6 vs. 19.3, P = 0.42) (Table 3). No other secondary outcomes showed significant differences between the intervention and placebo groups, including LOS in the ICU (7.0 vs. 6.0, P = 0.85) or LOS in the hospital (16.0 vs. 17.0, P = 0.35) (Table 3).

### Ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine in sepsis: a review of the biologic rationale and the present state of clinical evaluation [^116XqniX]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The Ascorbic Acid, Corticosteroids, and Thiamine in Sepsis (ACTS) trial and other ongoing clinical trials

The lack of adequate data exemplified by mixed practice patterns suggests a state of scientific equipoise has developed regarding the risk/benefit ratio of the routine administration of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine in sepsis. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to assess the effect of this drug combination on clinically important outcomes in sepsis. As of July 1st, 2018, a review of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Program (which includes) revealed nine ongoing or planned clinical trials of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine in six different countries (Table 1). These trials differ somewhat with respect to study populations (septic shock only vs sepsis or septic shock), control group interventions (the VITAMINS trial using hydrocortisone and the remainder choosing saline placebo), and primary outcomes, but all explore the intervention and daily doses proposed in the study by Marik et al. Of note, the Vitamin C Infusion for Treatment in Sepsis Induced Acute Lung Injury (Citrus-ALI), a 170-patient trial of 200 mg/kg/day of ascorbic acid vs placebo in sepsis-induced acute lung injury, has completed enrollment, although results of this study are not yet available.

### Resuscitation in paediatric septic shock using vitamin C and hydrocortisone (RESPOND): the RESPOND randomized controlled trial protocol [^113JQ8cf]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Evidence for adjunctive therapies in pediatric septic shock is scarce. The RESPOND trial will provide robust evidence that is urgently needed to inform pediatric critical care practice. RESPOND is the first trial powered for patient-centered endpoints in children with septic shock investigating high-dose vitamin C, based on our multicenter pilot RCT. The trial is run across all major PICUs in ANZ and is scalable to include additional international sites.

Several limitations need to be considered. First, rather than using Phoenix Sepsis Criteria for enrollment, which were published after the initiation of this trial, we chose a pragmatic entry point defined by the interventions clinicians apply in children with septic shock. We acknowledge that different clinicians may apply variable thresholds to initiate inotrope/vasopressor treatment; however, given uncertainty surrounding blood pressure thresholds, we believe our approach allows inclusion of the population of children exposed to these treatments at the study sites. Second, while we aimed for a pragmatic inclusion strategy, we excluded patients with malaria or those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Third, the intervention is open label given the logistic and feasibility challenges with blinding several drugs. Fourth, patients may have received hydrocortisone for septic shock before enrollment, which is why we apply a stratification for this situation. Fifth, the vitamin C dose is based on preclinical data, a systematic review, and the adult literature, and we are not performing a dose-finding trial nor pharmacological substudies. Sixth, the three-arm design permits comparison of hydrocortisone plus vitamin C vs. hydrocortisone alone, and vs. standard care, but does not compare vitamin C alone vs. standard care. Seventh, the primary outcome of survival free of inotropes/vasopressors censored at 1 week may not capture later effects related to immunomodulation of the interventions; however, the secondary outcomes should capture these later effects. Finally, if the trial recruits a sizeable proportion of patients from low- and middle-income resource settings, this — albeit improving generalizability — may add additional heterogeneity related to difference in drug formulation, practices of drug use, local epidemiology, and risk factors such as malnutrition.

The RESPOND trial will test the hypothesis that combination of IV hydrocortisone with vitamin C will improve survival free of inotropes/vasopressors support in children admitted to the PICU with septic shock. The trial will provide information on secondary outcomes, the effect of hydrocortisone treatment alone compared with standard care, and information on healthcare costs and long-term outcomes in children with septic shock.

### Benefit of hydrocortisone, thiamine, and vitamin C for patients with sepsis or septic shock? Too early to draw conclusions [^116MUhV6]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Previous studies demonstrated that a combination of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine (HVT) is a promising adjuvant treatment for sepsis and septic shock, with decreased mortality and improved resolution of disease. However, recently published prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not support this finding. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of HVT treatment for patients with sepsis or septic shock.

This meta-analysis was performed strictly following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. The primary outcomes were mortality, decrease of sequential organ failure assessment score from baseline (Delt SOFA), and time of vasopressors use. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% CIs were used. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model by RevMan version 5.1.

### True effect of fludrocortisone for septic shock: baseline risk and transitivity concerns [^117RCbqC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Recently, in the Journal, a network meta-analysis was reported that the combined effect of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone in septic shock was associated with improved mortality. The presentation of relative risk and credible intervals to report the magnitude of the effect has made a significant impact on us. Here, we would like to raise some methodological concerns to aid in the interpretation of these results.

First, we suggest conducting a network meta-analysis that includes studies using vitamin C, which was excluded in the original analysis. However, the Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock (APROCCHS) trial by Annane and colleagues included patients treated with drotrecogin alfa, a drug that has since been withdrawn from the market. Vitamin C has been shown not to improve mortality in patients with septic shock in the Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone and Thiamine in Patients With Septic Shock (VITAMINS) Trial by Fujii and colleagues. From the perspective of permitting the inclusion of ineffective drugs, it seems inconsistent to include studies administering drotrecogin alfa without also including those using vitamin C. Therefore, assessing the baseline risk by including studies on vitamin C would likely provide a more accurate evaluation of the true effect of the combination therapy of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.

In addition, it is worth considering a thorough reevaluation of transitivity. In this study, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (approximately 9) in Labib and colleagues was lower than that of other included studies (approximately 11), which was used to form the loop structure by the arm of the monotherapy of hydrocortisone and the combination therapy of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. A difference between 9 and 11 in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores could result in a twofold difference in mortality rates. This discrepancy could potentially lead to an overestimation of the beneficial effects of the combination therapy of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Furthermore, it was unclear which vasopressors were used in the included studies. Providing network estimates excluding these studies may enhance readers' understanding.

We hope these points contribute to a more nuanced interpretation of the findings and their implications for clinical practice.

### Early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine in adult patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^114b6kS2]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

In the PP population, the proportion of patients with reversal of shock was similar in the intervention and placebo groups (80.8% vs. 82.0%, respectively, P = 0.76). There were no significant differences in the time from randomization to shock reversal (3.0 vs. 2.0, respectively, P = 0.40) and 72-h Delta SOFA score between the intervention and placebo groups (1.0 vs. 2.0, respectively, P = 0.65). Similarly, there was no statistically significant between-group difference in 28-day cumulative ICU-free days (13.0 vs. 14.0, P = 0.23), vasopressor-free days (23.9 vs. 25.0, P = 0.36), or ventilator support-free days (17.6 vs. 19.6, P = 0.51) (Table 3). No other secondary outcomes showed significant differences between the intervention and placebo groups, including LOS in the ICU (7.0 vs. 6.0, P = 0.93) or LOS in the hospital (16.0 vs. 17.0, P = 0.26) (Table 3).

Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that after adjusting for potential confounding factors, age, APACHE II score, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, other sites of infection, bacteremia, time from randomization to the first antibiotic administration, lactate, need for ventilator support, and need for RRT remained independently associated with mortality (Additional file 1: Table S3).

Adverse events

In the safety population, the most common serious adverse events were severe hypernatremia (> 160 mmol/L) (occurring in 9 patients in the intervention group and 4 patients in the placebo group, P = 0.16) and fluid overload (occurring in 7 and 5 patients, respectively, P = 0.56). In addition, blood glucose disturbance was reported in 27 patients in the intervention group (12.7% vs. 0, P < 0.001) (Table 4).

Subgroup analysis

In the post hoc subgroup analysis, the 90-day mortality of the all subgroups was not significantly different between the intervention and placebo groups (P > 0.05 for all comparisons) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

### Adjunctive treatments for the management of septic shock-a narrative review of the current evidence [^116qV64H]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. The cornerstones of management include prompt identification of sepsis, early initiation of antibiotic therapy, adequate fluid resuscitation and organ support. Over the past two decades, there have been considerable improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and the host response, including regulation of inflammation, endothelial disruption and impaired immunity. This has offered opportunities for innovative adjunctive treatments such as vitamin C, corticosteroids and beta-blockers. Some of these approaches have shown promising results in early phase trials in humans, while others, such as corticosteroids, have been tested in large, international, multicentre randomised controlled trials. Contemporary guidelines make a weak recommendation for the use of corticosteroids to reduce mortality in sepsis and septic shock. Vitamin C, despite showing initial promise in observational studies, has so far not been shown to be clinically effective in randomised trials. Beta-blocker therapy may have beneficial cardiac and non-cardiac effects in septic shock, but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their use for this condition. The results of ongoing randomised trials are awaited. Crucial to reducing heterogeneity in the trials of new sepsis treatments will be the concept of enrichment, which refers to the purposive selection of patients with clinical and biological characteristics that are likely to be responsive to the intervention being tested.

### Effect of adjunctive vitamin C, glucocorticoids, and vitamin B1 on longer-term mortality in adults with sepsis or septic shock: a systematic review and a component network meta-analysis [^114eYdBZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

We identified 14,914 citations, including 13,416 unique reports. Of these, we assessed 183 full-text articles after excluding 13,233 reports based on the titles and abstracts. We included 43 trials, with 10,257 participants (Supplement 4, eResults 1). The weighted mean age, using studies with age data, was 62.9 years. Three studies were multi-arm trials. One trial compared vitC (very high dose) vs vitC (high dose) vs placebo, and we analyzed each arm separately as randomized. Two studies compared two strategies to administer low-dose hydrocortisone vs usual care. The two hydrocortisone arms were combined as one arm of glucocorticoid. Characteristics of the eligible trials and assessments of transitivity are presented in supplementary materials (Supplement 4, eResults 2, 3). Overall, there was no evidence of concern about the transitivity across the comparisons (Supplement 4, eResults 3).

### Challenges in the management of septic shock: a narrative review [^114ckuik]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

While guidelines provide important information on how to approach a patient in septic shock, "many challenges remain" for the management of these patients. In this narrative review, the panel discusses the challenges in identifying the right hemodynamic target, optimization of fluid therapy, selection of vasopressor agents, identification of patients who may benefit from inotropic agents or on the contrary beta-blockade, and use of steroids. The place for microcirculation-targeted therapy is debated as well as the use of alternative techniques (blood purification) and therapies (vitamin C). The implications of hemodynamic alterations on antibiotic doses is discussed. Finally, the specific challenges in low- and middle-income countries are addressed. Ongoing trials address some of these challenges, but many uncertainties will remain, and individualized therapies based on careful clinical assessment will continue to be essential to optimizing the care of patients with septic shock.

### Low-dose hydrocortisone therapy attenuates septic shock in adult patients but does not reduce 28-day mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112iAxfZ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The role of low-dose hydrocortisone in attenuating septic shock and reducing short-term mortality in adult patients with septic shock is unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of previous studies to determine whether hydrocortisone could ameliorate the effects of septic shock at 7 and 28 days and reduce 28-day morality.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids versus placebo (or supportive treatment alone) were retrieved from electronic searches (Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases; LILACS; and Web of Knowledge) and manual searches (up to May 2012). From a pool of 1949 potentially relevant articles, duplicate independent review identified 10 relevant, RCTs of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy in septic shock. Four pairs of reviewers agreed on the criteria for trial eligibility. One reviewer entered the data into the computer, and 3 reviewers checked the data. Missing data were obtained from the authors of the relevant trials. The primary outcome analyzed was an estimate of 28-day mortality.

Results

Eight publications were included in the meta-analysis. Low-dose hydrocortisone therapy did not reduce 28-day mortality (N = 1063; odds ratio (OR) = 0.891, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69–1.15). Low-dose hydrocortisone therapy ameliorated shock at 7 days (6 RCTs, N = 964, OR = 2.078, 95% CI, 1.58–2.73, P < 0.0001, and I = 26.9%) and 28 days (6 RCTs, N = 947, OR = 1.495, 95% CI, 1.12–1.99, P = 0.006, and I = 0.0%).

Conclusions

Although low-dose hydrocortisone therapy ameliorates septic shock at 7 and 28 days, it does not reduce 28-day mortality.

### Effect of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine vs hydrocortisone alone on time alive and free of vasopressor support among patients with septic shock: the VITAMINS randomized clinical trial [^1161RWTh]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It is unclear whether vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine are more effective than hydrocortisone alone in expediting resolution of septic shock.

Objective

To determine whether the combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, compared with hydrocortisone alone, improves the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration in patients with septic shock.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted in 10 intensive care units in Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil that recruited 216 patients fulfilling the Sepsis-3 definition of septic shock. The first patient was enrolled on May 8, 2018, and the last on July 9, 2019. The final date of follow-up was October 6, 2019.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to the intervention group (n = 109), consisting of intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g every 6 hours), hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours), and thiamine (200 mg every 12 hours), or to the control group (n = 107), consisting of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours) alone until shock resolution or up to 10 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary trial outcome was duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration up to day 7. Ten secondary outcomes were prespecified, including 90-day mortality.

Results

Among 216 patients who were randomized, 211 provided consent and completed the primary outcome measurement (mean age, 61.7 years [SD, 15.0]; 133 men [63%]). Time alive and vasopressor free up to day 7 was 122.1 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 76.3–145.4 hours) in the intervention group and 124.6 hours (IQR, 82.1–147.0 hours) in the control group; the median of all paired differences was -0.6 hours (95% CI, -8.3 to 7.2 hours; p = 0.83). Of 10 prespecified secondary outcomes, 9 showed no statistically significant difference. Ninety-day mortality was 30/105 (28.6%) in the intervention group and 25/102 (24.5%) in the control group (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.69–2.00). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with septic shock, treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone, did not significantly improve the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration over 7 days. The finding suggests that treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine does not lead to a more rapid resolution of septic shock compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone.

### Use of hydrocortisone based on plasma biomarkers in patients with septic shock: another one bites the dust? [^115DthfA]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There are many strengths of the study. Embedding the study in a high-quality randomized clinical trial ensured prospective valid data collection with few missing data, including few patients lost to follow-up. The internal and external validity is high, and the results are applicable to other ICUs with a similar case mix. The comprehensive and prespecified statistical analysis plan, including the heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, increases the transparency and robustness of the results. The sample size was large with resulting precise estimates. The use of reliable techniques to measure the biomarkers increases the validity of the measurements.

Despite the many strengths, the study holds some limitations. Sampling 14% (529/3,800) of the ADRENAL trial participants and limiting the sampling to baseline-only measurements may have introduced bias. Although robust, prespecified, and comprehensive, the statistical analyses were not adjusted for multiplicity, which may have resulted in false positives (type 1 error). Finally, patients included in the ADRENAL trial did not receive fludrocortisone along with hydrocortisone, therefore limiting the applicability to clinical settings with similar practice.

The clinical implications from this important, well-planned, and reported ADRENAL substudy are multiple. First and foremost, the finding that patients with lower or higher concentrations of baseline total or free cortisol concentrations did not receive any greater or lesser clinical effect from hydrocortisone treatment suggests that initial plasma cortisol is not a useful biomarker to identify patients who may benefit from this treatment. Owing to the known undesirable effects of hydrocortisone, use of hydrocortisone outside the pragmatic clinical criteria used in the APROCCHSS or in the ADRENAL trials is discouraged. Second, there is no indication of any clinically relevant association between baseline aldosterone concentrations and patient-important outcomes, which may suggest that mineralocorticoid deficiency plays a limited role in the pathophysiology in septic shock. Finally, there is evidence that low levels of ascorbic acid (hypovitaminosis C) plays a limited role in patients with septic shock, which indirectly questions the proposed combination therapy with ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone, and thiamine as an effective treatment strategy in septic shock. This is further supported by the recently published CITRIS-ALI (Effect of Vitamin C Infusion on Organ Failure and Biomarkers of Inflammation and Vascular Injury in Patients with Sepsis and Severe Acute Respiratory Failure) and VITAMINS (Effect of Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone, and Thiamine versus Hydrocortisone Alone on Time Alive and Free of Vasopressor Support among Patients with Septic Shock) trials, which could not confirm any benefit from use of this combination therapy.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^116KynBD]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Replacement of thiamine and vitamin C

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential water-soluble substance that cannot be synthesised by the body. It has powerful antioxidant properties and functions as an important enzyme co-factor in the biosynthesis of endogenous catecholamines and vasopressin. It also enhances host defence mechanisms by improving macrophage and T-cell immunity. Levels of vitamin C remain extremely low in critically ill patients despite regular supplementation. This is exacerbated in patients with septic shock where vitamin C deficiency is common despite achieving targeted intake via enteral or parenteral nutrition. In a phase I study, high-dose intravenous vitamin C reduced organ failures and pro-inflammatory plasma biomarkers in severe sepsis with no reported adverse effects. Others have reported a significant reduction in vasopressor requirements with intravenous replacement of vitamin C. Further trials are ongoing, but intravenous replacement of vitamin C in septic shock is based on scientific rationale and appears to be a safe and useful intervention.

Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is a water-soluble vitamin with an essential role in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production. Absolute or relative thiamine deficiency is common in patients with septic shock. Such a deficiency may present as an unexplained lactic acidosis but remains undetected since routine red cell transketolase measurements are rarely available and often very costly. Intravenous thiamine replacement has been shown to reduce lactate levels and mortality in patients with proven thiamine deficiency. Furthermore, intravenous thiamine replacement may also be associated with a reduced need for renal replacement therapy and improved renal function in patients with septic shock.

Our practice is to give combined vitamin C (4.5 g/day) and thiamine (2.25 g/day) using three pairs of intravenous Pabrinex™ three times per day until shock has resolved. This dosing regimen has been used in our institution, hospital-wide, for several years to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy in alcoholics. Combination therapy may be more effective with the suggestion of a synergistic effect between the two agents. A recent retrospective cohort study demonstrated a dramatic reduction in organ failures, duration of vasopressor support, and mortality using combination treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine. The presence of thiamine may mitigate concerns over renal oxalate crystal precipitation secondary to high-dose vitamin C and, whilst more robust evidence is awaited, there appears to be little harm with this approach.

This study is a meta-analysis of RCTs. The RCTs of vitamin C therapy in sepsis or septic shock were searched in PubMed, EMBASE and Clinical Trials.gov from inception to January 16, 2023. We registered the protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42022354875). The primary outcome was delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 72–96 h. Two reviewers independently assessed RCTs according to eligibility criteria: (1) study type: RCT; (2) patient population: patients ≥ 18 years with sepsis or septic shock; (3) intervention: IVVC at any doses as monotherapy or combined with thiamine or and hydrocortisone compared with standard of care, no intervention or placebo (defined as control group); (4) the RCT described short-term mortality or SOFA score. Then, two authors independently extracted related information from RCTs.

Results

Eighteen RCTs (n = 3364 patients) were identified in this meta-analysis. There were significant effects in the delta SOFA score from baseline to 72–96 h (MD, -0.62; 95% CI, -1.00 to -0.25; p = 0.001) and the duration of vasopressor use (MD, -15.07; 95% CI, -21.59 to -8.55; p < 0.00001) with IVVC therapy. Treatment with IVVC was not shown to improve short-term mortality (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.04; p = 0.14); nevertheless, dose at 25–100 mg/kg/d subgroup associated with a significant reduction in short-term mortality (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; p = 0.03). An increase adverse event was observed in IVVC therapy (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.68; p = 0.03).

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis, IVVC in sepsis or septic shock patients significantly improved delta SOFA score and reduced the duration of vasopressor use, whereas it was not associated with reduction in short-term mortality and had higher adverse events.

### Early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine in adult patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^115R29mn]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this single-center, double-blind RCT of patients with septic shock, early initiation of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine combination therapy compared with placebo did not significantly impact 90-day mortality and the secondary outcomes.

There is accumulative evidence indicating that vitamin C or thiamine deficiency is a common complication of septic shock patients, which is associated with immune dysfunction and poor prognosis. The combination of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine might show synergetic effect in ameliorating the systemic inflammatory response, preventing progressive organ dysfunction and reducing mortality of the septic shock patients.

In spite of theoretical plausibility of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine combination therapy, our study's results do not provide any significant survival benefit in septic shock patients, which is consistent with the results of previous RCTs and meta-analyses. It is worth pointing out that Marik et al. and Chang et al. highlighted that the early use of the combination therapy appeared to be associated with patients' survival improvement. In our study, the diagnosis time of septic shock in included patients was within 12 h, which is earlier than previous studies. However, early use of combination treatment in our study did not result in survival benefits.

### Effect of adjunctive vitamin C, glucocorticoids, and vitamin B1 on longer-term mortality in adults with sepsis or septic shock: a systematic review and a component network meta-analysis [^116gUqMn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recently there has been considerable interest in "metabolic resuscitation" as adjunctive therapy for sepsis and septic shock. Such metabolic resuscitation has generally involved a combination of vitamin C, glucocorticoids, and vitamin B1 or one of its components. Vitamin C is depleted in patients with sepsis. After a phase I study of vitamin C suggested dose-dependent improvement in vascular tone and attenuation of organ dysfunction, many randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating this therapy have been undertaken. The role of glucocorticoids in sepsis or septic shock has also been extensively investigated. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs suggested that low dose glucocorticoids do not reduce mortality but are associated with a shorter duration of artificial organ support. Vitamin B1, an essential cofactor in cellular metabolism, is also depleted in patients with sepsis, and administration of vitamin B1 has been reported to reduce lactate levels in patients with sepsis.

Because a range of combinations of vitamin C, glucocorticoids, and vitamin B1 has been tested, the evidence-base for these treatments is complicated and cannot be summarized by a simple, conventional, pairwise meta-analysis. Accordingly, we conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) and component NMA to summarize the available evidence concerning these therapies and determine any incremental effect of each component when added to sepsis treatment.

Objectives

We aimed to assess whether vitamin C, glucocorticoids, and vitamin B1 alone or in combination improved patient outcomes by comparing the effect of different therapeutic regimens on mortality and other clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis or septic shock.

### Vitamin C for septic shock in previous randomized trials: implications of erroneous dosing, timing, and duration [^113mFcNS]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We read with interest the article by Rosengrave et al. on a pilot randomized trial to assess the efficacy of intravenous (IV) vitamin C for improving vasopressor requirements and other outcomes in patients with septic shock. They did not observe significant differences in the dose or duration of vasopressor use between the vitamin C and placebo groups. The authors argue that the study was limited by the small sample size (to detect differences in populations with a lower prevalence of vitamin C deficiency), insufficient dosage (median: 8 g/day), and delayed initiation of vitamin C (median: 18 h). Further studies considering these limitations are needed, although we would like to add several issues regarding vitamin C duration and patient heterogeneity.

Previous studies have demonstrated that some patients might experience hypovitaminosis C as early as 48 h after discontinuation of vitamin C infusion, regardless of the dosing regimen. Given that most randomized trials that failed to show a survival benefit of vitamin C limited its use to a maximum of 4 days, sustained therapy may be needed to obtain the favorable effects of vitamin C over time. In the CITRIS-ALI trial that evaluated the benefit of IV vitamin C among patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the mortality rate was 81% lower in the 4-day treatment group than in the placebo group. However, there was no between-group difference in mortality after treatment cessation. In the study by Rosengrave et al. the dosing regimen may have been "too short" to observe any treatment effects because half of the intervention group did not receive vitamin C for the entire 4 days. We recently assessed the efficacy of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine in a murine model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Vitamin C (45 mg/kg), hydrocortisone (1.5 mg/kg), and thiamine (3 mg/kg) were dissolved in 1 mL lactated Ringer's solution and administered intravenously starting 6 h after CLP and continued every 12 h for 4 days for a total of 8 doses. Fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy (25 mg/kg of imipenem in lactated Ringer's solution with 5% dextrose starting 6 h after CLP and continued every 12 h for a total of 6 doses) were also provided. Notably, over 50% of control mice died within 3 days of CLP, whereas all treated mice survived the 4-day intervention and only started to die after cessation of intervention (Fig. 1 a). Inflammatory biomarkers in serum measured 24 h after CLP (tumor necrosis factor-α) and in hepatocytes harvested 7 days after CLP (heme oxygenase 1 and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2) were significantly lower in the treated mice than in the control mice (Fig. 1 b, c). In addition, hepatocyte swelling and necrosis 7 days after CLP were markedly attenuated in the treated mice (Fig. 1 d). These findings are consistent with those in our previous nationwide cohort study that found significantly lower in-hospital mortality in sepsis patients treated with IV vitamin C for ≥ 5 days. In this study, the survival curves of patients who received vitamin C for 1–2 or 3–4 days tended to diverge earlier during the course of sepsis than did those of patients treated for ≥ 5 days.

### Resuscitation with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin in children with septic shock: a multicenter randomized pilot study [^116Ng5aC]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The highest lifetime incidence of sepsis occurs in childhood, with a worldwide 1990–2017 estimate of annual deaths of 3 million. In Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), our most contemporary data, 2006–2016, indicate that about one-in-six children with septic shock admitted to the PICUs die. Moreover, survivors frequently suffer serious sequelae, which affect long-term health-related quality of life. Most children with septic shock present with rapid deterioration, and in our ANZ 2012–2015 experience, half of the deaths occurred within 48 hours of presentation. These observations imply that there is need for early interventions to reverse pediatric septic shock close to the time of presentation.

IV corticosteroids are commonly used to treat pediatric septic shock refractory to initial resuscitation, albeit with no evidence for mortality benefit in children nor adults. Recently, adjunctive therapy combining hydrocortisone with high-dose ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and thiamin (HAT therapy, or "metabolic resuscitation") has been evaluated in adults with sepsis. This therapy is based on preclinical data informed by the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin C, as well as associations of thiamin deficiency with lactatemia. HAT therapy has been trailed in adults, but reports have divergent findings on mortality. There are no similar randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in children with sepsis. A propensity-matched study reported decreased 30-day mortality in 43 children with septic shock treated with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin. Therefore, we conducted the multicenter Resuscitation in Paediatric Sepsis Using Metabolic Resuscitation — A Randomized Controlled Study in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (RESPOND PICU) study to test the hypothesis that a trial of high-dose vitamin C, thiamin, and hydrocortisone would be feasible in children admitted to PICU with septic shock.

### Resuscitation with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin in children with septic shock: a multicenter randomized pilot study [^1121ozoo]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamin (HAT) have been evaluated extensively as adjunctive sepsis therapy in adults, but randomized data on children are lacking.
Observational data indicate survival benefits associated with this treatment in children with sepsis, which has led to some PICUs using HAT therapy off-label.
It is unknown if a protocol of HAT versus standard care is feasible in children with septic shock, and whether this intervention results in shorter survival free of organ dysfunction.

WHAT THIS STUDY MEANS

In this pilot randomized trial including 60 children with septic shock, a protocol comparing high-dose vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamin versus standard care was feasible. The findings of this pilot study can inform the design of a full randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Rates of parental consent were high, and treatment was delivered at a median of 44 minutes after randomization.
The assessment of primary outcome — organ dysfunction-free survival — was also a feasible measure, and we estimate a sample size of n = 384 for a future RCT.

### Resuscitation in paediatric septic shock using vitamin C and hydrocortisone (RESPOND): the RESPOND randomized controlled trial protocol [^111oHaK2]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2020 pediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines do not recommend in favor of or against the use of hydrocortisone in children with septic shock refractory to adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. The benefit of steroids in septic shock may be enhanced by vitamin C, a strong antioxidant that has been postulated to modulate multiple pathways dysregulated during septic shock. Despite the biological plausibility of combining vitamin C based therapies with hydrocortisone in sepsis and initial promising studies, there is low certainty evidence that vitamin C may reduce in-hospital and 30-day mortality in adults, conflicting with moderate certainty evidence suggesting harm toward 90-day mortality in adults.

A propensity-matched study in children with septic shock demonstrated the safety of vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, and reported decreased 30- and 90-day mortality compared with hydrocortisone alone, and compared with standard care without hydrocortisone. We performed a pilot study that confirmed the feasibility of a study protocol of early delivery of vitamin C and hydrocortisone in children admitted to the PICU with septic shock, permitting intervention at a time when a study drug may be more likely to alter the disease trajectory. Children with low levels of vitamin C on presentation to the PICU were significantly more likely to have single or multiple organ dysfunction 24 hours later. Based on these data and a systematic review confirming safety of high-dose IV vitamin C in children, we designed the Resuscitation in Paediatric Septic Shock using Vitamin C and Hydrocortisone (RESPOND) trial to test the primary hypothesis that, in children younger than 18 years with septic shock, using IV vitamin C (100 mg/kg 6 hr) with hydrocortisone (1 mg/kg 6 hr) will result in quicker resolution of shock compared with hydrocortisone alone and compared with standard care. Here we describe the RESPOND trial protocol.

### Outcomes of metabolic resuscitation using ascorbic acid, thiamine, and glucocorticoids in the early treatment of sepsis: the ORANGES trial [^111GVb9h]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a major public health burden resulting in 25% to 30% in-hospital mortality and accounting for over 20 billion dollars of US hospital costs.

Research Question

Does hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, thiamine (HAT) therapy improve clinical outcomes in sepsis and septic shock?

Study Design and Methods

This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted from February 2018 to June 2019, assessing an HAT treatment bundle for the management of septic and septic shock patients admitted to an ICU. The primary outcomes were resolution of shock and change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, ICU mortality, hospital mortality, procalcitonin clearance (PCT-c), hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and ventilator-free days.

Results

One hundred thirty-seven patients were randomized to the treatment group (n = 68) and comparator group (n = 69), respectively, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. A statistically significant difference was found in the time patients required vasopressors, indicating quicker reversal of shock in the HAT group compared with the comparator group (27 ± 22 vs 53 ± 38 hours, P < .001). No statistically significant change in SOFA score was found between groups 3 (1–6) vs 2 (0–4), P = .17. No significant differences were found between study arms in ICU and hospital mortality, ICU and hospital LOS, ventilator free days, and PCT-c.

Interpretation

Our results suggest that the combination of IV ascorbic acid, thiamine, and hydrocortisone significantly reduced the time to resolution of shock. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and assess any potential mortality benefit from this treatment.

### Association of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone infusion with long-term cognitive, psychological, and functional outcomes in sepsis survivors: a secondary analysis of the vitamin C, thiamine, and steroids in sepsis randomized clinical trial [^115mbPeF]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Vitamin C, Thiamine, and Steroids in Sepsis (VICTAS) randomized clinical trial was conducted between August 2018 and July 2019 to test the hypothesis that this combination therapy would improve clinically important outcomes in patients with sepsis-induced respiratory and/or circulatory failure. The trial was designed a priori to evaluate the primary objective of effects on mortality and ventilator- and vasopressor-free days, which were shown to be unaffected by the treatment regimen. In addition, the trial was designed for a secondary objective of examining the effects of this combination therapy on the cognitive, psychological, and functional status at the 6-month follow-up of participants in the intervention and control groups, which was the focus of this secondary analysis. We hypothesized that, among survivors of sepsis requiring vasopressor or ventilator support, early treatment with high-dose vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone improves cognitive performance, psychological symptoms, and functional status 6 months after randomization.

### Evaluating vitamin C in septic shock: a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C monotherapy [^113yokBr]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Improvement in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores over the 96-hour study period was similar between arms, as were time to lactate clearance, vasopressor duration, and mechanical ventilation duration (Table 2). Subjects in the vitamin C arm received more IV fluids within the first 6 hours after study drug initiation (1.07 L [IQR, 0.72–1.64 L] vs 0.76 L [IQR, 0.36–1.26 L]; p = 0.03); however, the clinical significance of this 310-mL difference is unclear, and by 24 hours, there were no statistically significant differences in total volume administered (3.59 L [IQR, 2.52–5.02 L] vs 3.37 L [IQR, 1.98–4.70 L]; p = 0.47) nor net total fluid balance (2.12 L [IQR, 1.10–3.59 L] vs 2.05 L [IQR, 1.24–3.11 L]; p = 0.93). ICU length of stay (2.9 d [IQR, 1.8–7.5 d] vs 2.6 d [IQR, 1.5–5.3 d]; p = 0.47) and hospital length of stay (8.9 d [IQR, 4.0–20.0 d] vs 6.3 d [IQR, 3.8–12.5 d]; p = 0.15) following study drug initiation were similar between the two arms. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the arms in serum creatinine changes over the study drug period, there was an increased need for RRT in the vitamin C arm compared with the placebo arm (16.7% vs 3.3%; p = 0.02).

### Pro / con clinical debate: are steroids useful in the management of patients with septic shock? [^114NdTst]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

Decision-making in the intensive care unit is often very difficult. Although we are encouraged to make evidence-based decisions, this may be difficult for a number of reasons. To begin with, evidence may not exist to answer the clinical question. Second, when there is evidence it may not be applicable to the patient in question or the clinician may be reluctant to apply it to the patient based on a number of secondary issues such as costs, premorbid condition or possible complications. Finally, emotions are often highly charged when caring for patients that have a significant chance of death, and care-givers as well as families are frequently prepared to take chances on a therapy whose benefit is not entirely clear. Steroid use in septic shock is an example of a therapy that makes some sense but has conflicting support in the literature. In this issue of Critical Care Forum, the two sides of this often heated debate are brought to the forefront in an interesting format.

### Early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine in adult patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^115sUQfb]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, among patients with septic shock, hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine did not appear to reduce the 90-day mortality compared with placebo. These data do not support routine use of this combination therapy for adult patients with septic shock.

### The role of glucocorticoids as adjunctive treatment for sepsis in the modern era [^113pHL7z]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids have been used as adjunctive therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock for more than four decades. The rationale for the use of glucocorticoids is that this class of drugs downregulates the proinflammatory response and limits the anti-inflammatory response while preserving innate immunity. Between 1976 and 2017, 22 randomised placebo-controlled trials have been published evaluating the benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock. These studies produced conflicting results. In 2018, two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were published evaluating the role of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock. The Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock (APROCCHSS) trial reported a reduction in 90-day mortality whereas the Adjunctive Corticosteroid Treatment in Critically Ill Patients with Septic Shock (ADRENAL) trial reported no mortality benefit. This Viewpoint critically appraises these two RCTs and evaluates the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock in the modern era.

### Association of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone infusion with long-term cognitive, psychological, and functional outcomes in sepsis survivors: a secondary analysis of the vitamin C, thiamine, and steroids in sepsis randomized clinical trial [^116uF2oo]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The cognitive scores of both the intervention and control groups were similar in magnitude to those reported in other cohorts of ICU survivors. The median differences in scores for the cognitive assessments were 1 to 2 points on scales ranging from 0 to 10 or 20 (range of 0–100 in Controlled Oral Word Association Test), reflecting a relatively modest potential effect of the intervention on 6-month cognitive outcome. The rates of depression, PTSD, and functional disability were also commensurate with those previously reported, and consistent with the outcomes typically observed in PICS.

Could antioxidant-based therapy truly play a role in increased risk of adverse cognitive, psychological, and functional sequelae among sepsis survivors? The increased odds of PTSD that was observed in the intervention group may have been mediated less by the role of vitamin C as an antioxidant and more by its modulation of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain. Vitamin C facilitates the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline). The latter neurotransmitter is the primary messenger of the locus coeruleus, which mediates physical and emotional responses to stress, and facilitates the consolidation of aversive memories. Blockade of norepinephrine receptors enables fear extinction in animals that are subjected to stressful stimuli, reinforcing the hypothesis that norepinephrine transmission plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PTSD. If the prevention of vitamin C deficiency during sepsis preserved norepinephrine metabolism, it is possible that this process affected the strength of aversive memory formation during the stressful ICU experience, leading to higher odds of PTSD. Coadministration of hydrocortisone with norepinephrine potentiates fear memory responsesand may have acted synergistically to increase risk of PTSD in the VICTAS trial participants. Alternatively, exogenous norepinephrine and/or corticosteroids may have played a role. A post hoc review of the clinical data revealed that 73.7% of participants in the follow-up cohort (68.6% in the control group, and 78.7% in the intervention group) received parenteral norepinephrine; 31.0% received a concomitant open-label corticosteroid. The differential roles of exogenous vs endogenous neurotransmitters in PTSD pathogenesis have yet to be elucidated. The lower rate of mental health care and higher rate of rehospitalization in the intervention group may also have influenced the risk of PTSD. Regardless of whether the difference in outcomes between groups is directly associated with treatment, the observed rate of PTSD (13.1% [28 of 213 participants in the follow-up cohort) was higher than the past-year prevalence of 3.5% to 6.1% in the general population, lending further support to the Society of Critical Care Medicine recommendations for post-ICU screening of PTSD and other PICS-related symptoms.

### Thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone as a metabolic resuscitation cocktail in sepsis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with trial sequential analysis [^115cXGvY]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Sepsis is a common condition in the ICU. Despite much research, its prognosis remains poor. In 2017, a retrospective before/after study reported promising results using a combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone called "metabolic resuscitation cocktail" and several randomized controlled trials assessing its effectiveness were performed.

Design

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in septic ICU patients to assess the effects of this combination therapy.

Setting

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to March of 2021. Data were extracted independently by two authors. The main outcome was the change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 72 hours. Secondary outcomes included renal composite endpoints (acute kidney injury) Kidney Disease - Improving Global Outcome organization stage 3 or need for renal replacement therapy, vasopressor duration, and 28-day mortality.

Subjects

We included randomized controlled trials with patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis or septic shock.

Intervention

The trials compared a combination of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and hydrocortisone to standard care or placebo in patients admitted to ICU with sepsis or septic shock.

Measurements and Main Results

We included eight randomized controlled trials (n = 1,335 patients). Within 72 hours, the median of mean improvement was -1.8 and -3.2 in the control and intervention groups, respectively (eight randomized controlled trials, n = 1,253 patients); weighted mean difference -0.82 (95% CI, -1.15 to -0.48). Data were homogeneous and the funnel plot did not suggest any publication bias. Duration of vasopressor requirement was significantly reduced in the intervention group (six randomized controlled trials). There was no evidence of a difference regarding the ICU mortality and the renal composite outcome (acute kidney injury KDIGO 3 or need for renal replacement therapy, seven randomized controlled trials).

Conclusions

Metabolic resuscitation cocktail administrated in ICU septic patients improves change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score within 72 hours. However, this improvement is modest and its clinical relevance is questionable. The impact on renal failure and mortality remains unclear.

### Vitamin therapy in sepsis [^113aVtiJ]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamins are essential micronutrients with key roles in many biological pathways relevant to sepsis. Some of these relevant biological mechanisms include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, protein and hormone synthesis, energy generation, and regulation of gene transcription. Moreover, relative vitamin deficiencies in plasma are common during sepsis and vitamin therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in some adult and pediatric studies. High-dose intravenous vitamin C has been the vitamin therapy most extensively studied in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock. This includes three randomized control trials (RCTs) as monotherapy with a total of 219 patients showing significant reduction in organ dysfunction and lower mortality when compared to placebo, and five RCTs as a combination therapy with thiamine and hydrocortisone with a total of 1134 patients showing no difference in clinical outcomes. Likewise, the evidence for the role of other vitamins in sepsis remains mixed. In this narrative review, we present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in sepsis, including vitamin C, thiamine (i.e., vitamin B 1), and vitamin D. We also present the relevant evidence of the other vitamins that have been studied in sepsis and critical illness in both children and adults, including vitamins A, B 2, B 6, B 12, and E. IMPACT: Vitamins are key effectors in many biological processes relevant to sepsis. We present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in pediatric sepsis. Designing response-adaptive platform trials may help fill in knowledge gaps regarding vitamin use for critical illness and association with clinical outcomes.

### Early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine in adult patients with septic shock: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^11732T6m]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs due to a dysregulated host response to infection. There were approximately 49 million cases of sepsis and 11 million sepsis-related deaths worldwide annually. Septic shock, a subset of sepsis, is characterized by circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities that are associated with a higher risk of mortality.

At present, there are no treatments directly targeting the pathogenesis of sepsis; therefore, management relies on early identification and treatment of infection through appropriate antibiotic therapy and/or source control, as well as the reversal of hemodynamic instability through fluid resuscitation and vasopressors, if necessary. Therefore, safe, effective, affordable adjuvant interventions that focus on mitigating dysregulated host responses in addition to standard therapy are urgently required.

A previous retrospective before–after study of 94 patients showed that early use of combination therapy with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine might prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The promising results of this study have aroused great interest of the therapeutic effects of the combination therapy with vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone among sepsis and septic shock patients. However, recently published prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted since then reported conflicting results in relation to survival outcomes, and limited specific data are available in septic shock patients. The VITAMINS and ACTS trials, which included patients diagnosed of septic shock within 24 h, both demonstrated no significant mortality difference between the combination therapy and control groups. It was assumed that beneficial effect could be achieved if the combination therapy initiated early. Therefore, we performed this randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of early administration of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine combination therapy for patients with diagnosis of septic shock within 12 h.

### Early administration of vitamin C in patients with sepsis or septic shock in emergency departments: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial: the C-EASIE trial [^112w7LUk]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a dysregulated body's response to infection causing organ dysfunction. It is the primary cause of death from infection, especially if not recognized and treated timely. Current practice guidelines, based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, focus on early identification and appropriate management in the initial hours. It encourages clinicians to quickly obtain blood cultures, administer broad spectrum antibiotics, start adequate fluid resuscitation, measure lactate, and begin vasopressors if clinically indicated. Despite implementation of these guidelines, mortality is still high. A recent meta-analysis reported a 30-day mortality of 37.2% and 24.4% for septic shock and sepsis, respectively.

This has led to the investigation of targeted agents that limit the inflammatory cascade, such as vitamin C. In addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions, vitamin C is also an essential cofactor for the metallo-enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of vasoactive catecholamines and vasopressin and may thus support endogenous vasopressor synthesis. It is known from previous research that critically ill patients, including those with sepsis, have significant lower vitamin C plasma levels.

Over the last decades there has been an upsurge in clinical trials evaluating vitamin C alone or as part of HAT therapy in patients with sepsis and septic shock. Initially mixed but promising results were found. Unfortunately, all the following randomized controlled trials (RCT) of HAT therapy, vitamin C and thiamine in combination or vitamin C alone did not show any significant benefit.

However, early administration of vitamin C after the onset of sepsis might be more effective as it may avoid the development of multi-organ dysfunction by preventing microvascular dysfunction, mitochondrial injury, and oxidative stress. Nevertheless, most previous studies were conducted in intensive care units (ICU) which resulted in a significant delay, an average up to 12 h after ICU admission, in the administration of vitamin C. This may have reduced the effectiveness of the intervention. Furthermore, in most trials, only patients with septic shock were included. By including patients at an earlier stage of disease, a more rapid solution of shock and less deterioration from sepsis to septic shock could be expected from vitamin C supplementation, hereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the aim of this trial was to evaluate the effects of early administration, within 6 h after arrival in the emergency department (ED), of vitamin C in patients with sepsis or septic shock.

### Vitamin C and thiamine for sepsis and septic shock [^111Nvr86]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Intravenous (IV) vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone have shown promise in reducing hospital mortality. The Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) similarly implemented this regimen, called the vitamin C protocol, for patients presenting in sepsis or septic shock in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

This retrospective study in Veteran ICU patients with sepsis or septic shock compared outcomes of patients treated with IV vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone (treatment) with those who received IV hydrocortisone alone (control). Data was propensity matched to ensure comparability at baseline. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was calculated at day of diagnosis (day 0) and daily for 3 subsequent days. At the 24-month follow-up, 12 months after the 1-year-intervention, survival and measures of mental and physical health were collected by telephone interviews.

Results

Hospital mortality, the primary outcome, did not differ significantly between groups. Secondary outcomes including ICU, 28-day, and 60-day mortality were also not different, nor were vasopressor duration or hospital length of stay. However, ICU length of stay was significantly reduced in the treatment group compared to control (7.1 vs 15.6 days, respectively, P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Although no significant mortality benefit was observed, the vitamin C protocol was not associated with patient harm. In this Veteran population, there was reduced ICU length of stay, suggesting possible benefit. Though further investigation is warranted, utilization of IV vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone in patients with sepsis or septic shock may be a treatment option worth considering.

### Effect of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine on organ injury in septic shock: the ACTS randomized clinical trial [^115jsrFK]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine has been identified as a potential therapy for septic shock.

Objective

To determine whether the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine attenuates organ injury in patients with septic shock.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, blinded, multicenter clinical trial of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine vs placebo for adult patients with septic shock. Two hundred five patients were enrolled between February 9, 2018, and October 27, 2019, at 14 centers in the United States. Follow-up continued until November 26, 2019.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive parenteral ascorbic acid (1500 mg), hydrocortisone (50 mg), and thiamine (100 mg) every 6 hours for 4 days (n = 103) or placebo in matching volumes at the same time points (n = 102).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range, 0–24; 0 = best) between enrollment and 72 hours. Key secondary outcomes included kidney failure and 30-day mortality. Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in analyses.

Results

Among 205 randomized patients (mean age, 68 [SD, 15] years; 90 [44%] women), 200 (98%) received at least 1 dose of study drug, completed the trial, and were included in the analyses (101 with intervention and 99 with placebo group). Overall, there was no statistically significant interaction between time and treatment group with regard to SOFA score over the 72 hours after enrollment (mean SOFA score change from 9.1 to 4.4 [-4.7] points with intervention vs 9.2 to 5.1 [-4.1] points with placebo; adjusted mean difference, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.7 to 0.2; p = 0.12 for interaction). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of kidney failure (31.7% with intervention vs 27.3% with placebo; adjusted risk difference, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; p = 0.58) or in 30-day mortality (34.7% vs 29.3%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8–2.2; p = 0.26). The most common serious adverse events were hyperglycemia (12 patients with intervention and 7 patients with placebo), hypernatremia (11 and 7 patients, respectively), and new hospital-acquired infection (13 and 12 patients, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with septic shock, the combination of ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine, compared with placebo, did not result in a statistically significant reduction in SOFA score during the first 72 hours after enrollment. These data do not support routine use of this combination therapy for patients with septic shock.

### Evaluating vitamin C in septic shock: a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C monotherapy [^115rP35c]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock are common reasons for admission to the ICU with 49 million cases and 11 million sepsis-associated deaths each year worldwide. A therapeutic role for vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplementation in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock has been suggested for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and in 2017, an observational before-and-after study reported a remarkable survival benefit with the use of a combination of hydrocortisone, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and thiamine (HAT therapy). Following this, several randomized controlled trials of HAT therapy or vitamin C and thiamine in combination for sepsis and septic shock have been conducted, but these studies did not show the same dramatic effects. Although modest improvements in time to reversal of shock and organ dysfunction were occasionally noted, no study demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit. One study of vitamin C alone for treatment of patients with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) did show a reduction in all-cause 28-day mortality in the vitamin C arm with a p value of 0.03; however, this was one of numerous secondary outcomes that obfuscates the statistical significance of the result.

Despite the existing trials of HAT therapy, questions about vitamin C as adjuvant monotherapy remain. First, prior investigations into vitamin C alone have been limited to small pilot studies and unblinded trials, and although the interactions between constituents in HAT therapy have been assumed to be synergistically positive, this has never been proven. Unexpected interactions may cancel out or otherwise convolute effects, thus limiting the ability to judge the performance of individual components from trials of a combined regimen. Second, randomized controlled trials of adjuvant corticosteroids for septic shock have recently demonstrated clinical benefit with a consistent signal of decreased duration of vasopressor therapy, which has the potential to confound any positive results from prospective investigations of HAT therapy.

In designing our trial, we noted pharmacokinetic studies of vitamin C, which have shown that trough levels of the drug occurring with bolus dosing may result in periodic hypovitaminosis, whereas continuous vitamin C delivery resulted in more stable serum levels. We, therefore, designed the Evaluating Vitamin C in SepTic Shock trial to assess the effect of continuously infused vitamin C monotherapy on all-cause ICU and 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock.

### Ascorbate-dependent vasopressor synthesis: a rationale for vitamin C administration in severe sepsis and septic shock? [^1179jZdH]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening systemic inflammatory response to infection which can result in multisystem organ dysfunction (severe sepsis) and refractory hypotension (septic shock). Sepsis is a complex, heterogeneous condition that can be caused by any infectious organism, with Gram-positive infections often predominating. A majority of septic patients have a pulmonary source of infection, such as pneumonia, which results in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Dysfunction of cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and central nervous systems can also occur in severe sepsis. The incidence of severe sepsis is increasing, due to an increasingly aging population, and is currently the leading cause of death in critically ill patients, with mortality rates of 30–50%. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign has recommended a number of strategies for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock, including fluid resuscitation, infection control, and respiratory and central nervous system support and, despite an increase in incidence, mortality rates appear to be declining.

Septic shock is characterised by severe alterations in the cardiovascular system, including ineffective tissue oxygenation, inappropriate peripheral vasodilation, myocardial dysfunction and altered blood flow distribution, resulting in hypotension refractory to intravenous fluid administration. Septic shock is typically managed through the administration of catecholamine vasopressors (dopamine, norepinephrine or epinephrine), with norepinephrine being the preferred vasoconstrictor. Vasopressin is also recommended in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines to raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease the norepinephrine dose. The Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) indicated that vasopressin provided equivalent mortality rates to norepinephrine in patients already receiving vasopressors. Exogenous vasopressor administration to patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, however, can result in adverse side effects such as decreased cardiac output and cardiac arrest, mesenteric ischaemia, skin necrosis, digital ischaemia and hyponatraemia.

Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies have indicated a potential role for ascorbate in ameliorating the pathophysiology of sepsis. Numerous studies of septic animals administered high-dose ascorbate have shown improved microvascular changes and survival (reviewed in). A number of mechanisms have been proposed for ascorbate's observed activities in sepsis, but these have primarily focused on its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions, including its effects on signal transduction pathways in vascular cells (reviewed in). In contrast, very little attention has been paid to ascorbate's enzyme cofactor activities, particularly its role in the synthesis of vasopressors. In this review we present the hypothesis that adjuvant ascorbate could support endogenous vasopressor synthesis in severe sepsis and septic shock through acting as an essential cofactor for the metallo-enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of vasoactive catecholamines and vasopressin.

### Thiamine for septic shock: take your vitamins? [^116dD5Sf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis remains a leading cause of death in hospitals. In the presence of timely antibiotics, infection source control, and performance improvement projects, most ancillary therapies for sepsis have not demonstrated benefits in clinical trials. Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, has been investigated for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock, as thiamine deficiency has been reported in patients with sepsis. Many clinicians are familiar with the use of thiamine to correct low concentrations in patients with alcohol use disorder, and it has previously been studied in sepsis in conjunction with vitamin C and hydrocortisone.

Thiamine is an essential nutrient that plays a key role in energy generation and regulation of gene transcription, and its deficiency can lead to impaired cellular metabolism and organ dysfunction. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active form of thiamine, enters mitochondria to play as a cofactor in the Krebs cycle and facilitate transformation of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A. Therefore, thiamine deficiency can raise lactate and lower ATP production. TPP also aids the pentose phosphate pathway and antioxidant synthesis. Thiamine deficiency can increase oxidative stress and might affect inflammation responses.

Thiamine replacement can reduce lactate concentrations in critically ill patients and appeared to benefit certain patients with septic shock at increased risk for thiamine deficiency; however, the potential benefits and risks have yet to be fully understood.

In this issue of the Journal, articles by Moskowitz and colleagues (pp.) and Pereira and colleagues (pp.) report the results of modest-sized randomized clinical trials on thiamine for septic shock. Moskowitz and colleagues conducted an exploratory, multicenter, randomized trial (TRPSS trial) investigating the effects of thiamine versus placebo on kidney function (measured by serum creatinine changes at 72 h from enrollment) in adult patients with septic shock. The trial included 95 adult patients with septic shock and serum creatinine > 1.0 mg/dl at three ICUs in the United States; 88 patients received one or more doses of the drug. The thiamine group received 200 mg of intravenous thiamine every 12 hours for 3 days, and the placebo group received a matching volume of 0.9% NaCl. The trial was quadruple blinded, with participants, investigators, clinical teams, and outcomes assessors blinded to the allocation.

### Plasma cortisol, aldosterone, and ascorbic acid concentrations in patients with septic shock Do not predict treatment effect of hydrocortisone on mortality. A nested cohort study [^1174vTKL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Whether biomarkers can identify subgroups of patients with septic shock with differential treatment responses to hydrocortisone is unknown. Objectives: To determine if there is heterogeneity in effect for hydrocortisone on mortality, shock resolution, and other clinical outcomes based on baseline cortisol, aldosterone, and ascorbic acid concentrations. Methods: From May 2014 to April 2017, we obtained serum samples from 529 patients with septic shock from 22 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. Measurements and Main Results: There were no significant interactions between the association with 90-day mortality and treatment with either hydrocortisone or placebo for total cortisol (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.16 vs. OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00–1.13; P = 0.70), free cortisol (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04–1.38 vs. OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02–1.32; P = 0.75), aldosterone (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97–1.05 vs. OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98–1.04; P = 0.99), or ascorbic acid (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.89–1.39 vs. OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91–1.22; P = 0.70), respectively. Similar results were observed for the association with shock resolution. Elevated free cortisol was significantly associated with 90-day mortality (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00–1.27; P = 0.04), but total cortisol, aldosterone, and ascorbic acid were not. Conclusions: In patients with septic shock, there was no heterogeneity in effect of adjunctive hydrocortisone on mortality, shock resolution, or other clinical outcomes based on cortisol, aldosterone, and ascorbic acid concentrations. Plasma aldosterone and ascorbic acid concentrations are not associated with outcome.

### Effect of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone on ventilator-and vasopressor-free days in patients with sepsis: the VICTAS randomized clinical trial [^115UfHdb]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Sepsis is a common syndrome with substantial morbidity and mortality. A combination of vitamin C, thiamine, and corticosteroids has been proposed as a potential treatment for patients with sepsis.

Objective

To determine whether a combination of vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone every 6 hours increases ventilator- and vasopressor-free days compared with placebo in patients with sepsis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, adaptive-sample-size, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adult patients with sepsis-induced respiratory and/or cardiovascular dysfunction. Participants were enrolled in the emergency departments or intensive care units at 43 hospitals in the United States between August 2018 and July 2019. After enrollment of 501 participants, funding was withheld, leading to an administrative termination of the trial. All study-related follow-up was completed by January 2020.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g), thiamine (100 mg), and hydrocortisone (50 mg) every 6 hours (n = 252) or matching placebo (n = 249) for 96 hours or until discharge from the intensive care unit or death. Participants could be treated with open-label corticosteroids by the clinical team, with study hydrocortisone or matching placebo withheld if the total daily dose was greater or equal to the equivalent of 200 mg of hydrocortisone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the number of consecutive ventilator- and vasopressor-free days in the first 30 days following the day of randomization. The key secondary outcome was 30-day mortality.

Results

Among 501 participants randomized (median age, 62 [interquartile range {IQR}, 50–70] years; 46% female; 30% Black; median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 27 [IQR, 20.8–33.0]; median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 9 [IQR, 7–12]), all completed the trial. Open-label corticosteroids were prescribed to 33% and 32% of the intervention and control groups, respectively. Ventilator- and vasopressor-free days were a median of 25 days (IQR, 0–29 days) in the intervention group and 26 days (IQR, 0–28 days) in the placebo group, with a median difference of -1 day (95% CI, -4 to 2 days; p = 0.85). Thirty-day mortality was 22% in the intervention group and 24% in the placebo group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among critically ill patients with sepsis, treatment with vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase ventilator- and vasopressor-free days within 30 days. However, the trial was terminated early for administrative reasons and may have been underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.

### Ascorbic acid, corticosteroids, and thiamine in sepsis: a review of the biologic rationale and the present state of clinical evaluation [^115bVion]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common and highly morbid condition with an estimated 1.7 million cases occurring in the United States each year, resulting in over 270,000 deaths. Despite advances in critical care practices, sepsis remains the most common cause of death in non-cardiac intensive care units (ICUs). Even among sepsis patients who survive their hospital stay, residual organ dysfunction requiring ongoing treatment after discharge is common. Despite this high level of mortality and morbidity, antibiotics and source control remain the only focused therapies for this condition. In a small, retrospective observational study of septic ICU patients, the combination of thiamine (200 mg every 12 h), ascorbic acid (1500 mg every 6 h), and hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 h) was associated with a dramatic improvement in organ injury, time to shock reversal, and mortality as compared to historical controls at the same hospital. Each component of this combination of therapies has been recently evaluated individually in septic shock patients. A prior pilot randomized trial found that the provision of thiamine to septic shock patients with elevated lactate attenuated organ dysfunction (particularly renal dysfunction) and reduced lactate levels and potentially mortality in those patients with baseline thiamine deficiency. In addition, two small randomized trials of ascorbic acid vs placebo in sepsis have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes. Finally, while there have been mixed results with respect to the benefit of corticosteroids in septic shock generally, the addition of corticosteroids to ascorbic acid may have a synergistic effect.

In the present article, we review the biologic basis for and existing data supporting the use of thiamine, ascorbic acid, and corticosteroids in sepsis. We discuss the use of this drug combination in current clinical practice and the rationale for the currently enrolling Ascorbic Acid, Corticosteroids, and Thiamine in Sepsis (ACTS) trial, as well as other clinical trials addressing this question.

### Targeting the host response in sepsis: current approaches and future evidence [^1148jzBF]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Glucocorticoids have potent anti-inflammatory properties such as inhibition of innate immune response and endothelial activation. Clinical trials of glucocorticoids in sepsis yielded controversial results, with some showing improved outcomes and others reporting no or even adverse effects. Therefore, current guidelines contain only a weak recommendation for hydrocortisone in septic shock. Recently, however, a clear indication for dexamethasone in severe COVID-19 has been established, shedding new light on the efficacy of glucocorticoids in a homogenous population of critical ill patients. In addition, recent data, including the CAPE-COD trial, showed that patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia who received hydrocortisone had a lower mortality rate. These promising data from specific patient populations may also lead to a renaissance of glucocorticoid therapy in the context of subgrouping sepsis patients.

Vitamin C

Vitamin C is an antioxidant with pleiotropic anti-inflammatory activity that is depleted in response to oxidative stress, which is one reason to investigate the effect of vitamin C, either alone or in random combinations with hydrocortisone and thiamine. While initial studies suggested improved outcomes in sepsis, further studies could not confirm a beneficial effect. The CITRIS-ALI RCT showed that vitamin C did not significantly improve organ dysfunction scores or inflammatory markers in patients with sepsis and ARDS. Similarly, the VITAMINS trial, which examined the use of vitamin C in septic shock, found no significant improvement in survival without vasopressor administration for 7 days. The LOVIT trial, an RCT including patients with septic shock, found that vitamin C therapy increased the risk of a composite end point-death or persistent organ dysfunction at day 28. Yet, recent meta-analyses found an improvement in delta — sequential organ failure assessment (delta-SOFA) score and a reduction in the duration of vasopressor use, whereas short-term mortality was not affected. Because the role of vitamin C in sepsis remains uncertain, it should only be used in the context of RCTs. Such studies are underway and may provide more insight into optimal dosing and treatment duration, as well as the patient population that will benefit most from vitamin C therapy (Table 1).

Organ dysfunction in sepsis

The traditional paradigm of organ dysfunction in sepsis has focused on decreased systemic vascular resistance resulting in decreased organ perfusion, and ultimately impaired oxygen delivery. Numerous studies, however, have shown that organ dysfunction can occur during sepsis and septic shock even in the absence of decreased perfusion. Notably, histopathologic analyses of organs following death from sepsis often fail to demonstrate any substantial amount of ischemic injury, but rather reveal remarkably preserved parenchyma or a predominant pattern of apoptosis, suggesting alternative mechanisms of organ dysfunction apart from hypoperfusion and independent of cellular oxygen delivery. A number of such mechanisms have been proposed and include mitochondrial dysfunction with resultant bioenergetic failure, a direct effect of the immune response to infection (related to pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns), microvascular abnormalities, endothelial dysfunction, and inter-organ cross-talk.
