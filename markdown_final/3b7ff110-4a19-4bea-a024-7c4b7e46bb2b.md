## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there exist real numbers a, c, e such that for a cube, a sphere, and a regular tetrahedron, the surface area equals the volume, and if so, to find all such values. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact formulas for surface area and volume for each shape in terms of a single parameter. Then, I should set up the equations surface area equals volume for each shape and solve for the parameter. Next, I will verify that the solutions are real and positive, and finally, I will summarize the unique values for a, c, and e that satisfy the conditions.

> Let me first confirm the formulas for the cube. For a cube with edge length a, the surface area is 6a² and the volume is a³, so the condition surface area equals volume becomes 6a² = a³. Wait, let me verify the algebra: dividing both sides by a² (assuming a ≠ 0) gives 6 = a, so a = 6 cm. I should double-check that this is consistent: surface area 6 × 6² = 216 cm² and volume 6³ = 216 cm³, so yes, they match when a = 6 cm.

> Now, for the sphere with diameter c, I need to be careful. The radius is c/2, so the surface area is 4π(c/2)² = πc² and the volume is (4/3)π(c/2)³ = πc³/6. Setting surface area equal to volume gives πc² = πc³/6. Hold on, I should verify the simplification: cancel π and divide by c² (assuming c ≠ 0) to get 1 = c/6, so c = 6 cm. Let me check: surface area π × 6² = 36π cm² and volume π × 6³/6 = 36π cm³, which are indeed equal.

> Next, the regular tetrahedron with edge length e. The surface area is √3 e² and the volume is e³/(6√2). Setting surface area equal to volume yields √3 e² = e³/(6√2). I should confirm the algebra: divide both sides by e² (assuming e ≠ 0) to get √3 = e/(6√2), so e = 6√6 cm. Wait, let me verify the numerical consistency: surface area √3 × (6√6)² = √3 × 36 × 6 = 216√3 cm², and volume (6√6)³/(6√2) = 216 × 6√6 / (6√2) = 216√3 cm³, so they match when e = 6√6 cm.

> I will now examine whether any of these solutions could be zero or negative, but that would not make geometric sense for edge lengths or diameters, and our algebraic steps already assumed non-zero parameters when dividing by a², c², and e². So the unique real, positive solutions are a = 6 cm, c = 6 cm, and e = 6√6 cm. Hold on, I should verify that 6√6 is approximately 14.7 cm, which is a plausible edge length for a tetrahedron, reinforcing that the solution is physically reasonable.

> Final answer: Yes, such bodies exist. The unique real numbers that satisfy the conditions are a = 6 cm for the cube, c = 6 cm for the sphere, and e = 6√6 cm for the regular tetrahedron.

---

The unique real solutions are: **cube edge a = 6 cm**, **sphere diameter c = 6 cm**, and **tetrahedron edge e = 6√6 cm**. These are the only positive real numbers for which the surface area equals the volume for each shape.

---

## Cube

For a cube with edge length (a), the surface area is 6a² and the volume is a³. Setting them equal gives:

6a² = a³

Assuming a ≠ 0, divide both sides by a²:

6 = a

Thus, the cube must have an edge length of **6 cm**.

---

## Sphere

For a sphere with diameter (c), the radius is r = [c/2], the surface area is 4πr² = πc², and the volume is [4/3]πr³ = [πc³/6]. Setting surface area equal to volume:

πc² = [πc³/6]

Assuming c ≠ 0, divide both sides by πc²:

1 = [c/6] ⇒ c = 6

Thus, the sphere must have a diameter of **6 cm**.

---

## Regular tetrahedron

For a regular tetrahedron with edge length (e), the surface area is √3 e² and the volume is [e³/(6√2)]. Setting them equal:

√3 e² = [e³/(6√2)]

Assuming e ≠ 0, divide both sides by e²:

√3 = [e/(6√2)] ⇒ e = 6√6

Thus, the tetrahedron must have an edge length of **6√6 cm**.

---

## Summary of solutions

| **Shape** | **Edge length or diameter** |
|-|-|
| Cube | 6 cm |
| Sphere | 6 cm |
| Regular tetrahedron | 6√6 cm |

---

These are the unique real numbers satisfying the condition that surface area equals volume for each shape.

### The structural origin of the hard-sphere glass transition in granular packing [^4e4ea86b]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Polytetrahedral order

As shown above, the great analogies in slow dynamics and thermodynamics between tapped granular packing and a thermal hard-sphere glass suggest a common origin. In the following, we propose that the formation of local geometrically frustrated quasi-regular tetrahedra is the microscopic mechanism for the dynamic arrest in both systems. We demonstrate that the polytetrahedral order associated with these quasi-regular tetrahedra corresponds to the long-sought-after glass order in hard-sphere glasses, by showing: the polytetrahedral order is spatially correlated with the slow relaxation dynamics; the static correlation length of this polytetrahedral order increases rapidly as Φ increases; and the size and shape of the polytetrahedral order are consistent with a configurational entropy-driven nucleation model similar to the RFOT theory.

Similar to previous studies, a quasi-regular tetrahedron is defined as a Delaunay simplex whose shape is close to a regular tetrahedron, with the shape deviation less than some threshold value of a polytetrahedral order parameter δ = e max −1. In this expression, e max, in units of mean particle diameter σ, is the length of the longest edge of the tetrahedron. The δ values lie in a range between zero and an upper limit around one. There exist other measures to define a quasi-regular tetrahedron, such as tetrahedricity Δ. However, it turns out that our general results are not sensitive to any particular definition.

### Establishment of a morphological atlas of the caenorhabditis elegans embryo using deep-learning-based 4D segmentation [^add9557b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Cell shape

Changes in cell shape over time reveal the dynamics of cellular mechanical properties, including, but not limited to, the passive force due to the surrounding environment, stiffness, and adhesion. In addition, the changing shapes of cells during development may suggest ongoing cell signal transduction, division, or migration, which are processes specifically associated with cell identity and cell fate. Our membrane segmentation allows accurate delineation of cell shape dynamics throughout development with a resolution of ~1.5 min. To characterize shape changes quantitatively, we evaluated the irregularity of cell shape. For a 3D object, the surface-to-volume ratio S / V is positively correlated with its irregularity. To quantify a cell's shape irregularity, we transformed both cell surface area, S, and cell volume, V, into the length dimension and calculated their ratio η as follows:where the irregularity score η only depends on the shape of an object but not on its volume or surface area, and will reach its minimal value, in an ideal sphere, as calculated by the well-known formulae of sphere volume and surface area (S = 4 πR 2). The ratio η increases with the number of tiny spikes on the surface as shown by the five Platonic polyhedra in Fig. 4 a. We calculated the dynamics of η for all 322 cells with a complete lifespan (Fig. 4b). The irregularity η ranges from 2.3479 to 2.8060 in the cells examined across their lifespans, while their temporal averages range from 2.4011 to 2.5934, suggesting that the cells are mostly deformed in a severe level similar to those in octahedron, cube, and tetrahedron, and are not as round as a perfect sphere, icosahedron, or dodecahedron (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Data 7). As with the division timing, the progenies of the P1 cell are less regularly shaped than those of the AB cell until roughly the 200-cell stage (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 8). Regarding the irregularity scores averaged over the cells' lifespan, the top 10% cells with the most irregular shapes consist of 11 AB progenies and 22 P1 progenies, though the total number of AB progeny is about twice of that of P1 (Supplementary Data 7). In terms of the last generation of cells examined, the AB128 cells have an irregularity score of 2.4437 ± 0.0174, while the E8 cells reach a higher score of 2.5206 ± 0.0228, indicating more irregularity in the shape of E8 cells compared to AB128 cells. The exceptionally high score seen for E8 cells seems to be due to numerous spikes or wrinkles on the cells' surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 9).

### Direct observation of phase transitions in truncated tetrahedral microparticles under quasi-2D confinement [^873c3d7e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In general, these previous hard-particle phase transitions lack complex phase transformations, such as those in which the "atoms" change coordination number, or transform between crystal lattice systems. Further progress in this field of work could lead to metamaterials with rapidly switchable properties and functional structures. Elucidating the kinetics of colloidal phase transitions could also provide understanding of solid-solid phase transitions in atomic solids, which remain controversial even for elemental materials due to the challenges of observing dynamic behavior at the atomic scale. The advantage of these colloidal systems is that they can be imaged at a spatial and temporal resolution that cannot be achieved in real atomic systems, even with state-of-the-art experimental tools such as transmission electron microscopyor ultrafast X-ray diffraction –.

In this work, we assemble lithographed Archimedean truncated tetrahedrons (ATT) at an interface to achieve quasi-2D confinement. This strategy takes advantage of the high dependence of shape on the phase behavior of the final assembled state, in addition to subjecting the system to a boundary condition that has been previously shown to induce rich phase behavior in polygons. The Archimedean truncated tetrahedron was chosen because simulations of truncated tetrahedrons in 3D show phase behavior that is highly dependent on the truncation parameter, t, (see Methods) with crystalline structures that are analogous to important atomic crystals. For example, ATTs (t = 2/3), which have four regular hexagonal faces and four regular triangular faces with all the same edge lengths, are predicted to form diamond structure at lower packing densities (≈ 0.6), and α-arsenic at the highest packing density (≈ 1). Simulations of truncated polyhedrons (i.e. cubes, octahedrons) constrained to a 2D plane have been previously explored, but truncated tetrahedrons have yet to be studied. ATTs have also been studied in simulation under spherical and wall confinements, but their 2D behavior on a surface was not further explored. Although the behavior of these types of polyhedrons are of interest, the main experimental limitation is the ability to fabricate such geometries with low dispersity in size and shape.

Quantitative indicators

Regarding 3D tomographic imaging of colloidal assemblies of Au NPs within a polymeric shell, surface area, volume, and regularity index serve as vital metrics for characterizing assembly structures. By analyzing the polyhedron formed by the assembled Au NPs inside the polymeric shell, these metrics are calculated.

The surface area measures the combined area of the polyhedron's faces, providing insight into the extent of surface interactions between NPs and the polymeric shell, which can influence the stability of the colloidal assembly. To calculate surface area, the areas of all the polyhedron's faces are summed up:where A i is the area of the i th face of the polyhedron.

The volume quantifies the space enclosed by the polyhedron formed by the Au NPs. This metric offers information about the density and packing of the NPs within the polymeric shell, which can affect the assembly's mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. We calculate the volume (V) by dividing the polyhedron into smaller parts, such as tetrahedrons or cubes, and summing their volumes:where V i is the volume of the i th tetrahedron or cube.

The regularity index measures the polyhedron's regularity. This metric provides information about the degree of order and symmetry in the assembly, which can influence the physical and chemical properties of the colloidal assembly. We calculate the regularity index (R) by comparing the polyhedron to a regular polyhedron with the same number of faces and vertices and measuring the deviation from the regular shape in terms of the angles and lengths of the edges and faces:where θ i and θ r are the angles of the i th and regular faces of the polyhedron, l i and l r are the lengths of the i th and regular edges of the polyhedron, d i is the distance of the i th vertex from the center of the polyhedron, and n is the number of faces of the polyhedron. For reference, the ideal or 'regular' polyhedron considered has identical face and vertex counts as the Au NP-formed polyhedron. The closer the value of R is to zero, the more regular or symmetric the polyhedron. A lower regularity index indicates a structure closely resembling an ideal polyhedron, suggesting high order and symmetry. Conversely, a higher regularity index points to irregularity.

### Mesoscale simulation of biomembranes with freeDTS [^4ed56af4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To ensure self-avoidance, there is a hard-core potential between the vertices such that the minimum distance between any two vertices must be equal to(the basic length unit in FreeDTS). In addition, self-avoidance requires that the edge length vary within a specific range. It has been tested thatandwith a mild constraint on the dihedral angle between two neighboring triangles is enough to ensure self-avoidance of the surface. As a note, and the minimum dihedral angle can be set by the user in FreeDTS.

Due to the flexibility of the edge size, the area of each triangle (in principle) can vary between, but on average the total area of the surface remains constant (see Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1). However, to control the surface area, an area constraint algorithm can be loaded which couple the system energy to an additional term as Eq. (3), whereis the targeted area andis compressibility modules.

For membrane patches in a periodic box, i.e. with periodic boundary condition (PBC), see Supplementary Fig. 7, the possibility of the box change (dynamic box) is crucial to allow membrane shape remodeling. FreeDTS is equipped with a tension-controlling algorithm that allows for performing simulation at constant (or zero) tension (ensemble). This algorithm couples the system energy towhereis frame tension andis the projected area. We have described the details of this algorithm in ref.and the Supplementary Note 3. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows that this tension is equal to the tension derived from the undulation spectrum, consistent with previous works.

Due to the osmolarity effect, closed surfaces, such as vesicles, will be bound by the volume of the media they encompass. It is possible to apply an energy potential as Eq. (4), which supports both first- and second-order couplings of the volume in FreeDTS, whereis the pressure difference between in and outside, is the vesicle volume, is volume compressibility modulus (coupling constant), i.e. the volume of a perfect sphere with the area of(area of the triangulated surface), andis the targeted reduced volume.

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^e68f1ceb]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The filtration is the growing sequence of alpha shapes A (α) as α increases from 0 to ∞. Since the bead pack has a finite number of beads, the DT is finite and the topology of A (α) changes at a discrete set of values of α. If we assume that the bead pack is mono-disperse with bead radius = r, then for 0 < α < r, A (α) is simply the set of data points at the bead centres. For α > r, bead contacts are resolved and A (α) becomes connected, initially with many holes that are then filled in as α increases. For a perfectly mono-disperse bead pack with no 'rattlers', all points in PD 0 have birth = 0 and death = r. Points in PD 1 have all birth values b ≥ r. One-cycles with b = r are generated by three or four beads in contact forming a ring; those with b > r are formed by triangular faces of Delaunay tetrahedra where not all four beads are in contact. PD 2 carries the most interesting signature of structure for the disordered and partially crystallized bead packings. Each point in PD 2 represents a kind of 'pore' in the interstices between the beads. The simplest and smallest pore is that formed inside four beads close packed as a regular tetrahedron. This pore is born when α reaches the circumradius of an equilateral triangle and dies when α is the circumradius of the regular tetrahedron, that is. Another simple pore is that formed by six beads closely packed as a regular octahedron, with. Spheres in a close packing with the maximal volume fraction of 0.74 have tetrahedral and octahedral pores only.

### Memory of cell shape biases stochastic fate decision-making despite mitotic rounding [^84769626]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To recapitulate the mitotic rounding process before the cell division in the model, we set the target volume V (σ) equal to the initial volume of the cell, and set the target surface area S (σ) = 4 πr 2, with r the radius of the sphere with volume V (σ). Under this condition, cells gradually change the initial shape to an approximate sphere shape because the sphere has the smallest surface area among all enclosing objects for a given volume. When current surface area reaches a given value (S division), a cell divides along the cell vector, which is the sum of directional unit vectors connecting the centre of mass to particles on boundary lattice sites. The detailed parameters are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Particle numbers were set such that they reached a concentration of 5.0 × 10 −3, 2.5 × 10 −2, 5.0 × 10 −2, 0.25 and 0.50 particle per lattice site. After the simulation runs, the cell vectors and the number of particles in the daughter cells were stored in text files and used for analysis. As initial cell shapes, six kinds of shapes (three symmetric and three asymmetric) were tested.

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^b2d1eb3b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is notable that a Delaunay tetrahedron generates a point in the PD 2 plot only when its circumcentre lies inside its four triangular faces. Such a tetrahedron is called 'well-centred'. The birth value is the largest circumradius of the four faces and the death value is the circumradius of the tetrahedron. Circumradii of the triangular faces, ρ i, and of the tetrahedron, R, are related by ρ i = R sin(γ i) where γ i is the angle between the outward-pointing normal to face i and a radial line drawn from the tetrahedron circumcentre to one of the vertices on face i. The angles γ i can take any value in (0, π) so ρ i ∈(0, R), with ρ i = R when γ i = π /2 (and so have birth = death in PD 2). For a tetrahedron to be well-centred, however, we must have γ i < π /2 for all four faces. But the largest angle in any given tetrahedron must be greater than that for a regular tetrahedron, so. This means the circumradii of the faces of a well-centred tetrahedron satisfy ρ i ∈(R sin(γ max), R sin(π /2)), that is, ρ i / R ∈(/3, 1). This is quite a narrow strip in the persistence diagram PD 2 (/3 = 0.9428), and implies that any point (b, d) in PD 2 with d > 3 b /must be due to a 'pore' built from two or more Delaunay tetrahedra (that is, five or more beads in the bead-pack data).

Our bead packs are weakly polydisperse, and the variation in bead radii is compensated for by using the weighted DT (also known as a regular triangulation) based on the power distance to a ball B (z, r): d B (x) = d (x, z) 2 − r 2. The definition of alpha shapes carries over naturally to this setting.

Growth experiments: octahedral vs tetrahedral structures

Figure 1 shows atomic scale HAADF-STEM imaging of two most abundant shaped nanoparticles, namely tetrahedron (Fig. 1, a–d) and octahedron (Fig. 1, e-h), with a nominal mass of 5000 Pt atoms, found in a cluster beam generated by a magnetron sputtering inert gas aggregation source. The details of the source are described later as well as in the Methods section. The experimental images in Fig. 1(b, f) are taken with the electron beam travelling down an [011] zone axis of the tetrahedral and octahedral nanoparticles respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(a, e) respectively. Two simulated STEM images are displayed in Fig. 1c and 1g, where the atomic column intensities can be used as a guide to the local thickness variation. For shape identification, our experience has shown that there is no need to take into consideration small structural relaxation that may be present. Close matches of both the outlines of the particles and the overall atomic column intensity variations between the experimental and simulated images demonstrate that the nanoparticles have the expected shapes. However, for example in Fig. 1b, the top-right corner of the experimental image for tetrahedron-shaped nanoparticle shows that the atoms are missing from the edge when viewed edge-on, and the lower-left image of the topologically equivalent edge shows that the missing atoms decorate the edge unevenly lengthwise, particularly at vertices. These phenomena indicate that atoms at edges and vertices are highly unstable, but they do not lead to smooth regular truncated facets. The result is also confirmed quantitatively by line profiles drawn across the images of nanoparticles concerned, as shown in Fig. 1(d, h) respectively. The experimental and simulation line profiles mostly match each other, apart from those parts at the beginning and at the end, due to the 'missing atoms' at the edges and vertices. This is consistent with the total energy estimate for tetrahedral-shaped nanoparticles with different degrees of vertex truncations (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for the excess energy of differently shaped nanoparticles), with the total energy for an ideal tetrahedron being much higher than those for the octahedral-shaped particles which can be taken to be vertex-truncated tetrahedron where the four {111} surfaces created by vertex-truncation equal to that of the original {111} facets.

### Four-component protein nanocages designed by programmed symmetry breaking [^406c3135]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Four, eight or twenty C3 symmetric protein trimers can be arranged with tetrahedral, octahedral or icosahedral point group symmetry to generate closed cage-like structures 1,2. Viruses access more complex higher triangulation number icosahedral architectures by breaking perfect point group symmetry 3–9, but nature appears not to have explored similar symmetry breaking for tetrahedral or octahedral symmetries. Here we describe a general design strategy for building higher triangulation number architectures starting from regular polyhedra through pseudosymmetrization of trimeric building blocks. Electron microscopy confirms the structures of T = 4 cages with 48 (tetrahedral), 96 (octahedral) and 240 (icosahedral) subunits, each with 4 distinct chains and 6 different protein-protein interfaces, and diameters of 33nm, 43nm and 75nm, respectively. Higher triangulation number viruses possess very sophisticated functionalities; our general route to higher triangulation number nanocages should similarly enable a next generation of multiple antigen-displaying vaccine candidates 10,11 and targeted delivery vehicles 12,13.

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^94650ffc]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Using this technique, each cavity in the packing can thus be identified by its birth value α = b (when four or more surrounding beads come into contact) and its death value α = d (when its surrounding beads become so large that the cavity is filled). It is common practice to represent the birth and death value for each cavity in a persistence diagram, named PD 2. PD 2 contains all the (b, d) pairs of a given packing, each corresponding to topologically distinct cavities that exists in the interstices between the beads. PD 2 contains information not only about the number of cavities but also on the nature of each cavity/pore or on the frequency of occurence of patterns (regular-distorted) that have been detected within the packing. As such, PD 2 offers new ways to describe the phase space of stable grain configurations.

An interesting asset of PD 2 is that certain local cavities with a specific motif can be clearly and simultaneously identified in the same diagram. For instance, the simplest and smallest pore is that formed inside four beads closely packed as a regular tetrahedron. From a topological viewpoint, a tetrahedral pore is born when α (the filtration parameter) reaches the circumradius of an equilateral triangle and dies when α is the circumradius of the regular tetrahedron. This mathematical definition ensures that a regular tetrahedral cavity is uniquely identified by the pointin PD 2. Another simple pore is that formed by six beads closely packed as a regular octahedron. This type of cavity is uniquely identified by the pointin PD 2 (see Methods section). On a technical note, the persistence diagrams presented here are computed using a weighted alpha filtration related to a weighted Voronoi decomposition. It uses the power distance instead of the absolute distance between the bead centres. This approach allows us to take into account the small, yet finite, polydispersity of the grains. In the PD 2 based on the power distance, regular tetrahedron and octahedron cavities are located atand. In our experiments, the average bead radius is = 0.5 mm, therefore:

### Unifying the design space and optimizing linear and nonlinear Truss metamaterials by generative modeling [^d51b9d37]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

Creating the design space

We begin by introducing our definition of the design space of truss lattices. From a practical standpoint, we focus our attention on lattices based on the periodic tessellation of a cubic representative volume element (RVE). Inspired by the cube decomposition approach, we partition the RVE into eight equal cubes, the octants, as shown in Fig. 1 a. By assuming symmetries across the three mutually orthogonal symmetry planes, it is sufficient to define the truss only within a single octant, which simplifies the complex optimization problem while ensuring great flexibility and periodic tilability. Following the graph representation of molecules, truss-like structures can be described by a set of nodes connected by solid beams, which form the nodes and edges of the graph, respectively. To create a sufficiently large design space of truss structures, we define a total of 27 possible node placements within the octant (Fig. 1 a): 8 vertex nodes { v 0, v 1, v 2, v 3, v 4, v 5, v 6, v 7 }, 12 edge nodes { e 0, e 1, e 2, e 3, e 4, e 5, e 6, e 7, e 8, e 9, e 10, e 11 }, 6 face nodes { f 0, f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, f 5 }, and a single body node { t 0 } within the volume. While the body node is free to move in 3D, edge and face nodes are restricted to be displaced only along the edge and within the face, respectively, and vertex nodes are fixed, as illustrated in Fig. 1 a. We define the offsets of nodes (as in ref.) in the natural coordinate system, representing their relative positions with respect to the fixed vertex nodes to ensure connectivity on the outer boundaries. The complete set of node features x contains the offset of each node in its movable direction(s).

### Using symmetry to elucidate the importance of stoichiometry in colloidal crystal assembly [^c7b99764]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Equation (2) is very similar to Eq. (1), and W will also undergo a combinatorial explosion if C j, the number of nodes in a category, j, is very large. However, relative to Eq. (1) this explosion is delayed by two factors. First, we have used symmetry to reduce the degrees of freedom by considering only the fundamental domain, which can be as little as one twelfth of the total primitive cell area. Second, we have reduced these degrees of freedom even further by using the symmetry of each group to remove edge nodes within a fundamental domain's lattice which are not independent. The second condition plays a significant role when the number of edge nodes relative to those on the face is large.

Enumerating structures

Combining symmetry and stoichiometry to cast the structure prediction problem as a CSP permits the tractable enumeration of crystalline configurations satisfying a given stoichiometric ratio up to moderately sized primitive cells. To see this, one may compute the number of nodes per edge of the fundamental domain for each group such that the nodal density approaches, but does not exceed, that of a chosen p1 reference cell. This reference cell is assumed to have N g nodes per edge and represents the case where no internal symmetry is present so that configurations are generated combinatorially without constraint. In our approach, an equally weighted average over all groups suggests that when N g ≈ 8 the total number of edge nodes will be equal to the number of face nodes (cf. Methods). For fundamental domains smaller than this, we expect that boundary symmetry for the groups will play a dominant role in determining valid configurations in the CSP. Taking the spatial discretization to also be on the order of the colloidal diameter, δ ~ σ, the limiting p1 fundamental domain is on the order of A ~ 8 σ × 8 σ. This is as large as boxes used to simulate many coarse-grained or colloidal fluids, implying that the upper bound for the primitive cell that can be feasibly generated with this method is reasonably large.

The Reg. index indicates the degree of regularity in the arrangement of the Au NPs, with a smaller value suggesting the arrangement is closer to a regular polyhedron. Due to the structural diversity of the samples, the datasets are limited to only one per N number.

To further understand the structural regularity, we introduce a regularity index, quantifying the similarity between an experimentally assembled 3D cluster formed by the Au NPs in different environments and an idealized, regular polyhedron (Table 1). In a vacuum condition, the arrangement of Au NPs more closely resembles regular and compact polyhedra than in a liquid environment (Fig. 3 d–f). This suggests that capillary forces acting on the polymeric shells during drying compress the Au NPs into regular configurations. On the other hand, these forces are not uniform in all directions, and tension by the support can result in the cluster's symmetry deviating from that of ideal polyhedra. This contribution from the support can be observed as the number of particles increases, showing a more pronounced 3D structural disparity between clusters in vacuum and liquid. The polyhedron with the least number of Au NPs studied (N = 4) clearly shows this effect, being the only case where the regularity index in liquid is higher than that in the dried state. In addition, the tetrahedron has the highest packing fraction and, thus, the least free volume among the studied polyhedra. As the number of Au NPs increases, they likely have increased mobility within the polymeric shell when dispersed in water. This disparity in structures between the liquid phase and vacuum is likely attributed to the presence of remaining solvent (THF) within the clusters when still in the liquid phase, which is removed during drying in vacuum, additionally leading to deformation of the polymeric shell by capillary forces during the same drying process prior to ET. These results were further validated by cryogenic electron tomography (Supplementary Fig. 16 a–f and Supplementary Table 1), which is considered as the standard technique for investigating soft materials in 3D by TEM. The cryogenic results indicate a slight expansion of the polyhedra shape compared to the results obtained in vacuum, but less pronounced in comparison to the results obtained in a liquid environment. Thus, in this case, the liquid-phase results are more likely to represent a realistic configuration of the assemblies in their native environment.

### Geometry analysis and systematic synthesis of highly porous isoreticular frameworks with a unique topology [^5bc9e633]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

As is in the case of other prototypes, the solvent-accessible void of the ncb framework is dependent on the length of each ligand. The calculated crystal densities and pore volumes for Ia - Vd are 0.39–1.06 g cm −3 and 0.49–2.04 cm 3 g −1, respectively (Fig. 3a). With N 2 as a probe, the calculated accessible surface areas of the isoreticular frameworks vary from 970 to 4,760 m 2 g −1 (Fig. 3b). More interestingly, changing the ratio of the lengths between pyridylcarboxylate and dicarboxylate can anisotropically modulate the pore size/shape (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Figs S33–S45; Supplementary Table S5). The shape of cA is basically maintained as a regular tetrahedron, and its size is only determined by the dicarboxylate length, which has a diameter of 7.8, 9.4, 11.2 and 13.0 Å for bdc 2–, ndc 2–, bpdc 2– and edba 2–, respectively. In contrast, the shape of cB can be tuned by d r or the ratio of lengths of the two linkers. When d r ≈1 (for example, IIIb), the shape of cB is tetrahedral (similar to that of cA). Otherwise, cB becomes elongated (d r > 1, for example, IIIb) or flattened (d r < 1, for example, IIIc). It should be noted that isoreticular PCPs with changeable pore shapes are still rarely encountered in the literature. As cC is mainly composed of pyridylcarboxylate edges, its shape is basically unchanged, and its size is mainly determined by the pyridylcarboxylate length, which is about 7.4, 10, 12, 14 and 17 Å for ina −, pyac −, pba −, pvba − and pbpa −, respectively. Furthermore, such a systematic modulation can finally alter the relative volume ratio between the channel and the cavities of each framework (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Table S5). For instance, the relative channel/cavity volume ratios are 2.31, 1.72 and 1.51 for IIIa, IIIb and IIIc, respectively, which combine the same pyridylcarboxylate pba − with longer dicarboxylates bdc 2–, ndc 2– and bpdc 2–.

### Controlled packing and single-droplet resolution of 3D-printed functional synthetic tissues [^bd53e84a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Interestingly, at φ SIL = 0.59 (θ DIB = 35.3°), we found the largest fraction of hexagonal packing (0.43 ± 0.06 area fraction, Fig. 2f, k, p), together with low extents of oil inclusions (0.06 ± 0.01 area fraction) (Supplementary Fig. 3i), droplet rolling (13 ± 6% droplet excess) (Supplementary Fig. 3j), and droplet size variation (8.2 ± 1.5 coefficient of variation) (Supplementary Fig. 3k). This θ DIB of 35.3°, equal to approximately half the dihedral angle of a regular tetrahedron (70.5°, 3 s.f.), corresponds to the geometrically calculated critical contact angle (θ c = 35.3°, 3 s.f.) required to exclude the continuous oil phase enclosed by four droplets, when their centres are positioned at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron(see Supplementary Note 3 for derivations and Supplementary Fig. 4 for experimental evidence). When φ SIL was increased only slightly to 0.60 (θ DIB = 36.3°), we observed a significant drop in the hexagonal packing area fraction to 0.31 ± 0.05 (Supplementary Fig. 3e, see Supplementary Fig. 5a for accuracy of measurements).

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^0a807599]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Typically, such image-based analyses are based on implicit, a priori, assumptions of the macroscopic symmetry of the system. These approaches fail when multiple crystallographic phases and/or extended defects are present. Finding atoms without a reference to a global lattice is a general particle search problem, a well explored area with multiple available algorithms. That said, adaptation of these algorithms to an atom search is non-trivial, especially when multiple atom types are present. Other approaches circumvent atom finding by analysis of image segments that contain features of interest to extract relevant information. However, contrast-based image analysis methods are prone to error propagation, especially in the case of lower-quality images, significant computational time cost for large images and multiple image arrays, and rather extensive user involvement and expertise. Notably, steps have been taken to ameliorate these complications through the use of correcting algorithms including parameters such as orientation of the detector and environmental distortions. These image processing techniques are quite powerful and ensure maximal data veracity before the analysis is initiated. Conjoined with such a powerful and extensive suite of image processing software, contrast-based methods have achieved impressive results that extend into the realm of three-dimensional reconstruction and internal structure mapping.

Nevertheless, once all atoms are found, a bigger challenge arises: without the global lattice as an intuitive vehicle for interpretation of the local structural data, we need to find completely new ways to categorize, analyse and interpret. Here we aim to explore whether a universal physical description of the system, including local and global symmetries, phases, and topological defects, can be built up only from the local information, obviating the overall lattice structure. We propose an approach based on the multivariate statistical analysis of the coordination spheres of individual atoms, made up by an array of values that represent a variety of metrics between an atom and its nearest or next nearest neighbours, to reveal preferential structures and symmetries. We test this approach on a mixed-phase system with a variety of nearest neighbour environments and show how a framework for interpretation of this new type of structural data can be developed.

### A three-dimensional actuated origami-inspired transformable metamaterial with multiple degrees of freedom [^028b0b09]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Actuation

While so far we have shown that the shape and volume of our metamaterial can be altered by manually applying a force (Fig. 3d), we now explore a possible distributed actuation approach to programme and control its shape. To this end, we position inflatable pockets on three hinges of the unit cells to control the γ angles (Fig. 4a). Upon pressurization, these pockets apply a moment to the hinges, flattening them and forcing the extruded rhombi to change their shape (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Movie 4).

To determine which inflatable pockets should be pressurized to move between different configurations, we first note that the total energy, T, in our system is given by

where W indicates the work done to actuate the system and U is the total strain energy defined in equations (10, 11, 12). The equilibrium configurations can then be found by minimizing T with respect to all degrees of freedom, yielding

for all the states internal and on the faces of the regular tetrahedron. Since ∂ W /∂ γ i is the moment applied by the inflatable pocket to the hinge with angle γ i, equation (16) indicates that, in order to move between two states, the actuator controlling the γ i angle need to be pressurized if

Interestingly, some states inside the regular tetrahedron can be reached without actuation of all three γ angles. In fact, we numerically find that ∂ U /∂ γ i = 0 defines three surfaces within the regular tetrahedron (Fig. 4c). As a result, when moving between two states connected by a path that remains on one of these three surfaces, no moment needs to be applied to the hinge with angle γ i.

### Shape-dependent ordering of gold nanocrystals into large-scale superlattices [^e12f17e2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of individual building blocks into highly ordered structures, analogous to spontaneous growth of crystals from atoms, is a promising approach to realize the collective properties of nanocrystals. Yet the ability to reliably produce macroscopic assemblies is unavailable and key factors determining assembly quality/yield are not understood. Here we report the formation of highly ordered superlattice films, with single crystalline domains of up to half a millimetre in two dimensions and thickness of up to several microns from nanocrystals with tens of nanometres in diameter. Combining experimental and computational results for gold nanocrystals in the shapes of spheres, cubes, octahedra and rhombic dodecahedra, we investigate the entire self-assembly process from disordered suspensions to large-scale ordered superlattices induced by nanocrystal sedimentation and eventual solvent evaporation. Our findings reveal that the ultimate coherence length of superlattices strongly depends on nanocrystal shape. Factors inhibiting the formation of high-quality large-scale superlattices are explored in detail.

### Oriented cell division shapes carnivorous pitcher leaves of sarracenia purpurea [^6c9f9196]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

where S i is the area of cell i, L j is the length of edge j, L k is the length of outermost edge k, and K S, K B, K R, K E and L E are constants. The first term of the right-hand side represents area elasticity, where cell i has a target area s i that depends on its edge number N i and is given by the relative area of N i -sided regular polygon to that of regular hexagon, namely, s i = N i tan(π /6)/6 tan(π / N i). K S denotes the elastic constant. The second term describes the conservation force of edge length, where each edge has the target lengthat which the potential energy function reaches a minimum. This condition ensures that neighbouring vertices do not become extremely close because of repulsive force. The third term indicates the elastic force that maintains the outermost edges at a constant length L E with the elastic coefficient K E, which reflects that the outer cell wall is usually thickened and stiffened by a cuticle.

In animal cell models, it is usually assumed that vertices are reconnected to mimic cell movement if an edge becomes extremely short. In contrast, because the plant cell wall prevents changes in the relative position of cells, such reconnection process is not permitted in our model. In addition, neighbouring vertices are prohibited to be extremely close by potential energy as described above.

Programmes were written in C and the vertex position (x j) was iteratively calculated every time step Δ t = 0.005, using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method.

### A distribution-centered approach for analyzing human adipocyte size estimates and their association with obesity-related traits and mitochondrial function [^f23e5ea3]. International Journal of Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Besides different distribution shapes, we demonstrate that adipocyte area, diameter, volume, and surface area are equally correlated with common anthropometry and laboratory values. Across different sizing parameters, the correlation between adipocyte size and measures of glucose homeostasis and blood lipids was limited to the vc depot. Similar results were observed in previous studies and our results are in agreement with the well-known association between visceral obesity and metabolic disorders. Therefore, non-linear data transformation of the initial output variable (area) assuming spherical shape does not influence the associations between adipocyte size and obesity-related traits. Similar to inter-method comparisons we conclude that transformed adipocyte sizing parameters from the same method are equally related to measures of metabolic health and obesity. Our data suggests that while the "ground truth" adipocyte size remains unknown and shows variation between studies reported associations with adipocyte size should in general be comparable. In our opinion, small cohort sizes and limited adipocyte counts propose greater limitations to significance and comparability rather than the utilization of different measurement methods or sizing parameters.

Mean adipocyte diameter, volume, and area are the most common adipocyte size measures. Since mature adipocytes are three-dimensional in shape and mainly comprised of a triglyceride-containing unilocular lipid droplet, volume is of high biological relevance for many research questions including fat mass and cellularity calculations. Less biological relevance can be attributed to adipocyte area or diameter as they do not directly resemble the physiological properties of the adipocyte. Surface area is reported less frequently and is directly proportional to the largest cross-sectional area when the spherical shape is assumed. Since the surface area is proportional to membrane area it is relevant for receptor binding and signaling. Due to its linear relationship with adipocyte surface area, cross-sectional area could also be used as a meaningful readout of adipocyte size when signaling or biochemical processes are investigated. It is, however, important to emphasize that the cross-sectional area measured in histology is not necessarily equal to the largest cross-sectional area of the cell.

### Different pathways for engulfment and endocytosis of liquid droplets by nanovesicles [^46bccbd2]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Maximal droplet size for complete engulfment

For any closed surface in three-dimensional space, the surface area A and the enclosed volume V satisfy the isoperimetric inequality,

The limiting case A 3 = 36 π V 2 applies to a spherical shape, which provides the shape with the smallest possible surface area A for a given volume V. We now apply this inequality to the membrane shape of a completely engulfed droplet as displayed in Figs. 3 and 4. More precisely, we apply the inequality to the shape of the inner leaflet of these membrane shapes, which enclose the α droplet and the interior volume of the vesicle which is filled with the liquid phase γ, compare Fig. 1. For a completely engulfed droplet, the shape of the inner leaflet consists of two segments corresponding to the α γ and β γ membrane segments, which are connected by a closed membrane neck. The inner leaflet of the α γ segment has the surface area A α γ and encloses the droplet volume V α which implies the isoperimetric inequality

Likewise, the inner leaflet of the β γ segment has surface area A β γ and encloses the combined volume V α + V γ, where V γ is the volume of the γ phase. The corresponding isoperimetric inequality now has the form

For the total surface area A = A α γ + A β γ of the inner leaflet, we then obtainwhere the last inequality follows from V γ ≥ 0. Therefore, we conclude that complete engulfment of the α droplet is only possible for a sufficiently small droplet volume V α that satisfiesbut impossible for larger droplets with volume. The boundary case withcorresponds to two nested spheres formed by the inner leaflet of the bilayer membrane. These two spheres touch each other because the liquid phase γ between the α γ and the β γ membrane segments has volume V γ = 0.

### The shape of the brain's connections is predictive of cognitive performance: an explainable machine learning study [^e0b21c62]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Shape Measures

We study 12 fiber cluster shape measures that are considered to provide a detailed and comprehensive shape analysis of tractography (Yeh). These measures include length, span, volume, diameter, curl, elongation, trunk volume, branch volume, total surface area, total area of end regions, total radius of end regions, and irregularity (Figure 2). These shape measures are computed for all 953 fiber clusters from all subjects by applying the software package DSIStudio (Yeh) 3.

FIGURE 2
Four examples of individual white matter connections (fiber clusters) extracted from the entire white matter of the human brain using a fiber clustering approach. Example shape descriptors are shown for the red fiber cluster.

Full definitions of the shape measures can be seen in (Yeh), and we include a brief description of each measure here. Length is the average streamline length of the fiber cluster in mm. Span is the distance between the two ends of the fiber cluster in mm. Volume is defined as the volume of voxels occupied by the fiber cluster in mm 3, where DSIStudio creates a synthetic volume of isotropic voxels for use in computations. Diameter is estimated from the length and volume shape measures, under the assumption that the fiber cluster takes the form of a cylinder; the diameter is considered to represent the average fiber cluster diameter in mm. Curl is defined as the length divided by the span to approximate the overall curve (note this is also known as the u‐ratio in other literature, e.g. Nie et al.). Elongation is defined as the fiber cluster length divided by the diameter. The trunk volume is the volume of the streamlines connecting the fiber cluster's two largest end regions. The branch volume is the remaining volume (the difference between the total and trunk volume). The surface area is estimated by counting the outermost or surface voxels occupied by the fiber cluster, then multiplying by the area of one side of a voxel in mm 2. The total area of end regions is computed as above using the surface voxels of the cluster endpoints, which are also used in estimating the total radius of end regions using a circular model. Finally, irregularity is computed by dividing the fiber cluster surface area by the surface area of a cylinder with the same diameter and length; thus, irregularity quantifies how different the shape is from an idealized cylinder.

### Self-assembly of tetravalent goldberg polyhedra from 144 small components [^742e87c5]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Rational control of the self-assembly of large structures is one of the key challenges in chemistry, and is believed to become increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible as the number of components involved increases. So far, it has not been possible to design a self-assembled discrete molecule made up of more than 100 components. Such molecules-for example, spherical virus capsids-are prevalent in nature, which suggests that the difficulty in designing these very large self-assembled molecules is due to a lack of understanding of the underlying design principles. For example, the targeted assembly of a series of large spherical structures containing up to 30 palladium ions coordinated by up to 60 bent organic ligands was achieved by considering their topologies. Here we report the self-assembly of a spherical structure that also contains 30 palladium ions and 60 bent ligands, but belongs to a shape family that has not previously been observed experimentally. The new structure consists of a combination of 8 triangles and 24 squares, and has the symmetry of a tetravalent Goldberg polyhedron. Platonic and Archimedean solids have previously been prepared through self-assembly, as have trivalent Goldberg polyhedra, which occur naturally in the form of virus capsids and fullerenes. But tetravalent Goldberg polyhedra have not previously been reported at the molecular level, although their topologies have been predicted using graph theory. We use graph theory to predict the self-assembly of even larger tetravalent Goldberg polyhedra, which should be more stable, enabling another member of this polyhedron family to be assembled from 144 components: 48 palladium ions and 96 bent ligands.

### Entropically engineered formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of colloidal shapes [^c761a63b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fivefold and icosahedral symmetries induced by multiply twinned crystal structures have been studied extensively for their role in influencing the shape of synthetic nanoparticles, and solution chemistry or geometric confinement are widely considered to be essential. Here we report the purely entropy-driven formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of particles in molecular simulation without geometric confinement or chemistry. Hard truncated tetrahedra self-assemble into cubic or hexagonal diamond colloidal crystals depending on the amount of edge and vertex truncation. By engineering particle shape to achieve a negligible entropy difference between the two diamond phases, we show that the formation of the multiply twinned clusters is easily induced. The twinned clusters are entropically stabilized within a dense fluid by a strong fluid-crystal interfacial tension arising from strong entropic bonding. Our findings provide a strategy for engineering twinning behavior in colloidal systems with and without explicit bonding elements between particles.

### Accuracy of left ventricular cavity volume and ejection fraction for conventional estimation methods and 3D surface fitting [^394c416d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Left ventricular cavity volume (LVV) and ejection fraction (LVEF) have well‐established correlations with prognosis and recovery following treatment for a variety of heart conditions. 1 However, the accuracy and precision of LVV and LVEF estimates as applied in the clinic have yet to be rigorously quantified, bringing into question the reliance of these metrics for certain applications. For example, San Roman et al 2 concluded that LVEF measurement methods need to achieve > 5% precision for use in clinical trials of investigative cell therapies, where LVEF changes of only 3% to 5% are expected. Jenkins et al 3 asserted that for clinical acceptance, a LVV or LVEF estimation method must match the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐based measurements to within 5%, and that 2‐dimensional echocardiography methods do not meet this criterion.

Sources of Error

The primary sources of error in estimation of LVV and LVEF are (1) errors in segmentation of the endocardial border from 2‐dimensional images; (2) inability to sample the entire extent of the left ventricle (LV) from base (at the mitral valve annulus) to the apex; and (3) geometric assumptions used to interpolate in regions where measurements are sparse and/or noisy. Endocardial border segmentation is adversely affected by inadequate contrast or noise at the myocardial edge, and by partial volume effects typically caused by large slice thickness relative to wall curvature. A small error in border segmentation can lead to a relatively large error because of the radius‐cubed dependence of volume on radius. For example, for a 40‐mm‐diameter spherical LV cavity, a 1‐mm underestimation in wall radius will result in a 14% underestimate of LVV. Inadequate sampling of the endocardial surface is typically caused by both lack of time available to acquire a sufficient number of image slices, and inability to acquire images in optimal orientations because of anatomical constraints. Common sampling errors are the inability to delineate accurately the mitral valve annulus and the heart apex from a stack of short‐axis cut‐planes, and to miss undulations of the endocardial wall that occur between radially oriented long‐axis slices. Methods for interpolating between surface measurements are commonly used to overcome the inability to sample over the entire heart volume at all time points, and the inability to accurately delineate the true endocardial border from an image cross‐section. The most common approach is to fit sparse surface data to a simplified geometric model such as an ellipsoid, as championed by Dodge et al 4, 5 as early as 1960.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Structural and topological nature of plasticity in sheared granular materials [^dc4d8dfb]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Correlation between structure and plasticity

We further investigated how topology change as characterized by flip events, structure change by tetrahedral shape parameter, and plastic deformation by non-affine displacementsare related among each other. We classify tetrahedra into three types based on their behaviors upon the application of a shear step (Fig. 3a): tetrahedra which flip (unstable tetrahedra), tetrahedra with none of their vertices involved in flip events (stable tetrahedra), and tetrahedra with some of their vertices involved in flip events owing to their spatial proximity to flip events (intermediate tetrahedra). First, we investigate how non-affine displacements of tetrahedra depend on their shapeand flips. We characterize the non-affine displacements of a tetrahedron by defining its non-affine mobility, i.e. the mean square non-affine displacements of the four vertices of the tetrahedron. As shown in Fig. 3b, is largest for unstable tetrahedra, smallest for stable tetrahedra, and has values in between for intermediate tetrahedra, in agreement with the result of Fig. 2c. It is also interesting to note thathas only a very weak dependency on the tetrahedral shapefor stable tetrahedra. Sinceis directly related to the flip events and spatial proximity to them, we plot in Fig. 3c as a function of distance from unstable and stable tetrahedra. We recognize that unstable tetrahedra correspond to the cores of large plastic activities and the stable tetrahedra correspond to cores of much weaker but still finite plastic activities. The two curves roughly merge around, which yields the range of influence zone. Next we investigate the connection between the shapes of the tetrahedra and flip events. From Fig. 3d, it is obvious that flip is much more likely among highly distorted tetrahedra which have. And the more distorted, the more likely a tetrahedron will flip in the subsequent shear step. Stable tetrahedra are more likely to have smaller, i.e. more regular shape. Intermediate tetrahedra tend to have shapes between these two extremes. These results are reminiscent of previous findings in which a polytetrahedral glass order based on quasi-regular tetrahedra has been defined in granular packings based on. It is interesting to see that the defective structure associated with this order plays a significant role in plasticity, similar to the role played by dislocations in crystals. As shown in the following, the analogy is much more profound as we find that the flip process of unstable tetrahedra are equivalent to the rotation motions of 4-ring disclinations which are topological defects associated with rotational degrees of freedom (Supplementary Table 2). Although the shape parameterdoes not influence the non-affine displacements directly (Fig. 3b), it nevertheless yields a facilitation mechanism for subsequent plastic activities, i.e. a tetrahedron has to be heavily distorted to undergo a flip event upon shear, and it is therefore more likely have a new flip event close to a previous one since the tetrahedra are on average more distorted there (Supplementary Note 5). This facilitation effect is discernable within a diameter of 4 d of the flipped site similar to the influence zone as observed in Fig. 3c, which is obtained by analyzing the spatial correlation of flip events of two subsequent shear steps. The existence of facilitation mechanism thus indicates a spatial and temporal correlations between flip events. Recently, the collective behavior of microscopic plastic deformations in relation to macroscopic force fluctuations has been analyzed in sheared granular materials, and it is observed that a significant long-range strain correlation is directly related to the macroscopic avalanche behavior. It is therefore interesting to investigate in the future how the local facilitation mechanism as identified here is related to shear band formation and avalanches.

### Colloid science: non-spherical bubbles [^a1f7f043]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Surface tension gives gas bubbles their perfect spherical shape by minimizing the surface area for a given volume. Here we show that gas bubbles and liquid drops can exist in stable, non-spherical shapes if the surface is covered, or 'armoured', with a close-packed monolayer of particles. When two spherical armoured bubbles are fused, jamming of the particles on the interface supports the unequal stresses that are necessary to stabilize a non-spherical shape.

### A novel approach to segmentation and measurement of medical image using level set methods [^b8ca883b]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The study proposes a novel approach for segmentation and visualization plus value-added surface area and volume measurements for brain medical image analysis. The proposed method contains edge detection and Bayesian based level set segmentation, surface and volume rendering, and surface area and volume measurements for 3D objects of interest (i.e., brain tumor, brain tissue, or whole brain). Two extensions based on edge detection and Bayesian level set are first used to segment 3D objects. Ray casting and a modified marching cubes algorithm are then adopted to facilitate volume and surface visualization of medical-image dataset. To provide physicians with more useful information for diagnosis, the surface area and volume of an examined 3D object are calculated by the techniques of linear algebra and surface integration. Experiment results are finally reported in terms of 3D object extraction, surface and volume rendering, and surface area and volume measurements for medical image analysis.

### Superstructures generated from truncated tetrahedral quantum dots [^c3fd5d05]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

The assembly of uniform nanocrystal building blocks into well ordered superstructures is a fundamental strategy for the generation of meso- and macroscale metamaterials with emergent nanoscopic functionalities 1–10. The packing of spherical nanocrystals, which frequently adopt dense, face-centred-cubic or hexagonal-close-packed arrangements at thermodynamic equilibrium, has been much more widely studied than that of non-spherical, polyhedral nanocrystals, despite the fact that the latter have intriguing anisotropic properties resulting from the shapes of the building blocks 11–13. Here we report the packing of truncated tetrahedral quantum dot nanocrystals into three distinct superstructures-one-dimensional chiral tetrahelices, two-dimensional quasicrystal-approximant superlattices and three-dimensional cluster-based body-centred-cubic single supercrystals-by controlling the assembly conditions. Using techniques in real and reciprocal spaces, we successfully characterized the superstructures from their nanocrystal translational orderings down to the atomic-orientation alignments of individual quantum dots. Our packing models showed that formation of the nanocrystal superstructures is dominated by the selective facet-to-facet contact induced by the anisotropic patchiness of the tetrahedra. This study provides information about the packing of non-spherical nanocrystals into complex superstructures, and may enhance the potential of self-assembled nanocrystal metamaterials in practical applications.

### A surface curvature oscillation model for vapour-liquid-solid growth of periodic one-dimensional nanostructures [^b9454d84]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

While the vapour-liquid-solid process has been widely used for growing one-dimensional nanostructures, quantitative understanding of the process is still far from adequate. For example, the origins for the growth of periodic one-dimensional nanostructures are not fully understood. Here we observe that morphologies in a wide range of periodic one-dimensional nanostructures can be described by two quantitative relationships: first, inverse of the periodic spacing along the length direction follows an arithmetic sequence; second, the periodic spacing in the growth direction varies linearly with the diameter of the nanostructure. We further find that these geometric relationships can be explained by considering the surface curvature oscillation of the liquid sphere at the tip of the growing nanostructure. The work reveals the requirements of vapour-liquid-solid growth. It can be applied for quantitative understanding of vapour-liquid-solid growth and to design experiments for controlled growth of nanostructures with custom-designed morphologies.

### Biophysical basis of filamentous phage tactoid-mediated antibiotic tolerance in P. aeruginosa [^e8307e48]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Theoretical scaling calculation of tactoid geometry

We performed a theoretical scaling calculation, involving minimising an approximate free energy F of a tactoid that comprises of hard rods (modelled phages). By assuming that the volume of a tactoid is much greater than the volume of an individual rod, we can decompose the total tactoid free energy into two terms: one term describing the surface (interfacial) contribution and a second term describing the volumetric (elastic) contribution.

In order to arrive at a free energy that is simple enough to solve, yet complex enough to retain information on the overall geometry of the rods and tactoids, we make further physical assumptions. First, we use what is called the one-constant approximation for the elastic term. This means that the splay and bend elastic effects contribute to the free energy in equal measure. Second, we ignore twist and saddle-splay effects, as we are primarily concerned with large changes in overall shape and size, not on complex internal organisation of the rods. Lastly, we assume that the tactoid is sufficiently elongated (not spherical) and that there is a slight curvature in the stacking of rods in the tactoid, as observed in our experiments. Given the above assumptions, the free energy is given bywhereis the surface tension, A(r, R) is the area of the tactoid, V(r, R) is the tactoid volume, K is the Franck elastic constant, r is the short (minor) axis of the tactoid, and R is the long (major) axis of the tactoid.

To find the equilibrium geometry of the tactoid, we minimise F with respect to both r and R at fixed volume. In doing so we approximate the area as A~Rr and the volume as V ~ Rr 2. The equations to satisfy are given by:where λ is a Lagrange multiplier. By solving the above equations, rearranging them for λ, and then setting them to be equal, we obtain the following relation:

Next, to involve the shapes of the hard rods we approximate the Frank elastic constant and interfacial tension with their values at the homogeneous-bipolar transition given by van der Schoot:where ρ is the dimensionless volume fraction (also known as packing fraction) of hard rods in a tactoid. Given this, we reach the final relation given by:

### Hierarchical self-assembly of DNA into symmetric supramolecular polyhedra [^f10dd599]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

DNA is renowned for its double helix structure and the base pairing that enables the recognition and highly selective binding of complementary DNA strands. These features, and the ability to create DNA strands with any desired sequence of bases, have led to the use of DNA rationally to design various nanostructures and even execute molecular computations. Of the wide range of self-assembled DNA nanostructures reported, most are one- or two-dimensional. Examples of three-dimensional DNA structures include cubes, truncated octahedra, octohedra and tetrahedra, which are all comprised of many different DNA strands with unique sequences. When aiming for large structures, the need to synthesize large numbers (hundreds) of unique DNA strands poses a challenging design problem. Here, we demonstrate a simple solution to this problem: the design of basic DNA building units in such a way that many copies of identical units assemble into larger three-dimensional structures. We test this hierarchical self-assembly concept with DNA molecules that form three-point-star motifs, or tiles. By controlling the flexibility and concentration of the tiles, the one-pot assembly yields tetrahedra, dodecahedra or buckyballs that are tens of nanometres in size and comprised of four, twenty or sixty individual tiles, respectively. We expect that our assembly strategy can be adapted to allow the fabrication of a range of relatively complex three-dimensional structures.

### Early-stage bifurcation of crystallization in a sphere [^4a5d2c45]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Bifurcations in kinetic pathways decide the evolution of a system. An example is crystallization, in which the thermodynamically stable polymorph may not form due to kinetic hindrance. Here, we use confined self-assembly to investigate the interplay of thermodynamics and kinetics in the crystallization pathways of finite clusters. We report the observation of decahedral clusters from colloidal particles in emulsion droplets and show that these decahedral clusters can be thermodynamically stable, just like icosahedral clusters. Our hard sphere simulations reveal how the development of the early nucleus shape passes through a bifurcation that decides the cluster symmetry. A geometric argument explains why decahedral clusters are kinetically hindered and why icosahedral clusters can be dominant even if they are not in the thermodynamic ground state.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^97626220]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Analysis of defects

It is not possible to tile the surface of a sphere with a square grid of squares without introducing topological defects. The cubes in our simulations and experiments were nearly always found to align with a square face towards the spherical shell and will thus also form topological defects. The topological defects are characterized by their winding number, which is 90° or π /2 in this case (the rotational symmetry of a square), see Fig. 2e, f. To obtain the curvature of a sphere a total topological charge of 4 π or at least eight topological defects are required. To automate the analysis of the topological defects on the surface of the SPs, we analyzed the orientation of the nanocubes with respect to their neighbors. The topological defects can be identified by tracing a closed chain of particles and tracking the smallest rotation to rotate a particle to the orientation of the next particle in the chain. This is illustrated in Fig. 2f, the particles marked with yellow arrows form a chain and the yellow arrows show the orientation of the particle. If one starts tracing the orientation at the top left particle and follow the chain until one is back at this particle, the orientation has changed by 90° (π /2). This means that this chain surrounds a topological defect of charge π /2. In Fig. 2, we show one of these topological defects on the surface for α = 0.8. The red particles in Fig. 2f of the main text are the particles for which the chain formed by their neighbors surrounds one of these topological defects. The topological defect is a point on the surface of the sphere that lies between these red particles.

### A novel method for calculating the volume of hemangiomas [^69cc393b]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Accurately measuring the size of infantile hemangiomas is critical for objectively quantifying their growth, involution, and treatment response. Volumetric measurements are particularly appropriate because hemangiomas tend to mark out their territory early on and then grow and involute volumetrically. To our knowledge, only two publications have proposed bedside methods for measuring hemangioma volume. In these two publications, the authors modeled hemangiomas as perfect spheres or half-spheres, but many hemangiomas more closely approximate ellipsoids, with each of their axes in three dimensions having different, rather than equal, lengths. We present an alternative bedside method for calculating hemangioma volume, using a formula derived with calculus requiring only three bedside measurements using a disposable paper tape measure.

### Shape analysis, a field in need of careful validation [^3754a883]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

In the last two decades, the statistical analysis of shape has become an actively studied field and finds applications in a wide range of areas. In addition to algorithmic development, many researchers have distributed end-user orientated toolboxes, which further enable the utilization of the algorithms in an "off the shelf" fashion. However, there is little work on the evaluation and validation of these techniques, which poses a rather serious challenge when interpreting their results. To address this lack of validation, we design a validation framework and then use it to test some of the most widely used toolboxes. Our initial results show inconsistencies and disagreement among four different methods. We believe this type of analysis to be critical not only for the community of algorithm designers but also perhaps more importantly to researchers who use these tools without knowing the algorithm details and seek objective criteria for tool selection.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^608a67d1]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

SA of sharp cubes in spherical confinement

We first focus on our two experimental data sets of sharp nanocubes (α ≈ 0.7; Fig. 2) and rounded nanocubes (α ≈ 0.3; Fig. 3) and compare them with computer simulations, later we will discuss the whole range of α values available in our computer simulations (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods Section 3). To investigate the self-assembled superstructure of sharp Fe 3 O 4 nanocubes in drying emulsion droplets, we show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-HAADF-STEM) images of self-assembled SPs containing sharp Fe 3 O 4 nanocubes (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Methods Section 2.4). At the outside of the SP, the nanocubes are all aligned with their flat faces (i.e. {100} facets) towards the confining interface. In the inner core, the nanocubes form a simple-cubic (SC) lattice very similar to the bulk crystal of perfect cubes. To identify the physical mechanism that drives the assembly, we performed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of hard cubes with a range of α values in spherical confinement, and slowly shrunk the confining sphere, thereby mimicking the evaporation process (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Methods Section 3). For α > 0.5, the cubes on the outside align with the interface, and form a distorted square lattice (Figs. 2c and 4a–e). For α > 0.75, the cubes in the core form a (twisted) SC lattice which connects smoothly to the outer layer at the six {100} facets (Figs. 2d and 4a–c). At the points where the eight {111} facets of the central cubic lattice meet the surface aligned layers defects are formed. Further investigation of our simulation results reveal that eight topological defects with winding number of π /2 are located at these points, which is in perfect agreement with our experimental findings (Fig. 2e, f). Li et al.have studied the 2D assembly of squares on a spherical surface. The defect positions observed by them differ from the positions we observe for sharp cubes. For sharp cubic particles, we observe 8 defects in a cubic arrangement (positioned at the vertices of a cube) while Li et al. observe defects in an square antiprism arrangement (positioned at the vertices of a square antiprism or a twisted cube). In 2D SA on a curved surface, the position of the defects is solely determined by the interactions between the defects through this 2D layer. As shown by Li et al. in this case, the repulsion between the defects will cause the defects to position themselves as far away from each other as possible and to form a square antiprism arrangement. In our case, the defects do not only interact through the surface but also through the particles layers below the surface layers which includes the cubic lattice in the bulk of the SP. It is this interaction with this cubic lattice that favors the positioning of the topological defects near the vertices of this cubic lattice and causes the cubic arrangement of defects. This is strengthened by the fact that we always observe the surface defects near the corners of the central cubic lattice. Furthermore this cubic arrangement of the defects transitions to a square antiprism arrangement of defects when the SP looses its SC core when the cubes become more rounded. The fact that we see a SC core in our experiments with α = 0.7 while we only observe this in simulations for α > 0.75 indicates that there are small differences between the simulations and the experiments, most likely resulting from the polydispersity of the nanocubes and/or possibly a local difference in the ligand density, e.g. on the corners of the nanocubes (Supplementary Methods Section 2.3). Our simulations demonstrate that a (twisted) SC core and curved shells arise spontaneously for hard sharp cubes in spherical confinement, and reveal striking agreement with the experimental observations.

### The definition and measurement of heterogeneity [^cd67f037]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods that do not require a priori stratification

There are three main approaches to quantify heterogeneity when no compelling a priori stratification exists: (A) treating heterogeneity as the "volume" of a space that completely encloses one's data points, (B) clustering-based methods, and (C) dendrogram-based methods.

Heterogeneity as a convex hull volume

Roughly speaking, the space enclosed by the smallest perimeter around all pairwise paths in one's data is a convex hull. The volume of this space is sometimes used as a heterogeneity index, but if data are not distributed uniformly within the convex hull, heterogeneity will be overestimated (Fig. 4a–c). We know of no psychiatric study using convex hull volume to quantify heterogeneity.

Fig. 4
Illustration of convex hull and dendrogram-based heterogeneity indices for non-categorical systems.

Panel a illustrates the basic concept of a convex hull on synthetic 2-dimensional data. The volume of the hull is taken as an index of heterogeneity. Panel b shows one problem with the convex hull method, which occurs when data lie along a lower dimensional surface (here just a curve). In this example, the data are all concentrated along the outer border of the hull, leaving the core unoccupied. However, the convex hull volume index will nonetheless count the empty space toward the heterogeneity value. Panel c illustrates the effect of outliers on convex hull volume. Since a convex hull is found by creating a "shell" around one's data, outlying points will expand this shell in ways that leave much of the convex hull empty (though still counting toward the heterogeneity value). Panel d shows the dendrogram computed using agglomerative clustering for a simple mixture of five 2-dimensional (2D) Gaussians. The functional diversity (FD) measure, shown in the title, is the sum of all branch lengths in this tree. Panel e shows a simple simulation with five 2D Gaussians (standardized to lie within the bounds [−1.5, 1.5] in both axes) that were progressively separated further. One can appreciate that the FD measure decreases as the distributions become more distinct. This is the opposite effect demonstrated by the convex hull volume, insofar as FD increases as the space becomes more densely populated with data points.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^64d981fe]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) inside drying emulsion droplets provides a general strategy for hierarchical structuring of matter at different length scales. The local orientation of neighboring crystalline NPs can be crucial to optimize for instance the optical and electronic properties of the self-assembled superstructures. By integrating experiments and computer simulations, we demonstrate that the orientational correlations of cubic NPs inside drying emulsion droplets are significantly determined by their flat faces. We analyze the rich interplay of positional and orientational order as the particle shape changes from a sharp cube to a rounded cube. Sharp cubes strongly align to form simple-cubic superstructures whereas rounded cubes assemble into icosahedral clusters with additionally strong local orientational correlations. This demonstrates that the interplay between packing, confinement and shape can be utilized to develop new materials with novel properties.

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^3be75d54]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In bulk simulations of rounded cubes, we observed upon compression a transition from a plastic FCC crystal to a fully aligned C0 crystal. One of the main characteristics of the C0 phase is that the nearest neighbors do no longer align perfectly with the faces of the cubes but are shifted slightly off center. In Supplementary Fig. 15a, the position of the nearest neighbors is shown for the plastic crystal FCC phase and in Supplementary Fig. 15b for the C0 phase of rounded cubes in bulk for α = 0.3. Even in the case of the plastic crystal, the particles already have a preference for certain orientations, they avoid pointing their corners towards any of their neighbors. In the C0 phase the 4 spots (Supplementary Fig. 15b) in the center are caused by the off center position of these nearest neighbors resulting from the deformation of the unit cell and the alignment of the particles. However, when we compressed the same rounded cubes in spherical confinement we did not observe this transition, instead the particles remained in a more symmetric FCC/HCP position. This is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 15c (simulation) and d (experiment), where we plot the positions of the nearest neighbors for rounded cubes in confinement and observe a single bright spot in the center (neighbors aligned to the center of the faces).

Orientational correlations

The orientation of cube i is stored as a rotation matrix M. To quantify the orientation of the cubes with respect to neighboring cubes we want to calculate the minimum angle α ij required to rotate a cube with orientation M i into the same orientation as a cube with orientation M j. The angle between two orientation matrices can be obtained from the angle axis 1 + 2 cos α ij = but this would not take into account the symmetries of a cube. To do this, we need to calculate the symmetry group of the cube (or octahedron) S 4, which contains 24 rotationsthat preserve the orientation of a cube. To obtain the minimum angle, we then calculate the angle between all identical representations of the orientations of the cubeswhere f (x) = acos(Tr(x)/2 − 1/2) and the minimum is taken over all 24 members of the symmetry group.

Connecting particle color with its orientation

To obtain a visually interpretable effect, we color the particles by calculating the angle between the particle and three reference particles with different orientations. Detailed information can be found in Supplementary Methods Section 4.

### Microparticle traction force microscopy reveals subcellular force exertion patterns in immune cell-target interactions [^7f09802a]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Microparticle 3D shape reconstruction

Image analysis was performed with custom software in Matlab. Individual microparticles were segmented based on intensity thresholding confocal z-stacks, using the dip in the distribution of the logarithm of voxel intensities as the threshold. The centroid of DAAM-particles was estimated, and they were isolated in ~20 × 20 × 30 μm regions of interest (ROIs) that were used for further processing. First, images were deconvolved with a point spread function (PSF), measured ~8 μm from the sample surface (Supplementary Fig. 4). Deconvolution was performed with 25 iteration steps using a Landweber algorithm, and was implemented using DecovolutionLab 2. Background subtraction was performed by averaging the Z-slices outside the ROI along the axial direction and subtraction of the resulting 2D image from each slice of the ROI. At this point, cubic interpolation along the z-axis was used to equalize the voxel dimensions. Edge detection was performed using the 3D Sobel operator(Supplementary Fig. 7), after which the total edge magnitude was calculated as the root-mean squared of the three resulting images. For superlocalization of edge coordinates, first a volume estimate of each DAAM-particle was made, based on the number of thresholded voxels, which was converted into a particle surface area estimate assuming a perfect sphere. The number of edge coordinates N was determined as the particle surface area divided by the area of a circle with radius 250 nm (for the DAAM-particles subjected to phagocytosis) or 500 nm (for undeformed spheres, in which case we wanted to prevent correlation between neighboring points). Longitude φ and co-latitude θ for approximately equally spaced points were found as: where n = 0… N − 1. Modulus 2π is taken, such that. Cubic interpolation was used to estimate the intensity values along lines originating from the particle centroid in the directions of the angles determined above. Then a Gaussian function was fit to each line profile to determine the location of the edge with subpixel precision.

Smoothing of edge coordinates

Edge coordinates were smoothed (for sphericity, curvature and force calculations) using an equivalent of a 2D moving average, operating on the radial component of edge coordinates. Great circle distances (d) between edge coordinates with indices i and j were calculated along a perfect sphere:where R is the equivalent diameter of a sphere to the particle. The radial component of the edge coordinates was then averaged within the given window size (1 μm 2).

### Interplay between spherical confinement and particle shape on the self-assembly of rounded cubes [^0c83edb3]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-spherical particles with size and shape uniformity can form a large diversity of hierarchical structures –. The SA of cubes has been investigated extensively both theoretically,– and experimentally. Self-assembled nanocubes can often possess distinctive properties that are quite different from those of spheres. For example, quantum dot cubes have been demonstrated experimentally and theoretically to form NP solids with higher directional charge transport compared to spheres, as the cubes align their flat faces, thereby creating stronger coupling between neighboring NPs. The tunability of the shape of crystalline cubes, makes such particles an ideal model system to investigate the effect of asphericity and of the flat faces on the self-assembled structures and thus further modulate their collective properties.

In this work, by integrating experiments and computer simulations, we probe how and to what extent the SA of particles in spherical confinement is affected by particle shape, by investigating shapes that interpolate between perfect sharp cubes and perfect spheres via rounded cubes. We demonstrate experimentally that in slowly drying emulsion dropletssharp cubic and rounded cubic NPs self-assemble into spherical SPs. We find that locally the partially flat faces orient the nanocubes with respect to their neighbors inside the self-assembled SPs. Sharp cubes have strong orientational correlations which span the whole SP, while rounded cubes line up with each other with a short-ranged orientational order. We illustrate this concept for sharp cubic and rounded cubic NPs, but we believe our findings are applicable to a broad range of other shape-engineered single crystalline NPs as well.

### Shape matters: unsupervised exploration of IDH-wildtype glioma imaging survival predictors [^92ef449a]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

While high-order radiomic features show promise as prognostic tools for OS prediction in high-grade glioma patients, the potential of shape radiomic features as a prognostic parameter remains underexplored. In this study, we employed a method that avoids predefined classifications or guidance, focusing on identifying survival clusters based on the tumor volume and shape-related radiomic features in newly diagnosed pre-operative IDH-wt glioma. Our results indicate that incorporating these clusters could enhance prognostic accuracy, offering an advantage over relying solely on clinical assessments or models based on tumor volume alone when predicting OS.

Upon scrutinizing the clusters, we observed that cluster 1, associated with longer OS, had a higher percentage of patients with tumors displaying elevated sphericity and elongation values, suggesting a more spherical shape. Conversely, the fraction of patients in this cluster with high values in maximum 3D diameter, surface area, and axis length was markedly lower in comparison to cluster 2. These findings are consistent with the work of Pérez-Betata et al, who demonstrated that surface regularity, derived from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted pre-treatment MRI sequences, serves as a robust indicator of survival in a cohort of 165 GB patients from five local institutions. This parameter quantifies the degree of deviation of the tumor's surface from that of a sphere with corresponding volume. The study demonstrated that surface regularity serves as a robust indicator of patient survival. Notably, it was observed that patients with higher surface regularity, indicative of tumors with a shape akin to a sphere, exhibited prolonged survival periods. These results are consistent with many other studies, that showed that the irregularity of the tumor margins is a good prognostic parameter for survival in IDH-wt glioma patients. In contrast to Perez-Betata's focus on the surface area of contrast-enhancing compartments, our study extracted radiomics from the entire tumor including non-contrast enhancing FLAIR-hyperintense parts, suggesting that the shape of these parts also holds prognostic value.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Direct observation of phase transitions in truncated tetrahedral microparticles under quasi-2D confinement [^d624be7e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Colloidal crystals are used to understand fundamentals of atomic rearrangements in condensed matter and build complex metamaterials with unique functionalities. Simulations predict a multitude of self-assembled crystal structures from anisotropic colloids, but these shapes have been challenging to fabricate. Here, we use two-photon lithography to fabricate Archimedean truncated tetrahedrons and self-assemble them under quasi-2D confinement. These particles self-assemble into a hexagonal phase under an in-plane gravitational potential. Under additional gravitational potential, the hexagonal phase transitions into a quasi-diamond two-unit basis. In-situ imaging reveal this phase transition is initiated by an out-of-plane rotation of a particle at a crystalline defect and causes a chain reaction of neighboring particle rotations. Our results provide a framework of studying different structures from hard-particle self-assembly and demonstrates the ability to use confinement to induce unusual phases.

Fig. 1
NMR spectroscopy. a 31 P{ 1 H} MAS NMR spectrum of P 4 @ C. b 75 As NMR spectrum of As 4 in CS 2 extracted from As 4 @ C

The powder X-ray diffractograms of E 4 @ C (E = P, As) show only two broad peaks arising from the amorphous carbon material and no diffraction pattern of E 4 units (Fig. 2a). Thus, no crystalline E 4 is present in the scaffold, indicating that the arsenic and phosphorus tetrahedra, respectively, are located in the pores (< 5 nm). To clarify the distribution of the E 4 (E = P, As) molecules, the nitrogen adsorption measurement at liquid nitrogen temperature of E 4 @ C was examined and the DFT (density functional theory)-based pore size distribution was determined (Fig. 2b). As a result of the P 4 storage, the specific surface area and the total pore volume of the carbon host decrease by 55% and 57%, respectively. Considering the bulk density of P 4 (1.82 g cm −3), the maximum amount of P 4 in P 4 @ C is approximately 36%. The DFT pore size distribution displays the lack of the ultramicropores (< 0.7 nm) as well as an intense decrease of supermicropores (0.7 < 2 nm) (Fig. 2c). Considering a P-P bond length of approx. 2.21 Å and a van der Waals radius of 1.80 Å for a phosphorus atom, the size of the P 4 molecules (tetrahedrally shaped sphere with a diameter of about 0.61 nm) is similar to the pore size of the carbon host enabling a good fit into the ultramicropores. Additionally, the amount of meso pores (> 2 nm) diminishes. These results prove the incorporation of the P 4 molecules into the porous activated carbon. For As 4 @ C, the specific surface area and the total pore volume decrease by 9% and 14%, respectively. Considering the bulk density of As 4 (1.97 g cm −3), the maximum amount of As 4 in As 4 @ C is approximately 10%. With a diameter of about 0.65 nm, As 4 molecules smoothly fit into the carbon scaffold. The thermogravimetric analysis of As 4 @ C shows two steps of a loss of weight. In a first step, until 350 °C, the sample loses approximately 10% of its weight followed by an additional loss of 10% until 600 °C (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the thermogravimetric analysis of solid P 4 @ C shows a loss of weight of about 10% until 180 °C followed by an unexpected, but reproducible increase of the sample mass by 10% (Fig. 2d). Between 400 and 800 °C, a loss of weight of 32% is again detected resulting from released phosphorus.

### Direct 4D printing of ceramics driven by hydrogel dehydration [^7a7a1f4b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Design flow for direct 4D printing of ceramics

Figure 5a presents the design flow for direct 4D printing of ceramics, which includes five steps: 3D modeling, flat pattern design, theoretical model calculation, FE simulation, and experiment. We take the fabrication of a thin-walled regular tetrahedron as an example to illustrate the detailed design and manufacturing process of 4D printing ceramics. As shown in Fig. 5b, we first extract the key feature parameters from the target object. In the case of a regular tetrahedron, the side length L s is 10 mm, and the calculated dihedral angle θ s is 70.5°. Then, we design geometric parameters for the flat pattern that can be obtained by unfolding each face of the regular tetrahedron into to the same plane. As shown in Fig. 5c, all the faces only consist of ceramic elastomer. The bottom face and side faces are connected by three hinges composed of hydrogel-ceramic laminates. Considering the shrinkage of ceramics after sintering, the side length L d of each triangular face is calculated to be 12.78 mm (L d = L s / η = 12.78 mm). The hinge length is equal to L d, and the width is set to be 5 mm. The undetermined parameters are hydrogel thickness H hg and hinge thickness H which can be calculated through the developed theoretical model. Figure 5d presents the relation between bending angle θ s and H hg / H. The dihedral angle of the sintered ceramic tetrahedron can reach 70.5° when H = 1 mm and H hg / H = 0.69. Based on the structural parameters determined in Fig. 5c, d, we perform FE simulations to predict the shape transformation from the flat 2D pattern to the dehydrated and sintered 3D objects. As shown in Fig. 5e, the final sintered 3D shape is basically consistent with our initial design. Finally, Fig. 5f presents the experiment in which a ceramic tetrahedron is directly 4D printed. We use multimaterial DLP 3D printing to fabricate the 2D flat pattern with the determined design parameters, transform the 2D pattern to a 3D tetrahedron through dehydration, and convert the polymer-based tetrahedron to a ceramic one by sintering. The sintering process leads to the volume shrinkage and shape retraction, which is well predicted by the FE simulation.

### Precise regulation of the relative rates of surface area and volume synthesis in bacterial cells growing in dynamic environments [^4e2207f2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The steady-state size of bacterial cells correlates with nutrient-determined growth rate. Here, we explore how rod-shaped bacterial cells regulate their morphology during rapid environmental changes. We quantify cellular dimensions throughout passage cycles of stationary-phase cells diluted into fresh medium and grown back to saturation. We find that cells exhibit characteristic dynamics in surface area to volume ratio (SA/V), which are conserved across genetic and chemical perturbations as well as across species and growth temperatures. A mathematical model with a single fitting parameter (the time delay between surface and volume synthesis) is quantitatively consistent with our SA/V experimental observations. The model supports that this time delay is due to differential expression of volume and surface-related genes, and that the first division after dilution occurs at a tightly controlled SA/V. Our minimal model thus provides insight into the connections between bacterial growth rate and cell shape in dynamic environments.

### A colloidal viewpoint on the sausage catastrophe and the finite sphere packing problem [^cc9a8986]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It is commonly believed that the most efficient way to pack a finite number of equal-sized spheres is by arranging them tightly in a cluster. However, mathematicians have conjectured that a linear arrangement may actually result in the densest packing. Here, our combined experimental and simulation study provides a physical realization of the finite sphere packing problem by studying arrangements of colloids in a flaccid lipid vesicle. We map out a state diagram displaying linear, planar, and cluster conformations of spheres, as well as bistable states which alternate between cluster-plate and plate-linear conformations due to membrane fluctuations. Finally, by systematically analyzing truncated polyhedral packings, we identify clusters of 56 ≤ N ≤ 70 number of spheres, excluding N = 57 and 63, that pack more efficiently than linear arrangements.

### Identification of phases, symmetries and defects through local crystallography [^5fabe4e7]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Advances in electron and probe microscopies allow 10pm or higher precision in measurements of atomic positions. This level of fidelity is sufficient to correlate the length (and hence energy) of bonds, as well as bond angles to functional properties of materials. Traditionally, this relied on mapping locally measured parameters to macroscopic variables, for example, average unit cell. This description effectively ignores the information contained in the microscopic degrees of freedom available in a high-resolution image. Here we introduce an approach for local analysis of material structure based on statistical analysis of individual atomic neighbourhoods. Clustering and multivariate algorithms such as principal component analysis explore the connectivity of lattice and bond structure, as well as identify minute structural distortions, thus allowing for chemical description and identification of phases. This analysis lays the framework for building image genomes and structure-property libraries, based on conjoining structural and spectral realms through local atomic behaviour.

### A 3D ray traced biological neural network learning model [^d16b5e85]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Hidden neurons and glial cells' location assignment

In our model, both hidden neurons and glial cells are uniformly distributed in a network sphere of radius r s. To achieve that, we set up a spherical coordinate centered at the sphere origin withthe unit vectors pointing to the radial, polar and azimuthal directions as shown in Fig. 6 a. Within the sphere, every small volumecentered at (r, θ, ϕ) should contain the same number of cells, except for statistical fluctuations. Therefore, to assign the location of a cell i, we first generate three random numbers, and, each uniformly distributed within 0 to 1. Then the position of the cell (r i, θ i, ϕ i) can be assigned following the formula below:

### Impact of photoreceptor density in a 3D simulation of panretinal laser photocoagulation [^1efd119b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

3D average distribution of photoreceptors

We constructed the 3D average distribution of photoreceptors using 3D CAD software (SolidWorks 2017 standard®) using the photoreceptor density data from a previous study. Four graphs of photoreceptor densities in four directions (superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal) were obtained and representative graphs with the same eccentricity of the fovea were averaged, and an average photoreceptor density graph was created. This graph was rotated around the y-axis, and the 3D average distribution of photoreceptors was constructed using Solidwork 2017 standard®. In addition to the island-shaped solid representing the total photoreceptor distribution, the cubic volume of the solid represents the number of photoreceptors.

Simulation of PRP

Simulations of scatter PRP and full scatter PRP (size 400 μm on the retina, 1 spot width apart) were performed using a geometry-based simulation as previously described. To facilitate a better understanding of some relevant concepts, we describe important aspects of the geometry-based simulation as follows.

We used a geometric formula to calculate the curved surface area of a spherical dome (a portion of a sphere transected by a plane; see Fig. 1 a). If the radius of the dome is r, the height of the dome is h, the radius of the base is c, and the area of the base is B, the curved surface area (S) excluding B of the dome is as follows (see Fig. 1 a):If the values of c and h for the eye are known, the curved area of the retina as a whole is equal to the area of a circle with a radius of. The area of the whole retina can be considered to be a part of a sphere; thus, the entire retinal area corresponds to the curved surface area of a spherical dome. The dimensions of a standard eye were derived from a textbook (Fig. 1 b), and inserting these values into the abovementioned equation shows that the whole retinal area is equal to the area of a circle with a radius of 18.6-mm (Fig. 1 b).

### Entropically engineered formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of colloidal shapes [^3defe878]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Twinning arises from a type of grain boundary called a twin boundary, where two separate crystals sharing the same lattice plane intergrow with a certain symmetry. Fivefold and icosahedral symmetries, which are generally known to be incompatible with long-range order, can be induced in relatively large atomic crystal clusters (from several nanometers to a few microns) via multiple twinning –. For instance, materials that form face-centered cubic (fcc),– or cubic diamond, crystals can form twin boundaries toward the (111) or its equivalent lattice directions, promoting the formation of atwin angle that can produce multiply twinned structures with fivefold or icosahedral symmetry. Twinning has been widely used to obtain interesting properties in synthetic nanomaterials, such as enhancing the mechanical properties of nanowiresand increasing oxidation resistance, and to synthesize noble metal nanostructures with decahedral or icosahedral shape, which are useful as catalysts. Many studies have been conducted to control the growth mechanism, and stability of multiply twinned structures, e.g. tailoring solution chemistry,– and using multicomponent materials. However, the multiplicity of variables in multiply twinned crystals makes it difficult to know which variables are responsible for, or have the most influence on, the formation of fivefold and icosahedral twins.

Compared to most systems, hard particle systems are regarded as relatively simple because the phase behavior is driven solely by entropy maximization. The diversity and complexity of entropy-driven phase behavior, however, are enormously rich. The self-assembly of complex crystals and quasicrystals, as well as complex assembly pathways such as multistep crystallization, have been reported in hard particle systems. The spontaneous formation of icosahedral twins has been observed in hard sphere systems both in experiments and in computer simulations, but only under spherical confinement, which produces an artificial "surface tension" to overcome the internal strain within the cluster arising from local particle packing. That, and the negligible free energy difference between fcc and hexagonal close-packed (hcp), two competing crystal structures of hard spheres, conspire to produce twins. However, the formation and stabilization of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters without geometrical confinement or in any other hard particle systems or have yet to be reported. We hypothesized that artificial surface tension provided by spherical confinement could be achieved naturally, without any confinement, through the judicious choice of particle shape.

### Starting geometry creation and design method for freeform optics [^44fabd79]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Starting geometry creation and down-selection

The creation of a geometry that maximizes the benefit from freeform surfaces and requires less overall freeform departure, which also results in lower surface slope when only low-order (here up to Z15) Zernike polynomials are considered, is an important step in reducing the sensitivity and fabrication costs of the final design. Instead of first constructing a fully obscured rotationally symmetric system that is corrected through third-order then tilting the surfaces into a planar symmetric unobscured geometry as one might do with an off-axis conic or asphere design, this method focuses on first developing the geometries that are conducive to the application of freeform surfaces.

For a general optical system with some freedom to choose the folding geometry, this process begins by constructing a first-order optical layout in each possible permutation of surface tilt directions and image plane locations within each permutation. The magnitudes of the surface tilts should be minimized to what is necessary to avoid obscurations. An important feature and key point is that it is not critical at this stage that the layout variables (that is, surface powers and airspaces) take specific values, but rather are chosen to hold system constraints, such as focal length and system volume. The power distribution is typically chosen based on packaging constraints, surface sizes, flat-field conditions, and FOV requirements. The following N + 1 step procedure may be used to help determine layout variables that provide a sufficient starting point for a general optical system with N surfaces. Given a target system volume, as Step 1, set all airspaces between each surface to be roughly equivalent and to take full advantage of the allowed volume. With a chosen power distribution, in Steps 2 to N, assign radius of curvature values to the first N -1 optical surfaces, where all negative surfaces have radii equal to 1.5–2.5× the chosen airspace value and all positive surfaces have radii equal to 3–4× the chosen airspace value. In the N th + 1 step, the power of the final surface is chosen to hold the focal length of the system. It is important to reiterate that the specific values of the layout variables are not critical provided that the focal length, volume, and obscuration requirements are satisfied. Preferred values of the layout variables are determined in the optimization steps that follow developing this starting point. If other power distributions would satisfy the constraints of the design problem, this process can be repeated. The remainder of the design process will be demonstrated for the three-mirror imager, but can be adapted for a general system. A comprehensive selection of possible geometries for the imager using tilted surfaces is shown in Fig. 1, in which, the geometries have been grouped into a hierarchy of tiers based on the potential of each geometry to be corrected by freeform surfaces as predicted by methods that will be introduced below.

### Machine learning-enabled forward prediction and inverse design of 4D-printed active plates [^4ca5239a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Design results for FE-derived target shapes based on given voxel patterns

We first consider the FE-derived target shapes generated by intuitively or randomly designated voxel patterns. More specifically, we generate intuitive or random designs, and the corresponding actuated shapes obtained through FE simulations are used as the targets. Albeit still challenging, this is a relatively simpler case as the shape obtained from FE simulations can possess features, such as surface continuity and smoothness, upon which the ML model is trained. In addition, although our ML model uses 15 × 15 × 2 voxels, we specify the intuitive or random design in a grid with coarser in-plane resolution such that each grid consists of multiple voxels (≥ 2 × 2), but perform the inverse design at full voxel resolution. In this way, there is more room for the ML voxels to vary while achieving a shape that approximates the target. Figure 5 shows the inverse design results for three different FE-derived target shapes. As will be detailed later, we have performed different design trials for each target shape, and Fig. 5 only reports the best-achieved results. The given designs, target shapes, optimal designs, optimal shapes compared with targets, error maps, and experimentally 4D-printed, actuated shapes of both given and optimal designs, are shown in seven columns (from left to right). In column 4, since the optimization is entirely based on the ML model, the resulting optimal shape (i.e. the ML-predicted shape of the optimal design) is termed as the "ML-optimal shape" (blue grid). Also, since the ML always has prediction errors, we then use FE to evaluate the "true actuated shape" (orange grid) of the optimal design. To quantify the design accuracy, the approximation errors of the two optimal shapes against the target shape are obtained, using the absolute distance of each sampling-point pair in the two shapes (i.e. where i, j = 0, 1, …, 15) divided by a reference length (taken as the edge length, 40 mm). In column 5, only the error map of the FE true actuated shape is shown for brevity. In columns 6 and 7, all printed square sheets are initially flat and only the actuated shapes are shown. Experimental details can be found in "Methods". As shown in Fig. 5, for all three targets, excellent agreement is achieved between the target (gray surface), the ML-optimal shape (blue grid) and FE true actuated shape (orange grid), which is quantitively verified by the error map. The experimental actuated shapes of both given and optimal designs further validate such agreement (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Movies 1–3).

### Quantifying the unknown impact of segmentation uncertainty on image-based simulations [^256f92f6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Image-based simulation, the use of 3D images to calculate physical quantities, relies on image segmentation for geometry creation. However, this process introduces image segmentation uncertainty because different segmentation tools (both manual and machine-learning-based) will each produce a unique and valid segmentation. First, we demonstrate that these variations propagate into the physics simulations, compromising the resulting physics quantities. Second, we propose a general framework for rapidly quantifying segmentation uncertainty. Through the creation and sampling of segmentation uncertainty probability maps, we systematically and objectively create uncertainty distributions of the physics quantities. We show that physics quantity uncertainty distributions can follow a Normal distribution, but, in more complicated physics simulations, the resulting uncertainty distribution can be surprisingly nontrivial. We establish that bounding segmentation uncertainty can fail in these nontrivial situations. While our work does not eliminate segmentation uncertainty, it improves simulation credibility by making visible the previously unrecognized segmentation uncertainty plaguing image-based simulation.

Quantitative imaging metrics — common sources of systematic errors in imaging and analysis include six categories with representative examples: technical issues during acquisition (differences in hardware and software, acquisition protocol, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution), biased sampling of structure for analysis (comparison of mismatched airways), failure to define an appropriate reference space, issues with segmentation or registration, inaccurate assumptions or simplifications (assuming alveolar airspaces are spheres), and failure to consider spatiotemporal and biological heterogeneity (anatomical or gravitational gradients in tissue density, ventilation, and perfusion).

### Dynamics and universal scaling law in geometrically-controlled sessile drop evaporation [^4b9f0a0d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The resulting drops remained pinned for most of their lifetime (> 70%). The drop mass, m, was instantaneously measured with a microbalance (readability 0.01 mg) while the drops evaporated in a controlled chamber; the instantaneous evaporation rate is, thus, defined as. Infrared thermography, as described elsewhere, was used to observe the drop's thermal field. In all cases considered in the present work, the drop height (maximum 1.1 mm) was always smaller than the capillary lengthmm with water and 1.7 mm with ethanol. Here σ, ρ and g denote surface tension, liquid density and gravitational acceleration, respectively. Hence, surface tension dominates gravity and, thus, the interface shape results from the surface energy minimization of the system with the constraint that the contact line is pinned along the prescribed geometry on the substrate.

Evaporation kinetics in quasi-isothermal drops

We start by considering the quasi-isothermal case, in which the substrate remained at room temperature, in order to examine the evaporation kineticsof non-spherical drops. We considered drops of pure liquids with relatively low volatility (ethanol and distilled water). Under such conditions, the timescale of diffusion of vapour in the gas O (1 s) is much shorter than the evaporation timescale O (100 s). Since quasi-isothermal conditions also ensure negligible buoyancy-driven convection currents in the gas, the evaporation kinetics of these drops are the result of (quasi) steady-state diffusion in the gas, that is, ∇ 2 c = 0, where c is the vapour concentration in the gas phase. We thus performed a set of numerical simulations solving the steady-state vapour diffusion problem with appropriate boundary conditions (see Methods), and compared the results with the experimental values for different drop sizes (Fig. 1a). In these simulations, the three-dimensional (3D) drop shapes were calculated with Surface Evolverand entered the problem as part of the lower gas-domain boundary. Only circular and triangular contact shapes are presented since these are the limiting cases for regular polygons. The evaporation rates of other canonical geometries, for example, pentagonal shape, fall between the curves for the circular and triangular geometries. The overall agreement is very good, considering the purposely sought simplicity of the model, which corroborates that this is essentially a diffusion-limited phase change process.

### Giant regular polyhedra from calixarene carboxylates and uranyl [^1cd8bf7f]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of large multi-component systems is a common strategy for the bottom-up construction of discrete, well-defined, nanoscopic-sized cages. Icosahedral or pseudospherical viral capsids, built up from hundreds of identical proteins, constitute typical examples of the complexity attained by biological self-assembly. Chemical versions of the so-called 5 Platonic regular or 13 Archimedean semi-regular polyhedra are usually assembled combining molecular platforms with metals with commensurate coordination spheres. Here we report novel, self-assembled cages, using the conical-shaped carboxylic acid derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[5]arene as ligands, and the uranyl cation UO 2 2+ as a metallic counterpart, which coordinates with three carboxylates at the equatorial plane, giving rise to hexagonal bipyramidal architectures. As a result, octahedral and icosahedral anionic metallocages of nanoscopic dimensions are formed with an unusually small number of components.

### Dynamics and universal scaling law in geometrically-controlled sessile drop evaporation [^30d161e9]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Numerical algorithms

Evaporation kinetics. We consider only the gas phase to investigate the evaporation kinetics of non-heated sessile drops of pure fluids. Under these conditions and for liquids with relatively low volatility as those considered in this work, it can be shown that the evaporation timescale is significantly larger than the timescale of species diffusion in the gas. The process is, thus, quasi-stationary and can be accurately approximated by solving the problem of steady-state isothermal diffusion of vapour in the non-condensable gas (air). A schematic of the model is presented in Fig. 6a. We thus solve

in the gas with the boundary conditions given in Fig. 6a. Here c is the vapour mass concentration in the air. The domain is a cube of size L × L × L (where computations were performed to ensure L is large enough to minimize end effects without prohibitive computational cost) and the drop shape is introduced through the geometry of the lower boundary. Along this curved surface, the vapour concentration is constant and equal to the saturation concentration, that is, c = c i where c i is the interface vapour concentration calculated with Raoult's law and the saturation pressure at room temperature. The no-penetration condition e z ·∇ c = 0 is implemented in rest of the lower boundary. The vertical and top boundaries are assumed to be very far from the drop and, therefore, the vapour concentration there is equal to that in the ambient value, that is, c = c ∞. This closes the boundary value problem. Since surface tension dominates gravity in these drops, the drop interface shape is the result of the surface energy minimization of the system. We thus use Surface Evolverto calculate these. As in the experiments, the contact line and the volume are prescribed, and therefore the resulting geometry is unique. A comparison between the experimental drop geometry and that calculated with Surface Evolver for the same contact area and volume is presented in Fig. 6b.

American Thoracic Society–Fleischner Society quantitative lung imaging — key steps and practical principles emphasize acquisition standardization, cautious image processing, and rigorous validation. Image acquisition is to be "Standardize when possible" with examples such as "End-inspiration, vs. end-expiration, supine vs. prone, before or after bronchodilator treatment". For image manipulation, users are cautioned to "Avoid overfiltration, which may introduce distortion or bias". For intensity or signal thresholds, the table notes that "Discrete threshold values may not fully describe a continuum of changes". Structural quantification entries specify to "Determine quantity, quantity (e.g., number, length, diameter, volume), and their distribution. Compare groups at global, stratified, or regional level" and to "Include measures of heterogeneity (e.g., coefficient of variation or error)". Imaging biomarker examples include "For example, LAA, fSAD, Pi10, VDP", with the caveat that "Different metrics are at varying stages of standardization and validation. Vendor-specific algorithms may not fully harmonize with one another despite each being validated". Reproducibility is addressed via "Repeated measures across platforms, subjects, and time", while validation examples include comparison "with, for example, lung water gravimetry, microparticle deposition, multiple-breath gas washout, multiple-inert gas elimination technique", together with guidance to "Examine limitations of existing standards to ensure proper use". Abbreviation definitions include "Pi10 = wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of 10 mm".

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^f4124a5b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The main problem in network design is fundamentally different. We are given the density of population and we are looking for the network that minimizes some objective function involving some average time, in general (although other choices are possible, see for example). In this setting, there are usually two different transport modes, a slow one representing for example cars on the road network, and a fast one representing the subway or some rapid transit network. The natural framework here is then the one of multiplex networks comprising two different transportation networks, one known while the structure of the second one is to be determined (for multiplexes in the context of optimization see for example). A practical realization of this problem concerns the specific case of subways (for a network analysis of subways, see for example,–). In most large cities, a subway system has been built and later enlarged, with current total lengths varying from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers. The geometry of these networks, as its total length increases, varies from simple lines to more complex shapes with loops for larger networks. In particular, for the largest networks, convergence to a structure with a well-connected central core and branches reaching out to suburbs has been observed.

Algorithmic aspects of network design have been studied within computational geometry (e.g.chapter 9) and location science (e.g.and references therein), and some simpler problems of this type have been addressed previously. For instance, the problem of the quickest access between an area and a given point was discussed in. In network science, the optimization problem is traditionally recast as a navigation problem in lattices with long-range connections. However, our specific question – optimal network topologies as a function of population distribution and network length – is largely an open problem. In, some results were obtained in two-dimensional systems by comparing a priori defined optimal network configurations. First, it was shown that, if the goal is reaching a single point in the plane, then the optimal network is necessarily a tree. Second, the paper hinted at the possibility of the existence of transitions between optimal configurations when the length of the network changes. More precisely, it has been shown that as the length of the network increases resources go preferentially to radial branches and that there is a sharp transition at a critical value of the length where a loop appears.

### Observation of solid-solid transitions in 3D crystals of colloidal superballs [^f2263448]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Self-organization in anisotropic colloidal suspensions leads to a fascinating range of crystal and liquid crystal phases induced by shape alone. Simulations predict the phase behaviour of a plethora of shapes while experimental realization often lags behind. Here, we present the experimental phase behaviour of superball particles with a shape in between that of a sphere and a cube. In particular, we observe the formation of a plastic crystal phase with translational order and orientational disorder, and the subsequent transformation into rhombohedral crystals. Moreover, we uncover that the phase behaviour is richer than predicted, as we find two distinct rhombohedral crystals with different stacking variants, namely hollow-site and bridge-site stacking. In addition, for slightly softer interactions we observe a solid-solid transition between the two. Our investigation brings us one step closer to ultimately controlling the experimental self-assembly of superballs into functional materials, such as photonic crystals.

### Quantitative analysis of face symmetry [^54c31607]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The major objective of this article was to report quantitatively the degree of human face symmetry for reported images taken from the Internet. From the original image of a certain person that appears in the center of each triplet, 2 symmetric combinations were constructed that are based on the left part of the image and its mirror image (left-left) and on the right part of the image and its mirror image (right-right). By applying a computer software that enables to determine length, surface area, and perimeter of any geometric shape, the following measurements were obtained for each triplet: face perimeter and area; distance between the pupils; mouth length; its perimeter and area; nose length and face length, usually below the ears; as well as the area and perimeter of the pupils. Then, for each of the above measurements, the value C, which characterizes the degree of symmetry of the real image with respect to the combinations right-right and left-left, was calculated. C appears on the right-hand side below each image. A high value of C indicates a low symmetry, and as the value is decreasing, the symmetry is increasing. The magnitude on the left relates to the pupils and compares the difference between the area and perimeter of the 2 pupils. The major conclusion arrived at here is that the human face is asymmetric to some degree; the degree of asymmetry is reported quantitatively under each portrait.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Left atrial and right atrial size measurement — pediatric echocardiography methods are illustrated and described: apical 4‑chamber and 2‑chamber views at ventricular end‑systole show left atrial major‑axis length and planimetered areas, and "Planimetered RA areas or RA volumes calculated from the product of RA area and major-axis length may be better at assessing RA size, though the sample sizes in most studies have been small". It also states that "As with LA volumes, 3D echocardiography may provide a useful means by which to measure RA volumes using the polyhedral surface algorithm". Additionally, "Raw values and indexed values on the basis of BSA in normal adults are available".

### Objective breast volume, shape and surface area assessment: a systematic review of breast measurement methods [^acb54259]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are many methods of measuring the breast and their clinical applications are well described in the literature. However, there has been no attempt to compare these various methods to allow the user to have a broad overview of the subject. The authors have attempted to summarise all the available methods to measure the breast in this article to provide a useful reference for all.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was performed, and the resulting articles were screened and reviewed. The data regarding the methods' mechanism, reliability, time and cost were evaluated and compared.

Results

A total of 74 articles dating from 1970 to 2013 were included in this study. All of the methods can be classified into those that measure (1) volume, (2) shape and (3) surface area. Each category consists of several methods that work through different mechanisms and they vary in their reliability and feasibility. Based on their mechanism, the volume measurement methods were further grouped into the natural shape methods, the stereological method, the geometrical methods and the mathematical modelling method.

Conclusions

More objective breast evaluation can be achieved if all three dimensions (volume, shape and surface area) are considered. In the volume measurements, 3D modelling and the MRI are the most reliable tools. Linear measurement (geometry) and mathematical modelling are less accurate but are more economical. In the shape measurements, besides the traditional linear measurement, 3D methods that can deliver colour-coded maps and Swanson's 2D photographic measurement system are capable of depicting and tracking breast shape changes after surgery. Although the surface area metric has not been used extensively, it has potential in clinical and research applications.

### Stability and nature of the volume collapse of ε-feOunder extreme conditions [^4dccf84c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Analysis of the EXAFS signals before and after the volume collapse. a k 2 χ (k) EXAFS signals and b FT at the Fe K-edge at ambient (red line) and 31 GPa (black line). The Fourier transformed k 2 χ (k) EXAFS signals at 0 GPa (c) and 31 GPa (d) are shown in black squares together with their best fittings of the modulus (red line) and imaginary parts (blue line)

The first peak observed in the radial distribution function corresponds to the oxygen environment of iron, uncorrected for the phase shifts, while the second one accounts for the contribution of iron-iron scattering paths. The starting model used for the fitting of the FT signals takes into account the ambient conditions nearest-neighbor Fe–O distances of the two distorted FeO 6 octahedra around Fe(1) and Fe(2), a regular FeO 6 octahedron around Fe(3) and a regular FeO 4 tetrahedron around Fe(4) (Table 2). The best fit, at 31 GPa, was obtained considering two distorted FeO 6 octahedra and two regular FeO 6 octahedra.

### The meningioma surface factor: a novel approach to quantify shape irregularity on preoperative imaging and its correlation with WHO grade [^445d140c]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas account for 20% of all meningiomas. An irregular tumor shape on preoperative MRI has been associated with WHO grade II-III histology. However, this subjective allocation does not allow quantification or comparison. An objective parameter of irregularity could substantially influence resection strategy toward a more aggressive approach. Therefore, the aim of this study was to objectively quantify the level of irregularity on preoperative MRI and predict histology based on WHO grade using this novel approach.

Methods

A retrospective study on meningiomas resected between January 2010 and December 2018 was conducted at two neurosurgical centers. This novel approach relies on the theory that a regularly shaped tumor has a smaller surface area than an irregularly shaped tumor with the same volume. A factor was generated using the surface area of a corresponding sphere as a reference, because for a given volume a sphere represents the shape with the smallest surface area possible. Consequently, the surface factor (SF) was calculated by dividing the surface area of a sphere with the same volume as the tumor with the surface area of the tumor. The resulting value of the SF ranges from > 0 to 1. Finally, the SF of each meningioma was then correlated with the corresponding histopathological grading.

Results

A total of 126 patients were included in this study; 60.3% had a WHO grade I, 34.9% a WHO grade II, and 4.8% a WHO grade III meningioma. Calculation of the SF demonstrated a significant difference in SFs between WHO grade I (SF 0.851) and WHO grade II-III meningiomas (SF 0.788) (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified SF as an independent prognostic factor for WHO grade (OR 0.000009, 95% CI 0.000–0.159; p = 0.020).

Conclusions

The SF is a proposed mathematical model for a quantitative and objective measurement of meningioma shape, instead of the present subjective assessment. This study revealed significant differences between the SFs of WHO grade I and WHO grade II-III meningiomas and demonstrated that SF is an independent prognostic factor for WHO grade.

### Measuring the size of individual particles from three-dimensional imaging experiments [^f215a900]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Often experimentalists study particulate samples that are nominally monodisperse. In reality, many samples have a polydispersity of 4–10%. At the level of an individual particle, the consequences of this polydispersity are unknown as it is difficult to measure an individual particle size from images of a dense sample. Here we propose a method to estimate individual particle radii from three-dimensional data of the particle positions. We first validate our method with simulations. We then apply our method to experimental data of colloidal suspensions observed with confocal microscopy. We demonstrate that we can recover the full particle size distribution in situ. Finally, we use our method to study the relationship between homogeneous colloidal crystal nucleation and particle sizes. We show that nucleation occurs in regions that are more monodisperse than average.

### Interim guidance for medical screening and hazard surveillance for workers potentially exposed to engineered nanoparticles [^ce7938d8]. CDC (2009). Medium credibility.

Interim guidance — state of evidence on engineered nanoparticle toxicity notes that assessing the potential toxicity of engineered nanoparticles is at an early stage, and at this time only a few types of engineered nanoparticles have been studied so a clear and consistent picture of the relevant endpoints for workers has not yet emerged. Various physicochemical parameters of nanoparticles, including composition, size, shape, surface characteristics, charge, functional groups, crystal structure, and solubility, appear to affect toxicity, and it is not known whether size is the overriding parameter. Some nanoscale particles may pose a health concern.

### Tensorial neutron tomography of three-dimensional magnetic vector fields in bulk materials [^c29fc92c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Simulation of the coil and the trapped magnetic flux

The magnetic vector fieldgenerated by an electric current at locationis calculated by using the Biot-Savart law

where I is the electric current along segmentof path C andthe distance betweenand. The electric coil has an inner diameter of 10 mm, a length of 12 mm and 9.5 turns and is made of 1-mm thick aluminum wire. The electric current applied is 0.75 A. Due to limitations of manufacture the geometry of the measured coil slightly differs from the ideal shape assumed for the calculation and simulated measurement.

For calculating the field in the superconductor, electric currents circulating around the superconductor in the five planes marked by horizontal green lines in Fig. 4f are assumed. More specifically, current flow is along a rectangular path around the sample and equally distributed in a zone reaching from the outer edge of the superconductor to 2.5 mm below its surface. The five currents are varied in a way that the resulting magnetic flux fits to the measured results shown in Fig. 4 a–c. From top to bottom in Fig. 4, the values are 0.933A, 0.655A, 0.535A, 0.584A, and 0.937A.

These calculations represent a simplification of the real current flows inside the superconducting sample that is in fact much less uniform and distributed over the whole volume as can be clearly seen in Fig. 4 a–c and the Supplementary Movie 3.

### Long-range atmospheric transport of microplastics across the Southern hemisphere [^20aee8c7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Conversion of microplastics and non-plastic particles size to mass

To estimate the MPs and non-plastic particles airborne flux, we also need to know the mass concentration (MC) in addition to the number concentration (NC). We used the cylinder modeland the column modelto estimate the surface area and volume (mass) values of fibers and fragments (Text S3). In addition, an approximation by assuming the length-to-width ratio equates to the width-to-height ratio (L / W = W / H) was also applied for fragments. However, it is important to note that this simplified approach to suggest surface area and volume (mass) likely represents a low estimate, as it does not take into account additional surface roughness and cracks which are likely to be present on environmental MPs, subsequently increasing the actual surface area. To calculate the MC of individual airborne fibers (Eq. 1), we approximated fibers to be cylinders and considered a void fraction (40%), where n is in the total number of fibers in the sample i; v i is the sampled air volume; f is the fiber void fraction (40%), because airborne fibers become looser than their original states (Fig. S16), and the value of f = 0.4 was used here. R and L were the fiber diameter and length as calculated by the ImageJ software according to the top-view projection images, respectively. ρ is the average density of primary fragments collected in this survey (Table S4). To calculate the mass of airborne fragments, we assumed they were smooth fragments and used the Eq. 2. S was calculated as the width times length of each fragment according to top-view microscopy images. H is the height of a fragment, which was assumed as W 2 / L, according to the approximation by Koelmans et al.

Particle weathering index calculations

To quantify the degree of photochemical weathering during the transport, a common metric carbonyl index (CI) which measures the growth in the carbonyl (C = O) absorption of MPswere calculated using Eq. 3, which represents the absorbance ratios for the C = O detection wavelength band, and C-H 3 detection wavelength band.where, A 1 is the absorbance of the carbonyl (C = O) peak for MPs, and A 2 is the absorbance of a reference peak (CH 2) for these MPs samples. Detailed area bands were depicted in Text S4 and Fig. S15.

American Thoracic Society/Fleischner Society — physiological and practical context for quantitative imaging emphasizes that "Variation in alveolar size also creates gradients in regional alveolar ventilation (V A) and fresh gas delivery to the alveolar space because alveoli in nondependent regions expand less for a given change in pressure and are less well ventilated", and that "The wedge shape of the lung means that more lung volume lies in the dependent third in supine posture than prone posture (13, 14)", with "Lung volumes measured by spirometry also vary with posture (15, 16)", complicating supine–prone comparisons; overcoming these is "critical to ensuring that 1) imaging metric derivation is accurate and reproducible and 2) measurements accurately represent (patho)physiology to guard against misinterpretation of results in all QI applications irrespective of modalities or disease entities". The "Goal and Significance" state that "This American Thoracic Society (ATS)–Fleischner Society workshop aims to promote unbiased quantification and physiologically accurate interpretation of in vivo imaging results to enhance understanding of pulmonary structure–function relationships and to compare what are believed to be comparable metrics obtained using different imaging modalities". It notes modality risks where "CT and PET involve radiation exposure, especially when specialized protocols (e.g., inspiration–expiration, pre- and postcontrast) are used. MRI may be time consuming and cumbersome. Contrast injections may cause adverse reactions or impair renal function", and that "Advanced imaging and analysis require sophisticated equipment, infrastructure, and manual steps or edits that substantially increase the financial burden".

### Cortical thickness systematically varies with curvature and depth in healthy human brains [^c86f2cc5]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 Sulcal depth

Sulcal shape descriptors, such as sulcal depth (Li et al.), sulcal width (Jin, Zhang, Shaw, Sachdev, & Cherbuin; Madan,), and the location and spatial frequency of sulcal pits (the deepest points of cortical sulci) (Im & Grant; Meng et al; Meng, Li, Lin, Gilmore, & Shen,), have been investigated previously in order to explore cortical development (Im et al.). Here, we focus on sulcal depth as an indicator of whether a point is toward the outer surface of the brain or deep in its interior. In general, sulcal distance is measured either relative to a morphological closing surface which tightly shrink‐wraps the cortical surface (Kao et al.), or a mid‐surface that crosses the cortical surface (Fischl, Sereno, & Dale). Here, we incorporated both methods for our sulcal depth calculations (Figure 5). First, a point cloud is generated from the reconstructed pial surface mesh. Secondly, a morphological closing is achieved by generating an alpha surface which wraps the point cloud. Alpha shapes are generalizations of convex hulls, which wrap point clouds to varying degrees of tightness (Edelsbrunner, Kirkpatrick, & Seidel; Edelsbrunner & Mucke). The value of the arbitrary real parametercharacterizes the shape of the point cloud; values close to zero capture the fine details of the set of points, while higher values create a convex hull (Gardiner, Behnsen, & Brassey). An alpha value of 20 yielded a plausible surface for closure of the cortex as it captured the shape of the outer cortical surface without extending into the sulcal valleys, while also outlining the concave medial temporal lobe and inferior medial regions (Figure 5 inset). After aligning both surfaces to a common origin, we shrink the alpha surface by a constant offset value at each node to generate a midcortical surface that divides the pial and white surfaces. The offset parameter was chosen to be 7 mm such that, in all subjects, roughly half of the vertices are outside the midcortical surface and half are inside. While a single parameter is not able to achieve a perfect fit for all subjects, this resulted in only a 5% difference between the number of inside and outside vertices in most of the subjects, with up to a 10% difference in ~10% of subjects. Finally, we calculate the Euclidean distance between each vertex on the cortical surface and the nearest vertex on the alpha surface. This is the sulcal depth, defined such that points buried in the brain's folds have a positive sulcal depth and points on the outer surface of the brain have a negative sulcal depth (Im et al; Van Essen). This method is different from the Freesurfer's sulcal depth measurement, which measures how far a vertex moves during an inflation operation (Fischl et al.). Other depth measurement methods involve calculations of the shortest geodesic distance (Rettmann, Han, Xu, & Prince; Tosun et al.) or the adaptive distance, which is a combination of both Euclidean and geodesic distances (Kao et al; Yun, Im, Yang, Yoon, & Lee). However, Euclidean and adaptive distance calculations perform similarly in distinguishing between control groups and Alzheimer patients (Yun et al.), so for the sake of simplicity, we employ Euclidean distance.

### Diffusion in hierarchical systems: a simulation study in models of healthy and diseased muscle tissue [^2807b0d3]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Baseline

The baseline scenario is used as a basis for comparison for microstructural changes. We employ microstructural parameters from a histological study of healthy mouse forelimb muscle tissue 13. We use maximum likelihood estimation to obtain gamma distribution parameters from histograms of muscle fiber diameter (shape = 13.5, scale = 3.02 × 10 −6 m, 3 sig. figs.) and construct tissue substrates containing 750 parallel cylinders. The size of the substrate was chosen to maximize intracellular volume fraction. A substrate size ofm gives intracellular volumes fractions of 70% or greater. Each cylinder contains 525 internal cylinders.

Figs. 2 a and 2 c illustrate the constructed substrates.

Figure 2
Cross sections of substrates used in different microstructural scenarios. Space outside cylinders is colored white, space inside cylinders is red, and cell membranes are purple. (a) Baseline substrate. Outer cylinders have radii drawn from a gamma distribution fitted to histology of healthy, wild‐type mouse forelimb tissue. Each cylinder on the substrate contains regularly packed internal cylinders (c). (b) Effect of atrophy scenario 1, in which all internal cylinders are reduced in radius by a fixed factor. (d) The same cylinder as (c) with internal cylinders reduced in radius. Positions are unchanged. (e) A substrate with cylinder radii drawn from a different distribution, fitted to histology of an Mdx mouse model of DMD. Close inspection reveals that these cylinders have a wider range of radii than those in (a), but the packing fractions achieved are similar. Internal structure in (e) is similar to that in (a). (f) Atrophy scenario 2. Here, complete nested cylinders are removed from the baseline arrangement at random. In this example, 10% have been removed. The permeability scenario is not shown, as it is visually identical to the baseline.

Atrophy as a Result of Fiber Diameter Shrinkage

Atrophy is modeled as change in the radii of internal cylinders. The radius of each internal cylinder is reduced by a specified factor. Positions of cylinders are unchanged. This increases the space between fibers and reduces restriction inside top‐level cylinders. Substrates in which the atrophy ratio is set to 5, 10, and 20% (ie, cylinder radii are 95, 90, or 80% of the equivalent in the baseline) are investigated. Figures 2 b and 2 d illustrate the internal fiber atrophy.

### Entropically engineered formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters of colloidal shapes [^f05ead35]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In summary, we studied the entropy-driven assembly and stabilization of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters in a one-component fluid of hard truncated tetrahedra (TT). We showed that the thermodynamic stability of the cubic and hexagonal diamond phases can be entropically controlled by designing the TT shape. If the particle shape is designed to have a negligible free energy difference between the two diamond crystals, the formation of twin boundaries is easily induced. This strategy can be used to induce the formation of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters in fluid via seed-assisted growth. We found that the formation of a fivefold cluster follows an error-and-repair mechanism that removes mismatches of the stacking sequence of adjacent twin planes through particle rearrangement at the cluster surface. We showed the formation of an icosahedral cluster by additional growth of twinned structures from a fivefold twinned seed. We showed that the icosahedral cluster of TTs can be entropically stabilized in a fluid, which is not possible for hard spheres without confinement. The capillary fluctuation method showed that a hard TT system has a much higher fluid-solid interfacial free energy (here, entropy) difference than that of a hard sphere system, directly implicating fluid-solid interfacial tension in stabilizing the TT ico-twin.

Our findings provide a quantitative understanding of the formation and stabilization of fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters in hard particle systems. Importantly, we showed that the twinning behavior and the interfacial free energy difference may be entropically engineered by particle shape design. Experimentally, colloidal tetrahedral particles are synthesizable,– with tunable shape. Non-complementary DNA could be used to make non-interacting particles that might closely approximate those studied here. Fivefold and icosahedral twinned clusters should be also attainable with attractive TT particle shapes, provided the explicit attraction favors face-to-face alignment. Such interparticle attraction could be realized through organic ligands, via van der Waals forces or self-complementary DNA, both of which are commonly used to drive nanoparticle assembly.

### Predicting materials properties without crystal structure: deep representation learning from stoichiometry [^a59145a6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Machine learning has the potential to accelerate materials discovery by accurately predicting materials properties at a low computational cost. However, the model inputs remain a key stumbling block. Current methods typically use descriptors constructed from knowledge of either the full crystal structure - therefore only applicable to materials with already characterised structures - or structure-agnostic fixed-length representations hand-engineered from the stoichiometry. We develop a machine learning approach that takes only the stoichiometry as input and automatically learns appropriate and systematically improvable descriptors from data. Our key insight is to treat the stoichiometric formula as a dense weighted graph between elements. Compared to the state of the art for structure-agnostic methods, our approach achieves lower errors with less data.

### Determination of rheology and surface tension of airway surface liquid: a review of clinical relevance and measurement techniques [^88ce1c10]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Pressure-volume measurements

Some early studies used pressure-volume data from air- and liquid-filled excised lungs to calculate alveolar surface tension. For example, assuming a maximum surface tension and a constant relationship between lung surface area and lung volume, Bachofen and coworkers derived an equation that relates the surface tension (γ) to lung volme (V) and the component of recoil pressure (P s) caused by surface tension in the formwhere k is the shape factor, which can be found from the maximum surface tension. Thus, for each pair of air and saline P-V curves, the corresponding surface tension-surface area can be obtained by the above equation. Smith and Stamenovic provided another approach to deduce values of alveolar surface tension from pressure-volume data. Their approach rests on the assumption that at a given volume, P s is uniquely determined by γ. First, the pressure-volume curves of control air-filled lungs and test liquid-filled lungs with a limited set of fixed interfacial tensions are measured. As the intersections between the curves with the normal and test liquid interfaces define states of equal surface tension, by pooling data from all intersections, the surface tension-lung volume relationships are obtained. In addition, Wilson used an energy analysis method to calculate the values of surface tension from pressure-volume loops. The reader is referred to reference for a detailed description.

### Geometry analysis and systematic synthesis of highly porous isoreticular frameworks with a unique topology [^d243ea75]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Porous coordination polymers are well known for their easily tailored framework structures and corresponding properties. Although systematic modulations of pore sizes of binary prototypes have gained great success, simultaneous adjustment of both pore size and shape of ternary prototypes remains unexplored, owing to the difficulty in controlling the self-assembly of multiple molecular building blocks. Here we show that simple geometry analysis can be used to estimate the influence of the linker lengths and length ratios on the synthesis/construction difficulties and framework stabilities of a highly symmetric, ternary prototype composed of a typical trinuclear metal cluster and two types of bridging carboxylate ligands. As predicted, systematic syntheses with 5×5 ligand combinations produced 13 highly porous isoreticular frameworks, which show not only systematic adjustment of pore volumes (0.49–2.04 cm(3) g(-1)) and sizes (7.8–13.0 Å; 5.2–12.0 Å; 7.4–17.4 Å), but also anisotropic modulation of the pore shapes.

### Evidence for a low number prior in children's intuitive number sense [^9336fd90]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

Researchers have recently focused on the ANS's sensitivity to information and problems that occur in real‐world contexts (Odic and Oppenheimer; Sanford and Halberda; Testolin et al.). Beyond helping us understand the utility of the ANS in naturalistic scenarios, this work is further informed by the argument that the ANS emerged through evolutionary pressures (Brannon and Terrace). Consistent with this, the ANS is found in many non‐human animals (Cantlon and Brannon; Howard et al.), including from birth (Rugani et al.), and has been shown to inform decisions in naturalistic settings (e.g. monkeys appear to use their ANS when migrating; Piantadosi and Cantlon).

One prominent statistical feature of numbers in the real world is the negative power‐law distribution of numbers (Piantadosi; Testolin et al.). When examining distributions of objects in the real world, collections of objects with a smaller cardinality (i.e. 1–10) are more likely to occur than collections of objects with a larger cardinality. Analysis of real‐world photographs, for example, shows that scenes containing five items are more than 47 times more likely than scenes containing fifteen items (Testolin et al.). A perceptual system optimized to function in the real world should prioritize reliable mappings for things that occur most often in the real world (Gold and Stocker; Loh and Bartulovic). Piantadosi theorizes that this distributional property explains why the ANS represents smaller numbers with higher precision than larger numbers, resulting in scalar variability and Weber's law (Feigenson et al; Odic and Starr).

### Imaging the node-linker coordination in the bulk and local structures of metal-organic frameworks [^9b38af55]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

The iDPC-STEM imaging of MIL-101 crystals

The MOF specimen we used in this work for the iDPC-STEM imaging is MIL-101, a typical stable crystalline MOF with the giant unit cells (89 Å) and cages. The MIL-101 framework is built by the corner-sharing super tetrahedrons consisting of the trimeric Cr nodes and 1,4-benzene dicarboxylate (BDC) linkers. Due to the large cage volumes and surface areas, the MIL-101 crystals were used as the supports for various metal atoms and particles in catalysis –. Thus, it is of great significance to atomically resolve the node-linker coordination in the local structures of MIL-101 for the further characterizations of these catalysts. Figure 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1 show the structural model of MIL-101 framework. Especially, the < 110 > projection exhibits the complicated characteristic spheres regularly arranged and marked in Fig. 1b, whereas the node-linker coordination between them can be individually resolved. These Cr/BDC super tetrahedrons between characteristic spheres helped revealing the connection of cages inside the frameworks, especially at the surfaces and interfaces.

### The open-ocean missing backscattering is in the structural complexity of particles [^c1119696]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To understand what might be the consequences of using the homogeneous-sphere model to simulate the scattering properties of complex natural particles (e.g. phytoplankton), it is instructive to attempt to model the scattering of a complex particle by only using homogeneous spheres. Figure 8 demonstrates that, to reproduce the VSF of a coated sphere, multiple homogeneous particles of different sizes are needed. Specifically, as expected from previous studies, one homogeneous sphere of the same size and volume-averaged refractive index as the coated sphere can reproduce the forward scattering. However, to also reproduce the backscattering of the coated sphere, we must add the scattering intensities of multiple small spheres to that of the largest sphere, as they are the only homogeneous particles with a high backscattering efficiency. We thus postulate that previous conclusions regarding the sources of oceanic backscattering based on the homogeneous-sphere model might have been distorted by the same limitations illustrated in the example of Fig. 8. In summary, an optical model that is too simplistic to represent the complexity of marine particles might have considerably altered our interpretation of the sources of oceanic backscattering.

Fig. 8
The homogeneous-sphere model can only reproduce the shape of the volume scattering function (VSF) of a complex particle by using multiple homogeneous spheres. Only the forward scattering (angles < 90°) of a coated sphere (black line) can be reproduced by a homogeneous sphere (blue line) with the same size and volume-averaged refractive index. To reproduce the backscattering (angles > 90°) of the coated sphere, twelve homogeneous spheres with diameter equal to 0.2 µm purple line and the same volume-averaged refractive index of the coated sphere must be added to the largest homogeneous sphere (red line). The refractive index of the coat of the coated sphere was set equal to 1.13, the coat thickness was 13% of the radius and the volume-averaged refractive index of the whole particle was set equal to 1.06. The backscattering ratios are equal to 0.88% and 0.85% for coated and combined homogeneous spheres, respectively. VSFs are normalised to the total scattering, and are shown for the wavelength 532 nm
