## Question

What's the work up for suspected mucinous neoplasm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic workup for suspected mucinous neoplasm across different organs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and anatomic localization. Then, I should verify the initial imaging strategy and what features to look for. Next, I will examine organ-specific diagnostic steps for ovary, appendix, pancreas, liver, and peritoneum, including tumor markers and endoscopic evaluation. After that, I should confirm when and how to obtain tissue diagnosis and ancillary tests. Finally, I will integrate multidisciplinary review and preoperative planning into a practical, organ-tailored algorithm with attention to pitfalls and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why anatomic localization matters. Suspected mucinous neoplasms span ovary, appendix, pancreas, liver, and peritoneum, and management hinges on identifying the primary site because mucinous carcinomas frequently represent metastases rather than primaries, particularly in the ovary, where primary invasive mucinous tumors are uncommon and most mucinous ovarian tumors reflect GI metastases, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion for a GI primary and tailor the workup accordingly [^112XBfUG] [^112wTqG9] [^1151vX1N].

> I will now examine the initial imaging strategy. Wait, let me verify modality choices: for a pelvic mass or suspected ovarian involvement, start with pelvic ultrasound and then add contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis for characterization and staging. For appendiceal or peritoneal disease, CT is the workhorse. For pancreatic cysts, MRI/MRCP is preferred for delineating ductal communication. For hepatic cysts, MRI best shows septations and mural nodularity, and across sites, MRI can depict mucin's gelatinous features and organ displacement, which can refine differential and guide surgery [^111Suky9] [^113kbzHE] [^113QsoFZ] [^116sfzRf] [^116bYqQG].

> Hold on, I should verify ovarian-specific workup because the pretest probability of metastasis changes management. If mucinous histology is suspected or confirmed, I need to check the upper and lower GI tract to exclude an occult primary; upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are indicated, and if a mass is present, biopsy is warranted to document a GI primary; I should also obtain CEA and CA 19–9 because elevations favor a GI source, and a CA-125 to CEA ratio greater than 25 supports a primary ovarian source rather than colorectal metastasis; appendectomy should not be routine — let me double-check that — NCCN advises appendectomy only if the appendix is abnormal at surgery, whereas some series suggest considering appendectomy broadly when mucinous ovarian tumors are present, so I need to align with institutional practice and intraoperative findings while avoiding unnecessary resections [^116fLvbd] [^11496pu1] [^117LYsCf] [^112wTqG9] [^115ri8Ra] [^1112BJhv].

> Next, I should review appendiceal neoplasm workup. CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is mandatory at diagnosis. Colonoscopy should be performed preoperatively to exclude synchronous colonic lesions. I need to check baseline tumor markers CEA, CA 19–9, and CA-125, as they inform prognosis and are useful for surveillance. Peritoneal cytology is not recommended routinely. I should confirm the pathologic subtype because infiltrative adenocarcinoma behaves differently from pushing LAMN/HAMN, which affects nodal evaluation and extent of resection. For small, well-differentiated T1 lesions without LVI, appendectomy may suffice, whereas larger or higher-risk lesions often require right hemicolectomy with adequate nodal harvest [^1119bBH9] [^115Amvry] [^113G8mMQ] [^114f3uLT] [^114B23i8] [^114HdsDE].

> Let me consider pancreatic mucinous cysts carefully. MRI/MRCP helps identify main duct involvement and mural nodules; EUS with FNA is indicated when worrisome features are present or diagnosis is uncertain; cyst fluid CEA helps distinguish mucinous from non-mucinous lesions, though cutoffs vary and a threshold around 192 ng/mL is commonly used, while recognizing lower cutoffs may improve sensitivity; cytology and mucin staining add value, and I should integrate these with Fukuoka/AGA risk features to decide between surveillance and surgery; for branch-duct IPMN, absence of high-risk stigmata supports surveillance, whereas main duct involvement or enhancing mural nodules favor resection; hold on, I should verify surveillance intervals — most guidelines favor MRI at defined intervals with escalation for worrisome changes [^116sfzRf] [^111XqgYy] [^112nU5TV] [^117S59F2] [^115zLfMw] [^114HK9oh].

> I will now examine hepatic mucinous cystic neoplasm evaluation. MRI is preferred and demonstrates septations arising from the wall, mural nodularity, and sometimes calcifications; wait, I almost recommended tumor markers — let me reconsider — EASL explicitly advises against serum or cyst fluid CEA or CA 19–9 because they do not reliably distinguish MCN from simple cysts; aspiration or biopsy is discouraged due to low diagnostic yield and potential harm; complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice when feasible, and nonoperative candidates should undergo surveillance imaging with MDT input for interval decisions [^113kbzHE] [^116ybvZF] [^113eKMYE] [^1144DXZM].

> For suspected pseudomyxoma peritonei, I should confirm imaging features and source. CT classically shows scalloped liver/spleen margins with mucinous ascites, and MRI can further delineate extent. I need to check the appendix even if grossly normal because appendiceal LAMN is the most common source. If ovarian involvement coexists, I must differentiate primary ovarian mucinous carcinoma from ovarian metastasis using immunohistochemistry and clinical correlation. Management typically requires cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC in specialized centers, and tumor grade in the peritoneum drives prognosis more than the appendiceal primary grade [^116bYqQG] [^116TPFFm] [^114HdsDE] [^115MWkHN].

> Let me first confirm the approach to tissue diagnosis and ancillary testing. Core needle or excisional biopsy provides architecture and allows immunohistochemistry to distinguish primary from metastatic sites; in mucinous ovarian tumors, PAX8 positivity supports ovarian origin, while CK20/CDX2 and SATB2 favor colorectal/appendiceal origin; frozen section is useful intraoperatively but has known pitfalls in mucinous tumors, so permanent sections and targeted IHC panels are often necessary; molecular testing for KRAS, GNAS, MSI, and RAS/BRAF may refine classification and guide therapy, especially in appendiceal primaries and when considering anti-EGFR strategies [^114wLXSh] [^1171LYYs] [^114HdsDE] [^111rcALm].

> I need to ensure I incorporate multidisciplinary review and preoperative planning. A gynecologic, surgical, medical, and radiologic oncology MDT should review imaging, endoscopy results, tumor markers, and pathology to determine primary site, operability, and sequence of interventions; fertility-sparing surgery can be considered for early-stage ovarian mucinous tumors; for appendiceal disease, I should align nodal and resection strategy with pathologic subtype and stage; for pancreatic IPMN, main duct disease or high-risk features should prompt surgical referral, while branch-duct lesions without worrisome features may be surveilled with MRI [^1151vX1N] [^113G8mMQ] [^112nU5TV].

> But wait, what if imaging is indeterminate or tumor markers are equivocal? I should double-check for false reassurance: a normal appendix on imaging or exam does not exclude an appendiceal primary, especially if ovarian tumor is bilateral or there is peritoneal disease; CT has limited sensitivity for appendiceal neoplasms in the setting of appendicitis; conversely, cyst fluid CEA has imperfect sensitivity and specificity, so results must be integrated with imaging and cytology; when in doubt, repeat cross-sectional imaging with a different modality or EUS can resolve discrepancies and refine surgical planning [^117AemvL] [^117S59F2] [^116sfzRf].

> To synthesize an organ-specific algorithm without losing nuance: for an adnexal mucinous mass, start with ultrasound, then CT/MRI, obtain CEA and CA 19–9, and pursue upper and lower endoscopy to exclude a GI primary. Manage surgically based on frozen and permanent pathology, reserving appendectomy for abnormal appendices or high-suspicion scenarios per institutional policy. For an appendiceal mucocele or mass, obtain CT/MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis, colonoscopy, and CEA/CA 19–9/CA-125, then resect according to size, grade, and invasion. For a pancreatic cyst with worrisome features, use MRI/MRCP and EUS-FNA with cyst fluid CEA and cytology, and escalate to surgery if high-risk stigmata are present. For a complex hepatic cyst with septations or mural nodularity, confirm with MRI and plan for resection, avoiding aspiration and tumor markers [^111Suky9] [^1119bBH9] [^116sfzRf] [^113kbzHE].

> Final check before concluding: I should confirm that the workup is individualized by site and patient factors such as age, comorbidities, and fertility goals. Mucinous neoplasms often behave differently from their non-mucinous counterparts, and misclassification carries consequences, so I must maintain a high index of suspicion for metastatic disease, especially in the ovary, and involve MDT early to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment. This organ-specific, stepwise approach anchored to high-quality guidelines and imaging-pathology correlation minimizes diagnostic error and optimizes outcomes [^1151vX1N] [^114HdsDE] [^113kbzHE].

For suspected mucinous neoplasm, begin with **high-quality cross-sectional imaging** (CT/MRI) [^116sfzRf] to define anatomy, size, and features, then **obtain tissue diagnosis** via EUS-FNA or core biopsy [^112pWEqi] for definitive classification and to guide management. Add **tumor markers** (CEA, CA 19–9, CA-125) to support diagnosis and monitor response [^114f3uLT], and perform a **GI evaluation** (colonoscopy/endoscopy) to exclude occult GI primaries, especially for ovarian or appendiceal lesions [^112XBfUG]. Use EUS with cyst fluid analysis for pancreatic lesions [^112maF33] and MRI for hepatic cysts [^113QsoFZ]; avoid routine cyst fluid tumor markers in liver cysts [^113eKMYE]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with surgical resection for resectable disease and surveillance for low-risk lesions [^111XqgYy] [^116ybvZF].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

Obtain a detailed **history** (symptoms, family history, prior GI disease) and perform a focused examination, including abdominal and pelvic evaluation [^1153bTnk].

---

## Imaging studies

### General imaging

Use **CT or MRI** [^1119bBH9] as first-line imaging to define lesion size, location, and features; MRI is preferred for hepatic and pancreatic cysts because of superior soft-tissue contrast [^112cuYK2] [^1127p7H9] [^116bYqQG]. PET-CT may be considered for **indeterminate lesions** or to assess metastatic disease when results will alter management [^111Suky9].

---

### Organ-specific imaging

| **Organ** | **Imaging modality** | **Key features** |
|-|-|-|
| Ovary | MRI | - Large <br/> - Multiloculated <br/> - Unilateral cystic masses with variable signal due to mucin content [^116C5oNM] |
| Appendix | CT | - Dilated appendix <br/> - Mural thickening <br/> - Calcifications <br/> - Periappendiceal fat stranding [^114g4bvu] |
| Pancreas | MRI/MRCP | - Cystic lesions with septations <br/> - Mural nodules <br/> - Main duct dilation (IPMN) [^115zLfMw] |
| Liver | MRI | - Septations <br/> - Mural nodules <br/> - Calcifications <br/> - Mixed solid-cystic components [^116ybvZF] |

---

## Laboratory tests

- **Tumor markers**: CEA, CA 19–9, and CA-125 to support diagnosis, assess malignancy risk, and monitor response [^116fLvbd] [^117LYsCf].

- **Cyst fluid analysis**: CEA, amylase, cytology, and mucin staining for pancreatic cysts; CEA > 192 ng/mL suggests mucinous cyst [^116xUXfF].

- **Avoidance**: Do not routinely obtain CEA or CA 19–9 in blood or cyst fluid for hepatic cysts, as they do not reliably distinguish benign from malignant lesions [^113eKMYE].

---

## Endoscopic evaluation

Perform **upper and lower endoscopy** to exclude occult GI primaries, particularly in ovarian or appendiceal lesions [^116fLvbd]. Use **EUS-FNA** for pancreatic cysts to obtain tissue and fluid for analysis [^117D2PU4].

---

## Tissue diagnosis

- **Biopsy**: Obtain tissue via EUS-FNA, core needle biopsy, or surgical excision for definitive diagnosis and classification [^112TNnrz].

- **Immunohistochemistry**: Use markers such as CK7, CK20, CDX2, PAX8, and SATB2 to distinguish primary from metastatic lesions and determine origin [^1151vX1N].

---

## Multidisciplinary team (MDT) review

Engage **surgical oncology, gastroenterology, radiology, pathology, and medical oncology** to guide management decisions [^112nU5TV].

---

## Management strategies

- **Surgical resection**: Gold standard for resectable mucinous neoplasms, including ovarian, appendiceal, pancreatic, and hepatic lesions [^116ybvZF].

- **Surveillance**: For low-risk lesions (e.g. small branch-duct IPMN, benign hepatic cysts), use periodic imaging and clinical follow-up [^111XqgYy].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Consider chemotherapy or radiotherapy for advanced or unresectable disease, particularly in mucinous adenocarcinomas [^113G8mMQ].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Use **regular imaging** (CT/MRI) and tumor markers to detect recurrence or progression [^1119bBH9]. Provide **patient education** on signs of recurrence and the importance of adherence to follow-up [^notfound].

---

The workup for suspected mucinous neoplasm entails **imaging, tissue diagnosis, tumor markers, endoscopic evaluation, and MDT review**, with management tailored to lesion characteristics and patient factors.

### Mucinous breast lesions: diagnostic challenges [^113gF8Qn]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Breast lesions with mucin represent a broad spectrum of entities, ranging from benign fibrocystic changes with luminal mucin to mucocele-like lesions (MLL), which can be associated with banal epithelial alterations, atypical ductal hyperplasia or ductal carcinoma in situ. Occasionally invasive mucinous carcinoma can be identified in contiguity with MLL. Diagnostic challenges are enumerated, histological differentials are discussed, and a practical approach towards resolving some of these issues is provided. In addition to these lesions with abundant extracellular mucin, there are also conditions that feature stromal mucinous or myxoid material, as well as rare entities that demonstrate both epithelial extracellular and stromal mucin.

### Consensus guideline for the management of patients with appendiceal tumors, part 1: appendiceal tumors without peritoneal involvement [^1139sp81]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Appendiceal tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors that may be localized or disseminate throughout the peritoneum. Limited high quality clinical data exist and many practices have been extrapolated from colorectal cancer without validation in appendiceal cohorts. There are many controversies regarding the treatment of appendiceal tumors, and practices vary widely between centers and care settings. A national consensus update of best management practices for appendiceal malignancies was performed to better standardize care.

Methods

The 2018 Chicago Consensus guideline was updated through a modified Delphi consensus, performed over two rounds using nationally circulated surveys. Supporting evidence was evaluated using rapid systematic reviews. Key systemic therapy concepts were summarized by content experts.

Results

Most supporting literature consists of observational studies, but high-quality studies increasingly are becoming available to drive management. Two consensus-based pathways were generated for localized appendiceal tumors, one for epithelial mucinous neoplasms and another for appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Of 138 participants responding in the first round, 133 (96%) engaged in the second round. Greater than 90% consensus was achieved for all pathway blocks. Key points include minimizing intervention invasiveness where permitted by pathologic classification and margin status, and determining which margin and pathologic findings are indications for consideration of cytoreduction with or without intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Surveillance and systemic therapy recommendations are also presented.

Conclusion

With growing but still primarily observational evidence currently dictating care, these consensus recommendations provide expert guidance in the treatment of appendiceal tumors without peritoneal involvement.

### Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms: diagnosis and management [^112hj1XR]. The Oncologist (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (AMNs) are a rare and heterogeneous disease for which clinical management is challenging. We aim to review the literature regarding modalities of treatment to guide the management of AMNs.

Methods and Review Criteria

We conducted a PubMed search in February 2016 for English-language publications, using the terms "appendiceal", "appendix", "carcinoma", "cancer", "mucinous", "treatment", "genes", "target", "genomic", and terms listed in the articles' subheadings. Published reports and abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings were also searched.

Results

In this review, we summarize current data and controversies in AMN classification, clinical presentation, molecular alterations, treatment outcomes with regard to cytoreductive surgery, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), and the role of systemic chemotherapy.

Conclusion

Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms are a heterogeneous group of tumors with a rising incidence. Treatment is based on stage and histology. Low-grade tumors are treated surgically with resection of the primary site in early stage disease, or peritoneal debulking and HIPEC in patients with advanced stage disease. Treatment of high-grade tumors requires further prospective trials, and options include debulking surgery and HIPEC with or without preoperative chemotherapy. Trials evaluating novel therapies based on the molecular profiling of AMN tumors are needed to evaluate therapeutic options in patients who are not surgical candidates.

Implications For Practice

This review provides a reference to guide gastroenterologists, pathologists, surgeons, and oncologists in the management of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (AMNs), a rare and heterogeneous disease with no consensus on histologic classification or guidelines for treatment algorithms. This review summarizes all AMN classifications and proposes a treatment algorithm based on stage and histology of disease.

### Proteomic mucin profiling for the identification of cystic precursors of pancreatic cancer [^112EJEZo]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Mucinous tumors are frequent incidental findings, most commonly affecting the elderly. Progression to malignancy may take several years. Consequently, although resection is generally life-saving once malignant transformation has occurred, many patients with premalignant tumors would likely benefit greatly from being spared surgery. Currently, however, conventional methods for the prediction of malignancy in PCLs are not sufficiently reliable to safely guide treatment recommendations. MUC1 expression by contrast, identified malignancy in PCLs with 89.7% accuracy and could thus add a new dimension to the evaluation of these lesions. Further studies are required to validate these promising findings.

Some limitations of the study merit further consideration. First, to avoid bias from underrepresentation of benign lesions, the analysis was not restricted to cases with supportive histology. The follow-up period for conservatively treated lesions was defined by what was considered clinically motivated for each patient and, whenever warranted, supported by review by a multidisciplinary board/senior expert surgeon. Second, the rare solid pseudopapillary neoplasms and cystic neuroendocrine tumors were not considered in this study because they can be readily identified by cytology/immunocytochemistry. It should therefore be emphasized that mucin profiling is not intended to replace routine cytological assessment. These two analyses can easily be performed in parallel.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^111XqgYy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cyst surveillance for presumed intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) when size is less than 2 cm is structured by size: For " < 1 cm", perform "MRI* q2 years × 4 years", with "Stable size and appearance" leading to "Consider lengthening of interval imaging", while "Increase in cyst size" leads to "Consider shorter interval with MRI or EUS ± FNA within 6 months" followed by "MRI in 1 year and then return to original surveillance based on cyst size". For "1–2 cm", obtain "MRI* q1 years × 3 years" and, if "Stable size and appearance", proceed to "MRI q2 years × 4 years" and "If stable, consider lengthening of interval", whereas "Increase in cyst size" again leads to "Consider shorter interval with MRI or EUS ± FNA within 6 months". Surveillance notes specify "Surveillance should preferably be performed with same imaging modality in attempt to capture consistency in size measurements".

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small bowel adenocarcinoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend to consider magnetic resonance of the abdomen and pelvis or MR enterography where there is a contraindication to CT. Consider magnetic resonance of the abdomen with and without contrast for further evaluation of indeterminate liver lesions on CT. Obtain MRCP in the initial workup of suspected duodenal malignancies to further ascertain the tumor site of origin, particularly in cases of biliary obstruction.

### Management algorithms for pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^111Nrqrj]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

The detection of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) has increased owing to the advancement and widespread use of imaging modalities, resulting in differences between past and current management methods for PCNs, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Therefore, clinicians should accurately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment strategies. However, previously published treatment guidelines for IPMNs present different indications for treatment.

Objective —

To review the current status of PCNs, including epidemiologic change, malignancy risk, and factors for treatment, and to provide the optimal management algorithms for PCNs, including IPMNs, from the clinician's point of view.

Data Sources —

Literature review of published studies and the authors' own work.

Conclusions —

The treatment of PCNs relies on the type of cyst that is present or suspected. Serous cystic neoplasms are usually benign, and observation is sufficient. However, surgical treatment is required for mucinous cystic neoplasms, and malignancy risk differs according to lesion size. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms also require surgery. The detection of small IPMNs has been increasing, and most branch duct-type IPMNs are dormant. However, cysts 3 cm or larger or growing branch duct-type IPMNs must be carefully monitored because of the increasing risk of malignancy. Therefore, surveillance strategies should be different according to the size of the lesions. A tailored approach is needed for selecting surgery or surveillance, considering the malignancy potential of the lesion and patient-associated factors such as operative risks and life expectancy. Nomograms are valuable tools for selecting treatment methods as a customized approach for IPMNs.

### ACG practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of neoplastic pancreatic cysts [^112maF33]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of pancreatic cystic lesions is a common problem. At least 1% of hospitalized patients at major medical centers will have a pancreatic cystic lesion on cross sectional imaging. Up to a quarter of all pancreata examined in an autopsy series contained a pancreatic cyst, 16% of which were lined by an "atypical" epithelium and 3% of which had progressed to carcinoma-in-situ (high grade dysplasia). in the past, it was thought these cystic lesions were benign, but increasing evidence points to the cystic lesions as being the origin of some pancreatic malignancies. The most important clinical tools in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cystic lesions are cross sectional imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, and cyst fluid analysis. The most important differential diagnosis is distinguishing mucinous (pre-malignant) and non-mucinous cystic lesions. The findings of a macrocystic lesion containing viscous fluid rich in CEA are supportive of a diagnosis of a mucinous lesion. Serous lesion are the most common non-mucinous cyst and are characterized by a microcystic morphology, non-viscous fluid and a low concentration of CEA in the cyst fluid. The following document includes a description of neoplastic pancreatic cysts, a critical review of relevant diagnostic tests, and a discussion of treatment options. We have proposed a set of guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with neoplastic pancreatic cysts. The guidelines are based on published data backed by an analysis of the quality of the data and are designed to address the most frequent and important clinical scenarios. In addition to providing a summary of the diagnostic data, we offer diagnostic and management suggestions based on 13 common clinical problems. Although the field is rapidly evolving, a set of core principles is provided based on a balance between the risk of malignancy and the benefit of pancreatic resection.

### Mucinous tumours of appendix and ovary: an overview and evaluation of current practice [^113jwfVr]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Mucinous lesions of the appendix and ovary are commonly encountered in routine practice. There are several published classification schemes for appendiceal mucinous neoplasms with resultant inconsistent use of terms and clinical doubt. While nomenclature is more settled with regards to ovarian mucinous neoplasms, the difficulty here lies with distinguishing primary from secondary mucinous tumours. This review highlights the terminology and nomenclature for appendiceal mucinous tumours, the relationship with ovarian mucinous neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritonei, and the features that assist in separating primary from secondary ovarian mucinous tumours.

### The spectrum of mucinous lesions of the breast [^115uRt7v]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Context —

Mucinous lesions of the breast encompass many entities ranging from benign to malignant and nonneoplastic to neoplastic. Lesions discussed under this category are mucocele-like lesion, mucinous carcinoma, mucinous micropapillary carcinoma, solid papillary carcinoma, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma with extracellular mucin, mucinous ductal carcinoma in situ, and metastasis.

Objective —

To review clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of mucinous lesions of the breast, their differential diagnoses, and challenging features on core needle biopsies.

Data Sources —

The existing scientific and clinical literature as of December 2021.

Conclusions —

The category of mucinous lesions of the breast is vast and the differential diagnosis can be challenging, especially on core needle biopsies. In all cases, clinical, radiologic, and pathologic correlation is necessary to reach a comprehensive diagnosis. Given that the prognosis and management of each entity is different, being aware of these entities and their nuances is critical for a pathologist to guide accurate management.

### Review: pathology and its clinical relevance of mucinous appendiceal neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritonei [^115NM5ww]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Until recently, many classifications existed for the terminology and histopathologic classification of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms, mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinomas, and pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). A major accomplishment was achieved by consensus-based histopathologic classifications on behalf of the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International regarding mucinous appendiceal tumours and PMP. As different classifications were used over the years and also owing to the rare nature of these tumors, many clinicians are not familiar with the terminology and the impact on patient management. Hence, an overview concerning mucinous appendiceal neoplasms, mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinomas, and PMP is provided to serve as an introduction into the basic morphology of these tumors with tentative recommendations for management.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^116ybvZF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver (MCN-L) — imaging features and management — Mural calcifications have a 90% specificity for MCN-L and can be seen in up to 69% of cysts, and on MRI the presence and enhancement of septations and mural nodularity are a highly sensitive feature, nearly 100%. Complete surgical resection is the gold standard for all MCNs, whereas cyst aspiration, sclerotherapy, partial resection, or cyst fenestration are not recommended. Fluid aspiration or biopsy of MCN-L is not recommended to distinguish it from a simple hepatic cyst because of low sensitivity, and MCN-L with thick septations, fenestrations, nodularity, calcifications, or mixed solid and cystic components require prompt evaluation for complete surgical resection. For patients who are not surgical candidates, surveillance imaging should be implemented, although a specific interval cannot be recommended, and changes suggestive of malignant degeneration should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board for consideration for nonsurgical options. In the postoperative period, surveillance imaging is recommended, although there are no established guidelines regarding specific intervals.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: ovarian cancer / fallopian tube cancer / primary peritoneal cancer, version 3.2024 [^116fLvbd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 — Mucinous neoplasms of the ovary — Additional workup indicates that, if not previously done, GI evaluation, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA 19–9 are listed, and clinicians are advised to consider surgical staging and resection of residual disease, consider germline and somatic testing, and consider additional testing including upper and lower endoscopic evaluation to aid in distinguishing metastatic gastrointestinal malignancies from primary mucinous ovarian cancer; all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Factors associated with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma… [^112s75Aw]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

The measurement of mural nodule size in all types of carcinoma and carcinoembryonic antigen levels in the pancreatic juice in main duct and mixed type carcinoma might play important roles in predicting invasive intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma. Importance Invasive intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma has aggressive malignant behavior, including lymph node metastasis. It is important to identify factors associated with invasive intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma to determine operative procedures, but they remain unclear. The cutoff values for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, determined by a receiver operating characteristic, were 9 mm for branch duct and 6 mm for mixed and main duct carcinoma.

Conclusions and Relevance The measurement of mural nodule size in all types of carcinomas and carcinoembryonic antigen level in the pancreatic juice in mixed and main duct carcinomas might play important roles in predicting invasive intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma, but further large studies are needed to confirm these results. High mural nodule size measured by endoscopic ultrasonography was found to be significantly associated with invasive IPMC for all morphological types, which is consistent with a malignant predictor shown in several reports. 19, 20, 27, 35 High accuracies of invasive IPMC were found in all types of carcinomas by using the determined cutoff levels of 9 mm in patients with BD IPMN and 6 mm in patients with MD IPMN and mixed IPMN for mural nodule size in this study. Therefore, immediate surgical resection, with the same lymph node dissection as for PDAC, might be necessary in these patients.

However, some invasive IPMC did not have a higher mural nodule than these cutoff levels, indicating that it might not be enough to determine whether the tumor should be resected or observed only by measurement of mural nodule size. Therefore, more useful combinations of other factors, such as new biomarkers and mural nodule size, should be developed by further studies to have a higher accuracy of invasive IPMC. When all types of IPMN were taken together, using factors associated with invasive IPMC for each, a high diagnostic accuracy of 86. 0% was found in this study. When the diagnostic ability of invasive IPMC was analyzed using high-risk stigmata or worrisome features, as suggested by the 2012 international guideline, 3 lower accuracies were found than the identified predictors in this study.

### Update on pancreatic cyst fluid analysis [^112LknmP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCL) may be incidentally detected in up to 13.5% of patients. These represent a wide variety of lesions including mucinous cysts [intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)] that have malignant potential. The difficulty in identifying the various PCL and their unpredictable potential for malignant degeneration makes their management cumbersome. The current diagnostic evaluation of PCL often includes EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for cyst fluid analysis. Cyst fluid can be analyzed for tumor markers, cytology, mucins, DNA analysis and amylase. Pancreatic cyst CEA level is considered the most accurate tumor marker for diagnosing mucinous cysts. Approximately 0.2 to 1.0 mL of cyst fluid is required to run the test and a cut-off of 192 ng/ mL can be expected to capture ~75% of mucinous cysts. The presence of a KRAS mutation is very specific for a mucinous cyst but lacks sensitivity. Cytology is especially helpful in diagnosing malignancy typically in the presence of a solid component in the cyst. Newer markers to improve diagnostic accuracy are on the horizon, but clinical studies are awaited.

### Ovarian mucinous neoplasms: an integrated clinicopathologic perspective [^116EquZc]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Primary ovarian mucinous neoplasms represent a highly heterogeneous group of tumors. Despite being relatively common among ovarian tumors, they pose diagnostic challenges even for experienced gynecologic pathologists based on morphologic assessment, which serves as the primary means of classification and is intrinsically subject to substantial interobserver variability. Patients with low-stage disease generally have excellent outcomes, but infiltrative growth is associated with increased risk and high-stage disease is typically both aggressive and resistant to traditional therapy.

Objective —

To review diagnostic criteria for classification of mucinous tumors, highlight recent updates on grading and ancillary testing, and discuss ongoing challenges of classification as they relate to clinical management.

Data Sources —

Published peer-reviewed literature and personal experience of the authors.

Conclusions —

Primary ovarian mucinous neoplasms are frequently encountered in routine gynecologic pathology practice; however, their classification remains problematic. Much of the difficulty surrounding their diagnosis stems from their incredible spatial heterogeneity, which is confounded by frequent discordance between gross and histologic findings. One is faced with an even greater challenge during intraoperative assessment, because it drastically alters surgical management in real time, with limited sampling. The recent adoption of growth pattern-based grading may ultimately serve as a means of simplifying the approach to these elusive tumors for patients who present with low-stage disease. For those presenting with high-stage disease, ancillary testing to guide individualized therapy remains largely rooted in pan-tumor strategies, and study of potential biomarker-based approaches is ongoing.

Mucinous carcinomas of the ovary — workup, surgery, prognosis, and postoperative therapy — are summarized with key features and management. Patients with mucinous carcinoma of the ovary are often diagnosed with early-stage disease and have a good prognosis; the 5-year OS is about 80% to 90%, and individuals with mucinous tumors typically present at a younger age (20–40 years) than those with high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Primary treatment for these patients includes completion surgery with comprehensive staging followed by postoperative therapy or observation, and an appendectomy is also recommended at primary surgery in patients with suspected or confirmed mucinous ovarian tumors. The additional workup includes a GI tract evaluation and CEA level for patients with mucinous histology to determine whether patients have either occult GI primary that has metastasized to the ovaries or primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovaries, metastases to the ovaries are more common and primary mucinous tumors are uncommon, and PAX8 immunostaining may be useful. Fertility-sparing surgery is an option for select patients with stage I mucinous tumors; postoperative observation and monitoring are recommended for patients with stage IA or IB mucinous tumors, and for patients with stage IC mucinous carcinomas, postoperative options include observation, IV carboplatin with either paclitaxel or docetaxel, 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (GI regimen), or capecitabine/oxaliplatin (GI regimen).

### The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of cystic pancreatic neoplasms [^116xUXfF]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Cyst fluid chemistries and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) markers — In pooled data from 12 studies including 450 patients, amylase levels < 250 U/L virtually excluded a pseudocyst with specificity 98%. A prospective, multicenter study of 112 pancreatic cysts identified an optimal CEA cutoff of 192 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 84%. When morphologic criteria, cytology, and CEA (cutoff 192 ng/mL) were combined, EUS differentiated mucinous from nonmucinous lesions with 91% sensitivity and 31% specificity. Subsequent studies suggest that lower CEA cut-off levels (< 30 ng/mL) increase sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. Conversely, a CEA ≤ 5 ng/mL was seen in only 7% of mucinous cystic neoplasms and all-serous cystic neoplasms. A meta-analysis of EUS-FNA aspirates reported CEA sensitivity 63% (95% CI, 57%-67%) and specificity 88% (95% CI, 83%-91%) for identifying mucinous cystic tumors.

### The role of pancreatoscopy in the diagnostic work-up of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112d3o7P]. Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Confirming the diagnosis, invasiveness, and disease extent of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas is challenging. The aim of this study was to summarize the literature on the efficacy and safety of peroral pancreatoscopy (POP) in the diagnosis of IPMN, including the impact of pre- and intraoperative POP on the management of IPMN.

Methods The EMBASE, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched for articles. Eligible articles investigated cohorts of patients who underwent POP for (suspected) IPMN.

Results 25 articles were identified and included in this review; with 22 of these reporting on the diagnostic yield of POP in IPMN and 11 reporting on the effect of pre- or intraoperative POP on clinical decision-making. Cannulation and observation rates, and overall diagnostic accuracy were high across all studies. Frequently reported visual characteristics of IPMN were intraductal fish-egg-like lesions, hypervascularity, and granular mucosa. Overall, the adverse event rate was 12%, primarily consisting of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis, with a pooled rate of 10%, mostly of mild severity. Regarding the impact of POP on clinical decision-making, POP findings altered the surgical approach in 13%–62% of patients.

Conclusion POP is technically successful in the vast majority of patients with (suspected) IPMN, has a consistently high diagnostic accuracy, but an adverse event rate of 12%. Data on intraoperative pancreatoscopy are scarce, but small studies suggest its use can alter surgical management. Future studies are needed to better define the role of POP in the diagnostic work-up of IPMN.

### Mucinous neoplasms of the appendix and peritoneum [^112xij7u]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms are considered enigmatic tumors of unpredictable biologic potential. Their importance lies in their potential to spread to the peritoneum and viscera in the form of gelatinous mucin deposits. Extra-appendiceal spread of these tumors is the most common etiology of pseudomyxoma peritonei, which is a descriptive term encompassing a number of neoplastic and nonneoplastic peritoneal disorders. Many studies aimed at evaluating the biologic importance of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritonei have employed inconsistent histologic criteria for their diagnosis and descriptive terminology for their classification. As a result, appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and associated peritoneal disease represents one of the most confusing and controversial areas in gastrointestinal pathology.

Objectives

To summarize the literature regarding the biologic potential of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritonei and to discuss the similarities and differences between proposed systems for their classification.

Data Sources

Literature review and case-derived material.

Conclusions

Many studies have contributed to an increased understanding of the natural progression of mucinous neoplasms of the appendix and peritoneum, and the adoption of a uniform reporting system, as advocated by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the World Health Organization, will facilitate clear communication among pathologists and clinical colleagues.

### Mucinous appendiceal neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritonei: imaging features and current therapies [^115MWkHN]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Pseudomyxoma peritonei involves the gradual accumulation of gelatinous peritoneal metastases, typically resulting from the rupture of a mucinous appendiceal neoplasm. Standard treatment often includes cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. However, recurrence is common despite optimal cytoreduction, prompting ongoing investigation into novel therapies. This comprehensive review aims to enhance radiologists' understanding of mucinous appendiceal neoplasms and pseudomyxoma peritonei by focusing on nomenclature, pathophysiology, optimal imaging strategies, and the typical imaging appearance of mucinous appendiceal neoplasm and associated peritoneal disease. It also highlights problematic areas of disease that may affect the ability to achieve complete cytoreduction or influence surgical decision making and includes a surgeon's perspective on treating this complex condition.

### Multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^114eKZvM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have gained recognition in recent years as premalignant precursors to pancreatic cancer that enable early detection and often are found incidentally at imaging. Accurate diagnosis and optimal, finely tuned management of these lesions are important and require collaboration across various disciplines, including radiology, endoscopy, surgery, and pathology. Several imaging modalities can visualize these lesions adequately, each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are generally the first-line imaging modalities; endoscopic imaging such as endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are beneficial when the former 2 modalities are equivocal. Surgical candidates generally include patients with main duct lesions or branch duct lesions greater than 3 cm or any possessing a solid component. A management algorithm indicating when surgery should be pursued is proposed. For nonsurgical and postsurgical patients, follow-up management is important to monitor growth and recurrence, and risks from repeated radiation exposure should be taken into account. Furthermore, issues of multifocality and increased predisposition of the pancreas to ductal adenocarcinoma must be addressed at follow-up evaluation. A follow-up management algorithm also is proposed in this review.

### Perforated mucinous cystadenoma of the vermiform appendix: an overview in reasoning clinical decisions [^113H1JdY]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in the management of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (AMN) such as peritonectomy combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy have introduced new standards of care. However, many dilemmas are encountered in decision making as in the following patient. A 74-year-old woman was admitted with an appendiceal cystadenoma found in a preadmission CT scan. However, the tumour was not documented by the in hospital investigation due to its perforation and its reduction in size. Consequently, a series of management dilemmas were encountered that were solved by cautious evaluation of the pre and peroperative findings. She was submitted to a right hemicolectomy. A spontaneous perforation was suspected, but the accurate diagnosis was documented postoperatively by histopathology. This paradigm motivated this review which concluded that reasoning clinical decisions in the light of recent advances and appropriate care based on the disease-stage are essential for an optimal outcome in the management of AMN.

### Pancreatic cysts-part 2: should we Be less cyst centric? [^111N556Y]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

The management of pancreatic cysts is a common problem faced by physicians and surgeons. Pancreatic cysts are important because some of them are mucin-producing cysts (MPCs), which may harbor or develop pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Thus, accurate classification of pancreatic cysts and diagnosis of MPCs offer a potential for the prevention or early detection of pancreatic cancer. However, the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic pancreatic cysts are complicated by 2 factors. First, incidentally detected pancreatic cysts are often misdiagnosed as branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Although most are MPCs, there are other types of cysts, such as serous cystadenomas, which are managed differently. Second, only a minority of MPCs will ultimately develop into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Thus, on the one hand, pancreatic cysts offer a unique opportunity to identify precursors to pancreatic cancer and improve outcomes. On the other hand, misdiagnosis and overzealous testing or unnecessary surgery may lead to high cost and harm to patients. Several guidelines have been developed by various groups for the management of pancreatic cysts. In this article, we review the strengths and weaknesses of the American Gastroenterology Association guidelines, highlight key recommendations requiring further validation, and provide our balanced approach to diagnosing and managing pancreatic cysts.

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^111tNKDT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study lend to its effective representation of real-life patient care at four separate institutions; thus results are clinically useful and generalizable. Referral bias was minimized since the cohort included patients from a large, integrated healthcare system and a tertiary academic referral center. Cysts types were classified by clinical and EUS information that can be easily attained by most clinicians during diagnostic workup of incidentally discovered pancreatic cystic lesion. The large group of non-operatively managed patients and long-term follow up also allowed for a detailed description of the natural history of presumptive BD-IPMN.

In summary, this study supports the use of the Fukuoka "high-risk stigmata" and "worrisome features" criteria in stratifying the malignant potential of cysts consistent with BD-IPMN. This study supports surveillance of benign appearing cysts that lack Fukuoka criteria, or high-risk features as identified by AGA 2015 guidelines because they pose little to no risk to the patient. Most patients who develop pancreatic cancer in BD-IPMN have at least one Fukuoka criterion and are most often diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within a year of the cyst being detected. However, patients not diagnosed with cancer within the first year, continue to be at risk for developing pancreatic cancer over time, even in those who initially did not have Fukuoka criteria at the time of initial EUS. Thus surveillance should be continued in patients with presumptive BD-IPMN.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Histologically proven branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMN) with Fukuoka "high risk stigmata" have a high risk for pancreatic cancer and should be considered for immediate surgery
Histologically proven BD-IPMN with "worrisome features" and those without Fukuoka criteria are at intermediate and low risk for pancreatic cancer and may be managed non-operatively, however the safety of this strategy is not completely known
Non-invasive methods of establishing cyst diagnosis and malignant potential are imprecise

What the new findings are:

Fukuoka criteria perform well in stratifying risk of malignancy of clinically suspected BD-IPMN based upon clinical, radiographic and endoscopic ultrasound information
Suspected BD-IPMN without Fukuoka have an extremely low risk of either harboring or transforming into pancreatic cancer over at least first 7 years following diagnosis (1.2% cumulative risk) compared to those with at least 1 criterion (28%)

### The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of cystic pancreatic neoplasms [^115zLfMw]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions — comparative features in Pseudocyst, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), and mucinous cystic neoplasm are outlined, including presentation, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) findings, cyst fluid profiles, cytology, and malignant potential. Pseudocyst typically has a history of pancreatitis and nonmucinous cytology, with fluid chemistries of elevated amylase and low carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). IPMN may present with pancreatitis or abdominal pain or be incidental, and EUS can show a dilated main pancreatic duct or side branches with possible septations or a solid component. Mucinous cystic neoplasm is usually incidental but can cause abdominal pain and a palpable mass if large, and mucinous cytology with positive mucin staining and elevated CEA with low amylase support its diagnosis. Malignant potential is listed as none for pseudocyst and yes for both IPMN and mucinous cystic neoplasm.

### Pathologic diagnosis, origin, and natural history of pseudomyxoma peritonei… [^116TPFFm]. ASCO (2013). Low credibility.

3; our current understanding is that the vast majority of cases are primary appendiceal mucinous neoplasms 1, 4, 5, 6. In instances in which the appendix is distended or ruptured at the time of surgery and pathologic analysis reveals carcinoma within both the appendix and the mucinous ascites, the diagnosis is straightforward. However, cases that primarily present as pelvic masses in female patients or that do not have a grossly identifiable dominant tumor mass can be diagnostically challenging. 10CT is more helpful, as loculated spaces with characteristic scalloping of hepatic and splenic margins are pathognomonic of PMP and have densities that are higher than nonmucinous ascites. 10, 21CT also aids in preoperative planning by demonstrating the extent of disease. Surgically, PMP is generally encountered as grossly evident mucin in the peritoneal cavity. In many cases, it is a unexpected finding at the time of laparotomy.

7In other cases, mucinous aggregates are discovered incidentally in surgical specimens, such as hernia sacs, thus necessitating a search for the primary neoplasm. 12In many institutions, it has become standard to perform an appendectomy routinely in the staging of ovarian neoplasms. In a recent retrospective review 24of 155 appendectomies performed during staging for presumed ovarian mucinous neoplasms at a single institution, three appendiceal neoplasms were identified, which were all grossly abnormal. Pathologically, mucinous ascites and pools of mucin with variable amounts of neoplastic mucinous epithelium within the peritoneal cavity characterize PMP. Although these findings are consistent with PMP, it is a clinicopathologic syndrome, and the job of the pathologist does not end with identification of mucin or mucin-producing epithelium. The biologic potential of the lesion depends on several factors that can be further characterized on pathology.

The first goal is to identify the organ of origin. The vast majority of cases of PMP have a primary neoplasm in the appendix. The appendiceal lumen may be distended by copious amounts of mucin. The tumor cells in the appendix are generally of low nuclear grade and may be elongated and hyperchromatic. Sampling is important, and the appendix must be submitted entirely for microscopic evaluation.

### Treatment and management of peritoneal spread from appendiceal neoplasms [^116KNrAK]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Appendiceal neoplasms are rare entities prone to direct peritoneal spread. As these neoplasms occur in few patients, research regarding their management is largely retrospective, limiting its utility. Classification of these neoplasms continues to evolve and is largely based on histopathology. Thorough workup of patients with appendiceal mucinous neoplasms is essential for appropriate management and decision making. The cornerstone of treatment of low-grade and high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms with peritoneal spread is cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC), with limited use of systemic chemotherapy. For those patients who experience recurrence, it may be managed using CRS/HIPEC and possibly systemic chemotherapy.

### Frozen section diagnosis of ovarian epithelial tumors: diagnostic pearls and pitfalls [^114wLXSh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Epithelial tumors of the ovary are one of the most frequently encountered gynecologic specimens in the frozen section laboratory. The preoperative diagnostic workup of an ovarian mass is typically limited to imaging studies and serum markers, both of which suffer from low sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, intraoperative frozen section evaluation is crucial for determining the required extent of surgery, that is, cystectomy for benign tumors, oophorectomy or limited surgical staging for borderline tumors in younger patients to preserve fertility, or extensive staging procedure for ovarian carcinomas. Ovarian epithelial tumors may exhibit a wide range of morphologic patterns, which often overlap with each other and can mimic a variety of other ovarian nonepithelial neoplasms as well. A combination of careful gross examination, appropriate sampling and interpretation of morphologic findings, and familiarity with the clinical context is the key to the accurate frozen section diagnosis and successful intraoperative consultation.

Objective —

To review the salient frozen section diagnostic features of ovarian epithelial tumors, with special emphasis on useful clinicopathologic and morphologic clues and potential diagnostic pitfalls.

Data Sources —

Review of the literature and personal experience of the author.

Conclusions —

Frozen section evaluation of ovarian tumors continues to pose a significant diagnostic challenge for practicing pathologists. This review article presents detailed discussions of the most common clinical scenarios and diagnostic problems encountered during intraoperative frozen section evaluation of mucinous, serous, endometrioid, and clear cell ovarian tumors.

### Presentation and management of pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^115KDCpm]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms are less frequent than other pancreatic tumors, but because of the wide availability and improvement of modern imaging methods, these neoplasms are being recognized with increasing frequency and it is often possible to be differentiated preoperatively not only from other cystic pancreatic disorders but also from one another. Most patients have no symptoms while clinical signs are not really useful in the clinical work up, and when they are present, they never help us to identify the type of pathology. Treatment differs with the diagnosis. Serous cystic neoplasms are uniformly benign and usually do not mandate resection unless this lesion is symptomatic. In contrast, mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have a premalignant or malignant tendency, and therefore should be managed aggressively by pancreatic resection; in the absence of invasive disease, prognosis is excellent after appropriate surgery, but the presence of invasive malignancy signifies a poor prognosis. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms have nonaggressive behavior and their management is related to the extension of the disease. The purpose of this article is to review the types of pancreatic cystic neoplasms, their diagnosis, indications for surgical treatment, and outcome.

### Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms: controversial issues [^111RaDWP]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms can spread to the peritoneum as pseudomyxoma peritonei even though they are not obviously invasive in the appendix. During the past several decades, several problematic issues surrounding this enigmatic tumor have been debated in the literature, including appropriate nomenclature for the appendiceal tumors and their peritoneal metastases. In this article, the most contentious issues in the area of appendiceal mucinous tumors are examined. First, the classification systems that have been proposed for these tumors are compared in the context of whether the appendiceal mucinous tumors are ruptured adenomas or invasive carcinomas. The controversy about the nature of pseudomyxoma peritonei and its classification systems is discussed in the following section. A brief discussion follows that examines the issue of localized pseudomyxoma peritonei and its clinical significance. Next reviewed is the largely resolved controversy about whether ovarian mucinous tumors in this setting are separate primaries or are metastases from the appendiceal tumor. Finally, the controversy about the most effective treatment of patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei is discussed.

Imaging for suspected ovarian cancer — the primary workup for patients with clinical signs or symptoms should include an abdominal/pelvic ultrasound (US) and/or abdominal/pelvic computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI); US is typically used for initial evaluation and is effective at triaging most adnexal masses; when US is indeterminate, other modalities may help with assessing metastases, staging, and preoperative planning; abdominal/pelvic MRI may be useful if US is unreliable or indeterminate; fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) may also be useful for indeterminate lesions; the NCCN Panel recommends PET/CT or MRI for indeterminate lesions if they will alter management; and imaging algorithms have been proposed to distinguish benign from malignant masses and guide referral for surgery.

### Updates in appendix pathology: the precarious cutting edge [^116ACCj2]. Surgical Pathology Clinics (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on appendiceal neoplasm:

- **Definition**: Appendiceal neoplasms are abnormal growths that occur in the appendix. They encompass a range of tumors, including low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm, high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm, and mucinous adenocarcinoma.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of appendiceal neoplasms is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve genetic mutations that lead to the uncontrolled growth and division of cells in the appendix.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of appendiceal neoplasms in the US is estimated at 0.93 per 100,000 person-years from 2000 to 2017.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for appendiceal neoplasms include advanced age, cystic fibrosis, and familial adenomatous polyposis, although the risk factors are not comprehensively defined.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, appendiceal neoplasms often present with non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and weight loss. In some cases, they may be discovered incidentally during imaging or surgery for other conditions.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of appendiceal neoplasms can vary widely and is influenced by factors such as the stage of the disease at diagnosis and the specific type of neoplasm.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113G8mMQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Colon cancer — Principles of appendiceal adenocarcinoma, localized disease — Screening colonoscopy is recommended in all patients diagnosed with appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AA) prior to definitive resection to rule out synchronous large polyps or cancers, and right hemicolectomy with adequate lymphadenectomy is recommended; appendectomy may be sufficient for patients with T1, low-grade disease and absence of lymphovascular invasion. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy is largely extrapolated from colon cancer and should be considered for high-risk stage II and stage III cancers. During surveillance, a second-look diagnostic laparoscopy to evaluate for residual/recurrent disease is not routinely recommended, but may be considered for symptomatic patients in the absence of clear imaging findings, especially in the setting of rising tumor markers, and surveillance imaging should occur at least annually, with the option for more frequent imaging for patients with acellular mucinous spread at the time of surgery.

Conclusion

An inverted appendix should not be ignored because it may represent other pathologic changes. Cross-sectional imaging with either CT or MRI should be obtained. EUS can be helpful in evaluating this entity. In our case, analysis of biopsy specimens from the appendiceal lumen were decisive in identifying the histologic structure of an inverted appendix.

Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms are unique tumors of the appendix, characterized by low-grade mucinous epithelium with villiform, undulating, or flat architecture. These tumors lack infiltrative growth or destructive invasion, but can extend into the appendiceal wall by a "pushing" pattern of invasion, with a broad front that can mimic a diverticulum. These neoplasms have a propensity for peritoneal dissemination, resulting in the clinical presentation of pseudomyxoma peritonei. The pathologic staging of these neoplasms is challenging and fraught with confusing terminology and numerous classification systems. This review focuses on the AJCC pathologic staging of these tumors with a focus on challenging situations.

### Mucinous neoplasms of the ovary: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^116C5oNM]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Mucinous neoplasms of the ovary account for 10%-15% of ovarian neoplasms. They may be benign, borderline, or malignant. The large majority are benign or borderline, accounting for 80% and 16%-17%, respectively. Mucinous neoplasms of the ovary most commonly affect women in their 20s to 40s. The clinical manifestation is nonspecific, but most mucinous ovarian neoplasms manifest as large unilateral pelvic masses. At gross pathologic analysis, mucinous ovarian neoplasms appear as large multiloculated cystic masses. The contents of the cyst loculi vary on the basis of differences in internal mucin content. At histologic analysis, mucinous ovarian neoplasms are composed of multiple cysts lined by mucinous epithelium, often resembling gastrointestinal-type epithelium. Imaging evaluation most commonly includes US and/or MRI. The imaging findings parallel the gross pathologic features and include a large, unilateral, multiloculated cystic mass. The cyst loculi vary in echogenicity, attenuation, and signal intensity depending on the mucin content. Mucinous neoplasms of the ovary are staged surgically using the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) staging system. Primary treatment is surgical, with adjuvant chemotherapy considered in the uncommon case of mucinous carcinoma with extraovarian disease. Since most mucinous ovarian neoplasms are benign or borderline, the overall prognosis is excellent.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^116sfzRf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cyst imaging — modality performance and use are as follows: A systematic review concluded that CT is a good initial investigation with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) used when added information is needed, and in 1,060 patients with definitive histology the accuracy of CT for distinguishing benign from malignant cysts was 71–80%. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) imaging alone was accurate for diagnosing a benign from a malignant cyst 65–96% of the time. In a prospective comparison, PET/CT had a diagnostic accuracy of 94% compared with 77% for MDCT and 87% for MR, yet there is insufficient evidence to support the use of PET-CT currently. Secretin-stimulated MRCP improved duct–cyst communication visualization, but the communication was visualized solely on the secretin-stimulated study in only 5% of patients, and ERCP is no longer recommended for either cyst diagnosis or surveillance except for a limited role in the evaluation of main duct IPMN. Contrast-enhanced EUS may help distinguish a mural nodule from mucin but it is currently not FDA-approved.

### Role of cytology in the diagnosis of cystic and intradcutal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^115kPeAN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Cytology may provide valuable information and is diagnostic in many cases, but it is limited by sampling difficulties. Performance of mucin stains and analysis of the cyst fluid for tumor markers, as described in the article on histology of cystic neoplasms elsewhere in this issue, increase detection of MCNs and IPMNs; however, as with any other laboratory test, the results of the cyst fluid cytologic analysis need to be assessed in light of the clinical and radiologic findings, particularly when the cytology is not completely diagnostic.

### Diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia [^112fHYJz]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) encompasses a spectrum of neoplastic change in the epithelial lining of the pancreatic duct. As such, it is difficult to predict the presence of malignancy, and pancreatic resection is established as the only effective treatment for IPMN. There is controversy about the natural history, evaluation, surgical management and surveillance of IPMN; as IPMN is being increasingly recognized, this controversy is being brought to the forefront of clinical practice. This review presents pooled surgical data, future directions and a proposed algorithm for the management of patients with IPMN.

Less common ovarian cancers (LCOC) — workup for a pelvic mass mirrors that for other ovarian cancers but includes targeted tumor markers and assessments. Tumor markers may include CA-125, inhibin, beta-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Individuals younger than 35 years with a pelvic mass should have AFP levels measured to assess for germ cell tumors and to rule out pregnancy. A GI tract evaluation is recommended for mucinous histology to determine whether an occult GI primary has metastasized to the ovaries. An intraoperative frozen section evaluation is recommended for those who would like to maintain their fertility.

### Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and the management of pancreatic cancer [^112pWEqi]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Elastography is a newer non-invasive technique to evaluate stiffness (elasticity) of soft tissue. EUS transducer sends a shearing wave through the pancreas and generates an elastogram by calculating velocity faced by shearing wave while passing through soft tissue. EUS elastography works as an adjunct to EUS-FNA which may help in the differentiation of malignant from non-malignant masses. The diagnostic yield of EUS elastography in the differentiation of solid pancreatic cancers is variable, with three meta-analyses showing a 95%–97% pooled sensitivity and 67%–76% specificity.

An algorithm for the evaluation and management of patients with suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma based on current guidelines is shown in figure 1.EUS-FNA should be performed whenever possible for resectable pancreatic cancers to rule out alternative diagnosis. It could be difficult to differentiate from pancreatic neoplasm and to confirm tissue diagnosis if needed in patients who are unresectable. In addition, having a tissue diagnosis of PDAC for resectable disease allows for possible neoadjuvant therapy options.

EUS evaluation of pancreatic cystic lesions

With the advancement of cross-sectional imaging, the detection rate of incidental pancreatic cyst has increased. The most common incidental pancreatic cystic lesions include mucinous cysts (eg, MCN and IPMNs) pseudocysts and serous cystadenomas. Mucinous cystic lesions (which are considered premalignant and occasionally malignant) need to be differentiated from non-mucinous lesions, as they often carry different prognoses and management. EUS and cross-sectional imaging both MRI/CT scans are generally considered to be complimentary for the evaluation of pancreatic cysts. Although MRI is considered superior in the evaluation of pancreatic cystic lesions, a distinct advantage of EUS (especially with improved image resolution) is the ability to sample pancreatic cyst fluid for both cytology and tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and DNA mutational analysis. Under current guidelines, EUS is increasingly reserved for pancreatic cysts with high-risk stigmata or worrisome features where it may impact on diagnostic workup as well as stratifying patients for either surveillance or surgical resection.

Ovarian cancer tumor markers and mucinous histology — elevations and diagnostic cutoffs are outlined as follows: "Elevated serum CEA is a marker associated with gastrointestinal (GI) primary cancers, but can also occur in patients with ovarian malignancies, particularly mucinous tumors". Because of this association, "some advocate for further GI imaging in patients with high serum CEA". A "ratio of serum CA-125 to CEA > 25 has been proposed for differentiating ovarian cancer from colorectal cancer", and "CA-125:CEA ratio has been incorporated into entry criteria in trials testing neoadjuvant therapies". For mucinous ovarian cancer, "it has been proposed that CEA may be useful for monitoring for recurrent disease". "CA19–9 is another marker that is elevated more often in mucinous tumors compared with other ovarian cancer types", and "serum CA19–9 may be useful for monitoring for recurrence, especially in patients with mucinous ovarian cancers, and in those with high CA19–9 levels prior to treatment".

### Diagnostic concordance in cases of appendiceal mucinous neoplasia referred to a tertiary referral centre [^114vzCum]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of appendiceal tumours and any associated peritoneal disease is clinically important but can be difficult. We retrieved the records of patients referred to the Peritoneal Malignancy Institute, Basingstoke, in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 with a diagnosis of mucinous appendiceal neoplasia and identified 323 patients in which slides were reviewed as part of the referral pathway. Comparing the local report from the referring centre with the central review report, in 57 (18%) we identified a discrepancy. In 39 (12%) the discrepancy was in overall diagnosis, including 22 (7%) in which the local diagnosis was low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm whereas the review diagnosis was reactive mucosal changes, usually due to ruptured diverticulum, with no evidence of neoplasia. Our findings support the practice of central review of histopathology slides by experienced pathologists at tertiary referral centres. They also suggest that improvements in diagnostic criteria are needed.

### Mucinous tumors of the ovary: current thoughts on diagnosis and management [^117RmKvt]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Mucinous tumors of the ovary represent a spectrum of neoplastic disorders, including benign mucinous cystadenoma, pseudomyxoma peritonei, mucinous tumors of low malignant potential (borderline), and invasive mucinous ovarian carcinoma. These tumors are related closely to each other and are distinct from other histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian neoplasms from a clinical, histologic, and molecular standpoint. A continuum appears to be present from benign to borderline to malignant, which is different from other types of epithelial ovarian cancer. Mutational profiles are also distinct, as KRAS mutations are common, but p53 and BRCA mutations are infrequent. These characteristics lead to specific biologic behavior and guide both clinical management and research efforts in patients with mucinous ovarian tumors.

### Painless eyelid nodule [^116rmuuX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Additional workup or management should include which of the following?
A. Immunohistochemical staining
B. Colonoscopy
C. No further management is indicated
D. Warm compress
E. Enucleation

Answers:
A. Immunohistochemical staining – Correct. When evaluating mucinous carcinoma, the major diagnostic concern is determining metastatic or primary cutaneous origin. Given this patient's history of breast cancer, review of previous breast pathology and workup with immunohistochemical staining is warranted. Primary cutaneous mucinous carcinoma is positive for CK7 and negative for CK20, thyroid transcriotion factor-1, and D2–40, which could help to exclude metastases from colon or other gastrointestinal sites and the lung. However, breast carcinoma displays a similar immunophenotype, and both primary cutaneous and metastatic breast mucinous carcinomas may also express estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, GATA3, and p63, warranting the need for additional diagnostic imaging to exclude metastasis.
B. Colonoscopy – Incorrect. Colonoscopy would be included in the diagnostic workup of sebaceous carcinoma when there is concern for associated Muir–Torre syndrome.
C. No further management is indicated – Incorrect. This would not be an appropriate choice for mucinous carcinoma, as further workup and definitive management with surgical excision or radiation therapy is warranted.
D. Warm compress – Incorrect. Warm compress is utilized for the conservative management of chalazion.
E. Enucleation – Incorrect. Enucleation is used to treat uveal melanoma.

### The evolving role of pathology in new developments, classification, terminology, and diagnosis of pancreatobiliary neoplasms [^111rcALm]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pancreatobiliary tract lesions are increasingly being discovered because of more sensitive imaging modalities. Magnetic resonance imaging has identified incidental pancreatic cysts in 13.5% of patients of progressively increasing age. Pancreatobiliary tissue is more accessible through endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy procedures, and is now an integral part of pathologists' routine practice. Accordingly, several new tumor categories have been recently recognized, including intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm, a new addition to tumoral intraepithelial neoplasms. Other entities have been reclassified, including the recent transition to 2-tiered grading of preinvasive neoplasms, as well as new perspectives on the distinctive biologic behavior of oncocytic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) compared with other IPMN subtypes. This has led to proposals for revised staging of virtually every segment of the pancreatobiliary tree, with theranostic markers becoming an integral part of workup. Ki-67 is now an integral part of the classification of neuroendocrine tumors, with new definitions of "high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma". Although bile duct brushings have opened new avenues for diagnosis, their sensitivity remains low and often requires concomitant fluorescent in situ hybridization to better define ambiguous cases. Various molecular pathways have been elucidated for pancreatic cysts, including KRAS for ductal neoplasia, GNAS for intestinal IPMNs, RNF3 for mucinous cysts, and VHL for serous cystic neoplasms, all key players in diagnostic workup. Integration of these updates into our understanding of pancreatobiliary disease requires active engagement of pathologists for appropriate specimen triage, judicious interpretation of results, and incorporation into reporting and staging. They also provide exciting opportunities for targeted therapy.

### Primary neoplasms of the appendix: radiologic spectrum of disease with pathologic correlation [^113xFfi3]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Although uncommon, primary appendiceal neoplasms often result in clinical symptoms that may lead to abdominal imaging. Acute appendicitis from luminal obstruction is the most common manifestation for most tumor types. Other manifestations include intussusception, a palpable mass, gastrointestinal bleeding, increasing abdominal girth (from pseudomyxoma peritonei), and secondary genitourinary complications. Asymptomatic appendiceal neoplasms may be discovered incidentally. Mucoceles from either benign or malignant mucinous neoplasms represent the majority of appendiceal tumors detected at imaging but are the least likely to manifest as appendicitis. Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a common manifestation of mucinous adenocarcinoma. Colonic-type (nonmucinous) adenocarcinoma of the appendix is much less common than mucinous tumors and typically manifests as a focal mass without mucocele formation. Carcinoid tumor is the most common appendiceal neoplasm but is less often detected radiologically because it is typically small and relatively asymptomatic. Goblet cell carcinoid tumor and non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the appendix are rare and usually infiltrate the entire appendix. Cross-sectional imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), is effective in the evaluation of these neoplasms. CT appears to be the modality of choice whenever an appendiceal mass is suspected. CT will help rule out or confirm an appendiceal tumor and may suggest a more specific diagnosis.

### Diagnostic approach to pancreatic cysts [^115f9qZc]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diagnosis of pancreatic cysts remains challenging due to limitations of currently available radiologic and endoscopic tools. The diagnostic approach should focus on identifying mucinous and malignant cysts. Mucinous cysts require further differentiation to allow appropriate management.

Recent Findings

Although the overall rate of malignant pancreatic cysts is low, it remains higher than the general population. MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is the preferred imaging modality for pancreatic cysts. Attempts to improve diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration include performing cyst wall cytology and DNA analysis. The 2012 international consensus guidelines for mucinous cystic neoplasm and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm are superior to the original 2006 guidelines, although issues include the relatively poor ability to diagnose malignant cysts leading to unnecessary surgeries and the de-emphasis of cyst size. Cyst size remains an important predictor of malignancy. Translational research involving genomics, microRNA, proteomics, and metabolomics holds promise for improved biomarkers. Endoscopic innovations may safely aid in cyst diagnosis.

Summary

Incremental improvements in pancreatic cyst diagnosis have occurred with new biomarkers and endoscopic tools requiring validation in large-scale studies.

### Ovarian mucinous and seromucinous neoplasms: problematic aspects and modern diagnostic approach [^1171LYYs]. Histopathology (2022). Medium credibility.

The morphological spectrum of primary ovarian mucinous and seromucinous tumours is broad, and presents an array of diagnostic challenges, many unique to these tumour types. This reflects the heterogeneous nature of these lesions, their varied histogenesis and evolving classification systems over recent decades, with further modification to the seromucinous category incorporated in the recently published 5th edition of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Classification of female genital tumours. In this review we provide an update on the classification of these neoplasms and discuss their histogenesis and diverse morphology, focusing on areas which are diagnostically problematic. We also cover tumour grading, differential diagnosis, immunohistochemistry, the recent elucidation of the molecular underpinnings of ovarian mucinous neoplasia and discuss the gross and intra-operative handling of these tumours. A number of diagnostic issues remain unresolved, highlighting the importance of further research on this front, as well as a multidisciplinary approach in the care of patients with ovarian mucinous and seromucinous neoplasia.

### Outcomes and risk of pancreatic cancer with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms… [^114HK9oh]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Incidental detection of pancreatic cystic lesions has increased in recent years primarily due to improved resolution and widespread use of cross-sectional imaging. 1, 2 Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are the most frequently identified PCLs. 3–5 Current international consensus guidelines4 for management of IPMNs recommend image-based surveillance with the aim to detect clinical and imaging features of advanced neoplasia. The cross-sectional imaging at the time of PC diagnosis was reviewed by the study radiologist. Each patient was classified using established a priori imaging criteria as definitive IPMN-PC, probable IPMN-PC, possible IPMN-PC, or non-IPMN PC. For patients in the PC cohort, surgical pathology was reviewed by a gastrointestinal pathologist to confirm histology and determine if the PC arose from an IPMN.

The most frequent high-risk and worrisome features detected were obstructive jaundice and a main pancreatic duct diameter of 5 to 9 mm, respectively. Among patients with IPMNs, 107 individuals received follow-up with at least 1 abdominal cross-sectional imaging more than 6 months after the initial contrast CT scan, with a median interval of 5. 3 years between index CT scan and latest abdominal imaging. However, CT is generally able to detect IPMNs that are clinically relevant, and using MRI as the imaging modality could potentially limit the sample size. A similar population-based study using MRIs may be considered in the future and will be particularly relevant if assessing the incidence of IPMNs. A small subset of the IPMN population in this study underwent long-term imaging follow-up. Additionally, to detect IPMN-PCs, we combined imaging and pathologic criteria.

Imaging criteria of IPMN-PCs have not been definitively established and may impact the accuracy of our prevalence estimates. However, these imaging criteria for IPMN-PCs were defined a priori in consultation with an expert pancreatic radiologist to avoid the inherent bias of limiting the study to surgically confirmed PC. To further address this limitation, we have included estimates in the subgroup of patients with surgically confirmed PCs.

Figure 6

The sensitivity of cytology varies depending on the expertise of the endoscopist and the cytologist. Sometimes, cytology specimens are false negative because of sampling error. Cytology should be completed with measurements of CEA, amylase levels and mucin stain to increase the diagnostic accuracy to up to 80–90%. CEA measurement in the fluid is particularly helpful to separate serous from mucinous lesions, but there may be some degree of overlap. A CEA level < 5 ng/mL is suggestive of serous cystadenoma, while values > 400 ng/mL provide almost 100% specificity in diagnosing mucinous cystic neoplasms from pseudocysts. Despite this, infected pseudocysts may sometimes have elevated fluid CEA levels. High cystic fluid amylase levels are observed in cysts that communicate with the pancreatic ducts such as pseudocysts and IPMNs. All these pieces of information combined can usually lead to the correct diagnosis.

Cystic fluid from EUS-FNA is prioritized for CEA, amylase, mucin stain, and cytologic analysis. FNA is important even for classically benign appearing lesions to rule out malignant potential. FNA is not advised for probable malignant lesions for which surgery is already scheduled. However, the finding of a malignant or mucinous cytology, and an elevated fluid CEA may sometimes encourage decision for resection.

Concluding remarks

Pancreatic cystic lesions are infrequent but can pose a diagnostic challenge. They can represent simple cysts, pseudocysts due to previous acute or chronic pancreatitis or cystic pancreatic tumors. MRI is an important diagnostic tool for the evaluation of pancreatic cystic lesions and it should be followed by EUS with EUS-FNA where worrisome features are recognized. In doubtful cases it is better to proceed with EUS. Cystic pancreatic neoplasms are increasingly recognized and information provided by EUS with cytology and fluid examination can offer important assistance in the evaluation and management. However, the results of EUS should be combined with the clinical history, laboratory findings and other imaging studies (such as CT and MRI/MRCP) to promote the early detection of the cystic lesion, define the type of the tumor and distinguish it from pseudocysts, in order to recommend the most appropriate treatment.

### Overview of the clinical problem: facts and current issues of mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas [^111WsigK]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions are uncommon and consist of pseudocysts, congenital cysts and cystic neoplasms including mucinous cystic neoplasms, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and serous cystic neoplasms. Mucinous cystic neoplasms are large septated cysts without connection to the ductal system, characterised by the presence of thick-walled ovarian-type stroma and mucin. They occur predominantly in women and often are malignant. Therefore, surgical resection is recommended. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are neoplasms with tall, columnar, mucin-containing epithelium involving the main pancreatic ducts or major side branches. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms occur in men and women in their 60s and 70s and may differentiate into malignant neoplasms. Therefore, surgical resection is mandatory. Serous cystic neoplasms appear as multiple cysts lined with cubic flat epithelium containing glycogen-rich cells with clear cytoplasm. They mainly occur in women in their 50s and are generally benign. Therefore, a conservative approach is recommended. As both mucinous cystic neoplasm and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have a high malignant potential, it is important to differentiate between the various pancreatic cystic lesions. Several imaging techniques and tumour markers have been evaluated. Nonetheless, definitive guidelines to differentiate between serous cystic neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are still poorly defined. A number of management issues regarding these neoplasms are still under debate, for example which imaging technique to use, differentiation between malignant or benign lesions and the preferred treatment modality for each pancreatic cystic neoplasm. Further research may lead to a definitive guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of mucinous cystic neoplasms, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and serous cystic neoplasms.

### Validation of combined carcinoembryonic antigen and glucose testing in pancreatic cyst fluid to differentiate mucinous from non-mucinous cysts [^117S59F2]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) are increasingly detected incidentally on radiological imaging, with a reported weighted incidence of up to 49% in the general population, increasing with age. PCN compromise a heterogeneous group of lesions, ranging from benign to (pre)malignant entities. Mucinous PCN are considered (pre)malignant and thus require follow-up or surgical resection according to current international guidelines. On the other hand, non-mucinous PCN do not require surveillance or intervention. Thus, in order to prevent unnecessary surgery with associated mortality, morbidity, and costs, it is essential to accurately distinguish mucinous from non-mucinous PCN. However, differentiating different types of PCN remains challenging in daily clinical patient care. Even if best practice according to the clinical guidelines is applied, only 72% of PCN are diagnosed correctly and adequate differentiation between mucinous and non-mucinous PCN is made in 86%. Thus, improving accurate distinction between mucinous and non-mucinous PCN is essential in order to: (1) prevent lifelong futile follow-up of non-mucinous cysts, (2) allow for timely intervention in (pre)malignant PCN, and (3) avoid futile major abdominal surgery in wrongly diagnosed mucinous PCN.

Biochemical testing of pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF) obtained by endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is often used during diagnostic workup as it improves diagnostic accuracy in differentiating mucinous from non-mucinous PCN. From a clinical perspective, easily accessible biochemical markers to accurately analyze PCF are a crucial necessity in daily patient care. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is frequently used for this purpose and has the ability to distinguish mucinous from non-mucinous PCN with a sensitivity of 52–73% and a specificity of 77–89% using a cut-off value of 192 ng/mL. Nevertheless, the optimal cut-off value of CEA is still under debate, as underlined by data from a recently performed individual patient meta-analysis in 365 patients showing that a lower cut-off value of 20 ng/mL achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy [sensitivity 91% (95%CI 88–94%); specificity 85% (95%CI 72–93%)].

### Revisiting the necessity for routine appendectomies in mucinous neoplasms of the ovary: an evaluation of 460 mucinous ovarian tumors [^115ri8Ra]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Appendectomies are not uncommonly performed following an intraoperative diagnosis of a mucinous ovarian neoplasm, although the evidentiary basis for the practice is relatively limited. The current study is a contemporary re-examination of the issue, based on an analysis of a large single institutional cohort. We assessed whether there are any composite of factors that may be associated with the finding of significant disease in the appendix in this setting following intraoperative consultation (IOC) diagnosis of a mucinous neoplasm on an ovary-based mass. Records for 460 consecutive patients whose ovarian tumors were classified as "mucinous" on IOC (n = 246) and/or permanents (n = 214) were reviewed. The distribution of IOC diagnoses on the 246 tumors were as follows: cystadenoma (114), borderline (55), carcinoma (21), mucinous neoplasm or tumor without definitive classification (53), and probable metastases (3). Appendectomies were performed on 82 (33%) of the 246 cases. In 30 (36%) of these 82 cases, the appendix was grossly normal, the ovarian tumor was unilateral, and there was no intraabdominal/peritoneal disease. Microscopic examination of the appendices in these 30 cases showed no mucinous neoplasms therein, but one case had a grossly inapparent, 4 mm well-differentiated carcinoid. In contrast, among the remaining 52 cases (i.e. those with at least one of the "key abnormal features": intra-abddominal/peritoneal disease and/or appendiceal gross abnormality and/or ovarian tumor bilaterality), 12 neoplasms (23%) were microscopically identified in the appendix (4 adenocarcinomas; 7 LAMN; 1 carcinoid) [p = 0.0256]. Of these 12, a grossly abnormal appendix, intraabdominal/peritoneal disease, and ovarian tumor bilaterality was the sole key abnormal feature in 10, 8 and 4 cases respectively, meaning that requiring that any one feature be present to justify the appendectomy would have missed 17%, 33% and 67% of cases respectively. Only 33% (3/12) cases had all 3 features. Our findings support the emerging body of work that indicates that appendectomies should not be routinely performed during the primary surgery for suspected or confirmed mucinous tumors that involve the ovary, unless there is a specific indication. In our cohort, all identified mucinous appendiceal neoplasms were associated with at least one key abnormal feature (gross abnormalities of the appendix, intraabdominal/peritoneal disease, ovarian tumor bilaterality), which suggests that only in patients that meet these criteria would appendectomies most likely be beneficial.

### Porcelain appendix: a rare mimicker of the acute abdomen [^11221vHp]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

An appendiceal mucocele is a rare clinical entity often mimicking that of acute appendicitis in a majority of cases leading to incidental intraoperative findings. Nevertheless, appropriate diagnosis is vital prior to surgery to prevent complications such as pseudomyxoma peritonei. This report details a case of a man in his 70s, who was admitted to the emergency department with right iliac fossa pain with imaging showing wall thickening of the caecum and the ascending colon. During surgery, a calcified appendix raised the suspicion of a neoplastic process leading to a right hemicolectomy. The histology revealed a low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.

### Preoperative computed tomography is poor in detecting tumors of the appendix among patients with acute appendicitis: a cohort study of 5, 224 appendectomies [^117AemvL]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Neoplastic processes are among the known etiologies for acute appendicitis. While conservative treatment with antibiotics alone has been proposed as a treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis, the presence of tumors should be excluded when offering patients this option. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) in detecting appendiceal tumors.

Method

Consecutive patients operated on for acute appendicitis between January 2007 and October 3, 2018, in our university hospital were included. Whenever appendiceal tumor was histopathologically confirmed, CT interpretations and surgical reports were carefully reviewed. All CT scans were reanalyzed by consultant body radiologists. Discrepancies between the preliminary and final radiological interpretations were noted.

Results

A total of 5,224 patients underwent appendectomy, of whom 4,766 had histopathologically confirmed acute appendicitis. Eighty-four patients (median, 61 (13–89) years; 54% female) were diagnosed with appendiceal tumor. Fifty-two patients (62%) had uncomplicated appendicitis. Although incidence of tumors was associated with older age, tumors were found in all ages. The share of tumors increased from 1.7% to 3.0%/year during the study. The most common tumors were neuroendocrine tumors (n = 33), low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (n = 14), and adenocarcinomas (n = 11). Sixty-one patients (73%) underwent preoperative CT. Computed tomography interpretation during on-call hours suspected tumor in only one case (3.4%) with invasive tumor, and in five cases (16%) with noninvasive tumor.

Conclusion

Appendiceal tumors are possible findings in appendix specimens, and most patients had uncomplicated acute appendicitis. In light of findings we conclude that CT cannot be used to exclude neoplastic etiology underlying acute appendicitis.

Level Of Evidence

Diagnostic, level IV.

Appendiceal neoplasm — clinical presentation and initial evaluation emphasize heightened suspicion when a patient is > 50 years of age with a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and/or unexplained anemia; if appendicitis is treated nonoperatively, repeat interval imaging is crucial and lack of resolution may suggest malignancy. Initial diagnostic tests include CT/MRI, endoscopy, tumor biopsy, and in some cases surgery; an appendix > 15 mm on CT or MRI with an irregular or thickened wall is suggestive of appendiceal carcinoma. Colonoscopy is recommended if mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix is diagnosed due to increased risk of colonic polyps and neoplasia. Tumor biomarkers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA 19–9) can be used as prognostic indicators for patients receiving cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC); elevated preoperative CA 19–9 was associated with unfavorable progression-free survival (PFS) and elevated CEA with unfavorable overall survival (OS). CA-125 was inconclusive in one study, though other studies suggest normal serum levels of CA-125 and CA 19–9 correspond to increased survival and decreased recurrence; tumor differentiation and classification were the strongest predictors of both PFS and OS.

### CT features with histopathological correlation in inflammatory versus benign&malignant neoplastic appendiceal mucoceles: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^114g4bvu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study of 1,200 acute appendicitis cases, 9.3% (92 patients) had appendiceal neoplasms, with 51.1% being mucinous. Management of appendiceal mucocele varies: appendectomy or right hemicolectomy is used for unruptured cases, while ruptured cases with pseudomyxoma peritonei may require cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Advances in CRS and HIPEC have improved 10-year survival rates to nearly 50%. Another study found that neoplasms over 2 cm often necessitate right colon resection due to lymphatic spread risks. While open surgery is preferred to avoid rupture risks, laparoscopy is suitable for selected cases. Most authors recommend simple appendectomy for benign mucoceles and right hemicolectomy for suspected malignancies, stressing thorough abdominal exploration due to associations with other mucin-secreting tumors. In our study, 63.6% of patients who underwent right hemicolectomy had low-grade mucinous neoplasms, and 27.3% had malignant disease, indicating that this more extensive surgery is often justified for patients at higher risk of malignancy. Conversely, 25% of patients who received a simple appendectomy were later found to have either low-grade mucinous neoplasms or malignant lesions, underscoring the challenges in preoperative assessment and the potential for underestimating pathology with less invasive surgery.

Our study had few limitations of note. We had a small sample size owing to the rarity of the disease and a single-center experience. This was a retrospective study which may have resulted in a patient selection bias. We did not include in our study CT features in patients with appendicitis without mucoceles for comparison. Previous studies have shown that in both conditions, the appendix is dilated with low-attenuation intraluminal content and there are periappendiceal inflammatory changes with CT being unreliable to differentiate acute appendicitis with mucocele from acute appendicitis without mucocele. Therefore, there is a need to perform a larger study with an analysis of data from patients with suspected acute appendicitis and mucocele radiologically.

Moreover, due to the small number of malignant lesions, our study lacked sufficient power to reliably distinguish between benign and malignant neoplastic mucocele lesions on ROC analysis. Lastly, not all patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT scanning or sonographic imaging prior to the CT studies to determine whether there is a role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of these lesions. Having said that, this study adds to the growing body of literature helping clinicians in the preoperative assessment of a dilated appendix when a diagnostic dilemma arises.

### Epidemiology, clinical features and diagnostic work-up of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas: interim analysis of the prospective PANCY survey [^115yBBhj]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A prospective survey to evaluate the diagnostic workup of cystic pancreatic neoplasms (CPNs) according to the Italian guidelines.

Methods

An online data sheet was built.

Results

Fifteen of the 1385 patients (1.1%) had non cystic neoplastic lesions. Forty percent (518/1295) had at least one 1st degree relative affected by a solid tumor of the digestive and extra-digestive organs. Symptoms/signs associated with the cystic lesion were present in 24.5% of the patients. The cysts were localized in the head of the pancreas in 38.5% of patients. Of the 2370 examinations (1.7 examinations per patient) which were carried out for the diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging was performed as a single test in 48.4% of patients and in combination with endoscopic ultrasound in 27% of the cases. Of the 1370 patients having CPNs, 89.9% had an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) (70.1% a branch duct IPMN, 6.2% a mixed type IPMN and 4.6% a main duct IPMN), 12.7% had a serous cystadenoma, 2.8% a mucinous cystadenoma, 1.5% a non-functioning cystic neuroendocrine neoplasm, 0.7% a solid-pseudopapillary cystic neoplasm, 0.3% a cystic adenocarcinoma, and 1.2% an undetermined cystic neoplasm. Seventy-eight (5.7%) patients were operated upon after the initial work-up.

Conclusions

This prospective study offers a reliable real-life picture of the diagnostic work-up CPN.

### Pancreatic solid and cystic neoplasms: diagnostic evaluation and intervention [^112akMAf]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

High-resolution imaging modalities, such as multi-detector computed tomography, MR imaging, and endoscopic ultrasound, are frequently used alone or in combination to characterize focal solid and cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Imaging in solid pancreatic neoplasms, typically adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors, is primarily used to detect and stage the extent of the tumor and to determine if complete surgical resection for cure is feasible. In cystic pancreatic masses, imaging aims to differentiate benign nonmucinous cystic lesions from potentially or frankly malignant mucin-producing cysts. Several noninvasive and invasive treatment options can be performed if surgical resection is not possible or contraindicated.

Exposures Timeliness of resection according to the final pathological findings. Main Outcomes and Measures The risk of malignant transformation at the final pathology. Results. The radiological signs considered to suggest IPMN progression toward malignant disease were enhancing or nonenhancing mural nodules, cyst wall thickness, and solid components, as well as an MPD dilation of 5 mm or more. Conversely, invasive cancer was diagnosed when atypia extended beyond the mucosal layer. Low-grade IPMN were diagnosed as adenoma and included in the too early group; IGD IPMN were diagnosed as borderline and together with in situ carcinoma, composed the timely group. Invasive cancer, including colloid-type carcinoma, PDAC arising from IPMN, and PDAC concomitant with IPMN, belonged to the too late group. Of 1199 patients with available radiological imaging, 543 patients showed signs suspicious for a malignant condition, according to preoperative radiological assessment.

Overall, radiological criteria for malignant conditions were detected in 53 of 382 patients, 149 of 432 patients, and 341 of 386 patients in the too early, timely, and too late groups, respectively. Figure 3 recapitulates clinical decision-making and the indications for surgical resection in patients from the too early group. Of 438 patients, 118 were radiologically diagnosed with MD-IPMN or MT-IPMN. Of the remaining 320 patients, 248 presented with any additional feature, including other radiological suspicion of malignant disease, increased plasma CA 19–9 levels, diabetes, abdominal pain, or pancreatitis. It may be argued that some patients in the too early group could have had undergone clinical observation, endoscopic examination, cytological and molecular diagnostic tests, and eventually surgery in the event of positive findings.

5, 25 However, almost one-third of them had either MD-IPMN or MT-IPMN, which are associated with. These observations are reflected in the present result as well. The increasing MPD diameter and the increasing proportion of patients fulfilling MD-IPMN or MT-IPMN criteria shown in the 3 groups suggests that MPD size may be a very strong and clinically useful feature to indicate a timely surgical intervention.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^112TNnrz]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

SPECIAL COMMENTARY

Pathology

Pathology is an important part of diagnosing the type of EOC and guiding management of women with this disease. There is variable availability and financing for pathology services around the world. In some regions, clinicians may even have to make diagnoses without pathology. ASCO resource-stratified guidelines use the capacity framework in Table 2 to guide pathology recommendations. As resource-constrained regions develop pathology services, the Expert Panel would like to make some suggestions specific to ovarian cancer.

The clinical presentation and imaging findings of both benign (eg, peritoneal tuberculosis) and other malignancies (eg, GI cancer) may be similar or mimic those of ovarian cancer. Consequently, a histopathologic diagnosis should be undertaken prior to definitive treatment. Pathologic diagnosis may be rendered on a peritoneal or omental biopsy, particularly in patients for whom there is the potential for neoadjuvant intervention, or on resection specimens following laparotomy or laparoscopy. Usually, routine histologic processing of formalin-fixed tissue is sufficient for pathologic diagnosis. Immunohistochemical studies may provide additional confirmatory evidence, but are often not critical to diagnosis. Alternatively, a cytopathologic diagnosis may be enough if this specialized service is available. In some limited and enhanced settings, ascitic fluid can be sent to pathology for cell block in major cities. Where laboratories are of variable quality, cytology alone can be problematic. In some cases, immunohistochemical tests can be sent to a central laboratory to confirm diagnosis, especially if a sample is mucinous.

ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate. The expansion of oncology clinical trials in limited and enhanced settings is a global oncology priority.

### The role of pancreatoscopy in the diagnostic work-up of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wWtJj]. Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Confirming the diagnosis, invasiveness, and disease extent of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas is challenging. The aim of this study was to summarize the literature on the efficacy and safety of peroral pancreatoscopy (POP) in the diagnosis of IPMN, including the impact of pre- and intraoperative POP on the management of IPMN.

Methods

The EMBASE, Medline Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched for articles. Eligible articles investigated cohorts of patients who underwent POP for (suspected) IPMN.

Results

25 articles were identified and included in this review; with 22 of these reporting on the diagnostic yield of POP in IPMN and 11 reporting on the effect of pre- or intraoperative POP on clinical decision-making. Cannulation and observation rates, and overall diagnostic accuracy were high across all studies. Frequently reported visual characteristics of IPMN were intraductal fish-egg-like lesions, hypervascularity, and granular mucosa. Overall, the adverse event rate was 12%, primarily consisting of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis, with a pooled rate of 10%, mostly of mild severity. Regarding the impact of POP on clinical decision-making, POP findings altered the surgical approach in 13%-62% of patients.

Conclusion

POP is technically successful in the vast majority of patients with (suspected) IPMN, has a consistently high diagnostic accuracy, but an adverse event rate of 12%. Data on intraoperative pancreatoscopy are scarce, but small studies suggest its use can alter surgical management. Future studies are needed to better define the role of POP in the diagnostic work-up of IPMN.

### Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the thymus: a case report and review of the literature [^111gvRHx]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Primary thymic mucinous adenocarcinoma is extremely rare; to our knowledge, only 2 cases have been reported to date. We describe a third case of primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the thymus in a 41-year-old man who presented with an anterior mediastinal mass with subsequent metastasis to the lung. The initial diagnosis was of metastatic mucinous adenocarcinoma, but extensive clinical workup of the patient failed to reveal a primary tumor elsewhere in the body. The specific identification of mucinous adenocarcinoma as a primary thymic neoplasm can be difficult or impossible. Morphologic and immunophenotypic similarities to mucinous adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract can pose diagnostic challenges for surgical pathologists, especially in small biopsy specimens.

### Intraoperative predictors of appendiceal abnormalities in patients with mucinous ovarian neoplasms [^1112BJhv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate intraoperative factors predicting appendiceal pathology during gynecologic oncology surgery for suspected mucinous ovarian neoplasms.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study on 225 patients with mucinous ovarian neoplasms who underwent surgery for an adnexal mass with concurrent appendectomy between 2000 and 2018. Regression analyses were used to evaluate intraoperative factors, such as frozen section of the ovarian mass and surgeon's impression of the appendix in predicting appendiceal pathology.

Results

Most patients (77.8%) had a normal appendix on final pathology. Abnormal appendix cases (n = 26) included: metastasis from high-grade adenocarcinoma of the ovary (n = 1), neuroendocrine tumor of the appendix (n = 4), and low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (n = 26; 23 associated with a mucinous ovarian adenocarcinoma, 2 with a benign mucinous ovarian cystadenoma, and 1 with a borderline mucinous ovarian tumor). Combining normal intraoperative appearance of the appendix with benign or borderline frozen section yielded a negative predictive value of 85.1%, with 14.9% of patients being misclassified, and 6.0% having a neuroendocrine tumor or low-grade appendiceal neoplasm.

Conclusion

Benign or borderline frozen section of an ovarian mucinous neoplasm and normal appearing appendix have limited predictive value for appendiceal pathology. Appendectomy with removal of the mesoappendix should be considered in all cases of mucinous ovarian neoplasm, regardless of intraoperative findings.

### Management of patients with pancreatic cysts: analysis of possible false-negative cases of malignancy [^113fnMcS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Model of Fukuoka 2012 Patient Management Criteria

As reported previously, we determined the performance of a model of the Fukuoka (Sendai) 2012 criteria for managing this cohort of patients based on first-line test results. Cysts were determined as having high malignant potential ("surgery" category) if they met ≥ 1 of the Fukuoka 2012 "high-risk stigmata" (presence of obstructive jaundice in a patient with a cystic lesion of the head, enhancing solid component, main duct dilation ≥ 1 cm) or "worrisome features" [definite mural nodule confirmed by EUS, main duct involvement, severe (ie, suspicious) cytology, abrupt changes in duct caliber, a presumptive diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm based on indications of mucin in records, cyst size > 3 cm]. Although we included all cysts > 3 cm in diameter in the surgery category, the Fukuoka 2012 algorithm suggests that in patients with cysts > 3 cm and no other high-risk stigmata or worrisome features, surgery is strongly considered only in young, fit patients. Patients were categorized as meeting Fukuoka 2012 "surveillance" criteria (low malignant potential) if they lacked all of the above features. Because the cohort comprised only patients with negative, nondiagnostic, indeterminate, or acellular cytology results (not all patients with a pancreatic cyst), this model does not exactly correspond with the published Fukuoka 2012 guidance. The number of cases for which information was not specified for each of the above features was reported in the supplementary section of our previous report (Table e3).

### Spectrum of MRI features of mucin-producing neoplasms in the abdomen and pelvis [^116bYqQG]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Mucin-producing neoplasms in the abdomen and pelvis are a distinct entity, separate from simple fluid-containing neoplasms and loculated fluid collections. Mucin is a thick gelatinous substance and-owing to its high water content-has imaging features that can be mistaken for those of simple fluid-containing neoplasms with multiple imaging modalities. However, mucin-producing neoplasms arise from specific organs in the abdomen and pelvis, with unique imaging appearances, knowledge of which is important to guide accurate diagnosis and management. With its large field of view and high soft-tissue resolution, MRI has advantages over other imaging modalities in characterizing these neoplasms. The authors focus on the spectrum of MRI features of such mucin-producing neoplasms and illustrate how-despite a varied organ origin-some of these neoplasms share similar MRI and histopathologic features, thereby helping narrow the differential diagnosis. One common finding in these tumors is that the presence of internal complexity and solid enhancing components increases as the degree of malignant transformation increases. Lack of internal complexity generally indicates benignity. These tumors have a varied range of prognosis; for example, a low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm is indicative of a good prognosis, while a mucinous tumor of the rectum is known to manifest at an early age with aggressive behavior and poorer prognosis compared with its nonmucinous counterpart.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^112cuYK2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver (MCN-L) — imaging evaluation and diagnostic features: Up to 76% of MCN-Ls occur in the left hepatic lobe, with a predilection for segment IV. On ultrasound, MCN-L usually appears as a hypoechoic lesion with irregular, often thickened walls, internal septations, mural nodularity, and occasionally internal echoes. If a complex cyst is identified on ultrasound, cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained, and in general, MRI is the preferred modality to evaluate cystic lesions. The presence of septations has shown to be 95% sensitive in the diagnosis of MCN-Ls, and septations that arise directly from the wall of the cyst showed 100% specificity and 80% sensitivity for MCN-L as opposed to a simple hepatic cyst. CA 19–9 levels are elevated in 28%–73% of biliary cystadenocarcinomas (BCAs); however, serum or cystic fluid CA 19–9 levels do not discriminate between benign and malignant cysts or between MCNs and BCAs.

### Appendicitis mimicking the CT appearance of an appendiceal mucinous neoplasm [^115YonTc]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Occasionally, radiologically diagnosed acute appendicitis is found to harbour underlying appendiceal neoplasm on post-surgical histopathology. Conversely, a situation in which radiologically, the appendix demonstrates features consistent with an underlying tumour but post-operative pathology finds no evidence of neoplastic change is rare. We describe a case of a 50-year-old man who presented with a markedly dilated "mass-like" appendix with minimal inflammatory changes on a computed tomography scan. Radiological findings were suspicious for an appendiceal neoplasm/mucocele (i.e. low-grade mucinous neoplasm). However, the post-surgical histopathological diagnosis did not concur with the radiological diagnosis and instead demonstrated findings compatible with acute appendicitis without neoplastic change. In this case report we provide a histopathological correlation and an explanation as to how this may have happened with the hope of helping radiologists avoid this pitfall in the future.
