## Question

What does albumin/creatinine tell you on a lab

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) tells you on a lab test and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what ACR actually measures and why it is preferred over raw albumin concentration. Then, I should verify the standard cutoffs that define albuminuria categories and how to confirm an abnormal result. Next, I will consider what ACR tells us diagnostically, prognostically, and therapeutically, including special populations like pregnancy and pediatrics. After that, I need to check pre-analytical and analytical factors that can confound interpretation and how to mitigate them. Finally, I will integrate ACR with eGFR for CKD risk stratification and outline a practical, guideline-concordant workflow for ordering, confirming, and monitoring ACR in practice.

> Let me first confirm the construct: ACR is a spot urine test that divides urine albumin concentration by urine creatinine concentration, yielding a ratio that adjusts for urine concentration variability and approximates timed albumin excretion. This is why guidelines prefer ACR over albumin concentration alone for detecting and staging albuminuria, especially in diabetes and CKD risk assessment [^111VG1ea] [^111nW6MG] [^111Yd4cx].

> I need to verify the standard thresholds and categories. Wait, let me double-check the units and cut points: ACR is reported in mg/g or mg/mmol, and KDIGO defines A1 as less than 30 mg/g, A2 as 30–299 mg/g, and A3 as 300 mg/g or higher. Canadian guidance uses 2.0 mg/mmol (about 18 mg/g) as the A2 threshold in people with diabetes, which is lower than KDIGO's 30 mg/g, so I should explicitly note that jurisdictional differences exist and interpret results accordingly [^1175ZuJn] [^112DjRHa] [^115AujF4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single value. I should confirm persistence. Because of substantial day-to-day biological variability in albumin excretion, an elevated ACR should be confirmed on at least two additional first-morning specimens over 3–6 months, with classification based on two of three concordant results. This confirmation strategy reduces misclassification and aligns with KDOQI and ADA guidance [^111VG1ea] [^112bBHEU] [^113oert1].

> Next, I should review what ACR tells us diagnostically. ACR is a marker of kidney damage and is one of two laboratory criteria for diagnosing CKD alongside reduced eGFR. It detects diabetic kidney disease earlier than a declining eGFR and is the preferred initial test for albuminuria in adults, with protein-to-creatinine ratio as an alternative when albumin assays are unavailable or non-albumin proteinuria is suspected [^1175ZuJn] [^111Yd4cx] [^114GCygy].

> I will now examine prognostic implications. Elevated ACR signals higher risks of CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality, and this risk relationship is graded even at high-normal ACR values below 30 mg/g. Importantly, changes in ACR over time track with clinical outcomes, so a sustained rise or fall carries prognostic meaning beyond a single value [^1165NCvy] [^112qNDE8] [^115aEg9U].

> Let me consider therapeutic implications. Detection of albuminuria influences initiation and intensification of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and intensive blood pressure control; point-of-care ACR testing has been associated with increased detection and treatment modifications in diabetes care, though I should confirm abnormal results with laboratory methods when possible [^115734m4] [^1175ZuJn] [^116V4KaF].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or a child? In hypertensive pregnancy, spot protein-to-creatinine ratio is a reasonable rule-out test for significant proteinuria, whereas albumin-to-creatinine ratio data are more limited; in pediatrics, both ACR and PCR are acceptable, with first-morning samples preferred, and confirmation of elevations is recommended before labeling as CKD [^112P3vtP] [^115ZmuWp] [^113oert1].

> I should double-check factors that can confound interpretation. Pre-analytical issues include exercise, upright posture, menstruation, UTI, and dehydration; analytical issues include assay imprecision and inter-laboratory variability; biological factors include age, sex, and muscle mass affecting creatinine excretion; to mitigate, use first-morning samples, avoid uncontrolled exercise beforehand, treat intercurrent infections, and ensure laboratories meet quality standards and external quality assessment for urine albumin and creatinine [^113JKcU3] [^117HSGQS] [^117JSXLg].

> Let me verify how to handle variability when monitoring. Because within-person ACR variability can approach 40–50%, only relatively large changes are likely to reflect true biological change. KDIGO advises that a doubling of ACR exceeds expected laboratory variability and should prompt clinical reassessment, and multiple collections can improve confidence in trajectory [^115Z2BeX] [^11631Lyn] [^115F1pHd].

> Next, I should review integration with eGFR for risk stratification. CKD is staged by GFR categories (G1–G5) and albuminuria categories (A1–A3), and the combination predicts progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular events. When serum creatinine is unreliable, cystatin C–based eGFR can refine risk, and both ACR and eGFR should be monitored periodically in at-risk patients [^1175ZuJn] [^111Yd4cx] [^1114ry3p].

> I need to ensure the practical workflow is clear. Initial testing should use a first-morning spot urine ACR when possible. If ACR is 30 mg/g or higher (or local equivalent), confirm with two additional first-morning samples over 3–6 months. If initial testing is a dipstick or POCT, confirm with quantitative laboratory ACR. Report ACR to one decimal place with units and ensure the lab calculates the ratio rather than leaving it to clinicians [^1175ZuJn] [^111nW6MG] [^116DFttY].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence. For patients with established diabetic kidney disease or CKD, guidelines recommend ACR and eGFR monitoring 1–4 times per year depending on CKD stage and clinical context, with more frequent checks when eGFR is below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or ACR is substantially elevated, and VA/DoD suggests up to quarterly testing in very high-risk patients [^111wk3BT] [^111YkekA] [^111ddn4e].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line so I don't miss anything. ACR tells you whether albumin is being lost into the urine at abnormal levels, adjusts for urine concentration, and categorizes the severity of albuminuria; persistently elevated ACR confirms kidney damage, refines cardiovascular and kidney risk, and guides therapy, but it must be interpreted in context, confirmed when abnormal, and integrated with eGFR for comprehensive CKD assessment and follow-up [^1175ZuJn] [^111Yd4cx] [^1165NCvy].

---

The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is a spot urine test that quantifies albumin excretion normalized to creatinine, providing a **reliable marker of kidney damage** and cardiovascular risk [^115F2XKe]. It is the preferred initial test for albuminuria because it adjusts for urine concentration and is convenient, but results can be confounded by hydration, exercise, and assay variability; persistent elevation requires confirmation on two additional first-morning samples over 3–6 months [^113JKcU3] [^111VG1ea]. ACR is used to **stage CKD**, guide therapy (especially in diabetes and hypertension), and predict progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular events [^113ETzN7] [^1148ACz5].

---

## Clinical significance of ACR

ACR is a **sensitive marker of kidney damage**, detecting early kidney disease before eGFR declines, and is strongly associated with CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality [^112kS5RG] [^115F2XKe]. It is the preferred initial test for albuminuria because it adjusts for urine concentration and is more convenient than timed collections [^114dapSw] [^112CrwN8] [^11631Lyn].

---

## Measurement and interpretation

ACR is measured from a spot urine sample, preferably a first-morning void, and reported as mg/g or mg/mmol [^1175ZuJn]. Interpretation follows **KDIGO categories**:

| **Category** | **Acr (mg/g)** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| A1 | < 30 | Normal to mildly increased |
| A2 | 30–300 | Moderately increased |
| A3 | > 300 | Severely increased |

---

Confirmation of an elevated ACR (≥ 30 mg/g) should be done with **two additional first-morning samples over 3–6 months** to account for biological variability [^116CkXpH] [^111VG1ea].

---

## Clinical applications

ACR is used to:

- **Diagnose and stage CKD**: Integral to CKD classification and risk stratification [^113ETzN7] [^111Yd4cx].
- **Guide therapy**: Influences use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetes and hypertension [^notfound].
- **Monitor progression**: Tracks disease course and treatment response [^112qNDE8] [^115Z2BeX].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

ACR can be affected by:

- **Hydration status**: Dehydration or overhydration can alter results [^notfound].
- **Exercise and posture**: Recent exercise or orthostatic proteinuria can transiently elevate ACR [^113JKcU3].
- **Assay variability**: Differences between laboratories and methods can affect accuracy [^114GCygy] [^117JutBb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend:

- **Initial testing**: Use ACR as the preferred initial test for albuminuria [^114dapSw].
- **Confirmation**: Confirm elevated ACR with two additional first-morning samples [^112bBHEU] [^116DFttY].
- **Monitoring**: Monitor ACR at least annually in CKD, more frequently in higher-risk patients [^111ddn4e].

---

ACR is a practical, sensitive test for detecting and monitoring albuminuria, supporting CKD diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment decisions; however, **results should be confirmed and interpreted in clinical context** due to variability and confounders [^1175ZuJn] [^111Yd4cx].

Regarding quality improvement for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to requirements for laboratories, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to implement the following laboratory reporting and handling standards to ensure precision and reliability when evaluating urine samples:

- analyze samples for albumin measurement fresh or stored at 4 °C for up to 7 days

- do not store samples for albumin measurement frozen at -20 °C

- report albumin-to-creatinine ratio in untimed urine samples in addition to urine albumin concentration rather than the concentrations alone

- report to 1 decimal place for albumin-to-creatinine ratio whether mg/mmol or mg/g

- ensure the analytical coefficient of variation of methods to measure urine albumin is < 15%.

A. Analytical.

Analytical goals can be related to the degree of biological variation, with less precision required for analytes that vary widely. Detection limits and imprecision data are summarized in Table 7. Commercially available quantitative methods for low levels of albuminuria have documented detection limits of approximately 20 μg/L or less. Within-run imprecision and day-to-day (total) imprecision are well within the analytical goal of approximately 15% and are often considerably less. Most, but not all, methods agree well and support a reference interval of 2–20 μg albumin/mg creatinine.

The within-person variation in albumin excretion is large in people without diabetes and is even higher in patients with diabetes. Howey et al. studied day-to-day variation, over 3–4 weeks, in the 24-h albumin excretion, the concentration of albumin, and the albumin–creatinine ratio. The last two variables were measured in the 24-h urine sample, the first morning void, and random untimed urine collections. In healthy volunteers, the lowest within-person CVs were obtained for the concentration of albumin in the first morning void (36%) and for the albumin–creatinine ratio in that sample (31%). Multiple studies have evaluated the best procedure to assess albuminuria. Most studies have found that the spot urine albumin–creatinine concentration in the first morning void, rather than the 24-h urinary excretion of albumin or the timed collection, is the most practical and reliable technique.

To keep the analytical CV less than half the biological CV, an analytical goal of an 18% CV has been proposed. Alternatively, if the albumin–creatinine ratio is to be used, one may calculate the need for a somewhat lower imprecision (that is, a better precision) to accommodate the lower biological CV for the ratio and the imprecision contributed by the creatinine measurement. Assuming a CV of 5% for creatinine measurement, we calculate a goal of 14.7% for the analytical CV for albumin when it is used to estimate the albumin–creatinine ratio. A goal of 15% appears reasonable to accommodate use of the measured albumin concentration for calculating either the timed excretion rate or the albumin–creatinine ratio.

RECOMMENDATION: SEMIQUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE SCREENING TESTS SHOULD BE POSITIVE IN > 95% OF PATIENTS WITH LOW LEVELS OF ALBUMINURIA TO BE USEFUL FOR SCREENING. POSITIVE RESULTS MUST BE CONFIRMED BY ANALYSIS IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY GPP.

### Estimating urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from protein-to-creatinine ratio: development of equations using same-day measurements [^114sWyPP]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) are used to measure urine protein. Recent guidelines endorse ACR use, and equations have been developed incorporating ACR to predict risk of kidney failure. For situations in which PCR only is available, having a method to estimate ACR from PCR as accurately as possible would be useful.

Methods

We used data from a population-based cohort of 47,714 adults in Alberta, Canada, who had simultaneous assessments of urine ACR and PCR. After log-transforming ACR and PCR, we used cubic splines and quantile regression to estimate the median ACR from a PCR, allowing for modification by specified covariates. On the basis of the cubic splines, we created models using linear splines to develop equations to estimate ACR from PCR. In a subcohort with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, we then used the kidney failure risk equation to compare kidney failure risk using measured ACR as well as estimated ACR that had been derived from PCR.

Results

We found a nonlinear association between log(ACR) and log(PCR), with the implied albumin-to-protein ratio increasing from < 30% in normal to mild proteinuria to about 70% in severe proteinuria, and with wider prediction intervals at lower levels. Sex was the most important modifier of the relationship between ACR and PCR, with men generally having a higher albumin-to-protein ratio. Estimates of kidney failure risk were similar using measured ACR and ACR estimated from PCR.

Conclusions

We developed equations to estimate the median ACR from a PCR, optionally including specified covariates. These equations may prove useful in certain retrospective clinical or research applications where only PCR is available.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^112fDbCP]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Our study contributes new information that has been lacking in several important ways. First, our cohort was composed exclusively of individuals who were at high risk of developing diabetes on the basis of elevated fasting glucose and IGT plus overweight or obesity (for the majority). Because our sample size was far larger than all the IGT subgroups from the previously mentioned studies combined, it is unlikely that our negative findings were related to insufficient statistical power. Interestingly, despite their elevated risk for diabetes, the great majority of our cohort did not have microalbuminuria. Second, we analyzed ACR throughout its continuous range, avoiding artificial cutoff values, such as microalbuminuria, that could limit its descriptive utility. On the other hand, the DPP included very few subjects with micro- or macroalbuminuria, which could have reduced the power to show an association in these ranges and the generalizability of our results. Indeed, the predictive power of ACR could have been obscured by the increased risk for development of diabetes present in the DPP cohort at baseline. The fact that ACR was so closely associated with insulin or glycemic parameters supports this hypothesis. In addition, we excluded individuals with chronic kidney disease, further reducing generalizability, and measured ACR only once at baseline. ACR can be affected by diet, physical activity, and other habits, which may have introduced some variability into our findings, although this would be limited somewhat by the uniform collection criterion (i.e. fasting morning sample). Finally, major differences between the DPP and prior studies were the ethnically and culturally diverse cohort and the fact that we detected early diabetes by annual or semiannual surveillance glucose tolerance tests using accepted criteria, thus reducing the likelihood that ACR reflected prior exposure to severe hyperglycemia.

The study hypothesis was based on the presumption that subtle damage occurs within the kidney in the pre-diabetic state — whether from chronic exposure to abnormal glycemia that is below the formal threshold for diabetes, elevated intrarenal blood pressure, or oxidative stress (22), among other causes — that manifests itself as elevated ACR. ACR, as a subtle marker of incipient damage, could in turn herald the onset of diabetes. Although we did not confirm such a relationship, this does not exclude the possibility that ACR can predict hard outcomes in this population, as it has in others.

In summary, in a population of subjects at elevated risk for diabetes, ACR below the microalbuminuria range does not predict incident diabetes.

Of note, only in a minority of patient samples (3.3% of the cohort), quantitative albumin measurement was initially requested by the physician, while 18.3% of the samples showed an ACR of > 30 mg/g creatinine. These data reflect a known underdiagnosis of albuminuria and CKD.

Assessment of study quality

At least one reviewer used validated tools to assessed all included manuscripts for study and reporting quality. We defined methodological quality as the confidence that the study design, conduct, and analysis minimised biases in answering the research question, focusing on the internal validity (that is, the degree to which the results of an observation are correct for the patients being studied). Items considered important for a good quality paper were prospective design with consecutive/random recruitment or cross sectional studies, full verification of the test result with an outcome measure (> 90%), adequate description of the population and index test, and whether the clinicians managing the patients were blinded to the results of the index test. Consecutive recruitment is important to minimise bias and give a better reflection of the population. Prospective recruitment is important to ensure adequate and accurate collection of baseline variables and more complete follow-up. For the diagnosis of significant proteinuria, we also considered cross sectional studies to be of high quality as no time element is present.

We used QUADAS to assess the quality of the papers. We used the STARD checklist to assess elements of study design that were likely to have a direct relation to bias in a study of test accuracy.

Data synthesis

From the two by two tables, we calculated the following parameters for the different indices and various thresholds with their 95% confidence intervals for individual studies: sensitivity (true per cent positive), specificity (true per cent negative), and likelihood ratios (the ratio of the probability of the specific test result in people who have the disease to the probability in people who do not). Likelihood ratios indicate by how much a given test result raises or lowers the probability of the patient having the disease and have been recommended by evidence based medicine groups. Where two by two tables contained zero cells, we added 0.5 to each cell to enable calculations. We pooled results among groups of studies with the same threshold for protein to creatinine ratio or albumin to creatinine ratio (where necessary, we recalculated thresholds to mg/mg to ensure consistency of units) and the same outcome measure (either significant proteinuria (significant > 300 mg/24 hours, severe > 5000 mg/24 hours) on 24 hour collection or adverse pregnancy outcomes).

KDOQI — screening and confirmation of diabetic kidney disease emphasizes that screening can wait until 5 years after the onset of type 1 diabetes, whereas in type 2 diabetes screening at diagnosis is mandatory; elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) should be confirmed in the absence of urinary tract infection, and because albumin excretion rate (AER) has high day-to-day variability, most professional societies recommend confirmation during the subsequent 3 to 6 months using first-voided urinary specimens.

### Day-to-day variability in spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio [^11631Lyn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Accurate quantification of albuminuria is important in the diagnosis and management of chronic kidney disease. The reference test, a timed urinary albumin excretion, is cumbersome and prone to collection errors. Spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) is convenient and commonly used, but random day-to-day variability in ACR measurements has not been assessed.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study of day-to-day variability in spot urine ACR measurements.

Setting & Participants

Clinically stable outpatients (N = 157) attending a university hospital clinic in Australia between July 2007 and April 2010.

Outcomes

Spot urine ACR variability was assessed and repeatability limits were determined using fractional polynomials.

Measurements

ACRs were measured from spot urine samples collected at 9:00am on consecutive days and 24-hour urine albuminuria was measured concurrently.

Results

Paired ACRs were obtained from 157 patients (median age, 56 years; 60% men; median daily albumin excretion, 226 [range, 2.5–14,000] mg/d). Day-to-day variability was substantial and increased in absolute terms, but decreased in relative terms, with increasing baseline ACR. For patients with normoalbuminuria (ACR < 3 mg/mmol [< 27 mg/g]), a change greater than ± 467% (0–17 mg/mmol [0–150 mg/g]) is required to indicate a significant change in albuminuria status with 95% certainty; for those with microalbuminuria (ACR of 3–30 mg/mmol [27–265 mg/g]), a change of ± 170% (0–27 mg/mmol [0–239 mg/g]) is required; for those with macroalbuminuria (ACR > 30 mg/mmol [> 265 mg/g]), a change of ± 83% (5–55 mg/mmol [44–486 mg/g]) is required; and for those with nephrotic-range proteinuria (ACR > 300 mg/mmol [> 2,652 mg/g]), a change of ± 48% (158–443 mg/mmol [1,397–3,916 mg/g]) is needed to represent a significant change.

Limitations

These study results need to be replicated in other ethnic groups.

Conclusions

Changes in chronic kidney disease status attributed to therapy or disease progression, when based solely on a change in ACR, may be incorrect unless the potential for day-to-day biological variation has been considered. Only relatively large changes are likely to indicate a change in disease status.

### Impact of metabolic abnormalities on the association between normal-range urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and cardiovascular mortality: evidence from the NHANES 1999–2018 [^1128Pf6A]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), utilizes a complex, stratified probability sampling method to survey the noninstitutionalized US population. Data from NHANES were collected via interviews, physical assessments, and laboratory evaluations of blood and urine specimens collected from participants. This study used 10 cycles of the continuous NHANES from 1999 to 2018. Of the 55,081 participants aged 20 years or older, we excluded those with missing measurements for waist circumference, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides (TG), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (n = 7,118); those lacking data on urine albumin, urine creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and UACR ≥ 30 mg/g (n = 8,396); those missing information on relevant covariates (n = 12,236); and those with unclear mortality status (n = 33). The final analytical cohort comprised 27,298 participants (see Supplement Figure S1).

UACR definition and grouping

Urine samples were collected by trained investigators and frozen at -20 °C before being transported to the laboratory. A solid-phase fluorescence immunoassay measured urine albumin levels. Before 2007, urinary creatinine was measured using the kinetic Jaffe rate method. After 2007, an enzymatic method was employed for creatinine measurement. Comprehensive details of laboratory testing procedures are available on the NHANES website. To minimize discrepancies in urine creatinine measurement techniques, we applied the NHANES-endorsed algorithm to adjust creatinine levels for data collected before 2007. UACR is calculated by dividing urine albumin by urine creatinine. Participants were classified into tertiles according to their UACR levels within the normal range: low (< 4.62 mg/g), medium (4.62–7.94 mg/g), and high (> 7.94 to < 30 mg/g).

### Change in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^112qNDE8]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our findings demonstrate that achievement of decreased or stable UACR is associated with lower risk of CV and kidney adverse events compared with patients with an increase in UACR. These results add to previous studies examining the impact of UACR change on kidney outcomes and establish the benefit of measuring and targeting UACR for both CV and kidney disease. Together, our findings and the ADA guidelines support measurement of albuminuria at every visit in patients with kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, and its importance as a modifiable risk factor.

Evaluation of albuminuria — initial testing, confirmation, and interpretation: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of preference), and in all cases, a first void in the morning midstream urine sample is preferred. If measuring urine protein, use urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods, confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible, and confirm ACR ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the morning midstream urine sample. Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated.

For both ACR and PCR, a sensitivity and specificity of 100% was obtained. The correlation between the KDIGO CKD categories obtained with both ACR methods resulted in an agreement of 89.2% and 0.82, respectively, using the weighted kappa coefficient (Table 2).

### Optimization of screening strategy for chronic kidney disease by urine test strips using the albumin-creatinine read-out [^112oBR9w]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical laboratories play an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our aim was to evaluate the performance of qualitative and semi-quantitative albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) test strip results as screening tools for albuminuria in multiple representative patient cohorts.

Materials and Methods

ACR and PCR were evaluated in both cross-sectional (n = 940) and validation (n = 927) patient cohorts. Semi-quantitative urinary ACR and PCR were performed using a UC-3500 instrument (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The diagnostic performance of semi-quantitative ACR and PCR was determined using quantitative ACR and PCR as reference method.

Results

In the cross-sectional cohort, a sensitivity and specificity of 78.1% and 93.3%, respectively, were obtained for semi-quantitative ACR at a cut-off of 30 mg/g creatinine, with an overall agreement of > 90% between both methods. The sensitivity and specificity increased in the target population (validation cohort) to 89.9% and 92.1%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivities of qualitative protein concentration (78.6%) and semi-quantitative PCR (69.8%) were lower.

Conclusion

The results confirm that urine test strip readouts are a valuable screening tool for CKD in low-risk individuals. ACR should be the preferred criterion for reflex testing when using a urine test strip for screening CKD.

Quality of studies

Figure 2shows a summary of the quality assessment of the included studies. We found good compliance with appropriate population spectrum, selection criteria adequately described, appropriate reference standard, and adequate description of index and reference standard. Blinding of the assessors of the outcome measure to the results of the albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to creatinine ratio was poorly reported (3/20 studies). No studies reported on the use of any treatment in between the albumin to creatinine ratio or protein to creatinine ratio and delivery or whether the results of the tests were used in determining patients' management. Verification bias was minimised, as the number of eligible women progressing to the reference standard in included studies was more than 90% in 18/20. Five out of the 20 included studies used less than 80% of included women in the final analysis; reasons for this included exclusion after trial entry, lack of verification with reference standard, and loss to follow-up. In 379 (13%) cases this was due to incomplete 24 hour urine collection.

### Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in normal range, cardiovascular health, and all-cause mortality [^1165NCvy]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does cardiovascular health (CVH) modify the association of all-cause mortality with elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) within the normal range (< 30 mg/g)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 23 697 US adults with a UACR less than 30 mg/g, the risk of all-cause mortality associated with a high-normal UACR gradually increased across CVH groups as delineated by Life's Essential 8 scores. Participants with poor CVH status and high-normal UACR had the highest risk of all-cause mortality.

Meaning

The findings suggest that maintaining ideal CVH may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality associated with high-normal UACR, highlighting the importance of risk management for early kidney dysfunction.

### ALB_CR_L… [^117JutBb]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein in healthy individuals. Human serum albumin is synthesized by the liver and serves many important roles in human physiology such as, maintaining oncotic pressure, and transport of various hormones, vitamins, and drugs throughout the body. Kidney elimination of serum albumin may be observed in severe kidney disease. Following the urinary albumin excretion has been shown to be a diagnostic and prognostic marker for kidney and cardiovascular events. Unfortunately, this marker displays variable correlation between diagnostic vendors. The correlation deviations are attributed to calibration and assay differences between platforms. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle and is usually produced at a fairly constant rate by the body, depending on muscle mass. Creatinine is excreted by glomerular filtration during normal kidney function. Creatinine may be measured in both serum and urine.

Creatinine measurement is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases, in monitoring kidney dialysis, and as a calculation basis for other urinary analytes. Creatinine is produced by creatine and creatinine phosphate as a result of muscle metabolic processes. It is then excreted by glomerular filtration during normal kidney function. Creatinine may be measured in both serum and urine. Creatinine measurement is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases, in monitoring kidney dialysis, and as a calculation basis for other urinary analytes. In this enzymatic method creatinine is converted to creatine under the activity of creatininase. Creatine is then acted upon by creatinase to form sarcosine and urea.

Sarcosine oxidase converts sarcosine to glycine and hydrogen peroxide, and the hydrogen peroxide reacts with a chromophore in the presence of peroxidase to produce a colored product that is measured at 546 nm.

Microalbuminuria is described as "an independent risk factor for the development of CKD… and GFR loss… and for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality", with point prevalence varying "from 7% to 22% in type 1… and from 6.5% to 42% in type 2 diabetes", and annual incidence "of 1% to 2%… reported in type 2… and possibly type 1 diabetes". For testing, "the Work Group recommends estimating the ACR [albumin-to-creatinine ratio] in a spot urine sample (preferably the first morning void)", noting that "The sensitivity and specificity of ACR estimates are greater than 85% compared with timed urine collections", and that urinary albumin excretion has "an intraindividual CV of approximately 40%". Estimates of urine albumin excretion are also reported as "available, relatively inexpensive, and easy to perform".

### Urine albumin-creatinine ratio versus albumin excretion for albuminuria staging: a prospective longitudinal cohort study [^112sDakR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

New guidelines advocate the use of albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a urine sample instead of 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) for staging albuminuria. Concern has been expressed that this may result in misclassification for reasons including interindividual differences in urinary creatinine excretion.

Study Design

Prospective longitudinal cohort study.

Setting & Participants

We examined 7,623 participants of the PREVEND and RENAAL studies for reclassified when using ACR instead of 24-hour UAE, the characteristics of reclassified participants, and their outcomes. Albuminuria was categorized into 3 ACR and UAE categories: < 30, 30 to 300, and > 300mg/g or mg/24 h, respectively.

Predictors

Baseline ACR and 24-hour UAE.

Outcomes

Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality.

Results

When using ACR in the early morning void instead of 24-hour UAE, 88% of participants were classified in corresponding albuminuria categories. 307 (4.0%) participants were reclassified to a higher, and 603 (7.9%), to a lower category. Participants who were reclassified to a higher ACR category in general had a worse CV risk profile compared with nonreclassified participants, whereas the reverse was true for participants reclassified to a lower ACR category. Similarly, Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that reclassification to a higher ACR category was associated with a tendency for increased risk for CV morbidity and mortality and all-cause mortality, whereas reclassification to a lower ACR category was associated with a tendency for lower risk. Net reclassification improvement, adjusted for age, sex, and duration of follow-up, was 0.107 (P = 0.002) for CV events and 0.089 (P < 0.001) for all-cause mortality.

Limitations

Early morning void urine collection instead of spot urine collection.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that there is high agreement between early morning void ACR and 24-hour UAE categories. Reclassification is therefore limited, but when present, is generally indicative of the presence of CV risk factors and prognosis.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^113UfFor]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) testing rates and albuminuria detection — Across 24 health care organizations, eGFR testing among persons with type 2 diabetes had "a median percentile testing rate of approximately 90%", whereas "the median percentile testing rate for UACR in these same organizations was 53%", and an analysis "estimated that nearly two-thirds of patients likely to have albuminuria go undetected due to lack of UACR testing". Heterogeneous reporting further hinders clinical utility, including cases where "Scr or cystatin C results are reported without the corresponding eGFR", where "urine albumin and creatinine values are reported separately with unclear units of measurement, and the ratio has to be manually calculated by clinical providers", and where "urine albumin is commonly measured without a concurrent urine creatinine".

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^114yMu8q]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Identifying a simple, safe, and inexpensive tool to improve prediction of future diabetes would be an important public health achievement, especially in light of the ongoing diabetes pandemic. Preliminary results from several observational studies raise the possibility that low levels of ACR could play such a role, with further (indirect) evidence being that proteinuria-reducing antihypertensive agents are associated with a reduced risk of incident diabetes. However, in the present study, the largest study of pre-diabetic individuals to date, we did not find that ACR had any independent predictive value.

Our study hypothesis was not necessarily dependent upon a causal link between increasing ACR and onset of diabetes. For example, one possible premise is that exposure to levels of glycemia below what is conventionally considered pathological induces changes in renal handling of urinary albumin, which in turn would lead to increased ACR. Alternatively, increased ACR could simply be one of a number of early, organ-specific manifestations of insulin resistance that herald the onset of diabetes. Regardless, we felt it important to test this hypothesis, especially given prior findings.

### Change in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^115aEg9U]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

There were also some limitations to the study that warrant mention. First, UACR measurements were less frequently recorded in the dataset, which has led to the use of a single UACR test to define albuminuria and UACR change and a relatively long interval to identify the follow-up UACR test (ie, 0.5–2 years after the initial UACR). Therefore, the UACR change reflects relative change measured at different timepoints compared with the initial UACR measurement. Second, as UACR measurements are highly variable, there may have been misclassification of UACR category and change status. However, this was partially mitigated by our requirement of observing large changes in UACR (ie, > 30%) to be classified as having either an increase or decrease in UACR, which would reduce misclassification errors introduced by the fluctuation in UACR levels. Finally, to ensure that the selection of a study population with a follow-up UACR was independent of the duration of continuous eligibility, patients were required to have at least 2 years of continuous eligibility after the initial UACR test. Consequently, patients with rapid disease progression after the initial UACR test that led to early death were excluded.

### Albumin-to-creatinine ratio for detection of… [^116BDTXA]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

A challenge to periodic screening for microalbuminuria is that 24-hour urine collections are cumbersome, possibly contributing to noncompliance. Bakker compared the reliability of 24-hour collection versus the urinary albumin concentration and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio in detecting microalbuminuria. A total of 2, 394 consecutive urine samples from 1, 171 men and 1, 223 women with diabetes were evaluated over a period of two-and-one-half years. Standard methods were used to determine the total albumin excretion rate, the urinary albumin concentration and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. On the basis of the albumin excretion rate, the frequency of microalbuminuria in this population was 36. 6 percent in the men and
27. 9 percent in the women. The frequency of microalbuminuria increased steadily after the age of 50 years. The correlation between the albumin excretion rate and the albumin concentration was considered "acceptable" and did not show sex-related differences.

However, there was a closer correlation between 24-hour collection values and the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. The correlation improved for men and women when they were considered separately. An albumin excretion rate of 20 μg per minute corresponded to an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 1. 98 g per mol for men and
2. 81 g per mol for women. An albumin excretion rate of 200 μg per minute corresponded with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 19 g per mol for men and 28 g per mol for women. The author concludes that the albumin-to-creatinine ratio may be used in place of the more cumbersome 24-hour urine collection for the detection of microalbminuria. The sensitivity and specificity of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio were 94 percent and 92 percent, respectively, at 2. 5 g per mol for women, and 94 percent and 93 percent, respectively, at

1. 8 g per mol for men.

In contrast to the urinary albumin concentration, however, the albumin-to-creatinine ratio requires both sex- and age-specific discriminator values.

### Glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria for detection and staging of acute and chronic kidney disease in adults: a systematic review [^111Yd4cx]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Because early-stage kidney disease is asymptomatic and is associated with both morbidity and mortality, laboratory measurements are required for its detection.

Objective

To summarize evidence supporting the use of laboratory tests for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to detect and stage acute kidney injury, acute kidney diseases and disorders, and chronic kidney disease in adults.

Evidence Review

We reviewed recent guidelines from various professional groups identified via the National Guideline Clearing House and author knowledge, and systematically searched MEDLINE for other sources of evidence for selected topics.

Findings

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines define and stage acute and chronic kidney diseases by GFR and albuminuria. For initial assessment of GFR, measuring serum creatinine and reporting estimated GFR based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2009 equation is recommended. If confirmation of GFR is required because of conditions that affect serum creatinine independent of GFR (eg, extremes of muscle mass or diet), or interference with the assay, cystatin C should be measured and estimated GFR should be calculated and reported using cystatin C (eGFRcys) and serum creatinine (eGFRcr-cys) or GFR should be measured directly using a clearance procedure. Initial assessment of albuminuria includes measuring urine albumin and creatinine in an untimed spot urine collection and reporting albumin-to-creatinine ratio. If confirmation of albuminuria is required because of diurnal variation or conditions affecting creatinine excretion, such as extremes of muscle mass or diet, the albumin excretion rate should be measured from a timed urine collection.

Conclusions and Relevance

Detection and staging of acute and chronic kidney diseases can be relatively simple. Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with kidney disease, early diagnosis is important and should be pursued in at-risk populations.

### Optimization of screening strategy for chronic kidney disease by urine test strips using the albumin-creatinine read-out [^112kS5RG]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical laboratories play a crucial role in the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The age-standardized global prevalence of CKD stages 1–5 in adults aged ≥ 20 years is 10.4% in men and 11.8% in women. Early diagnosis and management may improve long-term outcomes.

Albuminuria, characterized by the presence of excessive albumin in urine, serves as a crucial indicator of kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. Early detection of albuminuria is imperative for timely diagnosis, intervention, and management of patients predisposed to kidney damage. According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are two laboratory-based criteria for the diagnosis of CKD. In CKD populations, urinary albumin may be the first and only sign of kidney disease, making it a highly sensitive marker for the detection of CKD, particularly in its early stages.

The measurement of albuminuria is important in screening for early CKD. Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown a graded relationship between increased albuminuria and mortality and kidney outcomes in diverse study populations, in addition to and independent of low eGFR and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The KDIGO guidelines, as well as the EFLM European urinalysis guideline 2023, primarily recommend screening using quantitative albumin tests. However, the cost of laboratory-based quantitative methods and reimbursement restrictions (e.g. in Belgium) may hamper the routine use of quantitative urinary albumin by clinicians as a screening tool in the general population or even populations at risk, and thus, potentially leading to underdiagnosis of CKD. For example, in Spain, it was previously shown that urinary albumin is under requested to properly monitor patients with diabetes and arterial hypertension. Screening by test strip analysis is suggested in the guidelines, albeit with lower priority and without further details on the type of reading to be used for screening or with the suggestion to use the total protein read-out.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of test strip analysis as a cost-effective tool for screening albuminuria. Several studies have shown promising results in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of albuminuria. However, most of these studies were performed in cohorts in which known and unknown CKD patients were mixed or the CKD status was unknown. In the current study, we aimed to provide novel insights into the analytical performance of urine test strips as a screening tool for unknown CKD by comparing the performance of multiple test strip readouts in several patient cohorts, including a patient cohort not known to have CKD.

### How to measure proteinuria? [^114Riz3B]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the use of urine total protein compared with albumin measurements to assess and monitor patients with chronic kidney disease.

Recent Findings

Urine albumin or total protein-to-creatinine ratio measurements on a single-voided specimen provide a convenient and reliable alternative to 24-h urine measurements. The majority of studies that inform current renoprotective strategies have relied upon urine total protein measurements. Urine albumin measurements are required to detect microalbuminuria. The proportion of urinary protein composed of albumin is variable and may depend on the underlying renal disease.

Summary

Urine protein-to-creatinine measurements should continue to be used for the assessment and monitoring of patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. Urine albumin-to-creatinine measurements should be reserved for detecting microalbuminuria and monitoring patients with diabetic nephropathy. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between urine total protein and albumin in different renal diseases and to compare the prognostic significance of urine total protein with that of albumin.

### Diagnostic accuracy of urinary spot protein: creatinine ratio for proteinuria in hypertensive pregnant women: systematic review [^112P3vtP]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review the spot protein:creatinine ratio and albumin:creatinine ratio as diagnostic tests for significant proteinuria in hypertensive pregnant women.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Medline and Embase, the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and experts. Review methods Literature search (1980–2007) for articles of the spot protein:creatinine ratio or albumin:creatinine ratio in hypertensive pregnancy, with 24 hour proteinuria as the comparator.

Results

13 studies concerned the spot protein:creatinine ratio (1214 women with primarily gestational hypertension). Nine studies reported sensitivity and specificity for eight cut-off points, median 24 mg/mmol (range 17–57 mg/mmol; 0.15–0.50 mg/mg). Laboratory assays were not well described. Diagnostic test characteristics were recalculated for a cut-off point of 30 mg/mmol. No significant heterogeneity in cut-off points was found between studies over a range of proteinuria. Pooled values gave a sensitivity of 83.6% (95% confidence interval 77.5% to 89.7%), specificity of 76.3% (72.6% to 80.0%), positive likelihood ratio of 3.53 (2.83 to 4.49), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.21 (0.13 to 0.31) (nine studies, 1003 women). Two studies of the spot albumin:creatinine ratio (225 women) found optimal cut-off points of 2 mg/mmol for proteinuria of 0.3 g/day or more and 27 mg/mmol for albuminuria.

Conclusion

The spot protein:creatinine ratio is a reasonable "rule-out" test for detecting proteinuria of 0.3 g/day or more in hypertensive pregnancy. Information on use of the albumin:creatinine ratio in these women is insufficient.

### National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification [^111NhAoF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, poor outcomes, and high cost. Outcomes of chronic kidney disease include not only kidney failure but also complications of decreased kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that some of these adverse outcomes can be prevented or delayed by early detection and treatment. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part as a result of lack of agreement on a definition and classification of its stages of progression. Recent clinical practice guidelines by the National Kidney Foundation 1) define chronic kidney disease and classify its stages, regardless of underlying cause, 2) evaluate laboratory measurements for the clinical assessment of kidney disease, 3) associate the level of kidney function with complications of chronic kidney disease, and 4) stratify the risk for loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. The guidelines were developed by using an approach based on the procedure outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This paper presents the definition and five-stage classification system of chronic kidney disease and summarizes the major recommendations on early detection in adults. Recommendations include identifying persons at increased risk (those with diabetes, those with hypertension, those with a family history of chronic kidney disease, those older than 60 years of age, or those with U.S. racial or ethnic minority status), detecting kidney damage by measuring the albumin-creatinine ratio in untimed ("spot") urine specimens, and estimating the glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements by using prediction equations. Because of the high prevalence of early stages of chronic kidney disease in the general population (approximately 11% of adults), this information is particularly important for general internists and specialists.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^111AWASw]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) reflects urinary albumin excretion and is increasingly being accepted as an important clinical outcome predictor. Because of the great public health need for a simple and inexpensive test to identify individuals at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes, it has been suggested that the ACR might serve this purpose. We therefore determined whether the ACR could predict incident diabetes in a well-characterized cohort of pre-diabetic Americans.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 3,188 Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) participants with a mean BMI of 34 kg/m 2 and elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and baseline urinary albumin excretion measurements were followed for incident diabetes over a mean of 3.2 years.

RESULTS — Of the participants, 94% manifested ACR levels below the microalbuminuria range and 21% ultimately developed diabetes during follow-up. Quartiles of ACR (median [range] within quartiles: 1, 3.0 [0.7–3.7]; 2, 4.6 [3.7–5.5]; 3, 7.1 [5.5–9.7]; and 4, 16.5 [9.7–1,578]) were positively associated with age, markers of adiposity and insulin secretion and resistance, blood pressure, and use of antihypertensive agents with antiproteinuric effects and inversely related to male sex and serum creatinine. An elevated hazard rate for developing diabetes with doubling of ACR disappeared after adjustment for covariates. Within the DPP intervention groups (placebo, lifestyle, and metformin), we found no consistent trend in incident diabetes by quartile or decile of ACR.

CONCLUSIONS — An ACR at levels below the microalbuminuria range does not independently predict incident diabetes in adults at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

### Results from 16 years of quality surveillance of urine albumin to creatinine ratio testing for a national indigenous point-of-care testing program [^1172bPs9]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

The burden of chronic kidney disease in Indigenous Australians is 7.3 times higher than that of non-Indigenous Australians. If chronic kidney disease is detected early and managed, deterioration in kidney function can be reduced. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio is a key marker of early renal damage.

Objective —

To report on 16 years of analytic quality of urine albumin to creatinine ratio testing on Siemens DCA devices enrolled in the national Quality Assurance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Medical Services point-of-care testing program.

Design —

Quality Assurance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Medical Services participants are required to test 2 quality assurance samples each month across two 6-monthly testing cycles per year. Participants also test 2 quality control samples monthly.

Results —

The percentage of urine albumin, creatinine, and albumin to creatinine ratio results for quality assurance point-of-care testing that were within assigned allowable limits of performance averaged 96.9%, 95.9%, and 97.5%, respectively. The percentage acceptable quality control results for urine albumin and creatinine averaged 93.5% and 86.8%. The median imprecision for urine albumin, creatinine, and albumin to creatinine ratio quality assurance testing averaged 5.5%, 4.1%, and 3.3%, respectively, and the median within-site imprecision for quality control testing averaged 5.4%, 4.3%, and 5.7%, respectively, for the low sample and 4.0%, 4.1%, and 4.5%, respectively, for the high sample.

Conclusions —

For 16 years the DCA system has proven to be reliable and robust and operators at Aboriginal medical services have demonstrated they are able to conduct point-of-care testing for urine albumin to creatinine ratio that consistently meets analytic performance standards.

### A novel kidney disease index reflecting both the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate, predicted cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^113UDaB5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

The non-linear relationships and interactions noted above plus the fact that both the eGFR and albuminuria are prognostically relevant for future serious outcomes highlight the potential value of a metric that combines the information contained in both the eGFR and the ACR. The KDI is such a metric. Its linear relationship to the 3 outcomes illustrated in Fig. 1, its straightforward calculation, and the fact that its area under the receiver operating characteristics curve is similar to that of complicated models that include interactions and squared terms, highlight its possible utility as a simple prognostic marker for kidney outcomes as well as cardiovascular outcomes and death.

Strengths of these exploratory, post hoc analyses include the international nature of these data, the fact that the participants are similar to people with diabetes in the general population, the long-term follow-up, the high number of outcomes, the fact that all clinical outcomes were adjudicated, and consistent findings when the new index was applied to a different cohort from the ORIGIN trial. The absence of a central laboratory for the urine and serum measurements is a limitation common to many epidemiologic studies of kidney function that is mainly mitigated by the large sample size. These analyses are also limited by the fact that they were not prespecified, and the fact that they were conducted in middle-aged and older people with diabetes and additional cardiovascular risk factors who consented to participate in a long-term randomized controlled trial. They therefore may not be applicable other populations.

Clinical performance of the POC ACR

The central laboratory method identified 81 participants as having albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g) whilst the POC method, performed on the same day, identified 166 participants with albuminuria. No adverse events were reported during testing or collection. In total the POC reader misclassified 119 samples (17%) with 102 false positives, and 17 false negatives. Sensitivity of the POC ACR to detect albuminuria (ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) was 0.790 (95%CI; 0.689–0.865), and specificity was 0.835 (95%CI; 0.804–0.862). A positive likelihood ratio of 4.80 (95%CI; 3.86–5.89) and negative likelihood ratio of 0.25 (95%CI; 0.16–0.37) was obtained for POC ACR. Predictive values of 0.968 (95%CI; 0.952–0.979) for negative results and 0.386 (95%CI; 0.337–0.436) for positive results were obtained. Sensitivity and specificity to predict ACR > 300 mg/g was 1.00 (95%CI;0.664–1.00) and 0.987 (95%CI;0.975–0.994) respectively; with predictive values of 1.00 (95%CI; 0.995–1.00) for negative results and 0.50 (95%CI;0.343–0.657) for positive results.

Creatinine is produced by creatine and creatinine phosphate as a result of muscle metabolic processes. It is then excreted by glomerular filtration during normal renal function. Creatinine may be measured in both serum and urine. Creatinine measurement is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for other urinary analytes. Antibody to human albumin is covalently attached to derivatized polyacrylamide beads. The solid-phase antibody is reacted with a urine specimen, and the urine albumin-antigen complexes with the solid-phase antibody. This complex then reacts with fluorescein-labeled antibody. The unattached fluorescent antibody is then removed by washing during centrifugation. The fluorescence of the stable solid-phase antibody complex is determined with a fluorometer; the fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of urine albumin present. The standard curve is 0.

Creatinine measurement is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for other urinary analytes. In this enzymatic method creatinine is converted to creatine under the activity of creatininase. Creatine is then acted upon by creatinase to form sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine oxidase converts sarcosine to glycine and hydrogen peroxide, and the hydrogen peroxide reacts with chromophore in the presence of peroxidase to produce a color product that is measured at 546 nm.

### Value of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in pre-diabetic individuals [^115ibogz]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

With the explosive growth of incident diabetes, type 2 diabetes has become a major international public health challenge. Moreover, an increasing number of individuals have evidence of a pre-diabetic state, which indicates significant future risk of developing diabetes. Fortunately, accumulating evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented in individuals with pre-diabetes by either lifestyle modification or medication. However, because prevention is a fundamental public health goal, there is clearly a great need for effective strategies to identify high-risk individuals. Unfortunately, the best available risk stratification method is an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is both costly and difficult to perform in a clinical setting.

The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a single untimed urinary specimen is a reflection of urinary albumin excretion and is increasingly being accepted as a marker that predicts several important health outcomes, including hypertension, kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality. These associations have been observed throughout the biological range, even at levels far below those previously considered to be pathological (e.g. microalbuminuria).

The ACR is also closely linked to cardiometabolic risk factors, vascular disease, and insulin resistance and might therefore play a clinically important role in predicting future onset of diabetes. Observational studies have shown an association between ACR and other markers of urinary albumin excretion and incident diabetes. In addition, observations that proteinuria-reducing therapies (e.g. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) delay progression to diabetes also support this hypothesis, albeit indirectly. However, the observational studies were heterogeneous in terms of study design and risk for incident diabetes, did not include proteinuria throughout its biologic range, and/or recruited individuals from ethnic groups distinct from the general U.S. population. In addition, a randomized clinical trial did not find that ramipril, a proteinuria-reducing agent, altered the incidence of diabetes.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) enrolled a large and well-characterized cohort of adults who were at high-risk for developing diabetes based on having elevated fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. We tested the hypothesis that ACR, throughout its biological range, improves the prediction of future diabetes.

### Testing for microalbuminuria in 2002: barriers to implementing current guidelines [^114DP2zr]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Testing for microalbuminuria is recommended to detect early kidney damage in patients with diabetes or other diseases. However, few studies have examined laboratory practices for microalbuminuria testing in the general community.

Methods

In 2002, all laboratories in Montana and reference laboratories used by Montana laboratories for microalbuminuria measurement were surveyed by mail to ascertain if they provided testing for microalbuminuria, specific tests performed, and units and cutoff values used to report microalbuminuria results.

Results

One hundred three of 126 laboratories (82%) responded to the survey. Overall, 79% of laboratories offered quantitative testing for microalbuminuria, either on site or through a reference laboratory. Twenty-five laboratories (24%) surveyed provided quantitative testing for microalbuminuria on site. Only 14 of 23 laboratories offering albumin-creatinine ratios on site reported results in units and cutoff values consistent with current recommendations. Fewer laboratories provided 24-hour (6 of 17 laboratories) or other timed (2 of 7 laboratories) testing, and many of these laboratories did not report results using recommended units and cutoff values. Overall, only 11 of 25 laboratories (44%) with on-site testing reported microalbuminuria values from 1 or more types of specimens exclusively using recommended units and cutoff values.

Conclusion

Quantitative testing for microalbuminuria is not offered universally, and results often are reported in units and cutoff values that differ from current clinical recommendations.

### Impact of albumin-to-creatinine ratio point-of-care testing on the diagnosis and management of diabetic kidney disease [^115734m4]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

For the diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), quantitative albuminuria measurement using the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is recommended according to various guidelines. It can be measured either in specialized laboratories or using ACR point-of-care testing (POCT). This observational study aims at evaluating the effect of ACR POCT utilization on the DKD diagnosis and treatment management for glycemic control and blood pressure.

Method

Data of 717 patients with diabetes (type 1 diabetes: n = 236; type 2 diabetes: n = 463; other diabetes forms: n = 18) were assessed in three centers. The impact of ACR POCT on DKD diagnosis and treatment management for glycemic control and blood pressure was assessed using a case report form. The assessment of ACR POCT utilization purpose and relevance for physicians was documented using a questionnaire.

Results

Of all participants (n = 717), 39.1% had a confirmed/suspected DKD diagnosis. Hereof, 8.6% were newly diagnosed with DKD, and 9.9% were suspected with DKD based on the actual ACR POCT values. Within the group of patients with confirmed/suspected DKD (n = 280), treatment modification was performed in 46.1% of participants. A drug initiation with GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors was performed in 11.1% or 8.9% of patients with confirmed/suspected DKD, respectively. Regarding the utilization purposes of ACR POCT, 100% of the physicians (n = 8) indicated using it to examine patients with diabetes with or without hypertension; 75% considered it very important for patients with diabetes.

Conclusions

The implementation of ACR POCT may positively affect DKD diagnosis and subsequently allow better management of patients with diabetes.

### Urine albumin-creatinine ratio variability in people with type 2 diabetes: clinical and research implications [^115F1pHd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Evidence has demonstrated that albuminuria is a key diagnostic and prognostic marker of diabetic chronic kidney disease, but the impact of its day-to-day variability has not been adequately considered. This study quantified within-individual variability of albuminuria in people with type 2 diabetes to inform clinical albuminuria monitoring.

Study Design

Descriptive cross-sectional analysis.

Setting & Participants

People with type 2 diabetes (n = 826, 67.1 [IQR, 60.3–72.4] years, 64.9% male) participating in the Progression of Diabetic Complications (PREDICT) cohort study.

Exposure

Four spot urine collections for measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) within 4 weeks.

Outcome

Variability of UACR.

Analytical Approach

We characterized within-individual variability (coefficient of variation [CV], 95% limits of random variation, intraclass correlation coefficient), developed a calculator displaying probabilities that any observed difference between a pair of UACR values truly exceeded a 30% difference, and estimated the ranges of diagnostic uncertainty to inform a need for additional UACR collections to exclude or confirm albuminuria. Multiple linear regression examined factors influencing UACR variability.

Results

We observed high within-individual variability (CV 48.8%; 95% limits of random variation showed a repeated UACR to be as high/low as 3.78/0.26 times the first). If a single-collection UACR increased from 2 to 5mg/mmol, the probability that UACR actually increased by at least 30% was only 50%, rising to 97% when 2 collections were obtained at each time point. The ranges of diagnostic uncertainty were 2.0–4.0mg/mmol after an initial UACR test, narrowing to 2.4–3.2 and 2.7–2.9mg/mmol for the mean of 2 and 3 collections, respectively. Some factors correlated with higher (female sex; moderately increased albuminuria) or lower (reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker treatment) within-individual UACR variability.

Limitations

Reliance on the mean of 4 UACR collections as the reference standard for albuminuria.

Conclusions

UACR demonstrates a high degree of within-individual variability among individuals with type 2 diabetes. Multiple urine collections for UACR may improve capacity to monitor changes over time in clinical and research settings but may not be necessary for the diagnosis of albuminuria.

Plain-Language Summary

Albuminuria (albumin in urine) is a diagnostic and prognostic marker of diabetic chronic kidney disease. However, albuminuria can vary within an individual from day to day. We compared 4 random spot urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) samples from 826 participants. We found that a second UACR collection may be as small as a fourth or as large as almost 4 times the first sample's UACR level. This high degree of variability presents a challenge to our ability to interpret changes in albuminuria. Multiple collections have been suggested as a solution. We have constructed tools that may aid clinicians in deciding how many urine collections are required to monitor and diagnose albuminuria. Multiple urine collections may be required for individual monitoring but not necessarily for diagnosis.

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

Albuminuria testing in diabetes — diagnosis confirmation and risk thresholds note that confirmation is necessary to establish the diagnosis of DKD or CKD in DM, that a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of > 300 mg/g indicates greater damage and greater risk for progression to kidney failure and development of CKD complications such as anemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and infections, and that sudden onset or rapidly increasing albuminuria should prompt additional testing to assess for other types of kidney disease.

### Albumin to creatinine ratio: a screening test with limitations [^115fbVC4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to assess the effects of age on (1) the ability of a spot albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) to accurately predict 24-hour albumin excretion rate (AER), and (2) the performance of spot ACR as a screening test for microalbuminuria. Three hundred fourteen patients with diabetes aged 18 to 84 years attending a tertiary outpatient clinic underwent one 24-hour urine collection and, immediately after completion, provided one fasting spot morning urine sample. Twenty-four-hour AER and spot ACR were determined. Performance of spot ACR was assessed according to age and sex. Fifty-three percent of men and 32% of women had an AER of 20 microg/min or greater. Multiple regression analysis showed age was an independent predictor of spot ACR. For an AER of 20 microg/min for patients in the age range of 40 to 80 years, there was an increase in corresponding values for spot ACR from 18.2 mg/g (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.6 to 21.3) to 32.5 mg/g (95% CI, 27.5 to 38.4) in men and from 22.1 mg/g (95% CI, 18.0 to 27.1) to 56.4 mg/g (95% CI, 47.2 to 67.4) in women. Using ACR cutoff values of 22.1 mg/g or greater and 30.9 mg/g or greater in conventional units (equivalent to ≥ 2.5 and ≥ 3.5 mg/mmol in SI units) in men and women, the spot ACR provided high sensitivities (men, 95.7%; women, 93.35%) and had excellent receiver operator characteristic curves, respectively. However, the spot ACR false-positive rate increased with age from 15.9% (age, 40 to 65 years) to 31.8% (> 65 years) in men and from 10.5% (age, 45 to 65 years) to 28.3% (> 65 years) in women. Spot ACR is a good screening test for microalbuminuria, but a poor predictor of quantitative AER, and should not be used as a diagnostic test. The increase in spot ACR relative to 24-hour AER with age supports the use of sex- and age-adjusted ACR cutoff values.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112bBHEU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

### Diagnostic performance of random urine samples using albumin concentration vs ratio of albumin to creatinine for microalbuminuria screening in patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HQ7aW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

A random urine sample measuring the albumin concentration (UAC) without simultaneously measuring the urinary creatinine is less expensive than measuring the ratio of albumin to creatinine (ACR), but comparisons of their diagnostic performance for microalbuminuria screening among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have not been undertaken in previous meta-analyses.

Objective

To compare the diagnostic performance of the UAC vs the ACR in random urine samples for microalbuminuria screening among patients with DM.

Data Sources

Electronic literature searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus for English-language publications from the earliest available date of indexing through July 31, 2012.

Study Selection

Clinical studies assessing the UAC or the ACR of random urine samples in detecting the presence of microalbuminuria among patients with DM using a urinary albumin excretion rate of 30 to 300 mg/d in 24-hour timed urine collections as the criterion standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Bivariate random-effects models for analysis and pooling of the diagnostic performance measures across studies, as well as comparisons between different screening tests.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the diagnostic performance measures of the UAC or the ACR in random urine samples, as well as comparisons between them.

Results

We identified 14 studies, with a total of 2078 patients; 9 studies reported on the UAC, and 12 studies reported on the ACR. Meta-analysis showed pooled sensitivities of 0.85 and 0.87 for the UAC and the ACR, respectively, and pooled specificities of 0.88 and 0.88, respectively. No differences in sensitivity (P = 0.70), specificity (P = 0.63), or diagnostic odds ratios (P = 0.59) between the UAC and the ACR were found. The time point of urine collection did not affect the diagnostic performance of either test.

Conclusions and Relevance

The UAC and the ACR yielded high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of microalbuminuria. Because the diagnostic performance of the UAC is comparable to that of the ACR, our findings indicate that the UAC of random urine samples may become the screening tool of choice for the population with DM, considering the rising incidence of DM and the constrained health care resources in many countries.

### Conversion of urine protein-creatinine ratio or urine dipstick protein to urine albumin-creatinine ratio for use in chronic kidney disease screening and prognosis: an individual participant-based meta-analysis [^113ETzN7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although measuring albuminuria is the preferred method for defining and staging chronic kidney disease (CKD), total urine protein or dipstick protein is often measured instead.

Objective

To develop equations for converting urine protein-creatinine ratio (PCR) and dipstick protein to urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and to test their diagnostic accuracy in CKD screening and staging.

Design

Individual participant-based meta-analysis.

Setting

12 research and 21 clinical cohorts.

Participants

919 383 adults with same-day measures of ACR and PCR or dipstick protein.

Measurements

Equations to convert urine PCR and dipstick protein to ACR were developed and tested for purposes of CKD screening (ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) and staging (stage A2: ACR of 30 to 299 mg/g; stage A3: ACR ≥ 300 mg/g).

Results

Median ACR was 14 mg/g (25th to 75th percentile of cohorts, 5 to 25 mg/g). The association between PCR and ACR was inconsistent for PCR values less than 50 mg/g. For higher PCR values, the PCR conversion equations demonstrated moderate sensitivity (91%, 75%, and 87%) and specificity (87%, 89%, and 98%) for screening (ACR > 30 mg/g) and classification into stages A2 and A3, respectively. Urine dipstick categories of trace or greater, trace to +, and ++ for screening for ACR values greater than 30 mg/g and classification into stages A2 and A3, respectively, had moderate sensitivity (62%, 36%, and 78%) and high specificity (88%, 88%, and 98%). For individual risk prediction, the estimated 2-year 4-variable kidney failure risk equation using predicted ACR from PCR had discrimination similar to that of using observed ACR.

Limitation

Diverse methods of ACR and PCR quantification were used; measurements were not always performed in the same urine sample.

Conclusion

Urine ACR is the preferred measure of albuminuria; however, if ACR is not available, predicted ACR from PCR or urine dipstick protein may help in CKD screening, staging, and prognosis.

### The diagnostic accuracy of a urine albumin-creatinine ratio point-of-care test for detection of albuminuria in primary care [^114dBjMk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Albuminuria is an important sign of chronic kidney disease and is detected routinely by measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR). A Siemens CLINITEK test designed for use at the point of care is available that can semiquantitatively measure ACR.

Study Design

Diagnostic accuracy study evaluating a urinary ACR point-of-care test.

Setting & Participants

The semiquantitative ACR test was evaluated at the point of care in a representative primary care population (those with or at increased risk of chronic kidney disease) of 642 patients under standard operational conditions and compared with the reference standard of ACR measurement in the clinical laboratory.

Index Test

The point-of-care CLINITEK semiquantitative ACR test. This test uses dye-binding and catalytic assays for albumin and creatinine, respectively, on a Microalbumin 9 strip, which is read by the CLINITEK Status Analyzer, and ACR is calculated automatically.

Reference Test

Laboratory measurement of albumin and creatinine on an Abbott Architect analyzer by immunoturbidimetric and enzymatic assays, respectively, and calculation of ACR.

Results

The prevalence of albuminuria (laboratory ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) in the study population was 20.2%. Sensitivity and specificity of the point-of-care test for detecting albuminuria were 83.2% and 80.0%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 51.2% and 95.0%, respectively; positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.16 and 0.21, respectively. Twenty-three (3.6%) samples measured at the point of care were not analyzed in the central laboratory for a variety of reasons, including laboratory reception data entry errors.

Limitations

Our sensitivity calculation is accurate to an approximately 8% CI.

Conclusions

The instrument-read reagent strip test was a poor rule-in test for albuminuria at the point of care, as evidenced by the low positive predictive value, but was a reasonable rule-out test. Observed sensitivity was lower than reported in earlier laboratory-based studies. This decreased diagnostic accuracy needs to be balanced against the potential advantages of a point-of-care testing approach.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116tVsFs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria and proteinuria assessment in HIV-infected persons — detection of albuminuria or proteinuria is the most common method of detecting kidney damage, and KDIGO guidelines recommend albuminuria as the preferred marker for staging CKD. Urine dipstick provides a semiquantitative measure but can substantially underestimate or overestimate true protein excretion depending on hydration status. Twenty-four–hour urine collections are the reference standard for measuring urinary excretion of albumin or protein; the adequacy of a 24-hour collection can be assessed against expected creatinine excretion of 20–25 and 15–20 mg/kg/day in men and women, respectively. The most clinically useful methods for quantifying excretion are the albumin-to-creatinine and the protein-to-creatinine ratios performed on random urine samples; albumin-to-creatinine ratios from random samples (ideally first morning) correlate closely with 24-hour collections. On average, humans excrete approximately 1 g of creatinine in the urine each day, so albumin or protein to creatinine ratios correspond to total daily excretion.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^112CrwN8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Urine albumin reporting and terminology — reporting albumin or total protein as a ratio to urine creatinine helps account for concentration variability in spot samples, but direct conversion from albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) to albumin excretion rate (AER) is cautioned: "Assuming a creatinine excretion of 1 g/d, an ACR of 1,000 mg/g would translate to an albumin excretion rate (AER) of 1,000 mg/d. However, this assumption is not correct". Implementation notes that "Clinicians may be resistant to switching from urine protein to urine albumin", and the commentary states, "we endorse the elimination of 'microalbuminuria' and 'macroalbuminuria' from the diagnostic testing lexicon".

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1175ZuJn]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected on less accurate methods:

- confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (quantify the albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio if initial semiquantitative tests are positive)

- confirm albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the urine sample.

### Diagnostic accuracy of spot urinary protein and albumin to creatinine ratios for detection of significant proteinuria or adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with suspected pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1126ZMbV]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical application

When considering the most appropriate diagnostic threshold for a test in practice, one must consider the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that relates to threshold. What is acceptable in clinical practice will be determined by the place of the test in the management pathway (such as add-on, triage, or replacement) and the nature of the disease. When considering pre-eclampsia, one would wish a replacement test (stand alone) to limit the number of false negative results, as these women run the risk of developing undetected pre-eclampsia with a risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Women with false positive results will be subjected to increased monitoring and possibly pre-term delivery. Thus, protein to creatinine ratio as a replacement test would ideally use a threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity. If protein to creatinine ratio were to be used as a triage test, with patients who test positive going on to have a 24 hour urine collection to verify the significant proteinuria, then false negatives need to be minimised but false positives will be identified by the second test, so sensitivity can be maximised at the expense of specificity. Our results can be used to determine the most appropriate threshold for each of these situations.

The findings from the multivariate meta-analysis relate to the accuracy of protein to creatinine ratio at the summary level (that is, averaged across all studies). Considerable heterogeneity exists at any threshold for which two or more studies provide evidence, so the performance of protein to creatinine ratio in an individual study setting may be somewhat different from the summary results presented here. Further research needs to identify the causes of heterogeneity in test accuracy across studies (for example, method of measurement, inaccurate reference standards) and identify those circumstances in which protein to creatinine ratio performs consistently well.

Prevalence of proteinuria also varied considerably across studies and has a big effect on how a protein to creatinine ratio test could be used. Following the protein to creatinine test, high positive and negative predictive values above 0.85 are achieved when the prevalence is high (for example, 0.8; see appendix E). However, when the prevalence is low (for example, 0.2; see appendix C), the negative predictive value remains above 0.85 but positive predictive value is then around 0.4. Thus a negative protein to creatinine ratio remains a good test for ruling out significant proteinuria, but positive tests results may have a high rate of false positives in this low prevalence population. Clinicians thus need to know the prevalence of significant proteinuria in the population and setting under investigation to allow accurate interpretation of the test results

Point of care testing

The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline endorses point of care testing (POCT) for creatinine measurements given the convenience associated with this in some settings, and place less value on the diagnostic accuracy. Given the need to improve the rate of detection of CKD in the community, even in Europe where most health systems are relatively robust, POCT may be an important tool to improve the rates of case finding. POCT for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) may be similarly convenient and would permit more complete CKD staging in appropriately selected individuals.

The key practice points from the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline are summarized in Table 1. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of POCT devices for creatinine and uACR is beyond the scope of this article, but as discussed in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, it is important to highlight the potential drawbacks especially in regions where resources may permit more accurate testing. Given the relevant concerns regarding accuracy of the various devices for both creatinine and albuminuria, the potential benefits and harms should be considered and individualized. As with any test it is important that the test is performed when indicated, in patients at risk of CKD. Importantly, a diagnosis of CKD cannot be made on single testing and must be confirmed through nephrology consultation of suspicion of advanced CKD or repeat testing in individuals with higher eGFR and/or lower levels of albuminuria.

Table 1:
KDIGO practice points on POCT for kidney function.

The potential benefits of POCT, as outlined in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, include the convenience for the patient and the rapidity of obtaining the test result, which permit testing in non-clinical environments (nursing homes, remote areas). For individuals, the convenience may outweigh the concerns about accuracy. In children, the tiny volume of blood required may be an additional advantage, especially if used for follow-up testing once a diagnosis is established. The improved accuracy below an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 improved the value of POCT for those who most require a rapid diagnosis.

POCT may, however, be associated with potential harms, including overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis related to the accuracy concerns. These may differ between devices. The tendency of POCT for creatinine to 'overdiagnose' CKD stage may be beneficial from a clinical perspective in terms of fewer missed cases, however overdiagnosis may cause unnecessary anxiety in some patients. It is important that clinical guidelines and/or referral pathways are in place to ensure appropriate follow-up and management.

### Assessing proteinuria in chronic kidney disease: protein-creatinine ratio versus albumin-creatinine ratio [^111hKcKx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Quantification of proteinuria is important in the assessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal test to identify significant proteinuria.

Methods

We retrospectively assessed the relationship between total protein:creatinine ratio (TPCR), albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and 24-h urine total protein in 6842 patients with CKD focusing on performance at thresholds of 0.5 and 1 g/day of proteinuria.

Results

The relationship between ACR and TPCR is non-linear. TPCR is highly correlated with 24-h urine protein (Spearman's rho = 0.91), though ACR also performs well (rho = 0.84). Using receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis, TPCR outperforms ACR at predicting 0.5 g/day [area under the curve (AUC) 0.967 vs 0.951, P < 0.001] and 1 g/day of proteinuria (AUC 0.968 vs 0.947, P = 0.004). A TPCR threshold of 100 mg/mmol had a higher sensitivity (94% vs 79%) but lower specificity (88% vs 95%) than an ACR of 70 mg/mmol to predict 1 g/day of total proteinuria. To achieve comparable sensitivity, the ACR threshold falls to 17.5 mg/mmol, with lower specificity than TPCR (69.8%). Sensitivity of TPCR rose with increasing age, and in females: to achieve 95% sensitivity in a man < 49 years, requires a TPCR of 65 mg/mmol, compared to 179 mg/mmol in a woman > 79 years. Non-albumin proteinuria was a lower proportion of total proteinuria in patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockade than in those who were not (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

TPCR is a more sensitive screening test than ACR to predict clinically relevant proteinuria. The diagnostic performance of both tests varies substantially with age and gender, and should be taken into consideration when interpreting results. Total proteinuria cannot be adequately predicted from ACR, and our results suggest that caution is appropriate before utilizing ACR in patients with non-diabetic CKD.

Point-of-care testing (POCT) for creatinine and urine albumin: We suggest that point-of-care testing may be used for creatinine and urine albumin measurement where access to a laboratory is limited or providing a test at the point-of-care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C). Whenever a POCT device is used for creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the same preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteria relating to the specimen collection and performance of the device, including external quality assessment, and the interpretation of the result is used. Where a POCT device for creatinine testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR and use the equation consistent with that used within the region.

### Strengths and weaknesses of renal markers as risk factors and surrogate markers [^114xsVRK]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The reports of associations between albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate and mortality are a major advance in understanding the progression of renal disease and its sequelae. These findings reinforce the importance of population risk profiling. However, application is limited by validity concerns due to substantial unexplained heterogeneity in many meta-analyses. Application to treatment decisions is premature given insufficient analysis of randomized trials of the association of by-arm differences in laboratory measures and by-arm differences in patient-relevant outcomes.
