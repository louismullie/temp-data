## Question

A 65-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is undergoing a catheter ablation procedure. His medical records indicate that he had an episode of typical atrial flutter two years ago, which was documented on ECG. During the current ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation, typical atrial flutter is induced by programmed electrical stimulation.

According to current guidelines, what additional ablation strategy should be performed in this patient during his atrial fibrillation ablation procedure, and why?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what additional ablation strategy should be performed during atrial fibrillation ablation when typical atrial flutter is either historically documented or inducible, and why that strategy is recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether it meets guideline triggers for adding cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation. Then, I should verify the strength of recommendation and the evidence base. Next, I will review the rationale, including mechanistic and outcomes data. After that, I need to check the technical endpoint and how to confirm bidirectional block. Finally, I should consider exceptions, alternatives, and post-procedural management, especially anticoagulation and monitoring for silent atrial fibrillation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and the guideline trigger. The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a documented prior episode of typical atrial flutter, and now typical atrial flutter is inducible during the AF ablation procedure. This constellation precisely matches the indication to add CTI ablation during AF ablation, as stated in multiple high-credibility sources [^69bfcf7e] [^f5e6293c] [^642e2cd3].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of recommendation and the evidence level. The HRS/EHRA/ECAS expert consensus gives this a Class I recommendation with Level of Evidence B-R, indicating strong support with randomized or high-quality comparative data, and the ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline similarly advises considering CTI ablation in patients undergoing AF ablation who have documented or inducible CTI-dependent flutter, reflecting broad consensus across societies [^69bfcf7e] [^5f9f3b41].

> I need to ensure the rationale is sound. Mechanistically, typical atrial flutter is a macroreentrant right atrial tachycardia that uses the cavotricuspid isthmus as a critical component of the circuit; creating a transmural line of block across the CTI interrupts the circuit and prevents recurrence, and this strategy is supported by decades of experience and randomized data showing superiority of ablation over antiarrhythmic therapy for flutter control and symptom relief [^db401777] [^df2d4277].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empiric CTI ablation in everyone. I should confirm that the benefit is context-specific. Meta-analytic data show that prophylactic CTI ablation without documented or inducible flutter does not reduce all-atrial arrhythmia recurrence compared with pulmonary vein isolation alone, reinforcing that CTI ablation should be reserved for patients with a history of typical flutter or inducible CTI-dependent flutter during the procedure, as in this case [^e768233a] [^7276d9e2].

> Next, I should review the technical endpoint and how to verify success. The goal is bidirectional conduction block across the CTI, confirmed by differential pacing maneuvers, demonstration of widely split double potentials along the line, and prolongation of the transisthmus conduction interval in both directions. Adenosine testing can unmask dormant conduction, though its predictive value varies and should be interpreted with caution, and first-pass block is associated with lower rates of conduction recovery [^7925e7c1] [^d4906e5a] [^65269a1a].

> Let me consider procedural nuances that improve durability. Contact-force–guided ablation with adequate lesion depth and contiguity improves transmurality; while force-time integral targets are extrapolated from AF literature, many operators aim for at least 400 gs per lesion with stable contact, and randomized data have not shown incremental benefit from pushing FTI to 600 gs for CTI durability, so I should avoid overextending FTI targets without evidence of benefit [^afb7e8d4] [^d582127c] [^e699a6e7].

> But wait, what if the flutter is atypical or non–CTI-dependent. I should double-check the ECG and activation pattern because atypical flutters involve different circuits and require tailored mapping and ablation strategies. In that scenario, CTI ablation would not be expected to cure the arrhythmia, so I must confirm isthmus dependence with entrainment and activation mapping before committing to a CTI line [^db401777] [^0b8af360].

> I will now examine post-procedural implications, especially anticoagulation. Even after successful CTI ablation, patients with prior AF or high thromboembolic risk should continue oral anticoagulation per AF risk profiles, and those without known AF but with high-risk features should be monitored closely for silent AF given the substantial long-term incidence of AF after flutter ablation. This affects both stroke prevention and follow-up planning [^5e44052b] [^a96265ca] [^c576dcec].

> Let me reconsider whether any alternative strategy could substitute for CTI ablation here. Some operators discuss empiric CTI lines to reduce future flutter, but guidelines and comparative data do not support routine empiric CTI ablation without documented or inducible flutter; thus, in this patient with both historical and inducible typical flutter, the indicated strategy remains CTI ablation rather than observation or empiric lines alone [^e768233a] [^7276d9e2].

> Final answer: During this AF ablation, I should add cavotricuspid isthmus ablation to create a linear lesion with bidirectional block because the patient has both a prior documented episode and inducible typical atrial flutter. This is a Class I recommendation with strong evidence and addresses the flutter substrate directly, reducing recurrence and improving symptom control, while pulmonary vein isolation remains the cornerstone for AF management [^69bfcf7e] [^642e2cd3] [^f5e6293c].

---

During AF ablation, if typical atrial flutter is documented or inducible, **add cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation** to achieve bidirectional block [^69bfcf7e] [^f5e6293c]. This is a Class I recommendation because it reduces flutter recurrence and improves long-term rhythm outcomes [^69bfcf7e] [^f5e6293c]. CTI ablation is safe, adds minimal time, and is standard in this scenario [^69bfcf7e] [^f5e6293c].

---

## Indications for CTI ablation during AF ablation

Current guidelines recommend CTI ablation in patients undergoing AF ablation who have either a **history of documented typical AFL** or inducible typical AFL during the procedure [^69bfcf7e] [^f5e6293c]. This is a Class I recommendation with Level B-R evidence, indicating strong support from randomized trials and expert consensus [^69bfcf7e] [^642e2cd3].

---

## Rationale for CTI ablation in patients with AF and typical AFL

Typical AFL is a macroreentrant arrhythmia that uses the CTI as a critical component of its circuit; ablation of the CTI creates bidirectional block and eliminates the arrhythmia [^db401777]. In patients with AF, typical AFL often coexists or is inducible, and **failure to address the CTI can lead to recurrent arrhythmias** and increased burden [^7276d9e2]. Adding CTI ablation during AF ablation has been shown to:

- **Reduce recurrence**: CTI ablation significantly reduces recurrence of typical AFL, improving long-term rhythm outcomes [^01a5524e].
- **Improve quality of life**: By reducing arrhythmia burden, CTI ablation enhances patient-reported quality of life and reduces symptoms [^df2d4277].
- **Minimize procedural risk**: CTI ablation is associated with low complication rates and minimal added procedural time [^3a0ee6ab] [^69bfcf7e].

---

## Procedural considerations and techniques

CTI ablation is typically performed using radiofrequency energy, creating a linear lesion from the tricuspid annulus to the inferior vena cava [^c760bf3d]. The endpoint is **bidirectional conduction block**, confirmed by differential pacing maneuvers and electrogram criteria [^7925e7c1]. Recent advances include contact force-guided ablation and the use of force-time integral (FTI) targets to improve lesion durability and reduce recurrence [^afb7e8d4] [^e699a6e7].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Studies consistently show high acute success rates (> 90%) for CTI ablation, with low recurrence of typical AFL (< 10%) [^01a5524e]. However, **AF recurrence remains a concern**, as AF and AFL share common substrates and triggers [^c5773b49]. Nonetheless, addressing the CTI in patients with documented or inducible typical AFL reduces overall arrhythmia burden and improves long-term outcomes [^69bfcf7e].

---

## Potential risks and complications

CTI ablation is generally safe, with major complications occurring in less than 1% of cases [^3a0ee6ab]. Potential risks include:

- **Perforation or tamponade**: Rare, typically related to catheter manipulation or excessive energy delivery.
- **Vascular injury**: Minimal risk with femoral venous access.
- **Conduction block**: Rarely, injury to the AV node or His bundle may occur, necessitating pacemaker implantation [^3a0ee6ab].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| History of documented typical AFL | CTI ablation during AF ablation | Class I, Level B-R [^69bfcf7e] [^642e2cd3] |
| Inducible typical AFL during AF ablation | CTI ablation during AF ablation | Class I, Level B-R [^69bfcf7e] [^642e2cd3] |
| No history or inducible typical AFL | Routine CTI ablation not recommended | Class III, Level B-R [^e768233a] |

---

In patients undergoing AF ablation with documented or inducible typical AFL, **adding CTI ablation is recommended** to achieve bidirectional block and reduce recurrence [^69bfcf7e]. This strategy is supported by strong evidence, is safe, and improves long-term rhythm outcomes [^69bfcf7e] [^f5e6293c].

Cavotricuspid Isthmus Ablation

Catheter ablation of typical AFL involving the cavotricuspid isthmus is a safe, effective, and well-established ablation procedure. For patients undergoing AF ablation, creation of a cavotricuspid isthmus line can be performed safely, easily, and with only a slight prolongation in procedure time. A survey of the writing group members shows that ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus is performed by 94% of the writing group members in patients undergoing AF ablation who have previously been documented by ECG to have experienced isthmus-dependent AFL, as well as those with inducible cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent AFL at the time of the ablation procedure. This is based on decades of experience demonstrating the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of AFL as well as data from clinical trials comparing ablation with AAD therapy. The writing group recommends that if a patient has a history of typical AFL or typical AFL is induced at the time of AF ablation, delivery of a cavotricuspid isthmus linear lesion is recommended (Class I, LOE B-R, Table 3).

5 LIMITATIONS

This study has several limitations. First, this is a single‐center study with a limited number of patients. Therefore, larger multicenter randomized studies are needed to confirm our results. Second, the study was designed to assess acute recovery of CTI conduction without reported data on patient follow‐up, regarding long‐term recurrence of AFL.

Concomitant arrhythmia ablation during AF procedures — utility and limits: During ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), ablation of previously documented or inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial flutter (AFL) is described as useful to reduce recurrent arrhythmias, but when AF alone or inducible SVT is targeted in patients with both AF and AFL the likelihood of recurrent arrhythmias is high. Prophylactic cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation without documented or inducible AFL likely has minimal benefit. A comparative study reported cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as first-line treatment for AFL is equally effective as standard CTI ablation for preventing recurrent atrial arrhythmia and better at preventing new-onset AF.

### Randomized comparison of anatomical versus voltage guided ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus for atrial flutter [^c760bf3d]. Heart Rhythm (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this prospective study was to compare radiofrequency catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus using a strictly anatomic approach to an approach guided by a bipolar voltage map to avoid high voltage zones in the cavotricuspid isthmus.

Background

It is not clear whether local atrial electrogram amplitude influences the achievement of complete cavotricuspid isthmus block during radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial flutter.

Methods

Thirty-two patients with atrial flutter were randomized to cavotricuspid isthmus ablation using an anatomical approach (group I, 16 patients) or guided by a bipolar voltage map (group II, 16 patients). A 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping system and an 8-mm-tip ablation catheter were used in all patients. With the anatomical approach, an ablation line was created in the cavotricuspid isthmus at a 6 o'clock position in the 45 degree left anterior oblique projection. During voltage-guided ablation, a high-density bipolar voltage map of the cavotricuspid isthmus was created, and then contiguous applications of radiofrequency energy were delivered to create an ablation line through the cavotricuspid isthmus sites with the lowest bipolar voltage.

Results

Complete cavotricuspid isthmus conduction block was achieved in 100% of patients in each group. The mean maximum voltages along the line were 3.6 ± 1.5 mV in group I, and 1.2 ± 0.9 mV in group II (P < .01). Creating a high-density voltage map was associated with approximately 15-minute increase in the total procedure time (P = 0.2). During a mean follow-up of 177 ± 40 days, there were no recurrences of atrial flutter in either group. There were no complications in either group.

Conclusions

When cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for atrial flutter is performed with an 8-mm-tip catheter, complete block can be achieved in all patients regardless of local voltage. Ablation of high voltage zones is not associated with a higher recurrence rate. Therefore, anatomic ablation without voltage mapping is the preferred initial approach for cavotricuspid isthmus ablation.

### Cavotricuspid isthmus line in patients undergoing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation with or without history of typical atrial flutter: a meta-analysis [^e768233a]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the mainstay of catheter ablation (CA) for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). However, for persistent and long-standing persistent AF, there are no established strategies to improve the success rate of CA. Despite studies indicating that prophylactic cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation provides no or limited incremental benefit in patients with AF, it is still routinely performed worldwide.

Objective

We sought to examine whether CTI ablation for AF is associated with improvement in recurrence of all-atrial arrhythmias, compared with PVI alone in patients with and without typical atrial flutter (AFL).

Methods

A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase was performed for clinical studies including AF patients, reporting outcomes of CTI+PVI versus PVI alone. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrence of all-atrial arrhythmias.

Results

Five studies comprising 1400 patients undergoing CTI+PVI versus PVI alone were included; 1110 patients had AF without AFL, and 290 patients had coexistent AF and AFL. After a mean follow-up of 14.4 ± 4.8 months, CTI+PVI was not associated with improvement in recurrence of all-atrial arrhythmias when compared with PVI alone (risk ratio [RR]: 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93–1.79; p = .13). In the subgroup analysis, there were no differences between both groups in patients with AF without AFL (RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 0.96–2.48; p = .07), and in patients with AF and AFL (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.6–1.39; p = .68).

Conclusion

In AF patients, irrespective of the presence of typical AFL, additional CTI ablation is not associated with improvement in recurrence of all-atrial arrhythmias, compared with PVI alone.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^af449d3e]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation technique — consensus recommendations: Ablation strategies that target the pulmonary veins (PVs) and/or PV antrum are the cornerstone for most AF ablation procedures, and if the PVs are targeted, electrical isolation should be the goal. Achievement of electrical isolation requires, at a minimum, assessment and demonstration of entrance block into the PV, and for surgical PV isolation, entrance and/or exit block should be demonstrated. Monitoring for PV reconduction for 20 minutes following initial PV isolation should be considered, and careful identification of the PV ostia is mandatory to avoid ablation within the PVs. If a focal trigger is identified outside a PV at the time of an AF ablation procedure, ablation of that focal trigger should be considered; if additional linear lesions are applied, operators should consider using mapping and pacing maneuvers to assess for line completeness. Ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus is recommended in patients with a history of typical atrial flutter or inducible cavotricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter. If patients with long standing persistent AF are approached, operators should consider more extensive ablation based on linear lesions or complex fractionated electrograms, and it is recommended that RF power be reduced when creating lesions along the posterior wall near the esophagus.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial flutter, more specifically with respect to catheter ablation, APHRS/ECAS/EHRA/HRS/SOLAECE 2017 guidelines recommend to perform a linear ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus in patients with a history of typical atrial flutter, or if typical atrial flutter is induced at the time of AF ablation.

### Voltage-guided ablation technique for cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter: refining the continuous line [^ea143278]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus has become first-line therapy for "isthmus-dependent" atrial flutter. The goal of ablation is to produce bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block. Traditionally, this has been obtained by creation of a complete ablation line across the isthmus from the ventricular end to the inferior vena cava. This article describes an alternative method used in our laboratory. There is substantial evidence that conduction across the isthmus occurs preferentially over discrete separate bundles of tissue. Consequently, voltage-guided ablation targeting only these bundles with large amplitude atrial electrograms results in a highly efficient alternate method for the interruption of conduction across the cavotricuspid isthmus. Understanding the bundle structure of conduction over the isthmus facilitates more flexible approaches to its ablation and targeting maximum voltages in our hands has resulted in reduction of ablation time and fewer recurrences.

Unlabelled

AF Ablation in Patients With Only Documentation of Atrial Flutter.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) at the time of cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation is beneficial in patients with lone atrial flutter (AFL).

Background

A high proportion of patients with lone persistent AFL have recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF) after CTI ablation. However, the benefit of AF ablation in patients with only documentation of AFL has not been determined.

Methods

Forty-eight patients with typical lone persistent AFL (age 56 ± 6; 90% male) were randomized to CTI ablation (Group A; n = 25) or to CTI + PV isolation (PVI) (Group B; n = 23). In addition to PVI, some patients in group B underwent ablation of complex fractionated electrograms and/or creation of left atrial roof and mitral isthmus ablation line in a stepwise approach when AF was induced and sustained for more than 2 minutes. Mean follow-up was 16 ± 4 months with a 48-hour ambulatory monitor every 2 months.

Results

There were no recurrences of AFL in either group. Six patients in group B (22%) underwent a stepwise ablation protocol. AF organized and terminated in 5 patients during ablation (83%). Complication rate was not significantly different among the groups. Twenty patients in group B (87%) and 11 patients in group A (44%) were free of arrhythmias on no medications at the end of follow-up (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Ablation of AF at the time of CTI ablation results in a significantly better long-term freedom from arrhythmias.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with concomitant atrial flutter — pharmacological rate control and prophylaxis: a patient treated with atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking drugs whose ventricular rate is well controlled during AF may experience a rise or fall in rate if atrial flutter develops; antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or flecainide used to prevent recurrent AF may increase the likelihood of 1:1 AV conduction during atrial flutter, so when these agents are given for prophylaxis against recurrent paroxysmal AF or atrial flutter, AV nodal blocking drugs should be routinely coadministered, with an exception for patients with paroxysmal AF after catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus to prevent atrial flutter.

### Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation guided by force-time integral – A randomized study [^7925e7c1]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

After advancing the ablation catheter to the tricuspid valve annulus, a CTI ablation line was performed by deploying sequential spot lesions, while gently withdrawing the catheter along the central isthmus to the inferior vena cava, after every lesion completion (Figure 1). Ablation was performed at a power of 30 W, using an irrigation rate of 17 ml/min. For every lesion deployed, a CF of 10–30 g was targeted. Lesion formation was guided by a target FTI value of either 400 or 600 gs in the two randomized groups, respectively.

Figure 1

The procedural ablation endpoint was the achievement of bidirectional CTI block, confirmed by differential pacing maneuvers, the presence of double potentials along the ablation line and the assessment of prolongation of the transisthmus interval in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions, during pacing from the coronary sinus ostium and the low lateral right atrium, respectively. First‐pass CTI block was defined as achievement of bidirectional CTI block upon the completion of the initially deployed CTI line, without the need for additional RF lesions.

Twenty minutes after documentation of bidirectional CTI block, the ablation line was assessed for spontaneous recovery of CTI conduction, using the same electrophysiological criteria as described above. In the absence of spontaneous recovery, a provocative test with intravenous adenosine was performed to evaluate the presence of dormant CTI conduction. Specifically, 6 mg of adenosine were rapidly infused intravenously, aiming to achieve at least one blocked P wave or a sinus pause of 3 s. In case of inability to achieve transient atrioventricular block or sinus pause, the infused dose of adenosine was increased by increments of 6 mg. Testing was initially performed under pacing from the proximal coronary sinus, with the ablation catheter positioned just laterally to the ablation line. The same testing was performed during pacing from the ablation catheter just laterally to the CTI ablation line. Dormant recovery of transisthmus conduction was defined as transient or permanent shortening of the transisthmus interval, following adenosine infusion (Figure 2). In case of adenosine‐mediated recovery of conduction, additional lesions were deployed until adenosine testing was rendered negative.

### Right ventricular pacing to assess transisthmus conduction in patients undergoing isthmus-dependent atrial flutter ablation: a new useful technique? [^67955f26]. Heart Rhythm (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Successful radiofrequency (RF) ablation of typical, isthmus-dependent atrial flutter requires establishment and confirmation of bidirectional conduction block across the cavotricuspid isthmus. Low atrial pacing usually is performed from the bipoles of the 20-pole Halo catheter, septal and lateral to the cavotricuspid isthmus ablation line. However, occasionally this is difficult because of high pacing thresholds and/or saturation of the atrial electrograms recorded near the pacing catheter.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess if right ventricular (RV) pacing and resulting retrograde atrial activation can be used to assess conduction block from the septum to the lateral wall in a clockwise direction.

Methods

Thirty-five consecutive male patients (mean age 64 ± 10 years; mean ejection fraction 42 ± 13%; mean left atrial dimension 44 ± 6 mm) with typical isthmus-dependent atrial flutter were studied. The following electrophysiology catheters were used: 20-pole catheter along the tricuspid annulus, quadripolar catheters at the His and/or RV apex, and 8-mm ablation catheter. Following RF ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus, bidirectional conduction block was confirmed in all 35 patients by pacing at a cycle length of 600 ms from bipoles septal and lateral to the cavotricuspid isthmus ablation line. Conduction times from pacing artifact to adjacent bipolar atrial electrograms and reversal of atrial activation pattern were analyzed. RV pacing was performed and retrograde atrial activation pattern assessed. If retrograde AV nodal conduction was absent, isoproterenol was infused intravenously at 2 microg/min, and RV pacing was repeated. The conduction time between the double potentials across the cavotricuspid isthmus ablation line was measured.

Results

Mean conduction times across the isthmus during septal (S), lateral (L), and RV pacing were 145 ± 21 ms, 144 ± 24 ms, and 129 ± 20 ms, respectively. Retrograde AV nodal conduction was present in 34 of 35 patients (isoproterenol 8 patients). Evidence of conduction block by a clear change in activation pattern across the isthmus was seen during RV pacing in 33 of 35 patients with bidirectional conduction block.

Conclusion

RV pacing is a simple and easy maneuver that can be performed to assess isthmus conduction in most patients.

### Evaluation of an individualized strategy of cavotricuspid isthmus ablation as an adjunct to atrial fibrillation ablation [^32fd79d2]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate supplementary cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation as an adjunct to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation in selected patients.

Background

It is unclear whether routine CTI ablation is beneficial in all patients undergoing AF ablation.

Methods and Results

In patients undergoing AF ablation, additional CTI block was created only for those with typical atrial flutter (Afl) before or during the ablation. Out of 188 consecutive patients (108 male, 56 ± 9 years), 75 underwent CTI ablation (Group CTI+) and left atrial (LA) ablation (circular mapping-guided extensive pulmonary vein isolation in all and linear LA ablation when required), while 113 underwent LA ablation alone (Group CTI-). Group CTI+ patients had smaller LA and less frequently persistent/permanent AF and linear LA ablation. Over a follow-up of 30 ± 10 months, complications (4% vs 5%, P = NS), typical Afl occurrence (1.3% and 2.6%, P = NS) and AF recurrence (25% and 28%, P = NS) were similar. Atypical Afl was more common in Group CTI- (4 vs 14%, P = 0.026). Eighty-two percent and 79% of patients in Groups CTI+ and CTI-, respectively, remained arrhythmia free in stable sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic drug treatment (P = NS).

Conclusions

Avoiding supplementary CTI ablation in AF ablation patients without evidence of typical flutter does not result in a higher incidence of typical Afl. Despite more persistent/permanent AF and larger LA in patients without evidence of typical flutter, a strategy of selective supplementary ablation resulted in similar and low AF recurrence rates in the group without CTI ablation compared with the group with CTI ablation.

Cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent atrial flutter — typical atrial rate range: Although the atrial rates for atrial flutter typically range from 250 bpm to 330 bpm, the rates may be slower in patients with severe atrial disease or in patients taking antiarrhythmic agents or after unsuccessful catheter ablation.

We describe the case of 2-year-old baby with compound heterozygosity for paternal and maternal alleles mutation of α-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A), sinus node dysfunction, atrial flutter recurrences, and drug induced long-QT syndrome. In this setting, we chose at first to perform linear ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus resulting in a bidirectional isthmus block. As a second step, we decided to implant a miniaturized loop recorder that, with a minimally invasive procedure, permits us to follow the development of the disease in order to define the future strategy. After 8 months follow-up, automatic daily loop-recorder transmissions disclose the complete absence of any arrhythmia along with asymptomatic ventricular pauses due to sinus node dysfunction. Echocardiography shows normal findings, in particular no left ventricular dysfunction.

Atrial flutter — coexistence with atrial fibrillation (AF) and AF incidence after cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation: It is common for AF and atrial flutter to coexist in the same patient. After CTI ablation, 22% to 50% of patients have been reported to develop AF after a mean follow-up of 14 to 30 months, and one study reported 82% of patients manifesting AF within 5 years. Reported risk factors for AF after atrial flutter ablation include prior AF, depressed left ventricular function, structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease, inducible AF, and increased left atrial size.

### Acute and long-term efficacy and safety of catheter cryoablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus for treatment of type 1 atrial flutter [^49962268]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial flutter (AFL) is commonly treated by radiofrequency catheter ablation. Catheter-based cryoablation may be an effective alternative with potential advantages.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to study the acute and long-term safety and efficacy of catheter-based cryoablation for treatment of cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent (typical and reverse typical) AFL.

Methods

Catheter-based cryoablation was performed with a 10Fr catheter in 160 patients with cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent AFL (122 men and 38 women; mean age 63.1 ± 9.3 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 54.6% ± 10.4%); 94 (58.8%) of these patients also had atrial fibrillation (AF). All patients underwent right atrial (RA) activation mapping and pacing at the cavotricuspid isthmus to demonstrate concealed entrainment and confirm cavotricuspid isthmus dependence of AFL. Catheter-based cryoablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was performed with multiple freezes (average freeze time 2.3 ± 0.5 minutes) until bidirectional block was demonstrated during pacing from the low lateral RA and coronary sinus, respectively. Patients were evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months and underwent weekly and symptomatic event monitoring. Acute procedural success was defined as cavotricuspid isthmus block persisting 30 minutes after ablation. Long-term success was defined as absence of AFL during follow-up.

Results

Acute success was achieved in 140 (87.5%) of 160 patients. Total procedure time was 200 ± 71 minutes, ablation time (including a 30-minute waiting period after ablation) was 139 ± 62 minutes, and fluoroscopy time was 35 ± 26 minutes. An average of 20.5 ± 11.3 freezes, for a total ablation time of 47.4 ± 24.3 minutes, were required to achieve cavotricuspid isthmus block, with average and nadir temperatures of -81.5 degrees C ± 3.7 degrees C and -85.6 degrees ± 3.6 degrees C, respectively. Four patients (2.5%) had procedure-related adverse events. Of 132 patients with acute efficacy who completed 6-month follow-up, 8 (6%) were lost to follow-up or were noncompliant with event recordings. Using survival analysis, 106 (80.3%) remained free of AFL on strict analysis of event recordings only, and 119 (90.2%) remained clinically free of AFL.

Conclusion

This large pivotal study demonstrated the acute and long-term efficacy and safety of catheter-based cryoablation for cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent AFL, similar to rates previously reported for radiofrequency catheter ablation.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 — Anticoagulation of typical atrial flutter (AFL): For patients with AFL, anticoagulation therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for atrial fibrillation (AF). In patients with AFL who undergo successful cardioversion or ablation resulting in restoration of sinus rhythm, anticoagulation should be continued for at least 4 weeks postprocedure. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation and have had AF previously detected before AFL ablation should receive ongoing oral anticoagulation as indicated for AF. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation and are deemed to be at high thromboembolic risk, without any known previous history of AF, should receive close follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring to detect silent AF if they are not receiving ongoing anticoagulation in view of significant risk of AF. In patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation without any known previous history of AF who are at high risk for development of AF, it may be reasonable to prescribe long-term anticoagulation if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests high risk (> 2% annual risk) for stroke.

### Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation guided by force-time integral – A randomized study [^d582127c]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

CTI ablation using spot lesions with an FTI of 600 gs is not associated with lower rates of spontaneous or adenosine‐mediated recovery of CTI conduction, compared to a target FTI of 400 gs. Our study does not support an incremental benefit from incorporating FTI values higher than 400 gs during CTI ablation, in terms of acute procedural efficacy.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study protocol

This prospective, single‐center, randomized study enrolled 50 patients with symptomatic CTI‐dependent AFL, who underwent first‐time CTI ablation from August 2019 to December 2020. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Mitera Hospital, Athens, Greece, and conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Study participants provided written informed consent and all CTI ablation procedures were performed by two experienced electrophysiologists (prior experience of over 300 CTI ablations). Patients were randomized to two groups, using the sealed envelope method: in group FTI400, patients underwent CTI ablation with spot lesions of 400 gs, while, in group FTI600, patients underwent CTI ablation targeting 600 gs spot lesions. The study endpoint was defined as either spontaneous or adenosine‐induced recovery of transisthmus conduction, after a 20‐min waiting period.

2.2 Ablation procedure

Catheter ablation was performed with uninterrupted anticoagulation therapy. All patients received oral anticoagulants for at least 1 month before the procedure and antiarrhythmics were discontinued for at least 7 days. Venous access was obtained via the right femoral vein in all patients. Twelve‐lead electrocardiogram and intracardiac electrograms were recorded and analyzed using the LabSystem EP Recording System. A deflectable decapolar diagnostic catheter was placed in the coronary sinus and an open‐irrigated ablation catheter (TactiCath™ Quartz ablation catheter, Abbott, Inc.) was advanced into the right atrium. In patients presenting with ongoing AFL, standard entrainment maneuvers were performed from the CTI and the proximal bipole of the coronary sinus catheter to confirm the diagnosis of CTI‐dependent flutter. In patients presenting with sinus rhythm, preablation transisthmus conduction interval was measured in both directions (from the proximal coronary sinus to the lateral isthmus and vice versa). All cases were performed with the use of the NavX electroanatomical mapping system (St. Jude Medical).

### Cavotricuspid isthmus catheter ablation without the use of fluoroscopy as a first-line treatment [^1f4c3d77]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction and Objectives

The use of intracardiac navigation systems has enabled a significant reduction of the radiation dose in the majority of ablation procedures. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of cavotricuspid isthmus ablation without the use of fluoroscopy as a first-line treatment.

Methods and Results

An observational study without a control group in patients referred for treatment of common atrial flutter. In all of the procedures, Ensite-NavX™ was the only guidance system used to visualize the catheters. One or two diagnostic catheters and a cooled-tip ablation catheter were used in each procedure. Bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block was considered to indicate a successful procedure. Eighty-three ablation procedures were performed in 80 patients (82.5% men, 61 ± 10 years of age). The procedure was repeated in 3 patients (3.75%) due to flutter recurrence. Success was obtained in 98.8% of the procedures; in 1 patient it was necessary to implant a pacemaker for sinus node dysfunction and 4 patients experienced minor complications. In 75 procedures (90.4%), fluoroscopy was not required. Visualization of the diagnostic catheters was the most common reason for using fluoroscopy. The time required to perform the ablation procedure was similar to that published in other series.

Conclusions

Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation using a nonfluoroscopic three-dimensional (3D) navigation system is effective and safe.

### Conduction recovery after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation when performed with or without concomitant atrial fibrillation ablation [^86d1fb5c]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to define the association between conduction recovery across the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) and typical atrial flutter (AFL) recurrence when CTI ablation is performed with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) compared with a stand-alone procedure.

Background

CTI ablation is commonly performed at the same time as PVI to treat AFL or as an empiric therapy. Conduction recovery is a recognized problem after linear ablation in the left atrium (e.g., mitral isthmus ablation) and is proarrhythmic. Less is known about conduction recovery after CTI ablation and possible differences in outcomes when performed at the time of PVI compared with at the time of a stand-alone procedure.

Methods

Eligible participants who underwent stand-alone CTI ablation were compared with those who underwent a combined (CTI+PVI) procedure. CTI conduction recovery was assessed at the time of a second ablation. Conduction recovery across the CTI (primary outcome) and recurrence of typical AFL (secondary outcome) were studied using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Among 295 eligible participants (median age: 64 years [interquartile range: 55 to 69 years]; 33% women), recovery was assessed in 232 and was more common after combined versus stand-alone CTI ablation (52% [72 of 139] vs. 13% [12 of 93]; p < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, CTI ablation performed as a combined procedure increased odds of CTI conduction recovery 7.8-fold (odds ratio: 7.8; 95% confidence interval: 3.3 to 18.3; p < 0.001) and clinical AFL recurrence 4.1-fold (odds ratio: 4.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 16.9; p = 0.049).

Conclusions

CTI ablation performed at the time of atrial fibrillation ablation is associated with higher rates of conduction recovery and typical flutter recurrence.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — pulmonary vein isolation by catheter ablation: Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) is recommended during all atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures (Class I, LOE A). Achievement of electrical isolation requires, at a minimum, assessment and demonstration of entrance block into the PV (Class I, LOE B-R). Monitoring for PV reconnection for 20 minutes following initial PV isolation is reasonable (Class IIa, LOE B-R). Administration of adenosine 20 minutes following initial PV isolation using radiofrequency (RF) energy with reablation if PV reconnection might be considered (Class IIb, LOE B-R). Use of a pace-capture (pacing along the ablation line) ablation strategy may be considered (Class IIb, LOE B-R). Demonstration of exit block may be considered (Class IIb, LOE B-NR). If a patient has a history of typical atrial flutter or typical atrial flutter is induced at the time of AF ablation, delivery of a cavotricuspid isthmus linear lesion is recommended (Class I, LOE B-R).

Unlabelled

Randomized Trial of ICE During CTI Ablation.

Introduction

Despite a high success rate, radio-frequency ablation (RFA) of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) can be unusually challenging in some cases. We postulated that visualization of the CTI with intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) could maximize the success rate, decrease the procedure and ablation time, and minimize the radiation exposure.

Methods and Results

In our prospective, randomized study, we included 102 patients scheduled for CTI ablation. We randomized patients in 2 groups: guided only by fluoroscopy (n = 52) or ICE-guided (n = 50) group. Procedure time, fluoroscopy time, and the time spent for RFA were significantly shorter, radiation exposure (dose-area product-DAP) and the sum of delivered radio frequency energy were significantly lower in the ICE-group (68.06 ± 15.09 minutes vs 105.94 ± 36.51 minutes, P < 0.001, 5.54 ± 3.77 minutes vs 18.63 ± 10.60 minutes, P < 0.001, 482.80 ± 534.12 seconds vs 779.76 ± 620.82 seconds, P = 0.001 and 397.62 ± 380.81 cGycm(2) vs 1,312.92 ± 1,129.28 cGycm(2), P < 0.001, 10,866.84 ± 6,930.84 Ws vs 16,393.56 ± 13,995.78 Ws, P = 0.048, respectively). Seven patients (13%) from the fluoroscopy-only group crossed over to ICE-guidance because of prolonged unsuccessful RFA and were all treated successfully. Four vascular complications and 2 recurrences were equally distributed between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

ICE-guided ablation of the CTI significantly shortens the procedure and fluoroscopy time, markedly decreases radiation exposure, and time spent for ablation in comparison with fluoroscopy-only procedures. At the same time, visualization with ICE allowed successful ablation in challenging cases. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 23, pp. 996–1000, September 2012).

### Prophylactic pulmonary vein isolation during isthmus ablation for atrial flutter: the PReVENT AF study I [^7b40806e]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although catheter ablation of isthmus-dependent atrial flutter (AFL) is successful at eliminating the target arrhythmia, many patients subsequently experience new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether AF can be prevented by prophylactic pulmonary vein ablation in patients with AFL.

Methods

A prospective, single-blind, randomized clinical trial in patients whose sole arrhythmia was AFL without AF was conducted. Patients were randomized to cavotricuspid isthmus ablation alone or with concomitant pulmonary vein isolation. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor.

Results

Fifty patients completed the trial, and patients were well matched. Isthmus ablation was successful in all patients; pulmonary vein isolation was successful in 25 (100%) randomized patients. Procedure (P < .0001) and fluoroscopy (P < .0001) times were longer in the combined ablation group. More patients in the isthmus ablation-only group experienced new-onset AF during follow-up (52% vs. 12%; P = 0.003). The 1-year AF burden also favored the combined ablation group compared with the isthmus ablation-only group (8.3% vs. 4.0%; P = 0.034). In the isthmus ablation-only group, 8 (32%) patients subsequently underwent another ablation for AF. The performance of pulmonary vein isolation and male sex were independent predictors of freedom from AF.

Conclusion

In the PREVENT-AF Study I randomized clinical trial of patients in whom only typical AFL had been observed clinically, the addition of pulmonary vein isolation to cavotricuspid isthmus ablation resulted in a marked reduction of new-onset AF during clinical follow-up as assessed with a continuous implantable cardiac monitor.

### Incidence of atrial fibrillation post-cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter: left-atrial size as an independent predictor of atrial fibrillation recurrence [^61d9604b]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter often coexist. The long-term occurrence of atrial fibrillation in patients presenting with atrial flutter alone is unknown. We report the long-term follow-up in patients who underwent cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for treatment of lone atrial flutter.

Methods and Results

Between January 1997 and June 2002, 632 patients underwent cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for the treatment of typical atrial flutter at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Three hundred sixty-three patients were included in this study and followed for a mean duration of 39 ± 11 months. The mean duration of atrial flutter symptoms was 12 ± 5 months. Mean left-atrial size and left-ventricular ejection fraction were 4.2 ± 0.8 cm and 47 ± 13%, respectively. After a mean follow-up time of 39 ± 11 months, 13% (48 of 363) of the patients remained in sinus rhythm. Five percent (18 of 363) of patients experienced recurrence of atrial flutter only. Sixty-eight percent (246 of 363) experienced the onset of atrial fibrillation and 14% (51 of 363) experienced recurrence of atrial flutter and the new onset of atrial fibrillation. Overall, 82% (297 of 363) of the patients experienced new onset of drug refractory atrial fibrillation. Left-atrial size was a predictor of atrial fibrillation recurrence post-atrial flutter ablation.

Conclusion

At long-term follow-up, approximately 82% of patients post-cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for atrial flutter developed drug refractory atrial fibrillation. This finding suggests that elimination of atrial flutter might delay, but does not prevent, atrial fibrillation. Evidence suggests both arrhythmias may share common triggers and such patients may derive a better long-term benefit from anatomical ablative treatment of atrial fibrillation as well.

Macroreentry is a broad term that encompasses what have been considered to be typical and atypical atrial flutters (AFLs). The hallmark of macroreentry is that two sites ≥ 2 cm apart demonstrate entrainment with a postpacing interval–tachycardia cycle length of ≤ 20 ms (i.e. within the circuit). The most common forms of atrial macroreentry are variants of classical common and reverse common cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent flutter (Figure 5A, 5B). These include both counterclockwise (common) and clockwise (reverse common) variants, with the circuit originally described as a broad active wavefront rotating around the tricuspid annulus. However, it is now recognized that many variants exist, such as lower loop reentry and forms in which the active wavefront crosses immediately anterior or posterior to the inferior vena cava. Rarely, intraisthmus reentry can occur. Classical AFL almost invariably coexists with AF. Studies of AFL onset and termination have demonstrated that both invariably require transitional AF, indicating that flutter is largely a downstream arrhythmia. Attempts to modify the natural history of AF by ablation of AFL have thus far largely been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation is a simple procedure with high efficacy and low risk that can provide good arrhythmia palliation in the appropriately selected patient. However, long-term follow-up studies following flutter ablation have demonstrated increasing prevalence of AF during long-term follow-up.

### Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation guided by force-time integral – A randomized study [^afb7e8d4]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)‐dependent atrial flutter (AFL) is a common arrhythmia caused by a macroreentrant circuit rotating along the tricuspid annulus. Catheter ablation, achieved by creating a line of bidirectional conduction block across the CTI, is considered the treatment of choice for CTI‐dependent AFL. Based on the recently issued ESC guidelines, catheter ablation is recommended not only in patients with multiple symptomatic AFL recurrences, but it should be considered, as well, even after the first episode of symptomatic AFL. Considering the low threshold for invasive management of CTI‐dependent AFL, the proposal of specific ablation guidelines to improve the durability of CTI bidirectional block has important clinical implications.

Deployment of effective ablation lesions is affected by several procedural factors, such as catheter stability, duration of energy delivery, temperature, impedance drop, and diminution of electrogram amplitude. Contact force (CF) is a marker of ablation lesion quality and transmurality. Low CF values are associated with ineffective lesion formation during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablationand specific CF recommendations have been issued to improve the durability of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Force‐time integral (FTI) incorporates the average CF (in grams) and duration (in seconds) during radiofrequency (RF) energy application and is a marker of ablation lesion size and volume at a given power setting. In the AF ablation setting, a minimum FTI of 400 gram‐seconds (gs) reduces the risk of pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection. However, specific FTI values to guide CTI ablation have not been proposed and the target limit of 400 gs is usually adopted, in everyday clinical practice. Thus, it remains elusive whether higher FTI values could result in reduced rates of CTI conduction recovery.

The aim of this randomized study was to test the hypothesis whether CTI bidirectional block achieved by sequential spot lesions with an FTI of 600 gs is associated with reduced rate of acute transisthmus conduction recovery, compared to 400 gs FTI lesions.

### Long-term outcomes after catheter ablation of cavo-tricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter: a meta-analysis [^01a5524e]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the success of catheter ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter (AFL), important postablation outcomes are ill-defined. The purpose of our study was to analyze long-term outcomes after catheter ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent AFL.

Methods and Results

A meta-analysis was performed of articles reporting clinical outcomes after catheter ablation of AFL published between January 1988 and July 2008. The analysis included 158 studies comprising 10 719 patients (79% men, 59.8 ± 0.5 years old, 46% left atrial enlargement, 46% heart disease, 42% with history of atrial fibrillation, 14.3 ± 0.4 months of follow-up). The overall acute success rate adjusted for reporting bias was 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5 to 92.4), 92.7% (95% CI, 90.0 to 94.8) for 8- to 10-mm tip/or irrigated radiofrequency catheters, and 87.9% (95% CI, 84.2 to 90.9) for 4- to 6-mm tip catheters (P > 0.05). Atrial flutter recurrence rates were significantly reduced by use of 8- to 10-mm tip or irrigated radiofrequency catheters (6.7% versus 13.8%, P < 0.05) and by use of bidirectional cavotricuspid isthmus block as a procedural end point (9.3% versus 23.6%, P < 0.05). The AFL recurrence rate did not increase over time. The overall occurrence rate of atrial fibrillation after AFL ablation was 33.6% (95% CI, 29.7 to 37.3) but was 52.7% (95% CI, 47.8 to 57.6) in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation before ablation and 23.1% (95% CI, 17.5 to 29.9) in those without atrial fibrillation before ablation (P < 0.05). The incidence of atrial fibrillation increased over time in both groups; however, 5 years after ablation, the incidence of atrial fibrillation was similar in those with and without atrial fibrillation before ablation. The acute complication rate was 2.6% (95% CI, 2 to 3). The mortality rate during follow-up was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.5). Antiarrhythmic drug use after ablation was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.6 to 37.8). The long-term use of coumadin was 65.9%, (95% CI, 43.8 to 82.8). Quality of life data were very limited.

Conclusions

AFL ablation is safe and effective. Ablation technology and procedural end points have greater influences on AFL recurrences than on acute ablation success rates. Atrial fibrillation is common after AFL ablation. Almost one third of patients take antiarrhythmic drugs after AFL ablation. Atrial fibrillation before AFL ablation may indicate a more advanced state of electric disease.

### Atrial fibrillation episode duration and arrhythmia recurrence following ablation… [^b853e5ab]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the association between preablation atrial fibrillation episode duration and arrhythmia recurrence outcomes following AF ablation. Findings. In this prespecified subanalysis of a randomized clinical trial of 346 patients with symptomatic AF undergoing catheter ablation, patients with AF episodes limited to less than 24 continuous hours had a significantly lower rate of recurrence following an ablation procedure. Arrhythmia recurrence and AF burden after ablation did not differ between patients with persistent AF and those with paroxysmal AF. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that the contemporary definition of paroxysmal AF does not reflect post-AF ablation arrhythmia outcomes. Importance Contemporary guidelines recommend that atrial fibrillation be classified based on episode duration, with these categories forming the basis of therapeutic recommendations.

While pragmatic, these classifications are not based on pathophysiologic processes and may not reflect clinical outcomes. Objective To evaluate the association of baseline AF episode duration with post-AF ablation arrhythmia outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants. The current study is a secondary analysis of a prospective, parallel-group, multicenter, single-masked randomized clinical trial, which took place at 8 Canadian centers. Between September 2014 and July 2017, 346 patients older than 18 years with symptomatic AF referred for first catheter ablation were enrolled. All patients received an implantable cardiac monitor at least 30 days before ablation. Data analysis was performed in September 2019. Exposure Before ablation, patients were classified based on their longest AF episode.

Ablation consisted of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation using standard techniques. Main Outcomes and Measures Time to first recurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmia following ablation and AF burden on preablation and postablation continuous rhythm monitoring. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT01913522 Contemporary North American and European guidelines recommend that the clinical pattern of atrial fibrillation be classified based on episode duration and persistence, with AF defined as paroxysmal if episode duration is less than 7 days and persistent if the episode duration is 7 days or longer. 1 These clinically determined patterns. of AF have been used to characterize the severity of disease, define patient populations in clinical trials, and form the basis of therapeutic recommendations.

1 Despite their central role in clinical practice, the historical derivation of these AF patterns was arbitrarily defined and thus may not reflect pathophysiologic processes or clinical outcomes. 2 The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between AF episode duration and outcomes following AF ablation. The study enrolled 346 patients older than 18 years with symptomatic AF refractory to at least 1 class I or class III antiarrhythmic drug referred for a first catheter ablation procedure. Ablation consisted of circumferential pulmonary vein isolation using standard techniques. 3 The study was performed according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki4 and approved by the appropriate national authorities and the institutional review committee at each center. All patients provided written informed consent. The original study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

### Effects of cavotricuspid isthmus ablation on atrioventricular node electrophysiology in patients with typical atrial flutter [^85b50f0b]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The atrial musculature in the cavotricuspid isthmus is a part of posterior inputs to the AV node. In patients with typical atrial flutter, effects of radiofrequency ablation of this isthmus on AV node conduction are still unknown.

Methods and Results

This study included 16 patients with clinically documented typical atrial flutter. Group 1 had 8 patients without and group 2 had 8 patients with dual AV nodal pathway physiology. Electrical pacing from the interatrial septum and low right atrium was performed to evaluate antegrade AV node function before and after ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus. In group 1, the AV node conduction properties were similar before and after ablation. In group 2, the AV node Wenckebach cycle length and maximal AH interval during low right atrium (356 ± 58 versus 399 ± 49 ms, P = 0.008; 303 ± 57 versus 376 ± 50 ms, P = 0.008) and interatrial septum (365 ± 62 versus 393 ± 59 ms, P = 0.008; 324 ± 52 versus 390 ± 60 ms, P = 0.008) pacing were significantly longer after ablation. Elimination of the slow pathway after ablation was noted in 2 patients, including 1 with AV nodal reentrant echo beats.

Conclusions

Radiofrequency ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was effective in eliminating typical atrial flutter without injury of antegrade fast AV node conduction. The atrial musculature in the cavotricuspid isthmus significantly contributed to the slow AV node conduction.

### Incidence and predictors of atrial fibrillation after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for typical atrial flutter [^61e7925e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation is a highly effective treatment of typical atrial flutter (AFL). The emergence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) following CTI ablation is clinically relevant but limited data exist regarding its predictors. The goal of this study is to investigate predictors of new-onset AF following CTI ablation. Patients who underwent CTI ablation between 2016 and 2022 were included. Baseline variables including left atrial volume index (LAVI), cardiac comorbidities, CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, and medications were collected. The primary outcome was the occurrence of new-onset AF after the index CTI ablation. New AF occurred in 44 (29%) of 153 patients at a median of 264 days. Patients who developed AF were more likely men (p = 0.046), had hypertension (p = 0.014), and higher LAVI (40.6 ± 12.2 vs. 34.2 ± 9.5 mL/m², p < 0.001). After adjusting for unbalanced covariates in a Cox multivariable model, protective predictors against developing new AF included female sex (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12–0.76, p = 0.011) and prior cardiac surgery (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07–0.72, p = 0.013) while increased LAVI (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.05, p = 0.08) showed a trend towards higher risk of new AF. In conclusion, in this cohort of AF-naive patients undergoing CTI ablation for typical AFL, nearly one-third developed new-onset AF. Independent predictors of developing AF include male sex and no-prior cardiac surgery. These findings have clinical implications to the management of AFL patients, including for the decision to consider performing concomitant AF ablation in patients with higher risk features.

2.4.3 Low‐voltage area guided ablation

Cluster ablation for the whole LVA will be performed in patients allocated to LVA guided ablation in addition to PVI. LVAs in the posterior wall may be isolated by linear ablation to avoid esophageal injury. The Visitag module will be used with the following settings: catheter stability ≤ 2 mm for 5 s, contact force ≥ 5 g (time ≥ 25%), tag size 6 mm in diameter. Radiofrequency will be delivered to the LVA until an AI of ≥ 350 and the distance between the tags will be < 6 mm. At the discretion of the physician, avoidance of ablation near Bachmann's bundle or near the His bundle will be acceptable if there are concerns they will be injured. The area of residual LVAs that are not ablated will be calculated. Scar areas are not included in the residual LVA.

2.4.4 Procedure after low‐voltage area guided ablation or

Following LVA guided ablation in addition to PVI or PVI alone, tachyarrhythmia inducibility will be evaluated using 10‐s burst pacing from the coronary sinus and right atrium at the maximum current output (20 mA), beginning with a cycle length of 400 ms and decreasing to 200 ms. Isoproterenol administration will be used to evoke non‐PV AF triggers. Physicians will perform focal ablation of AF triggers or isolate AF triggers, and ablate to block the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) in cases with inducible CTI‐dependent atrial flutter (AFL). Ablation for clinical coexisting tachyarrhythmias such as AFL, atrial tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia will also be performed. Physicians will confirm PVI stability by checking the disappearance of the potential in the PV > 20 min after the initial PVI and finish the procedure.

### Variable procedural strategies adapted to anatomical characteristics in catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus using a preoperative multidetector computed tomography analysis [^99775ffa]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is defined as the area between the tricuspid valve (TV) and inferior vena cava (IVC), and is contiguous in anatomy to the triangle of Koch. The CTI is a critical component of the reentry circuit for CTI-dependent atrial flutter (AFL).–Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation targeting the CTI is the optimal treatment for CTI-dependent AFL. Despite high overall success rates, the ablation procedure is occasionally difficult due to variations in the anatomical characteristics of the CTI. Multidetector row-computed tomography (MDCT) has become a widely used substitute in cardiac angiography studies.

In a preliminary study, the CTI anatomy was evaluated using 64-row MDCT, and the anatomical characteristics of the CTI that complicate the ablation procedure were identified. Subsequently, adaptations to the CTI ablation strategies according to the anatomical information provided by the preprocedural MDCT were prospectively examined in a main study. The goal was to improve and minimize the difficulty of the ablation procedure.

Anticoagulation for typical cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)–dependent atrial flutter (AFL) is directed by treatment path and thromboembolic risk. For patients managed with "Rate control or rhythm control with antiarrhythmic therapy" or those with "Unsuccessful typical AFL ablation (without plans for re-do ablation)", the pathway directs "Anticoagulation according to same risk profile as AF (1)". After "Successful typical AFL ablation", patients with "Known prior history of AF" receive "Anticoagulation according to same risk profile as AF (1)". In those with "No known prior history of AF", a "High-risk thromboembolic profile" leads to "Consider anticoagulation if high-risk features for development of AF† (2b)", whereas a "Low-risk thromboembolic profile" leads to "Monitor off anticoagulation (clinical follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring) (1)".

### Randomized comparison of anatomic and electrogram mapping approaches to ablation of typical atrial flutter [^d14b6176]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Introduction

The cavotricuspid isthmus can be ablated using an anatomic approach or an electrogram mapping approach in which sites at which there is a gap in the line of block are targeted. The aim of this study was to compare the anatomic and electrogram mapping approaches for creating a line of block in the cavotricuspid isthmus after an initial, unsuccessful anatomically directed ablation line.

Methods and Results

The subjects of this study were 63 patients with isthmus-dependent atrial flutter in whom a single series of contiguous applications of radiofrequency energy guided by fluoroscopy in the cavotricuspid isthmus did not result in complete block. The patients were randomly assigned to additional ablation on an anatomic basis (n = 31) or guided by single potentials or narrowly split double potentials during coronary sinus pacing (n = 32). After every 15 applications of radiofrequency energy, the alternate approach was used until complete block was achieved. Before cross-over, complete block was achieved in 6 patients (19%) with the anatomic approach compared with 19 patients (59%) with the electrogram mapping approach (P < 0.005). The electrogram mapping approach also was more effective than the anatomic approach in achieving complete isthmus block after the first cross-over (72% vs 23%, P < 0.005) and after the second cross-over (80% vs 42%, P < 0.05).

Conclusion

When there is incomplete block after an initial series of applications of radiofrequency energy in the cavotricuspid isthmus, complete block is achieved more efficiently with an electrogram mapping approach than with an anatomic approach.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^dbfc9ece]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation ablation in adult congenital heart disease — procedural considerations and efficacy — notes limited data, specialized approaches, and technique-specific observations. Data on ablative strategies for AF in patients with ACHD are limited; however, when performed by experienced centers, AF ablation in patients with simple forms of CHD is safe, and knowledge of the underlying congenital anatomy is key, as access to the atrial chambers may require different approaches, including transseptal puncture. Patients with ACHD who have persistent AF have lower success rates for ablation, and multiple procedures may be required, and there are insufficient data on the role, safety, and benefit of AF ablation in complex forms of CHD. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has a lower success rate in patients with ACHD than in structurally normal hearts; due to related right atrial pathology in repaired complex ACHD, additional ablation at atriotomy scars and the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) may be necessary. Cryoballoon ablation is a safe option for patients with simple or moderate forms of CHD and AF.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation lesion sets — pulmonary vein (PV) isolation and adjunct lines are illustrated with circumferential lesions around the right and left PVs whose primary endpoint is electrical isolation of the PV musculature; common linear lesion strategies include a roof line between encircling lesions of the left and right PVs, a mitral isthmus line from the mitral valve to the lesion encircling the left PVs at the level of the left inferior PV, and an anterior linear lesion to the mitral annulus; a cavotricuspid isthmus line is generally placed in patients with cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent atrial flutter clinically or when induced during electrophysiology (EP) testing; additional lines between the superior and inferior PVs can create a figure 8 lesion set and a posterior inferior line to isolate the posterior left atrial wall; an encircling lesion of the superior vena cava (SVC) directed at its electrical isolation may be performed if focal firing from the SVC is demonstrated, and a subset of operators empirically isolates the SVC; when complex fractionated electrograms are targeted, common ablation sites are also close to the autonomic GP.

### Concealed automaticity from an island of atrial myocardium post cavotricuspid ablation [^20b43c6e]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

We report the case of a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in whom 2 previous cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablations were performed for recurrent type I counterclockwise atrial flutter. One year after the last CTI ablation, the patient underwent pulmonary vein isolation for AF and reassessment of conduction block in the CTI was performed during the procedure. While mapping the CTI, activations were documented within the CTI that were dissociated from both right atrial and ventricular activity during sinus rhythm and pacing maneuvers. This dissociated activity was confined to a region delimited by the 2 previous ablation lines, the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena cava. These findings suggest that an island of atrial myocardium with automatic activity was created within the CTI by previous ablation lines.

3.3 Recovery of transisthmus conduction

The occurrence of the study endpoint (spontaneous or adenosine‐induced recovery of transisthmus conduction) was similar in groups FTI400 and FTI600 (19.2% vs. 16.7%, p = .81). In group FTI400, one patient failed to achieve bidirectional CTI block and was considered to have met the study endpoint; two patients showed spontaneous recovery of CTI conduction during the 20‐min waiting period and two patients after adenosine administration. In group FTI600, recovery of CTI conduction was documented in three patients spontaneously and in one patient following adenosine administration. In the total population, patients with first‐pass CTI block were less likely to show spontaneous or adenosine‐mediated recovery of CTI conduction, compared to those requiring additional ablation lesions (7.7% vs. 29.2%, respectively, p = .048).

Methods

Study Subjects

The institutional review board approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients with a serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL or more were excluded from the study. Patients in which adequate anatomical information necessary to perform the measurements was not obtained during the MDCT scan were excluded. Fortunately, the scans in all subjects provided the necessary anatomical information and it was not necessary to exclude any subjects due to an uninterpretable scan quality.

Preliminary Study

In total, 80 patients (63 males [79.7%], aged 59.8 ± 10.4 years) in whom CTI ablation was successfully performed using an 8 mm tip ablation catheter were included from the preliminary study. MDCT was performed within 24 hours before the ablation procedure in all patients. Typical AFL was clinically documented in 23 patients (AFL only: n = 7; both atrial fibrillation (AF) and AFL: n = 16). The remaining 57 patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF underwent a combined AF and CTI ablation with no evidence of AFL. Of the 73 patients with AF in whom circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) was performed, paroxysmal AF was evident in 63 patients and persistent AF in 10.

Main Study

Three hundred and sixteen consecutive patients (males: n = 255, 80.7%, aged 60.5 ± 10.2 years) scheduled for a CTI ablation were prospectively enrolled in the main study. Typical AFL was clinically documented in 22 patients. In the remaining 294 patients (including 56 patients with AFL) with persistent or paroxysmal AF, a combined AF and CTI ablation was performed with no evidence of AFL.

### Atrial fibrillation ablation in congenital heart disease: therapeutic challenges and future perspectives [^3445159c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

AF Ablation Challenges in ACHD and Emerging Techniques

Although AF ablation has emerged as a standardized therapeutic option for AF in patients with normally structured hearts, it remains a challenging treatment strategy in patients with ACHD due to the complex anatomy and the subsequent procedural difficulties. To date, relevant experience is scanty, and most ablation strategies, such as pulmonary vein isolation, connecting linear lesion sets to the left‐sided mitral isthmus, and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation, are extrapolated from the patients without ACHD. As AF ablation is intricate in ACHD, it should be performed by a multidisciplinary team of ACHD experts in tertiary centers.

In patients with ACHD, it is of importance to additionally consider that new‐onset AF may reflect a worsening hemodynamic profile, such as the emergence of new/worsening valve disease, shunts, ventricular dysfunction, or surgical pathway obstruction. Managing these conditions could possibly reduce the arrhythmia burden. Subsequently, before addressing AF, patients with ACHD should be evaluated for possible underlying structural causes that may have triggered AF. Whether preoperative AF ablation or intraoperative cryoablation is preferred, in case a concurrent operation is required, depends on the congenital defect, the hemodynamics, and the required surgery; careful individual decisions should be made in expert centers.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial flutter ongoing management — Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is useful in patients with atrial flutter that is either symptomatic or refractory to pharmacological rate control, and beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful to control the ventricular rate in patients with hemodynamically tolerated atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is useful in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter after failure of at least 1 antiarrhythmic agent, and ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). For rhythm maintenance in symptomatic, recurrent atrial flutter, the following drugs can be useful with the drug choice depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities: amiodarone, dofetilide, or sotalol. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF, and catheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options; flecainide or propafenone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic recurrent atrial flutter; and catheter ablation may be reasonable for asymptomatic patients with recurrent atrial flutter.

Mechanisms of Nonisthmus-Dependent Atrial Flutter and Approaches to Mapping and Ablation

The occurrence of AFL after AF ablation is common enough that all operators performing AF ablation should be skilled in mapping and ablating both typical and atypical AFL. The incidence of AFL after AF ablation depends on the type of ablation performed during the initial procedure, varying from 2.6% in centers performing PVI alone to 31% in centers performing linear ablation. AFL is less common after PVI with CB compared with RF-based PVI. The mechanism of AFL is reentry. Reentrant arrhythmias include focal reentry occurring through gaps in the prior PVI line (PV tachycardia) or macroreentry around anatomic obstacles created during ablation (mitral annular flutter, LA roof-dependent flutter, or septal flutters around areas of scar). Typical cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent flutter can also occur (Figure 5).

Determining the location of the reentry circuit starts with examination of the 12-lead ECG. A clear isoelectric line in all 12 leads suggests a focal AT involving a small reentrant circuit (e.g. microreentry), whereas continuous activation suggests a macroreentrant flutter involving a larger circuit. Typical cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent flutter frequently has an atypical appearance on the 12-lead ECG after prior LA ablation, and this should not be excluded based on an atypical ECG appearance alone. Although extensive LA ablation can limit interpretation of the 12-lead ECG, certain rules apply. Tachycardias arising near the PV ostia will typically have an inferior axis and positive F waves across the precordial leads. An "m"-shaped F-wave in lead V1 suggests a left PV exit. Right PV tachycardias are characterized by the ECG amplitude in lead II greater than that in lead III and a positive F wave in lead I. Mitral annular flutter has a similar appearance to left PV tachycardias, although an initial negative component in the precordial leads or amplitude in lead V2 less than that in V1 and V3 might be suggestive. These rules, however, could be less applicable in patients with extensive scarring, including that from prior ablations.

### Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation guided by force-time integral – A randomized study [^e699a6e7]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Force‐time integral (FTI) is an ablation marker of lesion quality and transmurality. A target FTI of 400 gram‐seconds (gs) has been shown to improve durability of pulmonary vein isolation, following atrial fibrillation ablation. However, relevant targets for cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation are lacking.

Hypothesis

We sought to investigate whether CTI ablation with 600 gs FTI lesions is associated with reduced rate of transisthmus conduction recovery compared to 400 gs lesions.

Methods

Fifty patients with CTI‐dependent flutter were randomized to ablation using 400 gs (FTI400 group, n = 26) or 600 gs FTI lesions (FTI600 group, n = 24). The study endpoint was spontaneous or adenosine‐mediated recovery of transisthmus conduction, after a 20‐min waiting period.

Results

The study endpoint occurred in five patients (19.2%) in group FTI400 and in four patients (16.7%) in group FTI600, p = .81. First‐pass CTI block was similar in both groups (50% in FTI400 vs. 54.2% in FTI600, p = .77). There were no differences in the total number of lesions, total ablation time, procedure time and fluoroscopy duration between the two groups. There were no major complications in any group. In the total population, patients not achieving first‐pass CTI block had significantly higher rate of acute CTI conduction recovery, compared to those with first‐pass block (29.2% vs. 7.7% respectively, p = .048).

Conclusions

CTI ablation using 600 gs FTI lesions is not associated with reduced spontaneous or adenosine‐mediated recurrence of transisthmus conduction, compared to 400 gs lesions.

### Our approach to persistent atrial fibrillation in the setting of pulmonary vein isolation [^5074a885]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) despite durable pulmonary vein isolation, there are a variety of approaches to further ablation. Here we summarize our strategy in this population. In brief, our approach is to isolate the posterior wall, ablate the coronary sinus musculature and left lateral ridge, complete a lateral mitral line, and achieve cavotricuspid isthmus block. Subsequently, we target organized atrial flutters and if AF persists, we ablate areas of long, fractionated electrograms within scarred regions. We administer isuprel in patients with a presentation consistent with triggered atrial fibrillation (low scar burden, paroxysms of AF).

### Electrogram polarity and cavotricuspid isthmus block during ablation of typical atrial flutter [^d5162501]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

The atrial activation sequence around the tricuspid annulus has been used to assess whether complete block has been achieved across the cavotricuspid isthmus during radiofrequency ablation of typical atrial flutter. However, sometimes the atrial activation sequence does not clearly establish the presence or absence of complete block. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a change in the polarity of atrial electrograms recorded near the ablation line is an accurate indicator of complete isthmus block.

Methods and Results

Radiofrequency ablation was performed in 34 men and 10 women (age 60 ± 13 years [mean ± SD]) with isthmus-dependent, counterclockwise atrial flutter. Electrograms were recorded around the tricuspid annulus using a duodecapolar halo catheter. Electrograms recorded from two distal electrode pairs (E1 and E2) positioned just anterior to the ablation line were analyzed during atrial flutter and during coronary sinus pacing, before and after ablation. Complete isthmus block was verified by the presence of widely split double electrograms along the entire ablation line. Complete bidirectional isthmus block was achieved in 39 (89%) of 44 patients. Before ablation, the initial polarity of E1 and E2 was predominantly negative during atrial flutter and predominantly positive during coronary sinus pacing. During incomplete isthmus block, the electrogram polarity became reversed either only at E2, or at neither E1 nor E2. In every patient, the polarity of E1 and E2 became negative during coronary sinus pacing only after complete isthmus block was achieved. In 4 patients (10%), the atrial activation sequence recorded with the halo catheter was consistent with complete isthmus block, but the presence of incomplete block was accurately detected by inspection of the polarity of E1 and E2.

Conclusion

Reversal of polarity in bipolar electrograms recorded just anterior to the line of isthmus block during coronary sinus pacing after ablation of atrial flutter is a simple, quick, and accurate indicator of complete isthmus block.

### Usefulness of pre-procedure cavotricuspid isthmus imaging by modified transthoracic echocardiography for predicting outcome of isthmus-dependent atrial flutter ablation [^cc2db4c7]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Anatomic characteristics of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) have been reported to be related to the outcome of atrial flutter ablation therapy. However, preprocedural evaluation of CTI anatomy using modified transthoracic echocardiography to guide atrial flutter ablation has not been well described.

Methods

Transthoracic echocardiography was prospectively performed before atrial flutter ablation in 42 patients with typical CTI-dependent atrial flutter. A modified apical long-axis view was designed to visualize and evaluate anatomic characteristics of the CTI and Eustachian ridge (ER). A prominent ER, extending from the inferior vena cava to the interatrial septum, is defined as an extensive ER.

Results

Twenty-eight patients had straightforward ablation procedures, and 14 patients had difficult ablation procedures. Two patients with difficult procedures had unsuccessful ablation. Multivariate analysis (using CTI length, the presence of a pouch or recess, ER morphology, and significant tricuspid regurgitation as variables) showed that the presence of extensive ER was the only independent predictor of a difficult ablation procedure. The ablation time in patients with extensive ER (n = 13) was significantly longer than in those patients with nonextensive ER (n = 29) (1,638.4 ± 1,548.3 vs 413.8 ± 195.5 sec, P = 0.015). The incidence of difficulty in achieving bidirectional isthmus block was also higher in patients with extensive ER (10 of 13 vs four of 29, P < .001).

Conclusion

Preprocedural transthoracic echocardiography using a modified apical long-axis view is useful to characterize the morphology of the CTI and the ER. An extensive ER is a strong predictor for difficult ablation of CTI-dependent atrial flutter.

Conclusions

Theoretically, aggressive treatment of early recurrences of AF might prevent electrical and structural remodeling and improve long-term outcome. Larger studies with more reliable follow-up methods are needed to clarify the relevance and optimal management of early recurrences.

Atrial Tachycardias After AF Ablation

ATs of new onset make up to 50% of all arrhythmias observed following catheter-based ablation of AF. Most of these tachycardias originate in the LA, although RA cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent flutters might also occur. Patients with a regular AT of new onset might complain of worsening symptoms due to a faster mean ventricular rate (frequently 2:1 ventricular response) than that during AF preablation. Rhythm control is often difficult with AADs.

The mechanisms underlying regular LA tachycardias following AF ablation include focal microreentrant tachycardias originating from reconnected PV ostia or macroreentrant tachycardias around anatomic obstacles or scar from intrinsic LA disease or prior ablation(s) (Figure 5). Occurrence of early AT within 3 months after ablation predicts occurrence of both late AT and AF. However, because up to 49% of ATs resolve with time, ablation should not be undertaken for early AT occurrence unless symptoms cannot be controlled. Initial treatment should include electrical cardioversion and AADs. Because Vaughan Williams Class Ic antiarrhythmic agents promote slow conduction that can facilitate macroreentrant tachycardias, Class III antiarrhythmic agents (dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone), together with negative dromotropic agents, are typically preferred. For those with intolerable symptoms or continued late AT recurrence, detailed activation and entrainment mapping of the tachycardia results in effective ablation in approximately 90% of patients.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Acute outcomes

There were 146 consecutive patients over 75 years receiving a first PVI in our clinic between 08/2009 and 09/2019 with an established diagnosis of either symptomatic paroxysmal (46.6%) or persistent (53.4%) AF. Acute success defined as complete PVI and sinus rhythm at the end of the procedure was achieved in all but one patient (99.3%). In 54.1% PVI was performed using the cryoballoon technique whereas 45.9% where ablated using RF energy (point‐by‐point ablation n = 26; 17.8% and PVAC n = 41; 28.1%). 49.7% of patients were ablated during sinus rhythm, while 50.3% had AF before ablation. In 47.9% of patients an electrical cardio version was performed during the ablation procedure. Prior to ablation, 11.8% already had had ablation of the cavotricuspidal isthmus for atrial flutter. In 4.8% of patients undergoing PVI in additional cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation was performed because of documented atrial flutter.

3.2 Baseline data and demographics

Concerning baseline characteristics, no significant differences were observed if grouped for ablation device. There were significant differences between patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF regarding gender, LA size, and structural heart disease (Table 1A). The mean duration from first diagnosis of AF to ablation was 5.3 ± 4.9 years. Mean EHRA stadium was 2.7 ± 0.5 while mean CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc‐score was 3.9 ± 1.0. The majority of patients (66%) had no evidence of structural heart disease while among the patients with structural heart diseases ischemic cardiomyopathy was most common (19.2%). A history of tachycardiomyopathy was present in 12 pts (8.2%). All but one patient with a Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) occluder were took oral anticoagulation (42.5% vitamin K antagonists, 57.5% direct oral anticoagulants).

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

2015 ACC/AHA/HRS atrial flutter subtypes — cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent atrial flutter (typical) is a macroreentrant atrial tachycardia that propagates around the tricuspid annulus with activation through the cavotricuspid isthmus and produces predominantly negative sawtooth flutter waves on the ECG in leads II, III, and aVF with a positive deflection in V1; the atrial rate can be slower than the typical 300 bpm (cycle length 200 ms) in the presence of antiarrhythmic drugs or scarring; reverse typical cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent atrial flutter propagates in the reverse direction with flutter waves typically positive in the inferior leads and negative in V1; atypical or non–cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent atrial flutter refers to macroreentrant ATs that do not involve the cavotricuspid isthmus and may include reentry around the mitral valve annulus or scar tissue within the left or right atrium.

PFA for Cavotricuspid Isthmus Dependent Typical Right Atrial Flutter

Figure 7 A through F shows the feasibility of PFA in terminating typical atrial flutter. The PFA catheter with flower pose is positioned at the cavotricuspid isthmus (Figure 7 E and 7 F), where entrainment from the PFA catheter shows postpacing interval equal to tachycardia cycle length (Figure 7 A), thereby confirming cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent typical atrial flutter. Nitroglycerin was administered before the PFA application at the cavotricuspid isthmus, which terminated atrial flutter to sinus rhythm (Figure 7 B), differential pacing at the proximal CS shows double atrial potentials (Figure 7 C). The 12-Lead ECG showed no ST elevation during or after the PFA applications at the cavotricuspid isthmus (Figure 7 D; the patient underwent continuous ECG monitoring for 48 hours before discharge.).

Potential risk of coronary spasm when using PFA remains a concern, especially when the PFA involves or is close to the coronary arteries. The mechanism might be due to direct local electrical effects on smooth muscle cells or vascular endothelium, and/or vasoconstrictive response to PFA. Safety measures include PFA setting optimization, preventive giving vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, and careful monitoring to detect early signs of coronary spasm or other abnormalities.

The optimal protocol to administer nitroglycerin is yet to be determined, recent study suggests that 3 mg i.v. bolus pre-PFA, during PFA 2 mg bolus every 2 minutes, and 2 mg bolus post-PFA appears to effectively prevent coronary artery spasm, during which patients also receive phenylephrine (0.3 ± 0.2 mg) divided in 1 to 3 doses pre-, intra-, and post-PFA based on blood pressure. Further research is warranted to evaluate acute and long-term effects of PFA on coronary arteries compared with traditional ablation energies.

### Intravenous adenosine to predict conduction recurrence in cavotricuspid isthmus early after ablation of typical atrial flutter: myth or reality? [^65269a1a]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Early recovery of conduction (ER) after cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation for typical atrial flutter (AFl) occurs in approximately 10% of the patients. If not recognized, ER might lead to AFl recurrences. In this study, we hypothesized that intravenous adenosine (iADO) can be used to predict ER in the CTI immediately after RF ablation and distinguish functional block from the complete destruction of the CTI myocardium.

Methods

We prospectively included 68 consecutive patients (age: 65 ± 14 years; male: 78%) referred in our centers for AFl ablation. Immediately after bidirectional isthmus block validation, a bolus of iADO was given during continuous pacing from the proximal coronary sinus. Patients with functional block revealed under iADO (iADO+) and those without (iADO-) were subsequently observed for a 30-minute waiting period (ER-) or until sustained recovery of the conduction through the CTI (ER+).

Results

Seven patients presented a persistent recovery (ER+, 10.3%, mean time to recovery: 14 ± 9 minutes). None of them presented even a transient resumption of conduction under iADO (iADO+: 0). With univariate analysis, we identified a heavy patient weight (> 95 kg) as a predictor of ER (sensitivity: 71%).

Conclusions

Adenosine does not predict early recovery in the CTI after linear ablation for atrial flutter. We found that a patient weight over 95 kg predicted early recovery of conduction through the CTI with a sensitivity of 71%.

### Characteristics of cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for atrial flutter guided by novel parameters using a contact force catheter [^ba0c30ce]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

This study sought to investigate specific contact force (CF) parameters to guide cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation and compare the outcome with a historical control cohort.

Methods and Results

Patients (30) undergoing CTI ablation were enrolled prospectively in the Study cohort and compared with a retrospective Control cohort of 30 patients. Ablation in the Study cohort was performed using CF parameters > 10 g and < 40 g and a Force Time Integral (FTI) of 800 ± 10 g. The Control cohort underwent traditionally guided CTI ablation. Traditional parameters (electrogram and impedance change) were assessed in both cohorts. All ablations regardless of achieving targets were included in data analysis. Bidirectional CTI block was achieved in all of the Study and 27 of the Control cohort. Atrial flutter recurred in 3 (10%) patients (follow-up 564 ± 212 days) in the study cohort and in 3 (10%) patients (follow-up 804 ± 540 days) in the Control cohort. There were no major complications in either cohort. Traditional parameters correlated poorly with CF parameters. In the Study cohort, flutter recurrence was associated with significantly lower FTI and ablation duration, but was not associated with total average CF.

Conclusion

CTI ablation can be safely performed using CF parameters guiding ablation, with similar long-term results to a historical ablation control group. Potentially CF parameters may provide adjunctive information to enable a more efficient CTI ablation. Further research is required to confirm this.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia classification — Macroreentrant atrial tachycardia/atrial flutter is characterized by constant regular P-wave/flutter wave morphology with rate typically > 250 bpm* and mechanism of macroreentry, whereas focal atrial tachycardia shows discrete P waves with an isoelectric segment, rate typically 100–250 bpm*, and mechanisms of microreentry or automaticity. Cavotricuspid isthmus dependent flutter is a right atrial reentry dependent on conduction through the cavotricuspid isthmus and can be cured by ablation creating conduction block in the cavotricuspid isthmus, while not cavotricuspid isthmus dependent ("Atypical Atrial Flutter") is reentry that is not dependent on conduction through the cavotricuspid isthmus, with circuits usually defined by atrial scars from prior heart surgery, ablation, or idiopathic, where location determines ablation approach and risks and multiple reentry circuits can be present. Typical atrial flutter includes counterclockwise atrial flutter with ECG flutter waves negative in II, III, aVF and positive in V1, and clockwise atrial flutter (reverse typical atrial flutter) with ECG flutter waves positive in II, III, aVF and negative in V1, with V1 typically opposite in polarity to inferior leads; atypical flutter may be suggested on ECG by P-wave polarity that does not fit typical atrial flutter (for example, concordant P-wave polarity between V1 and inferior leads).

This study evaluates the long-term clinical outcome of 56 consecutive patients affected by atrial fibrillation and drug-related typical atrial flutter who underwent cavo-tricuspid isthmus radiofrequency ablation. Symptomatic arrhythmic events recurred after ablation in 64% of the patients during follow-up of 19 ± 9 months. Even in those who had recurrences, there was a substantial reduction in the incidence of episodes, quality of life was improved, and hospitalizations decreased.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^0b8af360]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial flutter (AFL) and macroreentrant atrial tachycardia (AT) — typical, reverse typical, and atypical circuits with electrocardiogram (ECG) features — are described as occurring in many of the same situations as atrial fibrillation (AF). Typical AFL, also called cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)–dependent AFL, involves a macroreentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus traversing the CTI on the right side and is associated with sawtooth flutter waves in inferior ECG leads when counterclockwise; the clockwise variant is termed reverse typical AFL. If the flutter circuit is not tricuspid valve/isthmus related, it is termed atypical AFL, also known as noncavotricuspid isthmus–dependent macroreentrant AT, and prior type I/type II terminology is no longer used.

### Twelve-lead ECG interpretation in a patient with presumed left atrial flutter following AF ablation [^f52e4332]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

The 12-lead ECG provides valuable clues to the mechanism and origin of organized tachycardias occurring in patients after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Many of these patients have cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent flutter, and therefore it is important to be aware of variations from the norm of typical flutter. Left atrial reentrant tachycardias are, however, the most common arrhythmias encountered after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. The underlying circuits are typically formed around anatomic obstacles such as the PV ostia or the mitral valve, and facilitated by slow conducting, low voltage isthmuses through gaps through and bordering ablation lesions. They can be recognized by the presence of 12-lead synchronous iso-electric intervals separating flutter waves. Continuous activity ECGs (without 12-lead iso-electric intervals) are typical of larger size reentrant circuits not dependent on markedly slow conducting isthmuses. Delayed bystander activity can also however obscure iso-electric intervals. The integration of informed ECG analysis with a detailed knowledge of the index ablation strategy can provide an optimum platform for successful catheter ablation of these often very symptomatic arrhythmias.

### Reduction in atrial flutter ablation time by targeting maximum voltage: results of a prospective randomized clinical trial [^688f4974]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is an established therapy for typical atrial flutter. Previous studies have demonstrated that the CTI is often composed of discrete muscle bundles, and evidence has suggested that these bundles correlate with high-voltage local electrograms in the tricuspid isthmus. This randomized, multicenter clinical trial was designed to prospectively compare the hypothesis that a maximum voltage-guided (MVG) technique targets critical conducting bundles in the isthmus, as reflected by a reduction in ablation requirements compared to the anatomical approach to atrial flutter ablation.

Methods

Bidirectional block was achieved in patients undergoing ablation for typical atrial flutter using 1 of 2 randomly assigned methods. The anatomical approach produced a contiguous line of ablation lesions from the inferior aspect of the tricuspid annulus to the inferior vena cava using a standard method. The MVG technique sequentially targeted the maximum voltage local electrograms in the CTI along a similar line.

Results

Sixty-nine patients were randomized, with mean age 63 ± 10 and 58 (84%) male. Among patients in the anatomic group (n = 34), mean ablation time was 11.2 ± 7.5 minutes compared to 5.9 ± 3.3 in the MVG group (n = 35) (P = 0.0026). A mean of 14.2 ± 9.7 ablation lesions were created in the anatomic group, and 7.9 ± 4.8 in the MVG group (P = 0.0042).

Conclusions

Ablation for atrial flutter using an MVG technique results in significantly less ablation requirements than the traditional approach, potentially by concentrating ablation lesions on the muscle bundles responsible for transisthmus conduction.

### Left atrial ablation versus biatrial ablation for persistent and permanent atrial fibrillation: a prospective and randomized study [^dfcc2386]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare — in patients with persistent and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) — the efficacy and safety of left atrial ablation with that of a biatrial approach.

Background

Left atrium-based catheter ablation of AF, although very effective in the paroxysmal form of the arrhythmia, has an insufficient efficacy in patients with persistent and permanent AF.

Methods

Eighty highly symptomatic patients (age, 58.6 ± 8.9 years) with persistent (n = 43) and permanent AF (n = 37), refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs, were randomized to two different ablation approaches guided by electroanatomical mapping. A procedure including circumferential pulmonary vein, mitral isthmus, and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was performed in 41 cases (left atrial ablation group). In the remaining 39 patients (biatrial ablation group), the aforementioned approach was integrated by the following lesions in the right atrium: intercaval posterior line, intercaval septal line, and electrical disconnection of the superior vena cava.

Results

During follow-up (mean duration 14 ± 5 months), AF recurred in 39% of patients in the left atrial ablation group and in 15% of patients in the biatrial ablation group (p = 0.022). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that ablation technique was an independent predictor of AF recurrence during follow-up.

Conclusions

In patients with persistent and permanent AF, circumferential pulmonary vein ablation, combined with linear lesions in the right atrium, is feasible, safe, and has a significantly higher success rate than left atrial and cavotricuspid ablation alone.

### Correlation of atrial electrocardiographic amplitude with radiofrequency energy required to ablate cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter [^739ea27b]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a possible correlation between atrial ECG amplitude in common atrial flutter (AFL) and radiofrequency (RF) energy required to achieve cavotricuspid isthmus block.

Background

The amount of RF delivery required for ablation of typical AFL is variable. This variation has been attributed to the cavotricuspid isthmus anatomy. Atrial ECG amplitude can be a marker of atrial anatomic variations and therefore may correlate with RF duration required to achieve cavotricuspid isthmus block.

Methods

Seventy consecutive patients were prospectively studied. Ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was performed by creating a line of block between the inferior tricuspid annulus and the inferior caval vein using 8-mm-tip electrode catheters. If more than 20 minutes of RF time was required to achieve conduction block, the catheter was changed to an irrigated-tip catheter. Atrial ECG amplitude was assessed in leads II, III, aVF, and aVL.

Results

A total of 14 ± 11 minutes of RF energy was delivered to achieve block in all patients; 12 patients (8%) required more than 20 minutes. Atrial ECG amplitude showed highly significant correlations with cumulative RF energy (F and P waves in lead II: r = 0.703 and r = 0.737, P < .001). P-wave amplitude < 0.2 mV and/or flutter wave amplitude < 0.35 mV in lead II have a high negative predictive value to predict < 20 min RF delivery (96% and 89% respectively).

Conclusions

A significant correlation exists between atrial ECG amplitude and amount of RF required to ablate typical AFL. Atrial ECG amplitude may be a surrogate marker of characteristics of isthmus anatomy. These findings may influence the choice of catheter used for cavotricuspid isthmus ablation.

### Typical atrial flutter: a practical review [^df2d4277]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Typical atrial flutter (AFL), defined as cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia, often causes debilitating symptoms, and is associated with increased incidence of atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure, and death. Typical AFL occurs in patients with atrial remodeling and shares risk factors with atrial fibrillation. It is also common in patients with a history of prior heart surgery or catheter ablation. It is characterized by a recognizable ECG pattern that is highly predictive of CTI-dependent re-entry in patients without iatrogenic atrial scars. Typical AFL is difficult to manage medically due to poor efficacy of rate-controlling and antiarrhythmic drugs. Catheter ablation has been established in randomized trials to be superior to medical management in terms of safety, efficacy, and clinical outcomes including hospitalization and quality of life. Catheter ablation aims at achieving bidirectional conduction block across the CTI, which can be efficiently assessed by well-established techniques such as differential pacing. Long-term ablation success requires creating a stable transmural and continuous lesion, which can be optimized by systematic assessment of ablation parameters and lesion contiguity. The present review discusses the epidemiology, mechanisms, ECG characteristics, medical management, and catheter ablation of typical AFL.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent atrial flutter — definition and electrocardiographic features: Atrial flutter is a macroreentrant atrial arrhythmia characterized by regular atrial rate and constant P-wave morphology. When the atrial flutter circuit involves the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI), it is labeled CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Counterclockwise CTI-dependent atrial flutter is characterized electrocardiographically by dominant negative flutter waves in the inferior leads and a positive P wave in lead V1 at atrial rates of 250 bpm to 350 bpm, whereas clockwise isthmus-dependent flutter shows the opposite pattern with positive flutter waves in the inferior leads and negative flutter waves in lead V1. Although the atrial rates for flutter typically range from 250 bpm to 330 bpm, the rates may be slower in patients with severe atrial disease or in patients taking antiarrhythmic agents or after unsuccessful catheter ablation.

Atrial flutter (AFL) ablation — efficacy, complications, and subsequent atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation of typical AFL is reported as effective and relatively low risk, with meta-analysis estimates showing an acute success rate of 90% and a complication rate of 2.6%. After AFL ablation, atrial fibrillation occurred in 34%, with a recurrence rate of 23% in those without prior AF versus 53% with prior AF, and by 5 years AF developed in 60% to 70% of patients regardless of prior AF history. The typical substrate is the critical isthmus formed by the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve.

### Predictors of acute failure ablation of intra-atrial Re-entrant tachycardia in patients with congenital heart disease: cardiac disease, atypical flutter, and previous atrial fibrillation [^7bbd16db]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intra‐atrial re‐entrant tachycardia in patients with congenital heart disease increases morbidity and mortality. Radiofrequency catheter ablation has evolved as the first‐line treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze the acute success and to identify predictors of failedradiofrequency catheter ablation in.

Methods and Results

The observational study included all consecutive patients withwho underwent a first ablation procedure forat a single center from January 2009 to December 2015 (94 patients, 39.4% female, age: 36.55 ± 14.9 years). In the first procedure, 114were ablated (acute success: 74.6%; 1.21 ± 0.41per patient) with an acute success of 74.5%. Cavotricuspid isthmus–relatedwas the only arrhythmia in 51%; non–cavotricuspid isthmus–relatedwas the only mechanism in 27.7% and 21.3% of the patients had both types of. Predictors of acute radiofrequency catheter ablation failure were as follows: nonrelated cavotricuspid isthmus(odds ratio 7.3; confidence interval [CI] 1.9–17.9; P = 0.04), previous atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 6.1; CI, 1.3–18.4; P = 0.02), transposition of great arteries (odds ratio, 4.9; CI, 1.4–17.2; P = 0.01) and systemic ventricle dilation (odds ratio 4.8; CI, 1.1–21.7; P = 0.04) with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 ± 0.056 (CI, 0.74–0.93, P = 0.001). After a mean follow‐up longer than 3.5 years, 78.3% of the patients were in sinus rhythm (33.1% of the patients required more than 1 radiofrequency catheter ablation procedure).

Conclusions

Although ablation inis a challenging procedure, acute success of 75% can be achieved in moderate–highly complexpatients in a referral center. Predictors of failed ablation aredifferent from cavotricuspid isthmus, previous atrial fibrillation, and markers of complex(transposition of great arteries, systemic ventricle dilation).

### Empirical superior vena cava electrical isolation guided by quantitative ablation index improves outcomes of radiofrequency catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^0a2ec421]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The study has several limitations. First, this study is a single-operator, retrospective study without matching between the two groups. Differences in LA diameter, the frequency of empirical extra-PV linear ablation and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation (29% vs 16%) may affect the clinical results. Second, the study is retrospective in nature and single-centred with a relatively small sample size. The incidence of procedural complications might be underestimated, as no postprocedural imaging exam was systematically performed. However, no patient reported clinical symptoms potentially related to these complications. Our ongoing randomised study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT:05908955) will further address these issues. Third, the recurrence rate of AF may be underestimated, as some patients may experience short-duration, asymptomatic AF episodes between follow-up visits. We have employed 14-day ambulatory ECG during follow-up to maximise the detection of potential AF episodes. Previous studies have also used this approach during follow-up. Indeed, compared with the 14-day ambulatory ECG, the implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) is more accurate for assessing AF recurrence. However, in clinical practice, the use of ICM is limited due to its invasive nature and high cost, patients are reluctant to undergo the procedure, which restricts its application in routine clinical practice.

### Outcome of catheter ablation in the very elderly-insights from a large matched analysis [^1012ec54]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

As life expectancy is steadily increasing and quality of life remains high also in the very elderly, the health system is in a constant transition and challenges have changed over time. With increasing age arrhythmias are becoming clinically manifest in a growing number of patients, too. The need and wish for definitive therapy is also growing due to improved ablation techniques and consequently higher success rates. Catheter ablation has evolved as first line therapy for various arrhythmias. This is reflected in the recently updated ESC guidelines for the management of supraventricular tachycardias (SVT). 1 Of note, recommendations for ablation procedures are not limited to a special group of patients. While guidelines have devoted paragraphs to the specialized treatment of patients with congenital heart disease or during pregnancy, no specific recommendations are made for older patients. 1

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are very prevalent in the elderly. For typical AFL in particular, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation (CTI) has evolved as the gold standard since the 1990s in most patients as recurrence rate is high and treatment by CTI characterized by very high success rates. 2, 3 Surprisingly, recent evidence found markedly higher complication rates related to CTI than previously reported. 4 Advanced age was found to be a major risk factor so that the authors postulated that patient selection for CTI should be made particularly careful in the elderly in whom outcome studies on CTI are scarce. In contrast to AFL, atrioventricular nodal re‐entry tachycardia (AVNRT) manifests/presents most often in young and middle‐aged adults. Interestingly, more recent studies showed, that effectiveness of slow‐pathway modulation was greater in younger patients compared to patients > 50 years. 5 In addition, age seems to be a relevant factor in socioeconomic aspects of AVNRT ablation. Farkowski et al 6 showed that treatment costs were higher with increased patient age.

### Catheter ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation… [^28d551f5]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Compared with treatments for other cardiac arrhythmias, the treatment of atrial fibrillation has changed dramatically in the last 25 years. The landmark work of Haïssaguerre et al1 established the pulmonary veins as the initiation site of AF in the majority of cases and launched the era of ablative therapies for this most common of arrhythmias. In parallel with these developments, clinical trials have demonstrated higher success rates with ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs, while the debate over rate vs rhythm control has tilted to favor the latter in light of studies showing improved outcomes in select populations with AF. 2, 3 These advances have made pulmonary vein isolation the cornerstone of ablation therapy for AF. However, while this approach to ablation therapy for paroxysmal AF has improved with time, the success rates in patients with persistent AF have remained stubbornly modest. Passman R.

### Stroke and systemic embolism after successful ablation of typical atrial flutter [^fbebeaae]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Following successful cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation during typical atrial flutter (AFL), anticoagulation therapy is usually withdrawn. However, potential subsequent atrial fibrillation (AF) in these patients may increase embolic risk in the long term. Embolic rates in this setting have not been clearly established. Our aim was to determine the incidence of stroke/systemic embolism following radiofrequency ablation of AFL, particularly in those without a prior history of AF.

Hypothesis

After succesful AFL ablation, patients may suffer embolic complications in the long-term follow-up, mainly due to asymptomatic AF episodes.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent CTI ablation due to AFL in our center between 2006 and 2009.

Results

During the study period, 188 patients (mean age, 62.9 ± 8.6 years) underwent CTI ablation; 120 without prior AF were included in the study. At the end of the follow-up period (mean, 5.0 ± 2.4 years), 56.7% of patients (68/120) remained in sinus rhythm, 7/120 experienced a recurrence of AFL, and 45/120 (38%) developed AF. Ischemic stroke occurred in 11 patients and systemic embolism in 1. Of these patients, 5 had documented AF following AFL ablation. In the remaining 7 cases, previously undiagnosed AF was subsequently diagnosed at the time of stroke/embolism.

Conclusions

Patients with AFL who undergo successful ablation are by no means free from embolic complications during long-term follow-up, mainly due to a high rate of AF development. Given the difficulties in detecting AF and the uncertainty about the temporal relation of AF and stroke, oral anticoagulation may need to be continued in those patients with underlying stroke risk factors.

### Hybrid epicardial and endocardial ablation of atrial fibrillation: is ablation on two sides of the atrial wall better than one? [^42b225c1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale for a Hybrid Surgical and Catheter Ablation Approach

Particularly in patients with long‐standing persistent atrial fibrillation, epicardial‐only minimally invasive surgical atrial fibrillation has modest efficacy. There are several opportunities to improve the outcomes of epicardial‐only minimally invasive surgical atrial fibrillation ablation. The primary rationale for hybrid surgical and catheter ablation – is the assessment of gaps and the ability to ablate these gaps. A secondary goal of the catheter ablation part of the procedure is to create lesions that are surgically difficult or impossible from the epicardial surface. These include a cavotricuspid isthmus line and completion of lines to the mitral annulus. In the Cox‐Maze‐IV procedure cryoablation was performed at the mitral annulus to complete the mitral annular line and endocardial radiofrequency ablation is currently used to replace these lesions.

There are biophysical reasons why the epicardial delivery of radiofrequency energy is limited in terms of energy and heat transfer. Excessive heating of the epicardial layers increases tissue impedance reducing current delivery. Thus repeat applications of energy may have diminishing returns. In addition excessive heating at the epicardial surface may occur while deeper layers of tissue are cooled by the endocardial intracavitary blood flow. Combining endocardial ablation with epicardial ablation may have advantages in creating transmural lesions, particularly in areas of increased tissue thickness or in patients with scar or extremely large atria.

### Methods to access the surgically excluded cavotricuspid isthmus for complete ablation of typical atrial flutter in patients with congenital heart defects [^677bd9d9]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cavotricuspid isthmus (CVTI)-dependent flutter in postoperative congenital heart disease patients is common and difficult to treat.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate techniques for accessing excluded portions of the CVTI after Fontan or atrial switch procedures and completely ablating flutter.

Methods

Patients who had undergone Fontan or atrial switch procedures and had CVTI-dependent flutter requiring ablation between 1990 and 2007 were identified. Flutters induced, methods for accessing the CVTI, use of intracardiac echocardiography, complications, and success rates were noted.

Results

Sixteen patients (44% males, mean age at ablation 28 years) were identified: 14 prior Fontan and 2 Mustard repair, with a total of 19 ablation procedures. In 13 (81%) of 16 patients, access to the entire CVTI could not be achieved via a systemic venous route. The excluded CVTI was accessed by retrograde transaortic approach in 6 and by anterograde transconduit puncture in 1 patient, with termination and lack of reinducibility of CVTI-dependent flutter achieved in all cases. One patient developed high-grade AV block requiring pacemaker therapy. Follow-up data (range 1–89 months, mean 29 months) were available for 18 of 19 procedures. CVTI atrial flutter recurred in 1 of 7 patients involving access to the pulmonary venous side.

Conclusion

Even when surgical procedures exclude a portion of the CVTI, complete ablation of "typical" atrial flutter, including documentation of bidirectional block, can be achieved by novel approaches targeting the surgically excluded arrhythmogenic atrial tissue.

### Atrial flutter with a large bystander segment without double potentials in the cavotricuspid isthmus [^a2223642]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

We present two cases of common-type atrial flutter with a large bystander segment without double potentials in the cavotricuspid isthmus. In both cases, right atrial angiography demonstrated a prominent pouch at the center of the isthmus. When radiofrequency energy was applied to the tricuspid side of the isthmus, delayed potentials abruptly appeared on the local electrograms. When radiofrequency energy was applied on the inferior vena cava side of the isthmus, the tachycardia was terminated. Although ablation was not applied to the bottom of the pouch, bidirectional isthmus block was achieved. These outcomes indicate that the pouch represented a bystander segment.

Mechanism and Ablation of Atrial Tachycardia

Ablation of ATs was conducted in 25 (38.4%) patients, targeting a total of 54 ATs. Out of 47 patients in which a PVI only had been performed previously, 14 (27.7%) patients developed AT, whereas 10 of 17 (58.8%) patients with a previous ablation of CFAE presented with AT. One patient had a primary AT, as mentioned above. The mechanism was characterized as a macro‐reentry tachycardia in 37 (68.5%), as a localized reentry in 12 (22.2%), or as a true focal mechanism in 1 (1.9%) of the AT in question. The mechanism was not conclusively detectable and thus not classified for the remaining 4 (7.4%) ATs. As for macro‐reentry ATs, a linear ablation was performed at the LA roof (n = 10), the mitral isthmus (n = 11), and the anterior LA (n = 16). Localized reentry ATs were identified in various different locations (Figure 3), and ablation in the left or right atrium was conducted as appropriate. These ATs were located at the atrial septum (n = 3), the inferior LA (n = 2), the anterior LA (n = 2), near the ostium of coronary sinus (n = 1), in close vicinity of the right superior PV (n = 1), near the superior vena cava (n = 1), at the base of the left atrial appendage (n = 1), and at the posterior LA roof (n = 1). A true focal AT was located at the ostium of the coronary sinus (n = 1). An additional ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was performed in 14 (56.0%) of those patients either empirically (n = 2), because of previously reported typical atrial flutter (n = 9), or after the identification of cavotricuspid isthmus dependent atrial flutter (n = 3) during the electrophysiologic study (a repeat ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus was necessary for 1 patient during a subsequent ablation procedure).

Figure 2
Non‐PV ablation sites. The differences in non‐PV ablation according to ablation energy are shown (PF energy in red, thermal energy in blue). Anterior wall ablation was more common in thermal ablation and posterior wall ablation in PF ablation. CTI, cavotricuspid isthmus; LA, left atrium; PV, pulmonary veins; PF, pulsed field.

Several ATs were noted during the procedures. Perimitral atrial flutter was induced in four patients and developed spontaneously in two patients. It was treated by anterior wall ablation in three, mitral isthmus ablation in two and anterior wall ablation after unsuccessful mitral isthmus ablation in one patient. Typical atrial flutter was present in four patients at the onset of the procedure, was induced in seven patients, and developed spontaneously in four patients; all were treated by cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. Several microreentrant ATs were observed: ongoing AT in one patient, which was ablated at the anterior wall; induced ATs in six patients (three ablated at the anterior wall, one at the ostium of LA appendage and two right‐atrial ATs ‐ one terminated spontaneously and the other ablated at the inferolateral right atrium); and spontaneously developed ATs in five patients (two ablated at the anterior wall, one septal terminated spontaneously, 1 ablated at the mitral annulus and one ablated at posterior tricuspid annulus). All patients ended the CA procedure in sinus rhythm.

In one patient in the PFA group, in whom the procedure started in deep sedation, intubation and conversion to general anesthesia were necessary because of hypoventilation and the need for airway management. Despite this, CA was completed successfully without adverse sequelae. No other complications or adverse effects were observed in the entire cohort.

### Atypical access to typical atrial flutter [^599fc13b]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Typical atrial flutter with reentry around the tricuspid valve can easily be cured by ablating the cavotricuspid isthmus. In the reported case, transvenous access to the tricuspid valve was not possible because of a total cavopulmonal connection in congenital mitral atresia. Successful angioplasty of a small fenestration between the total cavopulmonal connection and the genuine right atrium (RA) allowed anterograde transvenous access to the RA. Electroanatomic RA mapping confirmed peritricuspid reentry, and successful ablation was performed.

### Improvement in quality of life after catheter ablation for paroxysmal versus long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation: a prospective study with 3-year follow-up [^e4e87e9f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Population

We consecutively scrutinized 285 patients with PAF and 127 patients with LSPAF who underwent their first AF ablation at 2 centers between January 2007 and July 2009. The majority of LSPAF patients included in this study were previously investigated for global hemodynamic, functional, and QoL benefit. Study investigations were approved by the local ethics committee, and all patients gave written informed consent.

Electroanatomic Mapping and Catheter Ablation

During the procedure, a 10‐pole circular catheter (Lasso; Biosense Webster) and a mapping/ablation catheter (NaviStar ThermoCool; Biosense Webster) were inserted via 2 nonsteerable transseptal sheaths into the left atrium (LA). Heparin was given to maintain activated clotting time of 300 to 400 seconds.

Electroanatomic imaging was performed by the CARTO system (Biosense Webster). Radiofrequency energy was applied with a Stockert (Biosense Webster) generator with irrigation of 17 to 30 mL/min and temperature and power limits of 42°C and 35 W, respectively. Irrigation and power were limited to 20 mL/min and 20 to 25 W, respectively, inside the coronary sinus (CS).

Patients with PAF underwent wide‐area pulmonary vein (PV) isolation validated with use of the circular catheter. They received supplementary ablation for extra PV arrhythmic sources when manifested during the procedure. Likewise, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was performed when typical atrial flutter was previously documented or occurred during the procedure. Ablation strategy in patients with LSPAF has been described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, mandatory wide‐area PV isolation with mitral isthmus, LA roof, and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation were successively performed in all patients. When AF continued, a stepwise approach consisting of CS ablation/isolation and additional linear and electrogram‐guided ablation was performed with the desired end point of SR restoration through ablation.

The end point of repeat procedures, in addition to SR restoration by ablation, PV reisolation, and restoration of conduction block across linear lesions, included noninducibility of AF or atrial tachycardia (AT) by incremental pacing up to 300 bpm and intravenous challenge with isoproterenol and/or adenosine.
