## Question

Would a 94 year old immobile female with current femur fracture and history of osteoporosis benefit from bisphosphonate treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 94-year-old, immobile woman with a recent femur fracture and a history of osteoporosis would benefit from bisphosphonate treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline fracture risk and guideline indications for therapy. Then, I should verify whether there is any contraindication due to the acute fracture. Next, I will weigh the magnitude of benefit from bisphosphonates, including time-to-benefit. After that, I need to evaluate harms relevant to her age and mobility, especially atypical femur fracture risk. Then, I should consider drug selection and timing. Finally, I will integrate non-pharmacologic care and align the decision with guideline principles for very elderly, frail patients, making sure I have checked all major recommendations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the risk category and indication. A hip or femoral fracture in a 94-year-old woman constitutes established osteoporosis and places her in the highest risk stratum for future fragility fractures, which meets strong recommendations for pharmacologic therapy in major guidelines, so she clearly has an indication to treat rather than observe or use a drug holiday approach [^1171HMRv] [^113WfNAn].

> Wait, let me verify whether an acute femur fracture is a contraindication to starting bisphosphonates. There is no absolute contraindication to initiating bisphosphonate therapy during or immediately after a hip fracture; in fact, trials and reviews support initiation in the acute and post-acute period, and in this context, zoledronic acid has randomized evidence of reduced recurrent fractures and reduced mortality when given soon after hip fracture, so the acute event should trigger treatment rather than delay it [^1113xGtU] [^113LWMKp].

> I need to check the expected magnitude of benefit and the time-to-benefit in a very old patient. High-certainty evidence shows bisphosphonates reduce hip fractures by about 6 per 1000 treated over roughly 3 years and nonvertebral fractures by about 18 per 1000, with time-to-benefit around 12–20 months for clinically meaningful hip and nonvertebral fracture risk reduction, so if life expectancy exceeds roughly a year, benefit is plausible even at age 94, acknowledging her high baseline risk and competing mortality risk [^1129ThYd] [^112owcqq] [^115o8Ate].

> Hold on, I should verify age-specific considerations and the evidence gap in the oldest old. Some reviews note that many trials under-represent patients over 80, yet major guidelines extrapolate benefit to older adults, and in the highest-risk phenotypes — like a recent hip fracture — the absolute risk reduction is greatest, which supports treatment despite advanced age when life expectancy is at least a year, which appears reasonable here based on typical geriatric trajectories after hip fracture [^114WJ9Xo] [^115o8Ate].

> Next, I should review harms pertinent to her age and immobility. Atypical femur fractures are rare but increase with duration of bisphosphonate exposure, rising from about 3 per 100,000 person-years after 2 years to roughly 20 per 100,000 at 5 years and about 50 per 100,000 beyond 8 years. Importantly, the absolute risk remains very low, and for each AFF, more than 1,000 fractures are prevented, so the benefit–risk balance remains favorable in high-risk patients, especially with a finite treatment horizon and monitoring for prodromal thigh pain [^112TJ2qa] [^113L1Hpo].

> I should double-check the practical approach to duration and drug selection. Given her very high risk, a short, finite course of an intravenous bisphosphonate is reasonable to maximize adherence and early benefit; zoledronic acid 5 mg IV annually for 1–3 years, followed by reassessment, is aligned with guideline-endorsed first-line therapy and the evidence base for post-hip fracture benefit, with subsequent decisions about continuation or a drug holiday based on risk reassessment and BMD response [^113WfNAn] [^1113xGtU] [^111zvn9u] [^1129L4dq].

> But wait, what if oral therapy is preferred for logistics or cost. Oral alendronate or risedronate are acceptable alternatives, though adherence and absorption requirements can be challenging in frail, immobile patients; IV zoledronate avoids GI intolerance and ensures administration, which is often advantageous in the post-acute care setting, so I would favor IV therapy initially and consider oral options only if IV access or infusion logistics are problematic [^113WfNAn] [^1156o7Am].

> I need to ensure we do not overlook non-pharmacologic care. Falls prevention, adequate calcium and vitamin D, and rehabilitation are essential adjuncts. Immobility itself is a risk factor for fracture and bone loss, so optimizing nutrition, addressing secondary causes of osteoporosis, and implementing fall-risk mitigation remain critical even when pharmacotherapy is initiated [^116aaDHq] [^115NHkjj] [^113WfNAn].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance and guideline alignment. The patient has a clear indication for bisphosphonate therapy, there is no contraindication to starting now, the expected absolute fracture risk reduction is substantial in this very high-risk phenotype, and the harms are rare and manageable with a finite course and vigilance for prodromal symptoms. Therefore, I would recommend initiating bisphosphonate therapy, preferably zoledronic acid 5 mg IV annually for 1–3 years, with reassessment of fracture risk, BMD, and the need for continuation or a drug holiday thereafter [^1171HMRv] [^1129ThYd] [^113WfNAn] [^111zvn9u].

In select 94-year-old immobile women with a femur fracture and osteoporosis, **bisphosphonates are reasonable** if life expectancy exceeds ~12 months [^115o8Ate] and there is no contraindication, as they reduce future fracture risk [^1129ThYd] and improve survival after hip fracture [^1113xGtU]. Use **IV zoledronic acid** to avoid GI side effects and limit therapy to 1–3 years with reassessment, balancing benefits against the low but rising risk of atypical femur fractures with prolonged use [^112TJ2qa] [^113L1Hpo]. If life expectancy is limited or risks outweigh benefits, prioritize pain control and supportive care.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting bisphosphonate therapy

Bisphosphonates reduce vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures in older adults with osteoporosis [^1129ThYd] [^1125F1Wr]; in the HORIZON trial, **zoledronic acid reduced new clinical fractures by 35% and mortality by 28% after hip fracture** [^1113xGtU]. The time-to-benefit for nonvertebral fracture prevention is ~12 months, supporting use when life expectancy exceeds 12 months [^115o8Ate].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of bisphosphonate therapy

- **Atypical femur fractures**: Rare but increase with duration, especially beyond 5 years; absolute risk is low (~3–50 per 100,000 person-years) [^112TJ2qa] [^113L1Hpo].
- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Rare (~0.01–0.3%) and mainly with invasive dental procedures or high-dose therapy [^113NrPCw].
- **Acute phase reactions**: Flu-like symptoms after IV zoledronic acid, usually self-limited [^1125t6wA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines support bisphosphonates as first-line therapy for osteoporosis, including after hip fracture, with individualized decisions in the very elderly [^1171HMRv] [^113WfNAn]. ACOG and AACE recommend initiating bisphosphonates after hip fracture and considering a drug holiday after 3–5 years if risk is no longer high [^111zvn9u].

---

## Special considerations for immobile patients

Immobility increases osteoporosis severity and fracture risk; bisphosphonates can reduce future fractures even in non-ambulatory patients. Use **IV zoledronic acid** to avoid GI side effects and adherence issues with oral agents [^114vv5cs].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

- **Denosumab**: Effective alternative, but risk of multiple vertebral fractures upon discontinuation; requires ongoing therapy or transition to bisphosphonate [^115kJss3].
- **Teriparatide or abaloparatide**: Anabolic options for severe osteoporosis, but limited duration (18–24 months) and require subsequent antiresorptive therapy [^112RR2VL] [^116WczUx].

---

## Clinical decision-making framework

| **Factor** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|
| Life expectancy | ≥ 12 months supports bisphosphonate therapy [^115o8Ate] |
| Fracture risk | High risk supports therapy [^117Q9vGy] |
| Mobility status | Immobility increases risk; bisphosphonates still beneficial |
| Comorbidities | Assess renal function, GI tolerance, dental health |
| Patient preferences | Discuss risks, benefits, and goals of care |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bisphosphonates are appropriate for a 94-year-old immobile woman with a femur fracture and osteoporosis if life expectancy exceeds 12 months and there are no contraindications. Use **IV zoledronic acid** for 1–3 years with reassessment, balancing fracture risk reduction against the low risk of atypical femur fractures with prolonged therapy [^112TJ2qa]. If life expectancy is limited or risks outweigh benefits, prioritize supportive care and pain management.

Patients who have suffered an atypical femoral fracture while on bisphosphonates or denosumab may continue to be at risk for typical osteoporotic fractures. There are no studies to provide guidance on safe treatment for such patients. Instead, using an illustrative case, 5 principles of management are provided that may lead to decreased osteoporotic fracture risk. The first principle is to discontinue the anti-resorptive medications, which may be challenging for the patient on denosumab because of rebound vertebral fractures reported in patients stopping denosumab. The second principle is to maximize non-pharmacologic management to reduce falls and fractures. Home safety, other methods of fall risk reduction, adequate nutrition, and an exercise prescription should help reduce fracture risk. Investigating potential secondary causes of osteoporosis, particularly if the original workup was not comprehensive, is the third principle because treatment of some specific causes may lower fracture risk. Reviewing the medication list is the fourth principle, with the goal of eliminating drugs that may increase fracture risk, and considering thiazides for some patients, which may lower fracture risk. Finally, some patients may benefit from anabolic therapy. One potential (but not FDA-approved) method is to use long-term cyclic teriparatide or abaloparatide on a 3-mo on, 3-mo off schedule. Tailoring the approach to each patient is important, based on the 5 clinical principles, in the absence of evidence-based management recommendations.

Fractures are fortunately rare in younger people even with severe chronic disease but when they occur they need to be carefully evaluated. When considering such a patient there needs to be an assessment of the risk of future fractures and their type, a search for potentially modifiable risk factors and an evaluation of the risks vs. benefits of bone protective therapy. These factors will have to be considered in the context of the underlying chronic disease and the way that this impacts on the patient. In those individuals where bone protective therapy is given a clear plan is needed relating to how long the treatment is used and what type of monitoring is warranted.

### Cost-effectiveness of screening for osteoporosis in older men with a history of falls [^116s5MqU]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Incidence of Fractures

The age-dependent fracture rates were obtained from hospital discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The model modified the fracture rates based on a history of falls, the presence of osteoporosis, and a history of fractures. The relative risks of fractures associated with a history of falls were taken from a meta-analysis of cohort studies from 3 countries. Pooled data from men with a history of a single fall and multiple falls were obtained and were assumed to last as long as 10 years. An alternate scenario considering the number of falls was also tested in a scenario analysis. The relative risks of fractures stratified by the number of falls (ie, 1, 2, or ≥ 3) in the past year were based on the combined data for men and women from a cohort study in Canada. The relative risks of fractures associated with the presence of osteoporosis were calculated using BMD data from the 2005–2008 NHANES and a meta-analysis of cohort studies from 12 countries. The excess risks of fractures associated with a history of fractures were taken from a meta-analysis of cohort studies from 11 countries.

Treatment Effect

Relative risk reductions of fractures by osteoporosis treatment were taken from a meta-analysis of clinical trials of bisphosphonates in men. We assumed that a history of falls did not alter the fracture reduction benefit by osteoporosis treatment. The model used the reduction in nonvertebral fracture rates as a surrogate for the reduction in hip, wrist, and humeral fracture rates. The fracture reduction benefit was assumed to appear in the second year of therapy. The model incorporated a linear decrease in the fracture reduction benefit during 5 years after its termination. Adherence to alendronate and zoledronic acid treatment was based on meta-analyses of multiple observational studies. The model adopted a conservative assumption that only those who completed a 5-year course of osteoporosis treatment gained the fracture reduction benefit. Adverse effects of treatment were not modeled based on a systematic review.

Mortality

The background mortality rates were based on 2017 US life tables published by the National Center for Health and Statistics. Excess mortality attributable to a history of falls was taken from the Longitudinal Study on Aging. Excess mortality after hip fractures was taken from a meta-analysis of cohort studies from 7 countries. Excess mortality after clinical vertebral fractures was taken from a retrospective data analysis of Medicare claims. An alternate scenario excluding excess mortality after clinical vertebral fractures was also tested in a scenario analysis.

Introduction

Advances in research have led to a more accurate assessment of the risk of fractures, and the range of treatment options available to prevent fractures has expanded. Algorithms on the risk of fractures that combine clinical risk factors and bone mineral density are now widely used in clinical practice to target treatment to individuals at high risk of fractures. Although drug treatments targeted at osteoporosis consistently improve bone mineral density, preventing fractures is the most relevant patient outcome. Heterogeneity has been noted for the magnitude of the reduction in the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and clinical fractures between treatments. Few active comparator trials have directly compared the effects on fracture endpoints. Greater understanding of the differences in the effects of treatments across clinical trials would influence estimates of the benefits of treatment and should therefore be considered among the evidence base that drives guideline recommendations.

Moreover, most randomised controlled trials included patients with an estimated high baseline risk of fractures, but this varied between treatments and over time. Existing post hoc analyses indicate that the antifracture efficacy of some treatments for osteoporosis differ according to estimates of the baseline risk of fractures of individuals in the study, typically, but not exclusively, calculated with the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). Therefore, factors such as history of fractures, age, bone mineral density, and body mass index, among others, might be potential effect modifiers.

In this analysis, we looked at several baseline risk indicators associated with the efficacy of drug treatments to assess the evidence of the effect and harms of available osteoporosis treatments on primary and secondary reduction of the risk of fractures among postmenopausal women. We also critically appraised the internal validity of the randomised controlled trials. We used meta-regression analyses to explore the evidence of the effect of antiosteoporosis drug treatments on the risk of fracture according to recognised baseline risk factors.

Treatment

Evidence-based medicine relies to a large extent on results from RCTs, and many of the problems in any clinical field are related to judging the extent to which findings under well-controlled circumstances apply to ordinary healthcare settings.

Does the existing evidence justify wide-scale use of bone-targeted pharmacotherapy?

Benefits of any medical intervention should be evaluated within the context of the three-step hierarchy of research evidence originally defined by Archie Cochrane: efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Basically, the strategy to prevent fractures by bone-targeted pharmacotherapy would be acceptable if the drugs were cheap, effective and with low risk of associated harms. However, it is questionable whether current medications meet these requirements.

With regard to the costs and effectiveness, even under the idealized circumstances of efficacy trials, we found that less than a half of all fractures could be prevented, whilst the cost of averting one hip fracture was about £100 000. By contrast, the average total cost of treating one hip fracture patient over the first year after fracture is about £16 000. Further, despite the fact that the mean age of hip fracture patients in Europe is about 80 years, and more than three in four hip fractures occur amongst individuals older than 75 years, this age group is under-represented in or even absent from most clinical trials assessing the antihip fracture efficacy of preventive pharmacotherapy. Only three of the 33 RCTs published so far have included a sufficient number of women over 75 years of age to allow analysis of hip fracture incidence, and these three studies did not show significant efficacy in this age group. Nevertheless, it is commonly believed that bisphosphonates can reduce the relative fracture risk independent of age, so that the absolute risk reduction would increase with age or baseline risk. Similar to those for other 'risk diseases', most osteoporosis guidelines ignore the lack of evidence in the oldest old (> 80 years of age) and extrapolate the efficacy estimates derived from younger adults to this group. It is unlikely that the oldest old are comparable to those in their 60s or 70s in terms of their response to drug therapy. Finally, osteoporosis is primarily considered to be a female disease, but about 30–40% of hip fractures occur in elderly men. However, there is a dire lack of available evidence regarding hip fracture prevention in men.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1168sxzv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Bisphosphonate holiday — monitoring and dose adjustment in postmenopausal osteoporosis states that fracture risk and bone mineral density (BMD) should be re-evaluated every 2 to 4 years after discontinuation, and that a significant drop in BMD (or a large increase in bone turnover markers) may lead to reinitiation of therapy before the 5-year maximum holiday is completed; some data suggest that a lower dose of alendronate (5 mg/d) after 5 years can maintain BMD and bone turnover marker levels as effectively as continuing the full dose (10 mg/d), but whether dose reduction decreases atypical femoral fracture (AFF) risk is unknown.

### Bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis: benefits, risks, and drug holiday [^1159ZZnK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The amino-bisphosphonates are first-line therapy for the treatment of most patients with osteoporosis, with proven efficacy to reduce fracture risk at the spine, hip, and other nonvertebral skeletal sites. Further, bisphosphonates have been associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and increase in survival. Following the use of bisphosphonates in millions of patients in clinical practice, some unexpected possible adverse effects have been reported, including osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femur fractures, atrial fibrillation, and esophageal cancer. Because bisphosphonates are incorporated into the skeleton and continue to exert an antiresorptive effect for a period of time after dosing is discontinued, the concept of a drug holiday has emerged, whereby the risk of adverse effects might be decreased while the patient still benefits from antifracture efficacy. Patients receiving bisphosphonates who are not at high risk for fracture are potential candidates for a drug holiday, while for those with bone mineral density in the osteoporosis range or previous history of fragility fracture, the benefits of continuing therapy probably far outweigh the risk of harm.

Applicability of study findings indicates that most studies enrolled adults at high risk for fracture with heterogeneous baseline risk definitions due to different scoring scales and differing proportions with prior vertebral fractures; primary studies did not consistently report prior treatment response, although most allowed previous bisphosphonate treatments; only bisphosphonates have been tested as first-line treatment in treatment‑naive patients; enrolled adults were already taking vitamin D, calcium, or both; most studies included females and a very small number of males, and few RCTs assessed the effect of zoledronic acid in males with osteoporosis.

### Osteoporosis [^116WczUx]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Fractures resulting from osteoporosis become increasingly common in women after age 55 years and men after age 65 years, resulting in substantial bone-associated morbidities, and increased mortality and health-care costs. Research advances have led to a more accurate assessment of fracture risk and have increased the range of therapeutic options available to prevent fractures. Fracture risk algorithms that combine clinical risk factors and bone mineral density are now widely used in clinical practice to target high-risk individuals for treatment. The discovery of key pathways regulating bone resorption and formation has identified new approaches to treatment with distinctive mechanisms of action. Osteoporosis is a chronic condition and long-term, sometimes lifelong, management is required. In individuals at high risk of fracture, the benefit versus risk profile is likely to be favourable for up to 10 years of treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab. In people at a very high or imminent risk of fracture, therapy with teriparatide or abaloparatide should be considered; however, since treatment duration with these drugs is restricted to 18–24 months, treatment should be continued with an antiresorptive drug. Individuals at high risk of fractures do not receive adequate treatment and strategies to address this treatment gap-eg, widespread implementation of Fracture Liaison Services and improvement of adherence to therapy-are important challenges for the future.

### Use of drug holidays in women taking bisphosphonates [^114ExQsy]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are the cornerstone of treatment for osteoporosis. These agents are generally safe and well-tolerated, but concerns have emerged about adverse effects related to long-term use, namely osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures. For most patients at moderate or high risk of fracture, the benefits of treatment far outweigh these serious but rare risks. Bisphosphonates accumulate in bone with some persistent protective effect after therapy is stopped, making it is reasonable to consider a "drug holiday". The duration of therapy and the length of the holiday should be based on clinical judgment.

---

### Osteoporosis: the emperor has no clothes [^112XY1wB]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis guidelines systematically ignore the obvious 'evidence void' in the RCTs (i.e. no antihip fracture evidence for women under 65 or above 80 years, or for men in general) and instead extrapolate efficacy estimates derived from younger women to their older counterparts and even to men. Assertions by NOF and NOGG on the 'cost-effectiveness' of bone-targeted pharmacotherapy are not based on actual trials, but on a computer-modelled cost-effectiveness analysis which assumes that bisphosphonates achieve a constant relative risk reduction for fractures irrespective of age, sex and baseline risk of fracture (or individual bisphosphonate). Accordingly, the model predicts a highly favourable (steadily increasing) absolute risk reduction with age and baseline risk, which is hardly the case as outlined above.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis, duration, ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing bisphosphonates to allow a drug holiday for low-to-moderate risk postmenopausal patients being stable after 5 years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates or after 3 years of therapy with IV zoledronic acid. Consider continuing treatment for longer durations of up to 10 years for oral bisphosphonates or up to 6 years for IV zoledronic acid in patients at high risk of fracture.

### Osteoporosis treatment after hip fracture: bad news and getting worse… [^112DL7FF]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Bauer DC. Osteoporosis Treatment After Hip Fracture: Bad News and Getting Worse. JAMA Netw Open. 2018; 1: e180844. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.0844 A growing public health concern is that fewer individuals with documented osteoporosis are receiving effective drug treatment to prevent osteoporotic fractures. 1 Evidence of this treatment gap is abundant and comes from multiple countries, health care settings, and demographic populations. Concerns about overtreatment of lower-risk individuals and rare but serious antiresorptive therapy adverse effects have contributed to undertreatment. Fortunately, there is almost universal agreement that individuals with documented hip or vertebral fracture have established osteoporosis, indicating that they are at high risk of future fracture, and appropriate drug therapy should be routinely offered in these settings.

Randomized trials have demonstrated that oral and parenteral bisphosphonate therapy following a hip or vertebral fracture substantially reduces subsequent fractures and disabilities, even in the setting of acute hip fracture. For example, the placebo-controlled HORIZON Recurrent Fracture Trial2 found that several yearly doses of intravenous zoledronic acid reduced subsequent clinical fracture risk by 35%, and somewhat unexpectedly reduced mortality by 28%. Lyles et al2 found zoledronic acid reduced fracture risk regardless of pretreatment bone mineral density or disability. Given the clear clinical mandate to treat individuals with a history of hip fracture, early reports of low rates of treatment were disappointing but perhaps understandable given the comorbidities and frailty that often accompany hip fracture.

For example, a high-quality study by Solomon et al3 reported that among a sample of US Medicare or commercially insured patients with hip fracture in 2011, only 21% received effective drug therapy after the fracture. Similar low rates of treatment following hip fracture have been reported in Spain and Korea.
4. Desai et al5 extend these previous reports by reporting post–hip fracture treatment rates and associated treatment efficacy in a large US population of commercially insured individuals. The most noteworthy finding from this analysis is that among 97 169 previously untreated patients with hip fracture, rates of effective drug treatment in the 180 days following hip fracture were only 9. 8% in 2004, and then decreased to
3. 3% in 2015.

Additional analyses found that low treatment rates were even worse in men and were not explained by disproportionate underuse in older or frail patients. These dismal treatment rates from as recent as 2015, despite a wealth of evidence about the markedly elevated fracture risk and the availability of effective and safe treatments, can only be described as a shocking failure to provide adequate care to a high-risk population. Furthermore, hip fractures represent only the tip of the iceberg; timely evaluation and consideration of drug treatment are appropriate for many other individuals at high risk of fracture. The analysis by Desai et al5 also examined the real-world effectiveness of available antiresorptive and anabolic treatments following hip fracture using a sophisticated instrumental variable analysis to account for potential confounding.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, bisphosphonates, ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate bisphosphonates as initial therapy in most postmenopausal patients at increased risk of fracture. Consider discontinuing bisphosphonates to allow a drug holiday in low-to-moderate risk patients being stable after 5 years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates or after 3 years of therapy with IV zoledronic acid. Consider continuing treatment for longer durations of up to 10 years for oral bisphosphonates or up to 6 years for IV zoledronic acid in patients at high risk of fracture.

### Bisphosphonate-associated atypical subtrochanteric femur fracture [^111WC2cn]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates help prevent progressive bone mineralization loss and subsequent osteoporotic fractures. However, long-term bisphosphonate therapy paradoxically increases the risk of a unique injury called an atypical subtrochanteric femur fracture. Despite this, the benefits of bisphosphonates outweigh the risks, because far more pathologic fractures are prevented than induced. The early identification of atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures is important as there is high associated morbidity and mortality. We describe a case of a 76-y-old woman with a completed bisphosphonate-associated atypical subtrochanteric femur fracture.

### Atypical fractures as a potential complication of long-term bisphosphonate therapy [^114nz4nb]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

The development of bisphosphonate therapy represented an important advance in the treatment of low bone mass and osteoporosis, conditions that affect more than half of individuals older than 50 years. Currently available bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce spine, nonspine, and hip fractures in individuals at increased risk of fracture. Case reports and limited clinical series over the past 5 years have raised concern that prolonged bisphosphonate therapy may suppress bone remodeling to the extent that normal bone repair is impaired, resulting in increased fracture risk. Fractures potentially resulting from suppressed bone turnover have been described as "atypical", affecting sites such as the subtrochanteric femur that are infrequently affected by osteoporotic fractures. A prodrome of thigh pain, lack of trauma prior to the fracture, and specific radiological characteristics have also been reported. Data are limited on the prevalence of, risk factors for, and treatment of this potential problem. Current strategies include fracture risk assessment, targeting bisphosphonate therapy appropriately to individuals at increased risk of fracture, considering a 12-month interruption in therapy after 5 years in patients who are clinically stable, and considering teriparatide treatment in individuals who experience an atypical fracture while receiving bisphosphonate therapy.

### Risk of hip, subtrochanteric, and femoral shaft fractures among mid and long term users of alendronate: nationwide cohort and nested case-control study [^1126Y7bk]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical management of osteoporosis has progressed greatly in the past four decades with the introduction of potent antiresorptive drugs that substantially reduce the risk of fractures in men and women with osteoporosis. Despite the relatively low cost of such intervention, the treatment gap is widening in many areas of the world because of concerns that antiresorptive treatment could lead to atypical femur fracturesand that this could offset the benefits of long term use. Prescription rates for bisphoshonates have declined by 50% in the United Statesand similar trends have been observed in the European Union. A recent commentary in The BMJ concluded that bisphosphonates could achieve at best a marginal reduction in the risk of hip fracture and that the risk of serious medical adverse events, including atypical femur fractures, makes pharmacotherapy non-viable as a health strategy against hip fractures.

Fractures classified as atypical femur fractures are defined by a set of clinical and radiological criteria, but they are also confined to a distinct anatomical area. Atypical femur fractures are substantially transverse fractures originating at the lateral femoral cortex. They are always non-comminuted and usually accompanied by localised or general cortical thickening. These fractures are a legitimate concern for prescribers and regulatory authorities given the short duration of the primary licensing trials for bisphosphonates. Trials typically lasted three years, with a limited proportion of participants carried forward into extension studies yielding a total follow-up length of 5–10 years, providing somewhat limited power to detect uncommon unexpected adverse events. The seemingly large number of atypical femur fractures predicted by odds ratios extracted from recent observational studies, however, seem to conflict with the observed slow increase and low overall rate of subtrochanteric and shaft fractures, the anatomical locations where atypical fractures would appear.

To provide the best possible strategies for care and an optimum use of resources it is vitally important to recognise and verify safety alerts and, if verified, scale them appropriately so that clinical practice — including duration of osteoporosis treatment — is driven by absolute rates of benefit and absolute measures of harm so that treatments with good safety records are not inappropriately withdrawn or changed to less cost effective or less safe alternatives. Established in 1995, the Danish prescription registry uniquely holds almost 20 years of drug exposure data for all residents in the country, and this can be linked to all fracture outcomes treated in hospital in the same period. We used this unique real world data source to study the association between long term use of alendronate and the risk of subtrochanteric and femoral shaft fractures.

### Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of osteoporosis: the battle to be won [^113gWtVu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

An expert opinion perspective on why osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Objective

To highlight the potential reasons for why osteoporosis is undertreated.

Design

Literature review from PubMed, Plos One, and Science Direct search engines from 1900–2015 under terms: sub-trochanteric and atypical femur fractures, bisphosphonate clinical trial and bisphosphonate review articles, and treatment/under treatment of osteoporosis, as well as personal experience.

Setting

Careful and objective review.

Patients

Derived from reviews.

Interventions

Bisphosphonates.

Outcomes

Atypical sub-trochanteric femur fractures.

Results

Atypical sub-trochanteric femur fractures occur in both bisphosphonate and non-bisphosphonate users; and, bisphosphonate utilization has declined in temporal relationship with the reporting of these fractures associated with bisphosphonate use. There is no causality in this association and the benefit/risk ratio of bisphosphonates reducing all fracture risk vs the potential for the development of an atypical sub-trochanteric femur fracture is exceedingly in favor of bisphosphonate use in higher risk populations.

Conclusions

Treatments for osteoporosis should not be stopped (e.g. the "drug-holidays") in higher risk patients since the basic pathophysiology of osteoporosis continues; and, the evidence linking bisphosphonate use to causing atypical sub-trochanteric femur fractures is non-existent.

### Hip fracture: diagnosis, treatment, and secondary prevention [^113LWMKp]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Hip fractures cause significant morbidity and are associated with increased mortality. Women experience 80% of hip fractures, and the average age of persons who have a hip fracture is 80 years. Most hip fractures are associated with a fall, although other risk factors include decreased bone mineral density, reduced level of activity, and chronic medication use. Patients with hip fractures have pain in the groin and are unable to bear weight on the affected extremity. During the physical examination, displaced fractures present with external rotation and abduction, and the leg will appear shortened. Plain radiography with cross-table lateral view of the hip and anteroposterior view of the pelvis usually confirms the diagnosis. If an occult hip fracture is suspected and plain radiography is normal, magnetic resonance imaging should be ordered. Most fractures are treated surgically unless the patient has significant comorbidities or reduced life expectancy. The consulting orthopedic surgeon will choose the surgical procedure. Patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus, before surgery. In addition, patients should receive thromboembolic prophylaxis, preferably with low-molecular-weight heparin. Rehabilitation is critical to long-term recovery. Unless contraindicated, bisphosphonate therapy should be used to reduce the risk of another hip fracture. Some patients may benefit from a fall-prevention assessment.

14.3	Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in the 12-month primary analysis of a 2-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study (NCT 01575873) of 795 patients (70% women and 30% men) aged 20 to 94 years (mean age of 63 years) treated with greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) for < 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation; n = 290) or ≥ 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, n = 505). Enrolled patients < 50 years of age were required to have a history of osteoporotic fracture. Enrolled patients ≥ 50 years of age who were in the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation were required to have a baseline BMD T-score of ≤ -2.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck; or a BMD T-score ≤ -1.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and a history of osteoporotic fracture.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control, risedronate 5 mg once daily) (n = 397) or denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously once every 6 months (n = 398) for one year. Randomization was stratified by gender within each subpopulation. Patients received at least 1000 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.

Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD)

In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, denosumab significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to the active-control at one year (Active-control 0.8%, denosumab 3.8%) with a treatment difference of 2.9% (p < 0.001). In the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, denosumab significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to active-control at one year (Active-control 2.3%, denosumab 4.4%) with a treatment difference of 2.2% (p < 0.001). Consistent effects on lumbar spine BMD were observed regardless of gender; race; geographic region; menopausal status; and baseline age, lumbar spine BMD T-score, and glucocorticoid dose within each subpopulation.

### Bisphosphonates for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [^111ify9z]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by bone loss, which leads to impaired bone strength and an increased risk of fractures. Two million fractures are attributed to osteoporosis annually in the United States and they are associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fracture by suppressing bone resorption and increasing bone strength, and they have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, the use of these drugs for the management of osteoporosis remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations including appropriate patient selection, pretreatment evaluation, potential adverse effects, patient preferences, and adherence. This review will discuss the evidence informing the clinical strategy for using bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis and those at high risk of fracture, focusing on the benefits and risks of treatment. We will also consider issues related to the monitoring and duration of treatment.

### Does a history of non-vertebral fracture identify women without osteoporosis for treatment? [^1177YDXy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Postmenopausal women with a prior fracture have an increased risk for future fracture. Whether a history of non-vertebral fracture defines a group of women with low bone mass but without osteoporosis for whom alendronate would prevent new non-vertebral fracture is not known.

Subjects and Methods

Secondary analysis of data from the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT). Of 2,785 postmenopausal women with a T-score at the femoral neck between -1 and -2.5 and without prevalent radiographic vertebral deformity, 880 (31.6%) reported experiencing a fracture after 45 years of age. Women were randomized to placebo or alendronate (5 mg/day years for the first 2 years and 10 mg/day thereafter) and were followed for an average of 4.2 ± 0.5 years. Incident non-vertebral fractures were confirmed by x-rays and radiology reports.

Results

In the placebo arm, a self-report of prior fracture identified women with a 1.5-fold (hazard ratio [RH] 1.46, 95% C. I. 1.04–2.04) increased risk for incident non-vertebral fracture. However, there was no evidence that the effect of alendronate differed across subgroups of women with (RH 1.26 for alendronate vs placebo, 95% C. I. 0.89–1.79) and without prior fracture (RH 1.02 for alendronate vs placebo, 95% C. I. 0.76–1.38; P = 0.37 for interaction).

Conclusion

Assessing a clinical risk factor, prior non-vertebral fracture, did not identify women with low bone mass for whom alendronate reduced future non-vertebral fracture risk.

### A 55-year-old woman with osteopenia [^114Z9bEx]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

About half of postmenopausal women have a bone density T score at the femoral neck between -1.0 and -2.5. Bone density in this range was termed "osteopenia" by a World Health Organization working group. Osteopenia is not a disease and the label can cause unnecessary anxiety. Osteopenia encompasses a wide range of fracture risks; an individual patient's risk can be estimated from her age, bone mineral density, and clinical risk factors. Regardless of bone mineral density, regular exercise and adherence with vitamin D and calcium intake may reduce the risk of hip fracture. Osteopenia by itself is not an indication for treatment. Decisions about pharmacological treatment to prevent fractures should be based on the patient's risk of fractures, evidence about the efficacy and nonskeletal effects of the specific treatment, and the patient's preferences.

Males with primary osteoporosis — bisphosphonates vs placebo outcomes and harms: Key outcomes were assessed at 12–36 and ≥ 36 months, with radiographic vertebral fractures at ≥ 36 months showing, per 1000 treated patients, BISPHOSPHONATES VS. PLACEBO with 140 fewer and certainty of the evidence low. At 12–36 months, bisphosphonates probably reduced radiographic vertebral fractures but not any clinical fractures; no RCTs evaluated hip fractures after bisphosphonates and other fracture-preventive treatments have not been examined in males with primary osteoporosis. Across harms in RCTs at 12–36 months, bisphosphonates resulted in no differences in serious adverse events and probably no differences in withdrawal due to adverse events or in the risk for atrial fibrillation.

### Osteoporosis: common questions and answers [^112fHFeJ]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis affects 10.2% of adults older than 50 years and is expected to increase to 13.6% by 2030. Osteoporotic fractures, specifically hip fractures, significantly affect morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Screening for osteoporosis with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry should be considered for all women 65 years and older or women who are postmenopausal with clinical risk factors. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends screening men 70 years and older and men with clinical risk factors; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force did not find sufficient evidence to support routine screening in men. Osteoporosis can be diagnosed by a T-score of -2.5 or less or the presence of a fragility fracture. All patients with osteoporosis should be counseled on weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and calcium and vita-min D supplementation. Treatment of osteoporosis is influenced by the patient's fracture risk, the effectiveness of fracture risk reduction, and medication safety. Patients at high risk of fracture should consider treatment with antiresorptive therapy, including bisphosphonates and denosumab. Anabolic agents such as teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab should be considered for patients at very high risk or with previous vertebral fractures.

### Bisphosphonate treatment beyond 5 years and hip fracture risk in older women [^113XXJku]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In a large cohort of older women who completed 5 initial years of bisphosphonate treatment, we found a similar 5-year risk of hip fracture whether women discontinued bisphosphonate treatment at study entry or continued adherent treatment for 5 additional years. These findings were evident in analyses when defining discontinuation with or without a 6-month grace period. For comparisons of hip fracture risk if women continued bisphosphonate treatment for 2 additional years, findings were mixed, depending on use of a 6-month grace period for discontinuation, which allowed the inclusion of a larger number of women. While our results suggest that interruption of bisphosphonate treatment after approximately 2 additional treatment years may be associated with lower interim risk of hip fracture compared with women who continued bisphosphonate treatment for 5 additional years, the 5-year risk differences were not statistically significant and the numbers of women and hip fracture events in this exposure group were relatively small.

The Fracture Intervention Trials (FIT), and Vertebral Efficacy with Risedronate Therapy (VERT) trials, demonstrated that bisphosphonate therapy reduced the risk of hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral clinical fractures in women with osteoporosis during the first 3 to 5 years. However, few trials to our knowledge have examined bisphosphonate efficacy beyond 5 years. A 5-year FIT trial extension (FLEX) conducted among 1099 women examined the efficacy of continuing or stopping alendronate after 3 to 5 years and found that women who stopped experienced no greater overall fracture risk for most clinical fractures compared with those continuining alendronate to 10 years, except for clinical vertebral fracture risk reduction but not those measured radiographically. In post hoc subgroup analyses, nonvertebral fracture risk reduction occurred in those without existing vertebral fractures who had hip osteoporosis by BMD, but there was no significant benefit to longer-term alendronate in the highest risk group (ie, those with prior vertebral fractures and low BMD). Some felt that these findings and 4- to 7-year risedronate extension studiessuggested that bisphosphonate continuation beyond 3 to 5 years may afford fracture protection in higher risk patients with osteoporosis, but existing trials examined fracture outcomes in relatively small numbers of women with more than 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy and were not able to examine hip fractures.

### Time to benefit of bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention of fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115o8Ate]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The clinical decision to initiate bisphosphonate therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis requires balancing shorter-term harms and burdens (eg, gastroesophageal irritation or severe musculoskeletal pain) with longer-term benefits in reducing potential fractures.

Objective

To assess the time to benefit (TTB) of bisphosphonate therapy for the prevention of nonvertebral and other fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Data Sources

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were identified from systematic reviews commissioned by the US Preventive Services Task Force (1 review), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (1 review), the Cochrane Library (2 reviews), and the Endocrine Society (1 review).

Study Selection

Studies selected were RCTs involving postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of osteoporosis based on existing vertebral fractures or bone mineral density T scores of -2.5 or lower. The selection process was focused on studies of alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid because they are guideline-recommended first-line agents for reducing nonvertebral fractures. Studies were excluded if they did not focus on women with a primary diagnosis of osteoporosis, had no placebo arm, or had a lack of data on time to fracture.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Random-effects Weibull survival curves were fitted and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and TTB for each study. These estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the time to 3 different ARR thresholds (0.002, 0.005, and 0.010) for the first nonvertebral fracture. Secondary outcomes included the time to 4 ARR thresholds (0.001, 0.002, 0.005, and 0.010) for hip fracture, any clinical fracture, and clinical vertebral fracture.

Results

Of 67 full-text articles identified, 10 RCTs comprising 23 384 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were included either as the original RCT or part of subsequently published pooled analyses. Among the studies, the number of participants ranged from 994 to 7765, with mean (SD) age ranging from 63 (7) years to 74 (3) years and follow-up duration ranging from 12 to 48 months. The pooled meta-analysis found that 12.4 months (95% CI, 6.3–18.4 months) were needed to avoid 1 nonvertebral fracture per 100 postmenopausal women receiving bisphosphonate therapy at an ARRof0.010. To prevent 1 hip fracture, 200 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis would need to receive bisphosphonate therapy for 20.3 months (95% CI, 11.0–29.7 months) at an ARR of 0.005. In addition, 200 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis would need to receive bisphosphonate therapy for 12.1 months (95% CI, 6.4–17.8 months) to avoid 1 clinical vertebral fracture at an ARR of 0.005.

Conclusions and Relevance

This meta-analysis found that the TTB of bisphosphonate therapy was 12.4 months to prevent 1 nonvertebral fracture per 100 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. These results suggest that bisphosphonate therapy is most likely to benefit postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who have a life expectancy greater than 12.4 months.

### Bisphosphonate use and the risk of subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fractures in older women… [^112ZtDtK]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Context Osteoporosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Oral bisphosphonates have become a mainstay of treatment, but concerns have emerged that long-term use of these drugs may suppress bone remodeling, leading to unusual fractures. Objective To determine whether prolonged bisphosphonate therapy is associated with an increased risk of subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fracture. Results We identified 716 women who sustained a subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fracture following initiation of bisphosphonate therapy and 9723 women who sustained a typical osteoporotic fracture of the intertrochanteric region or femoral neck. Compared with transient bisphosphonate use, treatment for 5 years or longer was associated with an increased risk of subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fracture.

A reduced risk of typical osteoporotic fractures occurred among women with more than 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy. Among 52 595 women with at least 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy, a subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fracture occurred in 71 during the subsequent year and 117 within 2 years. Conclusion Among older women, treatment with a bisphosphonate for more than 5 years was associated with an increased risk of subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fractures; however, the absolute risk of these fractures is low. Osteoporosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 1, 2 Approximately 50% of women older than 50 years will sustain an osteoporosis-related fracture during their lifetime, and 1 of 5 patients with an osteoporosis-related fracture will die within 12 months.

3–5 Although randomized trials have shown that treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporotic fractures, 6–8 concerns have recently emerged that bisphosphonate-related suppression of bone remodeling may adversely influence bone strength.
9. Women in the cohort were followed up until the first subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fracture, death, or the end of the study period. Primary Analysis. The primary analysis examined the association between hospitalization for a subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fracture and cumulative duration of bisphosphonate use for more than 5 years. To explore the association with lower cumulative doses, we also examined bisphosphonate durations of 3 to 5 years, and 100 days to 3 years. Women who initiated bisphosphonates but did not continue beyond 100 days served as the reference group for all analyses.

In the secondary analysis examining the risk of typical osteoporotic fractures, we identified 9723 women with fractures of the femoral neck or intertrochanteric region during bisphosphonate therapy. As expected, we found that extended bisphosphonate use was associated with a reduced risk of fracture compared with transient use. Women with intermediate bisphosphonate use demonstrated a similarly low risk with the upper CI limit just crossing unity, while a shorter duration of bisphosphonate use was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of such fractures. These findings contrast with a recently published analysis of 3 bisphosphonate trials that found no association between bisphosphonate use and the risk of subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fractures.

### Implications of expanding indications for drug treatment to prevent fracture in older men in United States: cross sectional and longitudinal analysis of prospective cohort study [^117RaTE1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Although basing the treatment decision on a patient's absolute risk of fracture is appealing, the efficacy of currently available treatment in preventing clinical fractures in men and women without osteoporosis defined by female specific norms or existing vertebral fractures has not been demonstrated. Previous trials in men with low bone mineral density have been powered to detect a change in bone mineral density or a reduction in risk of new vertebral fractures identified on the basis of radiographs alone; no trials in men have shown a benefit of treatment in reducing the risk of clinical fractures. With the exception of one trial in patients with recent hip fracture, evidence of the efficacy of treatment in reducing clinical fractures is limited to trials in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis defined by a female specific bone mineral density T score of –2.5 or below or with existing radiographic vertebral fractures. Systematic reviews of trials of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women have not reported significant reductions in risk of non-vertebral fractures among women without osteoporosis or existing vertebral fractures. Although one trial of clodronate reported efficacy of treatment in reducing clinical fractures (but not hip fractures) in older women not selected on the basis of bone mineral density, other pivotal trials of alendronate, risedronate, and denosumab found no benefit of treatment in reducing clinical fractures among women not selected on the basis of the WHO definition of osteoporosis (that is, female specific bone mineral density T score –2.5 or below) or existing vertebral fractures. In addition, whether higher estimated FRAX probabilities identify a subgroup of patients who benefit more from treatment is unknown. Post hoc analyses of trials in women of drugs including raloxifene and alendronate have not found evidence of an interaction between level of FRAX 10 year fracture probability and treatment assignment for prediction of risk of fracture events, although some evidence supported an interaction in trials of denosumab and clodronate.

### Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^1117ccbw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts (bone cells that break down bone tissue). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women at lower and higher risk of fracture, respectively.

Search Methods

We searched Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (which includes CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, drug approval agency websites, and the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews to identify the studies included in this review. The latest search date was 01 February 2023. We imposed no restrictions on language, date, form of publication, or reported outcomes.

Eligibility Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of alendronate on postmenopausal women. Targeted participants must have received at least one year of alendronate. We classified a study as secondary prevention if its population met one or more of the following hierarchical criteria: a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a history of vertebral fractures, a low bone mineral density T-score (-2.5 or lower), and 75 years old or older. If a study population met none of those criteria, we classified it as a primary prevention study.

Outcomes

Our major outcomes were clinical vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane risk of bias 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Based on the previous review experience, in which the clinical and methodological characteristics in the primary and secondary prevention studies were homogeneous, we used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis and estimated effects using the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. Our base case analyses included all eligible placebo-controlled studies with usable data. We selected the data available for the longest treatment period. We consider a relative change exceeding 15% as clinically important.

Included Studies

We included 119 studies, of which 102 studies provided data for quantitative synthesis. Of these, we classified 34 studies (15,188 participants) as primary prevention and 68 studies (29,577 participants) as secondary prevention. We had concerns about risks of bias in most studies. Selection bias was the most frequently overlooked domain, with only 20 studies (19%) describing appropriate methods for both sequence generation and allocation concealment. Eight studies (8%) were at low risk of bias in all seven domains.

Synthesis Of Results

The base case analyses included 16 primary prevention studies (one to five years in length; 10,057 women) and 20 secondary prevention studies (one to three years in length; 7375 women) which compared alendronate 10 mg/day (or 70 mg/week) to placebo, no treatment, or both. Indirectness, imprecision, and risk of bias emerged as the main factors contributing to the downgrading of the certainty of the evidence. For primary prevention, alendronate may lead to a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (16/1190 in the alendronate group versus 24/926 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.84; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 1.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.9% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence) and non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; ARR 1.6% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.3% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, clinically important differences were not observed for the following outcomes: hip fractures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32; ARR 0.2% fewer, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 0.2% more; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49; ARR 0.3% more, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 1.1% more; low-certainty evidence); withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18; ARR 0.2% more, 95% CI 0.9% fewer to 1.5% more; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; ARR 0.5% more, 95% CI 1.2% fewer to 2.8% more; low-certainty evidence). For secondary prevention, alendronate probably results in a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (24/1114 in the alendronate group versus 51/1055 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73; ARR 2.7% fewer, 95% CI 3.5% fewer to 1.3% fewer; moderate-certainty evidence). It may lead to a clinically important reduction in non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; ARR 2.8% fewer, 95% CI 5.1% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); hip fractures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.96; ARR 1.0% fewer, 95% CI 1.5% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.90; ARR 1.8% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; ARR 3.5% fewer, 95% CI 5.8% fewer to 0.6% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, the effects of alendronate for withdrawals due to adverse events are uncertain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.16; ARR 0.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.7% fewer to 1.3% more; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, the updated evidence for the safety risks of alendronate suggests that, irrespective of participants' risk of fracture, alendronate may lead to little or no difference for gastrointestinal adverse events. Zero incidents of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture were observed.

Authors' Conclusions

For primary prevention, compared to placebo, alendronate 10 mg/day may reduce clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, but it might make little or no difference to hip and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. For secondary prevention, alendronate probably reduces clinical vertebral fractures, and may reduce non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, and serious adverse events, compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alendronate on withdrawals due to adverse events.

### Benefits and risks of bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis [^1125t6wA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

There has been considerable concern recently in the scientific and lay media regarding the benefits vs. the risks of bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis. Risks include possible associations with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femur fractures. In this perspective, we review the use of bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis, including an objective assessment of the risks vs. the benefits of these drugs.

Evidence Acquisition

Authors' knowledge of the field and results of focused literature searches are presented.

Evidence Synthesis

Bisphosphonates have proven efficacy in the prevention of bone loss and in the reduction of fractures in postmenopausal women and men with established osteoporosis. Although bisphosphonates, at doses used to treat osteoporosis, may be associated with an increased risk of ONJ and atypical femur fractures, many more fractures are prevented by the use of these drugs compared to the relatively low risk of these complications. Although oral bisphosphonates are associated with upper gastrointestinal side effects and iv bisphosphonates with acute phase reactions, the association of bisphosphonate use with esophageal cancer and atrial fibrillation is not well supported by current data.

Conclusions

Bisphosphonates have been proven to prevent fractures in patients with established osteoporosis or those who are at high risk of fracture. In contrast, the incidence of major complications associated with bisphosphonate use, such as ONJ and atypical femur fractures, is very low.

Atypical femoral fracture (AFF) risk with bisphosphonates — incidence and duration trends is characterized by very low absolute rates but increases with longer exposure; studies report "about 3 AFFs per 1000 hip fractures", with population rates "about 5 per 100,000 person-years" versus hip fracture incidences of "300 to 400 per 100,000 person-years". Duration-related risk rose from "~3 per 100,000 person-years" after 2 years to "~20 per 100,000 person-years" at 5 years and "~50 per 100,000 with > 8 years of use". A benefit–risk analysis estimated that treating 1000 osteoporotic women for 3 years would "prevent 100 fractures, including 11 hip fractures, while causing about 0.1 AFF". Given rising risk beyond 5 years, the text states "the consistent increase shown for treatment beyond 5 years suggests consideration of AFF risk in treating patients for > 5 years", and notes the ASBMR proposal of a drug holiday "from oral bisphosphonates after 5 years and from IV bisphosphonates after 3 years" in low-to-moderate risk patients.

### Risedronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^111v9k6K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration leading to increased fracture risk. Risedronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs which act to inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts. This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was originally published in 2003.

Objectives

We assessed the benefits and harms of risedronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures for postmenopausal women at lower and higher risk for fractures, respectively.

Search Methods

With broader and updated strategies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase. A grey literature search, including the online databases ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and drug approval agencies, as well as bibliography checks of relevant systematic reviews was also performed. Eligible trials published between 1966 to 24 March 2021 were identified.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the benefits and harms of risedronate in the prevention of fractures for postmenopausal women. Participants must have received at least one year of risedronate, placebo or other anti-osteoporotic drugs, with or without concurrent calcium/vitamin D. Major outcomes were clinical vertebral, non-vertebral, hip and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. In the interest of clinical relevance and applicability, we classified a study as secondary prevention if its population fulfilled more than one of the following hierarchical criteria: a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a history of vertebral fractures, low bone mineral density (BMD)T score ≤ -2.5, and age ≥ 75 years old. If none of these criteria was met, the study was considered to be primary prevention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodology expected by Cochrane. We pooled the relative risk (RR) of fractures using a fixed-effect model based on the expectation that the clinical and methodological characteristics of the respective primary and secondary prevention studies would be homogeneous, and the experience from the previous review suggesting that there would be a small number of studies. The base case included the data available for the longest treatment period in each placebo-controlled trial and a > 15% relative change was considered clinically important. The main findings of the review were presented in summary of findings tables, using the GRADE approach. In addition, we looked at benefit and harm comparisons between different dosage regimens for risedronate and between risedronate and other anti-osteoporotic drugs.

Main Results

Forty-three trials fulfilled the eligibility criteria, among which 33 studies (27,348 participants) reported data that could be extracted and quantitatively synthesized. We had concerns about particular domains of risk of bias in each trial. Selection bias was the most frequent concern, with only 24% of the studies describing appropriate methods for both sequence generation and allocation concealment. Fifty per cent and 39% of the studies reporting benefit and harm outcomes, respectively, were subject to high risk. None of the studies included in the quantitative syntheses were judged to be at low risk of bias in all seven domains. The results described below pertain to the comparisons for daily risedronate 5 mg versus placebo which reported major outcomes. Other comparisons are described in the full text. For primary prevention, low- to very low-certainty evidence was collected from four studies (one to two years in length) including 989 postmenopausal women at lower risk of fractures. Risedronate 5 mg/day may make little or no difference to wrist fractures [RR 0.48 (95% CI 0.03 to 7.50; two studies, 243 participants); absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.6% fewer (95% CI 1% fewer to 7% more)] and withdrawals due to adverse events [RR 0.67 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.18; three studies, 748 participants); ARR 2% fewer (95% CI 5% fewer to 1% more)], based on low-certainty evidence. However, its preventive effects on non-vertebral fractures and serious adverse events are not known due to the very low-certainty evidence. There were zero clinical vertebral and hip fractures reported therefore the effects of risedronate for these outcomes are not estimable. For secondary prevention, nine studies (one to three years in length) including 14,354 postmenopausal women at higher risk of fractures provided evidence. Risedronate 5 mg/day probably prevents non-vertebral fractures [RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.90; six studies, 12,173 participants); RRR 20% (95% CI 10% to 28%) and ARR 2% fewer (95% CI 1% fewer to 3% fewer), moderate certainty], and may reduce hip fractures [RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.94); RRR 27% (95% CI 6% to 44%) and ARR 1% fewer (95% CI 0.2% fewer to 1% fewer), low certainty]. Both of these effects are probably clinically important. However, risedronate's effects are not known for wrist fractures [RR 0.64 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.24); three studies,1746 participants); ARR 1% fewer (95% CI 2% fewer to 1% more), very-low certainty] and not estimable for clinical vertebral fractures due to zero events reported (low certainty). Risedronate results in little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events [RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; eight studies, 9529 participants); ARR 0.3% fewer (95% CI 2% fewer to 1% more); 16.9% in risedronate versus 17.2% in control, high certainty] and probably results in little to no difference in serious adverse events [RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; six studies, 9435 participants); ARR 0% fewer (95% CI 2% fewer to 2% more; 29.2% in both groups, moderate certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

This update recaps the key findings from our previous review that, for secondary prevention, risedronate 5 mg/day probably prevents non-vertebral fracture, and may reduce the risk of hip fractures. We are uncertain on whether risedronate 5mg/day reduces clinical vertebral and wrist fractures. Compared to placebo, risedronate probably does not increase the risk of serious adverse events. For primary prevention, the benefit and harms of risedronate were supported by limited evidence with high uncertainty.

### Spontaneous femoral shaft fracture after long-term alendronate [^113Q4scg]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

Alendronate is used as first-line treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women worldwide. The evidence supporting its benefit in reducing the risk of fragility fracture among this high-risk group is well established. Due to its mechanism of action, there were concerns about potential reduction in bone turnover, repair of microdamage and hence reduced bone toughness and increased risk of fractures with long-term use. A number of cases have been reported from other countries describing a pattern of atraumatic mid-femoral fractures in women on long-term alendronate therapy. We present a case of an atraumatic femoral shaft fracture in an elderly woman on long-term alendronate therapy admitted to a UK Hospital.

Raloxifene — Meta-analysis versus placebo showed a 40% reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.69) with no significant effect on hip or nonvertebral fractures; the effect of raloxifene 60 mg daily was present in women with osteoporosis (BMD T-score of −2.5 or less) with or without a prior vertebral fracture, and side effects include venous thromboembolism, hot flushes, and leg cramps. Raloxifene has the added benefit of a reduced incidence of invasive estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer for at least 5 years after completion. Minor adverse events tend to be worse in the first 6 months, and it is common practice to encourage perseverance during the first few months. The risk of thromboembolic events is similar to current HT; the SmPC states raloxifene should be discontinued in the event of illness or immobilization, with discontinuation as soon as possible or from 3 days before immobilization and not restarted until the initiating condition has resolved and the patient is fully mobile.

### Osteoporosis treatment: updated guidelines from ACOG… [^112RR2VL]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Bisphosphonates, for up to five years orally or three years intravenously, are first-line therapy for osteoporosis.
- Denosumab injections every six months improve bone density more quickly than bisphosphonates, although bone density improvements fade within months after discontinuation unless bisphosphonates are started.
- Parathyroid hormone analog therapy for up to two years dramatically improves bone density and reduces fractures but requires subsequent bisphosphonate use to maintain benefit.
- One year of treatment with romosozumab, a sclerostin-binding analog, followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk more than two years of alendronate therapy alone. From the AFP Editors More than two-thirds of osteoporotic fractures occur in women, and one-half of postmenopausal women will experience an osteoporotic fracture.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has published new recommendations for managing this undertreated condition, including guidance on new medications and targeted treatments. Health Inequities in Osteoporosis Despite an increased risk of subsequent fracture within the first two years following a fracture, only one-fourth of women 60 years and older receive osteoporosis treatment during the first year. Black women are less likely than White women to receive treatment after diagnosis of osteoporosis, even after adjusting for insurance and socioeconomic status. Black women also have higher mortality in the year following a major fragility fracture. Diagnosis Although osteoporosis can be diagnosed clinically after a fragility fracture from a fall of less than standing height, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry is the preferred means of identifying bone loss before a fracture occurs.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry results are reported as a T-score of bone density referenced to healthy young women, and osteoporosis is identified at a T-score of −2.
5. Secondary Causes of Bone Loss Osteoporosis can stem from secondary causes. Although there is no direct evidence of benefit in patients with one or more of these factors or in patients with very low bone mineral density or a history of multiple or recent fractures, it may be appropriate to obtain a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone level with or without free thyroxine, 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, and 24-hour urine collection for calcium, sodium, and creatinine excretion. Indications for Medical Treatment Medication is recommended for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who have any of the following: T-score of −2.

5 or less for hip, lumbar spine, femoral neck, or distal third of radius History of fragility fracture, including incidental or asymptomatic vertebral fracture T-score between −1. 0 and −2. 5 and increased risk of fracture based on results from a clinical risk assessment tool, such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Anabolic Agents Anabolic agents restore lost bone structure in advanced osteoporosis and can be considered in patients with a very high risk of fracture. They should be followed by an antiresorptive agent to preserve bone density improvements. PARATHYROID HORMONE ANALOGS In patients with very high risk of fracture due to a history of severe or multiple vertebral fractures, a T-score of −3 or lower, or multiple risk factors, the parathyroid hormone analogs teriparatide and abaloparatide are highly effective.

Bisphosphonates — benefits and harms in older females: Zoledronate may have reduced any clinical or vertebral fractures, although evidence was very uncertain for the effect on hip fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, or risk for atrial fibrillation. Evidence showed there may have been no differences in serious adverse events. The limited evidence on the effects of alendronate or risedronate on fractures was very uncertain (insufficient).

### Bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis [^112Zb89u]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis to reduce fracture risk. Because of their long retention time in bone and uncommon side effects, questions have been raised about the optimal duration of therapy. Potential side effects appear to be rare and may not be causally related. Although there is no strong science to guide "drug holidays", there appears to be some lingering antifracture benefit when treatment is stopped, so some time off treatment should be offered to most patients on long-term bisphosphonate therapy. For most patients with osteoporosis, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis, duration, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to consider offering a bisphosphonate holiday after 3 years of treatment with zoledronate in high-risk patients or until fracture risk is no longer high, and continue for up to 6 years in very-high-risk patients.

Bisphosphonate holiday — postmenopausal osteoporosis: In patients who are not at high fracture risk, taking a temporary holiday from oral bisphosphonates after 5 years and after 3 years of IV bisphosphonates is described, with reports that after stopping, bone mineral density (BMD) gains are slowly lost during 3 to 5 years and the risk of nonvertebral fractures is not increased over 5 years after discontinuation; a large observational study also showed no increase in nonvertebral or hip fracture risks for discontinuers versus persistent users, and limited evidence indicates AFF is reduced by > 80% in the 3 years after stopping with preliminary data showing a similar reduction; the ASBMR Task Force suggests that those at low to moderate fracture risk can initiate a bisphosphonate holiday, whereas those at high risk should continue the bisphosphonate or switch to another therapy, and an algorithm based on the FLEX trial has been proposed to identify candidates for a holiday.

Key Clinical Points Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Fractures and osteoporosis are common, particularly among older women, and hip fractures can be devastating. Treatment is generally recommended in postmenopausal women who have a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less, a history of spine or hip fracture, or a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score indicating increased fracture risk. Bisphosphonates (generic) and denosumab reduce the risk of hip, nonvertebral, and vertebral fractures; bisphosphonates are commonly used as first-line treatment in women who do not have contraindications. Teriparatide reduces the risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures have been reported with treatment but are rare. The benefit-to-risk ratio for osteoporosis treatment is strongly positive for most women with osteoporosis. Because benefits are retained after discontinuation of alendronate or zoledronic acid, drug holidays after 5 years of alendronate therapy or 3 years of zoledronic acid therapy may be considered for patients at lower risk for fracture.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114w1C29]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass in adults — this ACP guideline presents a focused update on clinical recommendations for pharmacologic treatments to prevent fractures in adults, based on the best available evidence of the benefits and harms of treatments and consideration of patient values, preferences, and costs. The population is adults (premenopausal and postmenopausal females and males) with low bone mass or primary osteoporosis as diagnosed in primary studies, and baseline risk assessment considers diagnosis of osteoporosis, history of osteoporotic fractures (clinical or incidental), multiple risk factors for fractures, or failure or intolerability of osteoporosis medications rather than scores from available tools. The recommendations are based on biological sex assigned at birth because most studies reported sex rather than gender and the majority enrolled only older females. Evaluated therapies include an analogue of human parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (abaloparatide), bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, zoledronate), a receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) ligand inhibitor (denosumab), recombinant human parathyroid hormone (recombinant PTH) (teriparatide), a sclerostin inhibitor (romosozumab), and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (bazedoxifene, raloxifene), with focus on effectiveness and harms of active drugs compared with placebo or bisphosphonates. The intended audience is all clinicians, and management of secondary osteoporosis in people with cancer and other serious illnesses is outside the scope. The Clinical Guidelines Committee developed this guideline according to ACP's guideline development process, used Evidence-to-Decision tables, and graded recommendations using the GRADE approach; it is planning to maintain this topic as a living guideline with quarterly literature surveillance and periodic updating, and may retire living status if it is no longer a priority, if conclusions are unlikely to change with new evidence, or if new evidence is unlikely to emerge. The guideline is based on an accompanying systematic review and network meta-analysis completed by the ACP Center for Evidence Reviews, and the accompanying review and Supplement Appendixes provide appraised evidence of benefits and harms of evaluated pharmacologic interventions.

### Patient information: bisphosphonates for postmenopausal osteoporosis… [^1156o7Am]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Ensrud KE. Bisphosphonates for Postmenopausal Osteoporosis. JAMA. 2021; 325:

96. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.2923 Bisphosphonates are medications prescribed to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. Osteoporosis causes thinning of the bones, causing them to be more likely to break. Although osteoporosis can affect men, older women past menopause are at highest risk because of their low estrogen levels. Osteoporotic fractures most often happen at the hip, spine, and wrist. They typically result from falling, but sometimes even a mild stress can cause a fracture. Women at highest fracture risk, such as women with osteoporosis diagnosed by bone density testing or women with a personal history of hip or spine fracture, are most likely to benefit from osteoporosis medications. Women receiving osteoporosis medications should have an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D.

Most women being treated for osteoporosis receive a bisphosphonate such as alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, or ibandronate. Because bisphosphonates reside in bone for a long time, they continue to have effects on bone even after they are discontinued. Alendronate and risedronate are taken orally, ibandronate is available as an oral medication or as an intravenous injection, and zoledronate is administered as an intravenous injection. Oral bisphosphonates need to be taken first thing in the morning with a full 8-oz glass of plain water. After taking an oral bisphosphonate, one should remain upright and wait 30 to 60 minutes before lying down, drinking, or eating. This helps ensure that the medication is absorbed and reduces the chance of side effects. All bisphosphonates lower the risk of spine fractures. Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronate are most commonly recommended because they also lower the risk of nonspine fractures, including hip fractures.

Stomach upset is a possible side effect of oral bisphosphonates, but the risk of this problem is markedly reduced by closely following the medication instructions. Very rare potential harms include loss of blood supply to the jawbone and an unusual fracture of the thigh bone. Osteonecrosis of the jaw most commonly occurs after invasive dental procedures such as tooth extraction; women taking bisphosphonates should consult their doctor to determine whether to stop the medication before having this type of procedure. Taking bisphosphonates for more than 5 years may increase risk of having an atypical femoral fracture. For many women, limiting the treatment period to 5 years or less maximizes the benefits of taking bisphosphonates in reducing the chance of having typical osteoporotic fractures while minimizing the risk of having an atypical femoral fracture.

ACP osteoporosis guideline — postmenopausal females with low bone mass: ACP suggests that clinicians take an individualized approach regarding whether to start pharmacologic treatment with a bisphosphonate in females over the age of 65 with low bone mass (osteopenia) to reduce the risk of fractures (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). In this population, zoledronate may have reduced the risk for any clinical or vertebral fractures at 6 years of treatment without higher risk for serious adverse events compared with placebo in a randomized controlled clinical trial, but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of bisphosphonates (zoledronate) on the risk for hip fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and atrial fibrillation at 6 years (insufficient), and other medications have not been examined yet in females with low bone mass. The target population is postmenopausal females diagnosed with low bone mass.

### A broader strategy for osteoporosis interventions [^11334p2U]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Approximately 50% of women experience at least one bone fracture postmenopause. Current screening approaches target anti-fracture interventions to women aged > 60 years who satisfy clinical risk and bone mineral density criteria for osteoporosis. Intervention is only recommended in 7–25% of those women screened currently, well short of the 50% who experience fractures. Large screening trials have not shown clinically significant decreases in the total fracture numbers. By contrast, six large clinical trials of anti-resorptive therapies (for example, bisphosphonates) have demonstrated substantial decreases in the number of fractures in women not identified as being at high risk of fracture. This finding suggests that broader use of generic bisphosphonates in women selected by age or fracture risk would result in a reduction in total fracture numbers, a strategy likely to be cost-effective. The utility of the current bone density definition of osteoporosis, which neither corresponds with who suffers fractures nor defines who should be treated, requires reappraisal.

### Recurrent proximal femur fractures in a teenager with osteogenesis imperfecta on continuous bisphosphonate therapy: are we overtreating? [^113TzHjw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term bisphosphonate (BP) therapy in adults with osteoporosis is associated with atypical femoral fractures, caused by increased material bone density and prolonged suppression of bone remodeling which may reduce fracture toughness. In children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), long-term intravenous BP therapy improves bone structure and mass without further increasing the already hypermineralized bone matrix, and is generally regarded as safe. Here we report a teenage girl with OI type IV, who was started on cyclical intravenous pamidronate therapy at age 6 years because of recurrent fractures. Transiliac bone biopsy revealed classical structural features of OI but unusually low bone resorption surfaces. She made substantial improvements in functional ability, bone mass, and fracture rate. However, after 5 years of pamidronate therapy she started to develop recurrent, bilateral, nontraumatic, and proximal femur fractures, which satisfied the case definition for atypical femur fractures. Some fractures were preceded by periosteal reactions and prodromal pain. Pamidronate was discontinued after 7 years of therapy, following which she sustained two further nontraumatic femur fractures, and continued to show delayed tibial osteotomy healing. Despite rodding surgery, and very much in contrast to her affected, untreated, and normally mobile mother, she remains wheelchair-dependent. The case of this girl raises questions about the long-term safety of BP therapy in some children, in particular about the risk of oversuppressed bone remodeling with the potential for microcrack accumulation, delayed healing, and increased stiffness. The principal concern is whether there is point at which benefit from BP therapy could turn into harm, where fracture risk increases again. This case should stimulate debate whether current adult atypical femoral fracture guidance should apply to children, and whether low-frequency, low-dose cyclical, intermittent, or oral treatment maintenance regimens should be considered on a case-by-case basis. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Drug insight: bisphosphonates for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^114vv5cs]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Bisphosphonates are potent antiresorptive agents, which have largely been used for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis during the past 10 years. When embedded in bone matrix, bisphosphonates are taken up by osteoclasts engaged in bone resorption, leading — mainly by inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase, a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway — to osteoclast apoptosis. Bone resorption decreases, with consequent improvement in the mechanical properties of bone and a reduced risk of fracture. Alendronate and risedronate are oral nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown the ability of these bisphosphonates to halve the risk of vertebral fracture when taken daily for 3 years. Nonvertebral fracture risk, including that at the hip, was also significantly decreased. Weekly regimens have simplified the administration of bisphosphonates and, probably, improved adherence to treatment. A significant reduction in the risk of vertebral fracture has also been demonstrated with an intermittent regimen of ibandronate, which is a new, potent, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate. Ibandronate was recently marketed for use in an oral, once-monthly dose of 150 mg, with the goal of improving compliance. Bisphosphonates are usually well tolerated in the long term. Intravenous administration of bisphosphonates in women with osteoporosis, which is currently under investigation, might be an interesting future option for women who cannot tolerate oral regimens, and for enhancing compliance.

Comparative pharmacotherapy signals include that evidence from randomized controlled trials suggested there may be no differences between bisphosphonates and denosumab in fracture risk reduction at 36 months or beyond, and that raloxifene probably reduced radiographic fractures compared with placebo but increased risk for withdrawal due to adverse events in RCTs and was associated with higher risk for venous thromboembolism in observational studies with at least 36 months of follow‑up compared with bisphosphonate users and other drug classes.

### Fracture outcomes related to persistence and compliance with oral bisphosphonates [^114QdcLD]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

The effects of low persistence on fracture risk have not been fully addressed. The objectives of this study were to describe the persistence and compliance with bisphosphonates and to evaluate the association with fracture risk. The General Practice Research database was used to identify patients ≥ 18 yr of age prescribed alendronate or risedronate. The follow-up was divided into periods of current and past use. Time-dependent Cox regression was used. The study population included 44,531 patients; 58.3% of the patients continued bisphosphonate treatment for > 1 yr and 23.6% for > 5 yr. The risk of hip/femur fracture (adjusted relative rate [RR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.94) and osteoporotic fracture (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94) were lower with current compared with past bisphosphonate use. The largest reduction in hip/femur and osteoporotic fracture risk was observed in patients treated for at least 6 mo and no reduction in those treated for < 6 mo. The risks of hip/femur and osteoporotic fractures followed the pattern of nonosteoporotic fractures in the first 6 mo but then started to reduce after 6–12 mo of treatment. Increased risks of osteoporotic and hip/femur fractures were found in patients with low compliance. Use of bisphosphonates was associated with fracture risk reductions after 6–12 mo of treatment, but only 58% of the patients were treated for at least 1 year. Improvement in long-term persistence to bisphosphonate treatment may be important to reduce the impact of osteoporosis-related fractures.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^116ziuG8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

ECTS recommendations regarding denosumab use following diagnosis of AFF include:

Follow with a short course of bisphosphonate or selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for surgically treated bilateral AFF or unilateral AFF without sign of contralateral incomplete AFF.
Denosumab could be continued or initiated in patients at high risk of fragility fracture with bilateral surgically managed AFFs.
Denosumab could be stopped without follow-up therapy in patients at low risk of fragility fractures without history of vertebral fractures (VFs), particularly in those who have only had one or two six-monthly injections of 60 mg.
Consider a SERM or teriparatide in patients at high risk of fragility fracture, with the caveat of accelerated loss of BMD when switching from denosumab to teriparatide.

Further evidence of the low risk of both AFF and ONJ is presented by Ferrari et al.who published an estimate of fractures prevented relative to skeletal adverse events observed with up to 10 years of denosumab use. The group modelled a hypothetical placebo group and calculated the fractures prevented with denosumab treatment and related these to the number of cases of AFF and ONJ observed in the FREEDOM trial and its extension study (five per 100,000 subject-years and 35 per 100,000 subject-years respectively). The skeletal benefit/harm ratio was 281 for AFF and 40 for ONJ, indicating a favourable outcome of denosumab use long-term.

Early detection of incomplete atypical AFF using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) systems is a means to early identification of AFF because default length of the femur field visualizes the sub-trochanteric region. Focal thickening of the periosteal surface and endosteal surface of the lateral femur cortex can be identified. The default length of the femur image at the time of DXA can be extended to view the entire length of the femur. DXA manufacturers have added a feature to DXA protocols that allows rapid imaging of the entire femur length, with low radiation exposure and near X-ray quality imaging. The Official Positions of the International Society of Clinical Densitometry recommends: consider bilateral full length femur imaging for detecting abnormalities in the spectrum of AFF in patients who are receiving bisphosphonates or denosumab therapy or discontinued it within the last year, with a cumulative exposure of 3 or more years, especially those on glucocorticoid therapy.

### Approach to the patient with bone fracture: making the first fracture the last [^115kJss3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Atypical femur fractures (AFFs) are atraumatic fractures of the subtrochanteric femoral shaft, believed to result from accumulation of microdamage caused by the inhibition of bone remodeling during prolonged antiresorptive therapy. While the incidence of AFFs rises with increasing duration of treatment, with an absolute risk of around 11 fractures per 10 000 person-years of bisphosphonate treatment and similar risk in denosumab users, the absolute risk remains very low and the benefit of treatment usually outweighs the risk of AFF by a large margin. As the risk of AFF declines rapidly following cessation of antiresorptive therapy, a "drug holiday" may be considered in appropriate patients, that is, in those without major risk factors such as prevalent or new fragility fractures or very low BMD. In stark contrast, denosumab discontinuation is not recommended at any point as this leads to a complete and rapid reversal of its effects on bone turnover and BMD, with an increased risk of multiple vertebral fractures. Risk factors for multiple vertebral fractures post denosumab cessation include longer duration of treatment and cessation, prevalent vertebral fractures, greater hip BMD gain on treatment, and greater hip BMD loss off treatment. Thus, while adherence to all forms of osteoprotective pharmacotherapy is important, particular attention should be paid to 1) communicate clearly to patients and their GPs that once denosumab is commenced the drug cannot be ceased without subsequent antiresorptive therapy to prevent bone loss, and 2) carefully consider the appropriateness of using denosumab in a younger patient in whom lifelong antiresorptive treatment is neither desirable nor indicated.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw, another extremely rare adverse event associated with antiresorptive therapy, typically occurs in the setting of invasive dental procedures and higher-dose regimens in oncology patients. Patients should be aware that the incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw in the setting of osteoporosis treatment is only around 1 in 10 000 to 100 000 patient-years. They should be counseled on the importance of informing their dentist of antiresorptive treatment, with antiresorptive therapy recommended 4 to 6 weeks after invasive procedures to promote wound healing.

Clinical considerations for pharmacologic management — Clinicians should prescribe generic medications if possible rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians treating postmenopausal females with osteoporosis should encourage adherence to recommended drug treatments and healthy lifestyle modifications, including exercise, and counseling for evaluation and prevention of falls. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be part of fracture prevention in all postmenopausal females with low bone mass or osteoporosis. Clinicians should assess baseline risk for fracture based on individualized assessment of bone density, history of fractures, response to prior treatments for osteoporosis, and multiple risk factors for fractures in postmenopausal females with primary osteoporosis. Current evidence suggests that increasing the duration of bisphosphonate therapy to longer than 5 years probably reduced risk for new vertebral fractures but not risk for other fractures at the expense of increased risk for long-term harms. Therefore, clinicians should consider stopping bisphosphonate treatment after 5 years unless the patient has a strong indication for treatment continuation. The decision of a temporary treatment discontinuation (holidays) should be individualized and based on baseline risk for fractures, type of medication and its half-life in bone, duration of discontinuation, benefits and harms of discontinuation, and higher risk for fracture due to drug discontinuation. Females initially treated with an anabolic agent should be offered an antiresorptive agent after discontinuation to preserve gains and because of serious risk for rebound and multiple vertebral fractures. Older postmenopausal females with primary osteoporosis or low bone mass are at increased risk for falls and other adverse events due to polypharmacy and drug interactions need individualized treatment selection based on comorbidities and concomitant medications associated with higher risk for falls/fractures.

### Drug insight: existing and emerging therapies for osteoporosis [^116D3kWt]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem that is characterized by microarchitectural deterioration, low bone mass, and increased risk of fractures. Currently, many women and men affected with this disease are not diagnosed or treated. As osteoporosis is often clinically silent, risk-factor assessment and measurement of BMD are needed to identify those who may benefit from osteoporosis therapy. Although adequate daily intake of calcium and vitamin D, and regular weight-bearing exercise are important for skeletal health, they are not adequate treatments for individuals with osteoporosis. Therapies approved for treatment and/or prevention of osteoporosis in the United States include oral bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate), calcitonin, estrogens, teriparatide (parathyroid hormone fragment [1–34]), and raloxifene. For most patients, oral bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice, given the large-scale randomized-trial data demonstrating efficacy in fracture reduction, although bisphosphonates that reduce spine and nonspine fractures (e.g. alendronate and risedronate) are preferred. For high-risk patients (those with very low bone density, or with fractures), teriparatide therapy for 2 years should be considered. The treatment paradigm for osteoporosis will evolve further as promising new treatments progress through clinical development.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1129L4dq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — bisphosphonate duration, holiday, sequencing, and special populations: Current evidence suggests that increasing the duration of bisphosphonate therapy to longer than 3 to 5 years reduces risk for new vertebral fractures but not risk for other fractures; however, there is increased risk for long-term harms, therefore, clinicians should consider stopping bisphosphonate treatment after 5 years unless the patient has a strong indication for treatment continuation. The decision for a temporary bisphosphonate treatment discontinuation (holiday) and its duration should be individualized and should be based on baseline risk for fractures, type of medication and its half-life in bone, benefits, and harms. Females initially treated with an anabolic agent should be offered an antiresorptive agent after discontinuation to preserve gains and because of serious risk for rebound and multiple vertebral fractures. Older adults (for example, those aged > 65 years) with osteoporosis may be at increased risk for falls and other adverse events due to polypharmacy or drug interactions, and individualized treatment selection should address contraindications and cautions for drugs indicated to treat osteoporosis based on comorbidities and concomitant medications. There is variable risk for low bone mass in transgender persons based on age at gonadectomy, therapy with sex hormones, distribution of comorbidities, and behavioral risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures.

Bisphosphonate applicability and denosumab positioning: These recommendations are applicable to bisphosphonates studied in the eligible primary randomized controlled trials (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronate), and there is no evidence that ibandronate reduces hip fractures; the RANK ligand inhibitor (denosumab) can be used as a second-line treatment in both females and males at high risk for fracture, evidence from randomized controlled trials showed that denosumab had a favorable long-term net benefit in postmenopausal females with primary osteoporosis, a history of osteoporotic fractures, and a history of treatment with bisphosphonates, and use of denosumab was not associated with a higher risk for osteonecrosis of the jaw.

### Can bisphosphonate therapy reduce overall mortality in patients with osteoporosis? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113LG23G]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

For patients with osteoporosis, bisphosphonate therapy can reduce the risk of fractures, but its effect on reducing mortality remains unclear. Previous studies on this topic have produced conflicting results and generally have been too small to definitively answer the question of whether bisphosphonate therapy reduces mortality. Therefore, a meta-analysis may help us arrive at a more conclusive answer.

Questions/Purposes

In a large meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we asked: (1) Does bisphosphonate use reduce mortality? (2) Is there a subgroup effect based on whether different bisphosphonate drugs were used (zoledronate, alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate), different geographic regions where the study took place (Europe, the Americas, and Asia), whether the study was limited to postmenopausal female patients, or whether the trials lasted 3 years or longer?

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using multiple databases, including Embase, Web of Science, Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, with each database searched up to November 20, 2023 (which also was the date of our last search), following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We included randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with participants diagnosed with osteoporosis and receiving bisphosphonate treatment. We excluded papers posted to preprint servers, other unpublished work, conference abstracts, and papers that were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov but were not yet published. We collected 2263 records. After excluding records due to study type, study content not meeting the inclusion criteria, and duplicates, our meta-analysis included 47 placebo-controlled RCTs involving 59,437 participants. Data extraction, quality assessment, and statistical analyses were performed. The evaluation of randomized trials for potential bias was conducted using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. This assessment encompassed factors such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, subject blinding, outcome assessor blinding, incomplete outcome data, and reporting bias. Some studies did not provide explicit details regarding random sequence generation, leading to a high risk of selection bias. A few studies, due to their open-label nature, were unable to achieve double-blind conditions for both the subjects and the researchers, resulting in intermediate performance bias. Nevertheless, the overall study quality was high. Due to the low heterogeneity among the studies, as evidenced by the low statistical heterogeneity (that is, a low I 2 statistic), we opted for a fixed-effects model, indicating that the effect size is consistent across the studies. In such cases, the fixed-effects model can provide more precise estimates. According to the results of the funnel plot, we did not find evidence of publication bias.

Results

The use of bisphosphonates did not reduce the overall risk of mortality in patients with osteoporosis (risk ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.88 to 1.03]). Subgroup analyses involving different bisphosphonate drugs (zoledronate, alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate), regions (Europe, the Americas, and Asia), diverse populations (postmenopausal female patients and other patients), and trials lasting 3 years or longer revealed no associations with reduced overall mortality.

Conclusion

Based on our comprehensive meta-analysis, there is high-quality evidence suggesting that bisphosphonate therapy for patients with osteoporosis does not reduce the overall risk of mortality despite its effectiveness in reducing the risk of fractures. The primary consideration for prescribing bisphosphonates to individuals with osteoporosis should continue to be centered on reducing fracture risk, aligning with clinical guidelines. Long-term studies are needed to investigate potential effects on mortality during extended treatment periods.

### Managing osteoporosis in patients on long-term bisphosphonate treatment: report of a task force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research [^115AQZNp]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2016). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are the most commonly used medications for osteoporosis. This ASBMR report provides guidance on BP therapy duration with a risk-benefit perspective. Two trials provided evidence for long-term BP use. In the Fracture Intervention Trial Long-term Extension (FLEX), postmenopausal women receiving alendronate for 10 years had fewer clinical vertebral fractures than those switched to placebo after 5 years. In the HORIZON extension, women who received 6 annual infusions of zoledronic acid had fewer morphometric vertebral fractures compared with those switched to placebo after 3 years. Low hip T-score, between -2 and -2.5 in FLEX and below -2.5 in HORIZON extension, predicted a beneficial response to continued therapy. Hence, the Task Force suggests that after 5 years of oral BP or 3 years of intravenous BP, reassessment of risk should be considered. In women at high risk, for example, older women, those with a low hip T-score or high fracture risk score, those with previous major osteoporotic fracture, or who fracture on therapy, continuation of treatment for up to 10 years (oral) or 6 years (intravenous), with periodic evaluation, should be considered. The risk of atypical femoral fracture, but not osteonecrosis of the jaw, clearly increases with BP therapy duration, but such rare events are outweighed by vertebral fracture risk reduction in high-risk patients. For women not at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of BP treatment, a drug holiday of 2 to 3 years can be considered. The suggested approach for long-term BP use is based on limited evidence, only for vertebral fracture reduction, in mostly white postmenopausal women, and does not replace the need for clinical judgment. It may be applicable to men and patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, with some adaptations. It is unlikely that future trials will provide data for formulating definitive recommendations. © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Antiresorptive-associated spontaneous fractures of both tibiae, followed by an atypical femur fracture during the sequential treatment with alendronate, denosumab then teriparatide [^1161dZSW]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

In summary, atypical fractures potentially associated with antiresorptive therapy can occur in weight-bearing long bones other than the femur. Moreover, teriparatide usage does not prevent the development of atypical fractures. Given the low incidence of bisphosphonate-related atypical fractures and good evidence that benefits outweigh risks if appropriate 'bisphosphonate holidays' are taken, findings from this case should not be extrapolated to other patients taking antiresorptives beyond 5 years. However, bony femoral or tibial tenderness in a patient on long-term antiresorptive treatment should prompt careful investigation to exclude an atypical fracture. Current guidelines are unclear about the optimal treatment of severe osteoporosis after an atypical fracture, and new strategies may be required to prevent ongoing harm in patients such as this.

Learning points

Atypical fractures in the tibia can be a potential complication of long-term antiresorptive therapy.
Teriparatide, while helpful in increasing bone mass, does not fully prevent the development of an atypical fracture.
Careful investigation should be considered in patients on long-term antiresorptive agents presenting with bony tenderness to exclude an atypical fracture.
Appropriate 'bisphosphonate holidays' should be taken to minimise the risk of developing atypical fractures.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111LmN5Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Rationale for Recommendation 4 — evidence limits and gaps: Evidence was limited on treatments in adults with low bone mass and was largely informed by a single trial in older females that showed zoledronic acid may reduce any clinical or vertebral fractures; fracture prevention in females with low bone mass needs to be balanced with harms and costs of bisphosphonates based on an individualized assessment of baseline risk for fractures. Diagnostic criteria for low bone mass in females varied in the primary studies, and the effectiveness across different individual bisphosphonates has not been directly evaluated in females with low bone mass. The systematic review did not identify any studies reporting on fracture outcomes for males with low bone mass or on differences in treatment outcomes by sex.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^1148XtuZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bisphosphonate treatment holidays are considered because the risk of atypical femur fractures (AFFs) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), particularly with long-term bisphosphonate use beyond 5 years, has prompted concerns about defining the treatment course.

### The impact of preventive measures on the burden of femoral fractures-a modelling approach to estimating the impact of fall prevention exercises and oral bisphosphonate treatment for the years 2014 and 2025 [^113omQxv]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Although bisphosphonate treatment may be very effective only about 65% of femoral fractures of persons 65 years and older are attributable to osteoporosis in our model. As a consequence, most persons with osteoporosis would need to receive bisphosphonates in order to reduce the number of femoral fractures: 79.4% in 2014 and 56.2% in 2025 to attain above mentioned reductions.

The calculations are based on meta-analyses pooling data from studies with various inclusion criteria. Effect size of FPE was taken from a meta-analysis that included participants with different fall risks at baseline. While some studies included participants only on the basis of age, other studies required the presence of specific risk factors. However, fall risk at baseline does not seem to modify the effect size of FPE and was not considered in our analyses.

FPE studies conducted to date do not have sufficient power to use fractures as primary outcome variable. For our calculations a meta-analysis was used which demonstrated a reduction of all fractures combined, but did not report femoral fractures separately. However, femoral fractures represent the most frequent type of fragility fractures in older age and are nearly always the result of a fall. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume a linear correlation between fracture incidence and femoral fracture incidence.

The effect size of bisphosphonate treatment on fracture reduction was taken from a meta-analysis including studies of four different oral bisphosphonates. Inclusion criteria of these studies varied: some studies required a prior fracture, others recruited based on BMD with different T-score thresholds. In our analyses, we focused on persons aged 65 years and older with osteoporosis and did not consider persons with osteopenia. The incremental benefit of bisphosphonate treatment for persons with osteopenia is lower than for persons with osteoporosis. Including persons with osteopenia, the number of potentially preventable fractures would increase. At the same time, the proportion of persons that need to receive bisphosphonate treatment in order to prevent the targeted number of fractures would increase as well.

### Atypical femur fractures: review of epidemiology, relationship to bisphosphonates, prevention, and clinical management [^113L1Hpo]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are highly effective in treating osteoporosis and reducing hip, vertebral, and other fractures by as much as 50% to 70%. However, since 2006, atypical femur fractures (AFFs) emerged as potential side effects of BPs and other treatments. These fractures have unusual radiologic features and occur with little trauma. Public concern has led to a > 50% decrease in BP usage. AFFs are rare: for each AFF, > 1200 fractures, including 135 hip fractures, are prevented. Case definition criteria were updated by the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research in 2014. Many epidemiologic studies have been reported, and although methodologically challenging, generally support a BP-AFF association. However, the magnitude of the association between BPs and AFFs is uncertain: estimates of relative risk for AFFs among BP users vs nonusers range from 1 to 65 with a meta-analysis estimate of 1.7. Although mechanistic studies have proposed several hypotheses explaining how BPs might decrease bone strength, AFF pathogenesis remains uncertain and cannot explain the paradox of efficacy of reduction of common fractures while increasing risk for rare fractures at one site. There are several consistent risk factors, including Asian race (in North America), femoral bowing, and glucocorticoid use, whereas others remain unclear. Consensus is emerging about strategies to prevent AFFs in BP users (including drug holidays after 5 years' use in some patients). In conclusion, AFFs can be devastating, but even under the most pessimistic assumptions, the benefit/risk ratio is highly positive for BPs, particularly during 3 to 5 years of use. As understanding of AFFs increases, it is becoming increasingly possible to maximize BP benefits while minimizing AFF risk.
