## Question

What should be the next step for recurrent AFib in someone who had ablation treatment years ago, was in normal sinus rhythm, but is now experiencing recurrence?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the next step should be to manage recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) in a patient who had catheter ablation several years ago, was in normal sinus rhythm for a long symptom‑free interval, and now has recurrence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true arrhythmia recurrence and classifying its timing and type. Then, I should reassess thromboembolic risk and anticoagulation. Next, I will consider immediate rate control needs versus rhythm control, weigh antiarrhythmic drug therapy against repeat ablation, and plan a redo strategy if appropriate. Finally, I need to discuss alternatives if redo ablation is unsuitable, and integrate comorbidity and lifestyle management with a structured follow‑up plan [^114sr2Bx] [^114Cm8je] [^112QYdgL].

> Let me first confirm the rhythm diagnosis and characterize the recurrence, because symptoms alone can be misleading and atypical atrial tachycardias (ATs) after prior ablation are common; I should obtain a 12‑lead ECG during symptoms when possible and use ambulatory monitoring (Holter, event, or patch) to document AF or AT episodes of at least 30 seconds and to quantify burden, and I should distinguish early, late, and very‑late recurrence since very‑late recurrence after a long quiescent period can reflect different mechanisms than early relapse [^117S1RTM] [^115hxjfz] [^115DAyM6].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical phenotype, because treatment selection hinges on symptom severity, AF burden, and whether the pattern has evolved from paroxysmal to persistent; if the arrhythmia is now persistent, I need to anticipate substrate beyond pulmonary veins and consider strategies that address atrial fibrosis or drivers rather than PVI alone [^113gVpjd] [^113NLgkr].

> Next, I should review stroke prevention, and I need to ensure oral anticoagulation (OAC) is managed according to CHA₂DS₂‑VASc rather than apparent rhythm outcome; uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended periprocedurally, and after any repeat ablation, OAC should be continued for at least 2 months and then maintained long‑term based on stroke risk rather than procedural success [^114Cm8je] [^1165kZWx] [^113hxTwH].

> I will now examine immediate rate control because if the patient is hemodynamically stable but symptomatic from a rapid ventricular response, I should confirm there is no decompensation and then titrate a beta‑blocker or a non‑dihydropyridine calcium‑channel blocker as first‑line rate agents while I finalize rhythm‑control decisions [^114Cm8je] [^11736o7w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ablation before discussing medical rhythm control; in a symptomatic patient with recurrent AF after prior ablation, both repeat catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drug therapy are guideline‑endorsed, but redo ablation is generally favored when symptoms improved after the index procedure or PVI failed initially, especially if the patient desires durable rhythm control and procedural risk is acceptable [^114sr2Bx] [^114Cm8je].

> Let me think about antiarrhythmic options if we choose a pharmacologic trial; for acute self‑terminating episodes in a structurally normal heart without ischemic disease, a previously tested pill‑in‑the‑pocket flecainide or propafenone strategy can be used alongside AV nodal blockade, whereas for maintenance, low‑dose amiodarone is effective but should be reserved for cases where other AADs are ineffective or contraindicated due to extracardiac toxicity; dronedarone or sotalol may be considered in selected patients, recognizing modest efficacy compared with redo ablation [^114YuL7V] [^1111eHN8] [^114Cm8je].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought early recurrences in the blanking period did not predict long‑term failure, but I should double‑check that; while short‑term AADs can reduce early recurrences, they do not improve longer‑term freedom from AF, and more recent data suggest that arrhythmias during the blanking period correlate with later failure, so I should use early recurrence as a risk signal even if not an absolute determinant of strategy [^114Fs3ZT] [^113Nog2T] [^1172z7nU].

> For redo ablation, I should confirm the likely mechanisms and plan the procedure accordingly; PV reconnection is common and should be the first target, but in very‑late recurrence, non‑PV triggers and right atrial sources are relatively more prominent, so after confirming and re‑isolating any reconnected PVs, I should actively search for extra‑PV triggers and organized AT circuits that often arise after prior ablation lines [^1134ToQg] [^116VRbgA] [^11126xsF] [^116UKCiV].

> I need to check our pre‑procedure work‑up and mapping toolkit to maximize efficacy; preprocedural CT or MR can delineate left atrial and PV anatomy and exclude stenosis, high‑density electroanatomic mapping can localize gaps and AT isthmuses, and in selected cases noninvasive ECGI can complement invasive strategies, but I should verify feasibility and limitations before relying on it [^117USh7q] [^116M1B21].

> Hold on, I should verify the energy source decision; both radiofrequency point‑by‑point and cryoballoon are acceptable for redo PVI, and while pulsed‑field ablation is emerging with promising safety and efficacy, it is not yet mandated by guidelines for redo strategy selection, so operator experience and lesion set goals should guide energy choice [^notfound] [^1134ToQg] [^114sr2Bx].

> Let me set expectations realistically; single‑procedure success after AF ablation averages around 50% at multi‑year follow‑up, whereas multiple procedures yield roughly 80% freedom from atrial arrhythmias, and even after long‑term success, very‑late recurrences can be managed successfully with redo in a majority, though mechanisms often shift toward non‑PV triggers [^112nt4YJ] [^116UKCiV].

> If repeat percutaneous ablation is unsuitable or fails, I should consider alternatives; a hybrid epicardial–endocardial strategy can be effective in carefully selected patients after failed percutaneous therapy within a multidisciplinary rhythm‑control team, and for refractory rate issues or in patients exhausted of rhythm options, AV node ablation with pacing is reasonable, favoring conduction‑system pacing when EF is preserved and CRT when HF is present, with initial pacemaker lower rate programming at 80–90 bpm to reduce sudden death risk after AV node ablation [^112vZLTr] [^1128hLEJ] [^112McoRj] [^113brpZu] [^112CNSQK].

> Next, I should review and intensify risk‑factor and comorbidity management because it materially alters ablation outcomes and AF trajectory; I need to ensure blood pressure control, structured weight loss in obesity, treatment of sleep apnea, optimization of glycemic control, alcohol moderation, smoking cessation, and regular exercise, aligned with AF‑CARE principles and national guidance [^112QYdgL] [^117YHSUT].

> I will now examine a follow‑up plan that tracks both rhythm and outcomes without overburdening the patient; scheduled visits with ECG at 3, 6, and 12 months and periodic Holter thereafter are reasonable, with symptom‑triggered ECGs to capture recurrences, recognizing that the intensity of monitoring should match goals such as quality of life versus arrhythmia burden reduction [^117S1RTM] [^116wgq1w].

> But wait, what if the patient is concerned about disease progression and long‑term value; I should explain that earlier durable rhythm control may slow progression to persistent AF and improve cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life, and that models suggest economic and health value to preventing progression, reinforcing the importance of timely, effective rhythm strategies in appropriate candidates through shared decision‑making [^114qAMhN] [^114Hp8EA].

The next step for recurrent AF after prior ablation is to **confirm recurrence with ECG or ambulatory monitoring** and **assess symptom burden and stroke risk** (CHA₂DS₂-VASc) [^114Cm8je] [^117S1RTM]. If symptomatic or high risk, **consider antiarrhythmic therapy or repeat ablation**; if asymptomatic or low risk, rate control [^115izmTN] and anticoagulation per risk are reasonable [^114Cm8je]. Repeat ablation is appropriate for symptomatic recurrence [^114sr2Bx], especially if prior PVI improved symptoms, and AV node ablation with pacing [^112McoRj] is reserved for refractory cases [^111TFXzf]. Always address modifiable risk factors and comorbidities to reduce recurrence [^112QYdgL] [^114Cm8je].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm recurrence**: Document AF with ECG, Holter, or event monitor [^117S1RTM].

- **Assess symptom burden**: Determine impact on quality of life and daily function [^114Cm8je].

- **Evaluate stroke risk**: Use CHA₂DS₂-VASc to guide anticoagulation.

- **Identify modifiable risk factors**: Screen for hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and alcohol use [^112QYdgL].

---

## Medical management

- **Antiarrhythmic drug therapy**: Consider AADs (e.g. flecainide, propafenone [^114YuL7V], sotalol, dronedarone, or low-dose amiodarone) [^1111eHN8] for symptomatic recurrence [^114Cm8je].

- **Rate control strategy**: Use beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin if rhythm control is not preferred or feasible [^114Cm8je].

- **Anticoagulation**: Continue or initiate based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc, regardless of rhythm status [^114Cm8je].

---

## Interventional management

Interventional management options include **repeat catheter ablation** [^1134ToQg], which is appropriate for symptomatic recurrence [^114sr2Bx], especially if prior PVI improved symptoms or failed. **AV node ablation with pacemaker** [^112McoRj] is considered for refractory symptomatic AF unresponsive to medical therapy or repeat ablation [^111TFXzf].

---

## Risk factor modification

Risk factor modification focuses on **lifestyle changes**: weight loss, blood pressure control, diabetes management, alcohol reduction, and sleep apnea treatment reduce recurrence [^112QYdgL] [^114Cm8je].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **regular follow-up** [^117S1RTM] with periodic ECG and Holter monitoring to detect asymptomatic recurrence and guide therapy, along with **patient education** on symptom recognition and when to seek care [^114Cm8je].

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm recurrence with ECG or ambulatory monitoring [^117S1RTM] |
| 2 | Assess symptom burden and stroke risk (CHA₂DS₂-VASc) [^114Cm8je] |
| 3 | Initiate or adjust antiarrhythmic or rate control therapy [^1111eHN8] |

### Economic and health value of delaying atrial fibrillation progression using radiofrequency catheter ablation [^114Hp8EA]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

To isolate the effect of progression, the model characterized AF disease using two severity levels: early AF, wherein patients were in normal sinus rhythm with or without PAF recurrences, and advanced AF, wherein patients could experience persistent or long-standing persistent AF. Advanced AF was intended to characterize generally sicker patients due to having experienced PsAF with potentially higher steady-state health care resource utilization rates but was not intended to represent a patient's exact rhythm status over the simulation period. The model incorporated the risk of progression from early AF to advanced AF and generated lifetime discounted costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on AF severity-dependent rates of resource consumption, health outcomes, and complications.

The model commenced with the entry of patients with PAF refractory to at least one AAD or rate control drug, with an average age of 67 years and a HATCH score (Hypertension, Age, Stroke or transient ischemic attack, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Heart failure) of 1 to 4, to simulate patients similar to those included in ATTEST. Figure 1 summarizes each possible health-state transition (excluding death) from one cycle to another. Patients received either RFCA or AADs in the first cycle (3 months) and transitioned from PAF to a sinus rhythm state for the next cycle. In subsequent cycles, patients could experience PAF recurrence, progression to advanced AF (with the first occurrence of PsAF), or remain in normal sinus rhythm.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering low-dose amiodarone (100–200 mg/day) for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF and normal LV function. However, due to its adverse effect profile, it should be reserved for situations when other rhythm control strategies are ineffective, not preferred, or contraindicated.

### 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^117S1RTM]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of the trial should align with the type of monitoring performed. If the ultimate goal is to improve patients' quality of life (QOL), then excessive monitoring for asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) might not be warranted. However, if the goal is to reduce AF burden or change prognosis, particularly from a stroke perspective, continuous monitoring should be required.

In the past, the consensus statement provided minimum clinical requirements for postablation monitoring in clinical trials. Initially stringent, the last consensus statement made these requirements more flexible. The consensus recommends the following minimum monitoring requirements:

- **Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)**: Follow-up screening should include a minimum of three visits (e.g. at 3, 6, and 12 months), with a 12-lead ECG at each visit. A 24-hour Holter should be conducted at the end of the follow-up period (e.g. 12 months). Limited event recording is recommended from the end of the 3-month blanking period to the end of follow-up, both at regular intervals and with patient-activated recordings obtained at the time of symptoms (or equivalent). Follow-up beyond 1 year is encouraged, potentially occurring every 6 months with Holter and ECG (or equivalent).

- **Persistent and long-standing persistent AF**: Follow-up screening should include a minimum of three visits (e.g. at 3, 6, and 12 months), with a 12-lead ECG at each visit and a 24-hour Holter every 6 months. Event recording from the end of the 3-month blanking period to the end of follow-up, as well as at symptom onset (or equivalent), is recommended.

### Cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation versus medical therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in the United Kingdom [^1165Y4tR]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

The model structure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and the treatment protocol for AF recurrence is depicted. The structure and flow of patients through the model are illustrated in the accompanying diagrams. Figure 1A shows the general flow of patients through various health states in the model, while Figure 1B depicts the protocol for patients that experience recurrence in the model.

1. All patients begin in the "treatment" state, incurring expenses related to both the pretreatment work-up and the treatment itself.
2. Patients who undergo ablation are assumed to have initial procedural success.
3. In the "normal sinus rhythm" and "AF recurrence" health states, patients incur costs related to follow-up and maintenance care.
4. All patients in the ablation arm who restore normal sinus rhythm from AF recurrence do so by either starting antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) or receiving a repeat ablation. In the AAD arm, it is assumed that all patients do so by changing AADs.
5. In the catheter ablation arm, a subset of patients with AF recurrence will receive a single repeat ablation procedure.
6. After attempting four treatments, as outlined in the recurrence treatment protocol, patients will cease rhythm control efforts and start taking rate control drugs for the remainder of the model.
7. Patients may experience cardiovascular events such as ischemic stroke, major bleeding event, or cardiac arrest during the model time horizon. After a cardiovascular event, patients can recover without disability and continue rhythm control efforts, moving to either the normal sinus rhythm or AF recurrence states. Alternatively, they may become disabled and move into a post-adverse event state.

### Fibrosis-guided ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113gVpjd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis were carried out following the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, alongside adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA) Statement. The prospective meta‐analysis protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42024561077).

The PICO question addressed: "In patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), does pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) plus adjunctive fibrosis‐guided ablation influence procedural efficacy and safety compared to PVI alone?"

- **Database search**: Searches were conducted on MEDLINE and EMBASE, covering all content from inception until 6th September 2024. The search strings included terms like "atrial fibrillation", "catheter ablation", "fibrosis", and "randomized controlled trial". A detailed search strategy is available in Supplementary Table 1. Reference lists of studies that potentially met eligibility criteria were also examined.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Studies were considered eligible if they were (1) randomized controlled trials; (2) compared PVI plus adjunctive fibrosis‐guided ablation versus ablation not targeting fibrotic regions; (3) enrolled patients with any type of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or long‐standing persistent); (4) reported prespecified efficacy or safety outcomes of interest; (5) had a follow‐up duration of at least 12 months. Studies lacking comparator arms, non-randomized, or non-human studies were excluded.

The main outcome of interest was freedom from atrial arrhythmias following a 3‐month blanking period.

### The different mechanisms between late and very late recurrences of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing a repeated catheter ablation [^116VRbgA]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

The mechanisms of late (1 year after the ablation) recurrences of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) after catheter ablation have not been reported.

- **Methods and results**: Fifty consecutive patients undergoing a repeated electrophysiologic study to investigate the recurrence of paroxysmal AF after the first ablation were included. Group 1 consisted of 12 patients with very late (26 ± 13 months) and group 2 consisted of 38 patients with late (3 ± 3 months) recurrence of paroxysmal AF. In the baseline study, group 1 had a lower incidence of AF foci from the pulmonary veins (PVs) (67% vs. 92%, P = 0.048) and a higher incidence of AF foci from the right atrium (50% vs. 13%, P = 0.014) than group 2. In the repeated study, group 1 had a higher incidence of AF foci from the right atrium (67% vs. 3%, P < 0.001) and a lower incidence of AF foci from the left atrium (50% vs. 97%, P < 0.001), including a lower incidence of AF foci from the PVs (50% vs. 79%, P = 0.07) and from the left atrial free wall (0% vs. 29%, P = 0.046) than group 2. Furthermore, most of these AF foci (64% of group 1, 65% of group 2) were from the previously targeted foci.

- **Conclusion**: The right atrial foci played an important role in the very late recurrence of AF, whereas the left atrial foci (the majority were PVs) were the major origin of the late recurrence of AF after the catheter ablation of paroxysmal AF.

### Long-term outcomes of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112nt4YJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Until very recently, few data have been available on AF ablation outcomes beyond 3 years after the index procedure. Guidelines define "very late" recurrence as atrial arrhythmia occurring more than 1 year after ablation and recommend follow-up until 2 years. In our study, we addressed the issue of AF ablation outcomes at three or more years of follow-up. We utilized drug-free success data where available, and follow-up intensity was determined by individual study design.

A particular consideration in a study such as this one is that the studies were reports generated at highly experienced referral centers with considerable experience in the application of AF ablation. Ablation procedures were performed by experienced operators in selected AF patients. An interesting observation in our study was that the funnel plots of procedure outcomes in larger studies tended to have higher success rates, perhaps reflecting an experience effect. However, an alternative interpretation raised by these data is that of ascertainment bias, with the possibility that different results would be achieved for procedures undertaken in lower-volume, less-experienced clinical centers.

Single-procedure ablation success was achieved in approximately 50% of patients; however, there was significant heterogeneity in single-procedure outcomes in the included studies. With the inclusion of multiple procedures, about 80% of patients achieved long-term freedom from atrial arrhythmia.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) [^112vZLTr]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for atrial fibrillation, particularly surgical ablation, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering endoscopic or hybrid ablation procedures. These are suggested for patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) who are refractory to antiarrhythmic drug therapy and have experienced a failed percutaneous catheter ablation strategy. The goal is to prevent symptoms, recurrence, and progression of AF. This decision should be made within a shared decision-making rhythm control team that includes both electrophysiologists and surgeons.

### Commentary: The rising storm of atrioesophageal fistulae after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^115BQYfQ]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Low credibility.

Atrioesophageal fistula is a rare but highly lethal complication after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation that thoracic surgeons will increasingly be asked to manage. In this case report, Gibney and colleagues describe the successful management of an atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) that developed as a complication of previous percutaneous ablation for atrial fibrillation. This timely report addresses a rare but highly lethal clinical scenario that all thoracic surgeons will increasingly face in the future.

Catheter ablation has recently become a cornerstone of therapy for patients with paroxysmal and chronic atrial fibrillation. Recent large randomized trials, such as the CASTLE-AF and CABANA trials, demonstrate the benefits of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation and are expected to lead to an increased number of atrial fibrillation ablations performed worldwide.

As the authors have noted, because the development of AEF is a rare but highly lethal complication of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, early recognition of the complication and prompt surgical intervention is imperative. Literature reviews of all reported patients with AEF after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation indicate that fever and neurologic deficits are the most common presenting symptoms. The 2012 Heart Rhythm Society consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation has highlighted these two symptoms.

Other take-home messages:

- **Diagnostic modalities**: Chest and head CT scans seem to be the most useful and accurate for diagnosis.

### The efficacy and safety of left atrial low-voltage area guided ablation for recurrence prevention compared to pulmonary vein isolation alone in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation trial: Design and rationale [^116rFAdW]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The primary endpoint of the study will be the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) documented by scheduled or symptom-driven ECG tests during the one-year follow-up period after the index ablation procedure. "Recurrence of AF" is defined as the documentation of any atrial arrhythmia, including AF, atrial flutter (AFL), and/or atrial tachycardia (AT) lasting ≥ 30 seconds by 12-lead ECG or other appropriate tests. The endpoint will be determined by the endpoint committee, which will be composed independently of protocol developers, the data and safety monitoring board, clinical research funders, investigators, subcontractors, and collaborators.

- **Secondary endpoints**: Secondary endpoints will include death from any cause, symptomatic cerebrovascular stroke, bleeding events, recurrence of AF after repeat ablations, and any periprocedural adverse events. Bleeding events are defined as major bleeding according to the ISTH bleeding criteria and bleedings requiring hospitalization.

### Ablation of paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation in the very elderly real-world data on safety and efficacy [^11537KPe]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, we present data on AF ablation in elderly patients aged over 75 years. We found success rates comparable to those reported in the literature, with recurrence rates around 30% to 50% during follow-up and low overall complication rates. As a novel finding, cryoballoon ablation, as well as multielectrode phased-radiofrequency ablation, tended to be more effective and had similar complication rates compared to conventional RF ablation using 3D mapping systems. This did not reach statistical significance, mostly due to the low number of patients ablated with RF.

A trend toward better results of PVI with the cryoballoon in the elderly patient cohort has already been discussed in the literature. Heeger et al. reported data for 104 patients ablated with the second-generation cryoballoon, showing low recurrence rates of 20% after 1 year and 40% after 3 years of follow-up with a single ablation procedure in patients over 75 years. Additionally, Metzner et al. published data on 94 patients over 75 years ablated with RF. In a mean follow-up of 37 months, only 38% of patients remained in sinus rhythm with a single ablation procedure. With repeated ablation procedures, the number of patients in SR could be raised to 59%.

These two studies underline the high overall safety and the reasonable success rates, which we also observed in our data, as well as the difference in efficacy between the two energy forms in this patient collective. In our analysis, we found mid-term success rates of the multielectrode phased-radiofrequency ablation comparable to those achieved with other methods.

### Atrial fibrillation: A4 study: proof of concept [^111vZsNY]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The A4 and other similar small studies strongly support the launch of major trials of left atrial catheter ablation for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, reduction of cardiovascular hospitalizations, and improved survival in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Will pharmacological therapies continue to have an important place in the management of atrial fibrillation?

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1165kZWx]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy and peri-catheter ablation, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend performing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation with uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation. The recommended goal is an INR of 2.0–3.0 in patients on warfarin.

### Comparison of ablation outcomes of the second ablation procedure for recurrent atrial fibrillation using an ultra-high-resolution mapping system and conventional mappings system [^117USh7q]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Prior to the ablation procedure, we examined the electrical conduction between each pulmonary vein (PV) and the left atrium. If the conduction indicated reconnection, radiofrequency energy was applied at the estimated gap sites. An example map of a left atrium-PV conduction gap using an ultra-high-resolution electroanatomical mapping (UHR-EAM) system is presented in Figure 1A.

- **Propagation map showing a left atrium-left pulmonary vein conduction gap**: The gap is clearly visible at the posterior aspect of the initial circumferential pulmonary vein isolation line. A single radiofrequency application at the gap site immediately eliminated the left atrium-pulmonary vein conduction.
- **Propagation map showing a focal atrial tachycardia (AT) originating at the right atrial posterior wall**: A point ablation at the earliest activation site (white star) directly terminated the AT.
- **Propagation map showing a figure-of-eight macro-reentrant AT with a slow conduction isthmus at the left atrial septum**: A point radiofrequency application at the slow conduction isthmus resulted in direct tachycardia termination.
- **Propagation map showing a conduction gap following a posterior mitral isthmus linear ablation**: Point ablation at the gap achieved immediate bidirectional conduction block. White arrow indicates wave-front propagation, while the white zigzag line denotes the slow conduction zone.

After re-isolation of reconnected PVs, atrial burst pacing (cycle length 200–300).

### Impact of atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence on the development of long-term adverse clinical events following catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation with systolic impairment: A single-center observational study [^116mooaB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

We obtained data from all patients regarding clinical events. Figure 2A shows the comparison of the cumulative incidence of adverse clinical events following the first procedure between the nonrecurrence and ATA recurrence groups. The proportion of freedom from adverse clinical events was significantly lower in the ATA recurrence group than in the nonrecurrence group (41% [95% CI, 21–61] versus 95% [95% CI, 85–100], P < 0.0005). In total, 21 patients developed adverse clinical events at a median of 2.2 (range: 0.64–2.8) years following the initial procedure.

- **Adverse clinical events**: The adverse clinical events mainly comprised HFH (18/21 patients, 86%). All-cause death was noted in 3 patients (Patients 6, 17, and 18). No patient developed acute myocardial infarction during the follow-up period.

- **ATA and HF**: ATA was attributed to worsening HF in half of the patients with HFH (9/18 patients). Three patients developed HFH before ATA recurrence (Patients 4–6).

Figure 2B shows a comparison of the cumulative incidence of adverse clinical events following the last procedure between the nonrecurrence and ATA recurrence groups. The proportion of freedom from adverse clinical events was significantly lower in the ATA recurrence group than in the nonrecurrence group (35% [16–54] versus 57% [16–97], P < 0.0001). Patients who underwent a redo procedure developed adverse clinical events.

### Prediction of recurrence of atrial fibrillation after radiofrequency ablation by frailty [^117YHSUT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Although several studies have demonstrated a higher mortality and readmission rate in frail patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), there have been limited reports on the relationship between frailty and AF recurrence post-ablation. Previous studies have shown that frail patients with AF are associated with lower rates of management with a rhythm control strategy compared with non-frail patients with AF. Our study showed that frail patients with AF had approximately a sixfold risk of recurrence compared with the non-frail patients after catheter ablation.

Consistent with our findings, Rajdip et al. assessed patients who underwent cryoablation for AF using the electronic frailty index and found that patients with frailty had a significantly increased rate of arrhythmia recurrence after cryoablation. The 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of AF reported the worst clinical outcomes in patients who were older, multimorbid, or frail, and recommended AF-CARE as a management principle for all patients with AF (C-comorbidity and risk factor management, A-avoidance of stroke and thromboembolism, R-reducing symptoms with rate and rhythm control, E-evaluation and dynamic reassessment). The "C" in the AF-CARE principle refers to comorbidity and risk factor management.

The worst clinical outcomes of frail patients with AF may be attributed to multiple comorbidities and a worse substrate of the left atrium. However, the study conducted by Soejima et al. showed no significant difference in the success rate among patients in the frailty, prefrailty, and robust groups.

### Recurrence after atrial fibrillation ablation and investigational biomarkers of cardiac remodeling [^1172z7nU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

AF was classified as paroxysmal in 1008 participants (53.8%), persistent in 865 participants (46.2%), and long‐standing persistent in 57 participants (3.0%). Rhythm at the time of blood draw was sinus in 1410 participants (74.7%), AF in 423 participants (22.4%), and atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia in 54 participants (2.9%). Most participants underwent radiofrequency ablation, with 1478 participants (78.9%) choosing this option, while 395 participants (21.1%) underwent cryoablation. A total of 521 participants (27.8%) underwent additional ablation procedures, including linear roof ablation (18.4%) and posterior wall ablation (13.6%). Furthermore, 896 participants (47.8%) had cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for typical atrial flutter treatment or prevention, performed before or during the AF ablation. The median follow‐up duration was 3.9 years (interquartile range, 2.2–5.2 years). Notably, 187 patients (10.0%) had a follow‐up duration of less than 1 year.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, specifically in relation to atrioventricular nodal ablation and pacemaker placement, the 2024 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guidelines recommend considering conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left bundle area in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and normal ejection fraction undergoing atrioventricular node ablation.

### How to assess the impact of diagnosis-to-ablation time in patients with early-onset atrial fibrillation [^112WhAmj]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Zhou et al. have elucidated that a reduced diagnosis-to-ablation time correlates with diminished susceptibility to cardiovascular incidents and recurrence of atrial fibrillation among patients exhibiting early-onset atrial fibrillation. However, several pivotal concerns have been raised.

One significant query pertains to the rationale behind the authors' delineation of the threshold for early-onset atrial fibrillation at 45 years, as opposed to the commonly established 60 years. Previous literature has indicated the conjunction of early-onset atrial fibrillation with hypertension at the age of 40. This early-onset manifestation of atrial fibrillation might potentially intertwine with distinctive genetic disorders. Notably, the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation following catheter ablation stands at 40% over a span of 5 years, signifying a considerable rate warranting comprehensive interventions addressing associated comorbidities or underlying etiologies alongside atrial fibrillation ablation.

The protocol for managing recurrence of atrial fibrillation remains nebulous. While the authors evaluated not only atrial fibrillation recurrence but also mortality, readmission due to heart failure, and incidences of bleeding, the strategy for addressing recurrence of atrial fibrillation and its consequential impact on these outcomes necessitates elucidation.

Accurate diagnosis of coexisting heart failure in patients afflicted with atrial fibrillation poses a challenge due to their overlapping symptoms. Notably, 5% of subjects in the authors' study exhibited heart failure. Clarity regarding the appropriate management strategies for these patients is needed.

### Sex difference in atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs [^116wgq1w]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

The postablation management and follow-up involved scheduled visits to the outpatient clinic at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, with continued visits every 6 months thereafter or whenever symptoms occurred after the atrial fibrillation catheter ablation (AFCA). According to the guidelines, a rhythm follow-up was conducted using ECGs and 24-hour Holter monitoring at designated intervals: 3, 6, and 12 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter. During Holter recordings, we identified the symptoms of premature atrial contractions (PAC) and atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes, as well as the percentage of PACs. Additionally, ECG was recommended whenever patients experienced palpitations. Clinical recurrence was diagnosed when an AF recurrence lasting over 30 seconds occurred following a 3-month blanking period.

- **Management of atrial fibrillation recurrence**: We initially prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for rhythm control in patients experiencing AF recurrence. If sinus rhythm was not restored, electrical cardioversion was performed. Upon restoration of sinus rhythm, patients using AADs underwent ECG recordings at every visit, along with regular 24-hour Holter monitoring in the outpatient clinic. The definitions of AF recurrence after AAD use and after AFCA were identical. Repeat ablation was recommended if atrial arrhythmia persisted during AAD treatment or recurred after sinus rhythm conversion with AADs. The management and follow-up schedule post-repeat ablation were the same as those following the de novo procedure.

### Patterns of postablation recurrence and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111nYzww]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) status may influence clinical outcomes. Guidelines recommend continuing long-term OAC therapy after atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation based on stroke risk. However, data from a Denmark nationwide cohort showed that thromboembolism incidence was low in patients both with and without OAC therapy. Similarly, a previous study from our cohort demonstrated that discontinuing OAC therapy after ablation could be safe for select patients, specifically those without AF recurrence, a history of thromboembolism or transient ischemic attack, and diabetes, regarding thromboembolic and major bleeding risks. Aligned with these findings, our centers adopted a strategy of discontinuing OAC therapy 3 months after ablation under specific conditions. In this study, the overall anticoagulation rate at 12 months following ablation was 16.9%, with a low thromboembolism incidence rate observed in both on-OAC and off-OAC groups. Notably, the risk of adverse outcomes remained the highest in the PersAF recurrence group, although the on-OAC rate was highest in the PersAF recurrence group. These observations further emphasize the importance of considering AF progression as a meaningful outcome measure in clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of ablation strategies.

It has been established that attaining sinus rhythm at 12 months mediates the improved cardiovascular outcomes with early rhythm control. The CABANA substudy provided further evidence that maintaining sinus rhythm after ablation was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary outcome during a median follow-up of 57.0 months.

### Correlates of arrhythmia recurrence after hybrid epi- and endocardial radiofrequency ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation [^1128hLEJ]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

The long-term efficacy of catheter-based treatment for persistent atrial fibrillation is unsatisfactory. Minimally invasive surgical ablation techniques have been developed recently, but their efficacy has never been systematically tested.

- **Methods and results**: Seventy patients (median age, 63.5 years) with persistent atrial fibrillation underwent epicardial thoracoscopic radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation, linear ablation, Marshall ligament disruption, and exclusion of the left atrial appendage. The procedure was followed by electroanatomic mapping and ablation (EAM) 2 to 3 months later. Only 76% of patients were in normal sinus rhythm at the beginning of EAM. All four pulmonary veins and the left atrium posterior wall were found isolated in 69% and 23% of patients, respectively. Arrhythmia-free survival off antiarrhythmic drugs 12 months after EAM was 77%. Using previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs and reablation procedures, arrhythmia-free survival increased to 97% during follow-up (mean, 936 ± 432 days; range, 346–1509 days). The majority of arrhythmia recurrences occurred during the first 12 months after EAM. In a multivariable-adjusted estimates, left atrium volume > 165 mL, absent normal sinus rhythm at admission for EAM, and inducibility of any sustained tachyarrhythmia at the end of EAM procedure were identified as independent correlates of atrial fibrillation recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: Our report demonstrated that the majority of patients, after epicardial ablation using bipolar radiofrequency instruments, required endocardial catheter ablation to complete the procedure successfully.

### Medical management of atrial fibrillation: State of the art [^11736o7w]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Predominantly a disease of advancing age, atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Its prevalence is rising as the proportion of elderly people in the population continues its inexorable rise. Without more effective therapeutic interventions, AF-related cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality will also continue to rise. Antiarrhythmic drugs are an essential tool in the management of AF and may be used as premedication before cardioversion, together with cardioversion to help or assist cardioversion, or given afterward to prevent recurrence. If AF recurs after one or two cardioversions, it is usual to adopt a rate control strategy; highly symptomatic patients who fail cardioversion may benefit from ablation therapy.

We are already on the threshold of a large expansion in the use of ablation therapy, a strategy that has the potential to deliver dramatic improvements in outcome. Not only can AF be cured by ablative therapy, but there is also evidence that it confers functional improvement as well. It will not, however, be appropriate for all AF patients, and pharmacological therapies will continue to have an important place in the management of AF. The plethora of antiarrhythmic drugs currently available for the treatment of AF is a reflection that none is wholly satisfactory, each having limited efficacy combined with poor safety and tolerability. Improved class III antiarrhythmic agents, such as dronedarone, new classes of antiarrhythmic agents, such as atrial repolarization delaying agents, and upstream therapies dealing with subs.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with recurrent persistent atrial fibrillation [^115izmTN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of sinus rhythm. We hypothesized that ventricular rate control is not inferior to the maintenance of sinus rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation following a previous electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs. The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.

- **Results**: After a mean (± SD) of 2.3 ± 0.6 years, 39 percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group had sinus rhythm, as compared with 10 percent of the 256 patients in the rate-control group. The primary end point occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the rate-control group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the rhythm-control group. The 90 percent (two-sided) upper boundary of the absolute difference in the primary end point was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 10 percent or less). The distribution of the various components of the primary end point was similar in the rate-control group.

Regarding surgical interventions for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to surgical ablation, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend continuing oral anticoagulation in patients with AF who are at elevated thromboembolic risk after concomitant, endoscopic, or hybrid AF ablation. This is suggested irrespective of rhythm outcome or left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion to prevent ischemic stroke and thromboembolism.

### Meta-analysis of cryoballoon ablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs as initial therapy for symptomatic atrial fibrillation [^114JLGeK]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is among the most common arrhythmias, occurring in approximately 1%–2% of the total population. It recurs in 90% of treated AF patients without preventive therapy. The guidelines recommend the use of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as initial therapy for rhythm control in patients with symptomatic AF. However, AADs have substantial side effects and limited efficacy.

Compared with AAD, isolating pulmonary veins through catheter ablation (CA) is superior in maintaining sinus rhythm, preventing AF recurrence, and enhancing the quality of life in patients who have failed drugs. Thus, CA has become a recognized strategy for long-term rhythm control in this population. In the Early Treatment of AF for Stroke Prevention (EAST-AFNET 4) trial, cardiovascular outcomes were better with early rhythm control through CA than with conventional treatment. Ablation for rhythm control may also slow disease progression to persistent AF, which is harder to manage. Similarly, recent studies have shown that CA intervention prior to pharmacotherapeutic failure is beneficial due to a shorter interval between diagnosis and ablation, resulting in lower incidences of re-arrhythmia, hospitalizations, and repeat procedures.

The two most frequently used ablation techniques, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoballoon ablation (CBA), differ in their application methods and energy sources. RFA applies radiofrequency currents in a point-by-point mode, whereas CBA uses low-temperature energy on the balloon in a one-step mode, causing cellular necrosis.

### Atrial tachycardias following persistent atrial fibrillation ablation: Predictors of recurrence after the repeat ablation [^115k6mpF]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Repeat procedures after persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation are frequently performed for secondary atrial tachycardias (AT). Predictors of AT recurrence after the first repeat ablation have not yet been studied.

- **Methods**: We investigated predictors of AT recurrence in 117 patients who underwent ablation for secondary AT arising following a previous ablation for persistent AF using the Cox proportional hazards model.

- **Results**: Acute ablation success rate was 94%. Over a follow-up period of 12 months, 61 patients (53%) were free from AT recurrence. Of the assessed predictors of AT recurrence, the number of ablated AT forms (> 1 vs. 1) was significantly associated with AT recurrence (hazard ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.18–3.43, P = 0.01). Other variables including left atrial diameter, AT mechanism, or the characteristics of previous AF ablation did not have a significant influence on AT recurrence (P > 0.05). Men had a tendency toward fewer AT recurrences than women (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34–1.05, P = 0.07). During a second AT ablation procedure, 19 (49%) patients were identified to have a recurrence of the previously ablated AT, whereas in 20 patients (51%) a new AT form was diagnosed.

- **Conclusion**: Ablation of atrial tachycardias following persistent AF ablation has a high acute success rate. However, a substantial number of patients develop new onset AT during follow-up. The occurrence of multiple AT forms during the repeat ablation procedure was the only predictive factor for AT recurrence.

### Five-year outcome of catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation using termination of atrial fibrillation as a procedural endpoint [^112aWvyv]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine the 5-year efficacy of catheter ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) using AF termination as a procedural endpoint.

- **Methods and results**: One hundred fifty patients (57 ± 10 years) underwent persistent AF ablation using a stepwise ablation approach, which included pulmonary vein isolation, electrogram-guided, and linear ablation, with the desired procedural endpoint being AF termination. Repeat ablation was performed for recurrent AF or atrial tachycardia. AF was terminated by ablation in 120 patients (80%).

	- Arrhythmia-free survival rates following a single procedure were 35.3% ± 3.9%, 28.0% ± 3.7%, and 16.8% ± 3.2% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Arrhythmia-free survival rates after the last procedure (mean 2.1 ± 1.0 procedures) were 89.7% ± 2.5%, 79.8% ± 3.4%, and 62.9% ± 4.5% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. During a median follow-up of 58 (interquartile range, 43–73) months after the last ablation procedure, 97 of 150 (64.7%) patients remained in sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic drugs. Another 14 (9.3%) patients maintained sinus rhythm after reinitiation of antiarrhythmic drugs, and an additional 15 (10.0%) patients regressed to paroxysmal recurrences only.

	- Failure to terminate AF during the index procedure (hazard ratio 3.831; 95% confidence interval, 2.070–7.143; P < 0.001), left atrial diameter ≥ 50 mm (hazard ratio 2.083; 95% confidence interval, 1.078–4.016; P = 0.03), continuous AF duration ≥ 18 months (hazard ratio 1.984; 95% confidence interval, 1.024–3.846; P < 0.04), and structural heart disease (hazard ratio 1.874; 95% confidence interval, 1

### Recurrence after "long-term success" in catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^116UKCiV]. Heart Rhythm (2015). High credibility.

The latest guidelines define "long-term success" as freedom from atrial arrhythmia recurrence more than 36 months after procedures without any antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes and procedural findings in patients with recurrence beyond the defined "long-term success".

- **Methods**: Among patients who underwent pulmonary vein (PV) antrum isolation for drug-refractory symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), 37 patients who experienced arrhythmias during annual follow-up after "long-term success" and who underwent repeat procedures for these arrhythmias were included in the study.

- **Results**: The time from the latest procedure to recurrence was a median of 61 months ([25th, 75th percentiles]: [51–77.5]). The type of arrhythmia was paroxysmal in 22 patients (59.5%) and persistent in 15 (40.5%). Atrial tachycardia (AT) was observed in 13 patients (35.1%), including 8 with AT unrelated to PVs. Repeat procedures were performed a median of 2.0 months ([1.0–4.0]) after identifying the episodes. Recovered PV conduction was found in 29 patients (78.4%) and non-PV foci in 4 (10.8%). Freedom from recurrence one year after repeat procedures was 63.3%. Seven patients (18.9%) underwent further repeat procedures a median of 7.0 months ([2.0–28.0]) after repeat procedures without PV reconnections. In total, AF/AT unrelated to PVs was present in 24 patients (64.9%), whereas, arrhythmias related to PVs were observed in 2 patients (5.4%) during a total of 46 repeat procedures.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning atrioventricular nodal ablation and pacemaker placement, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend setting the initial pacemaker lower rate programming at 80–90 bpm. This is to reduce the risk of sudden death in patients with atrial fibrillation and a persistently rapid ventricular response undergoing atrioventricular node ablation.

### Effect of recurrence in the blanking period after thoracoscopic atrial fibrillation ablation on long-term recurrence [^113Nog2T]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, significantly contributing to cardiovascular events and increasing the risk of all-cause mortality. Effective rhythm control is crucial for managing AF. Catheter ablation of the pulmonary veins is widely recommended as a primary treatment for both paroxysmal and persistent AF, regardless of the associated risk factors for AF recurrence. Additionally, thoracoscopic surgical ablation is an alternative option. The guidelines recommend that thoracoscopic surgical ablation should be considered for patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF who do not respond to antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD), have failed transcatheter ablation, or present with evident risk factors for transcatheter ablation failure.

However, it is important to recognize that neither catheter ablation nor thoracoscopic surgical ablation serves as a definitive cure, as a substantial proportion of patients experience short- or long-term recurrence of AF following these procedures. Recurrence remains a critical metric for evaluating the overall success of ablation.

Previous studies have shown that AF recurrence within three months after catheter ablation, termed the "blanking period", does not necessarily predict long-term recurrence. This consensus is similarly applied to thoracoscopic surgical ablation. Recent studies on catheter ablation have shown that the occurrence of AF during this blanking period is a predictor of long-term outcomes. This finding suggests that the duration of the blanking period following AF ablation could inform long-term prognosis.

### Cause of very late recurrence of atrial fibrillation or flutter after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^11126xsF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The major mechanism underlying the early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after ablation is primarily the reconnection of the isolated pulmonary vein (PV); however, the mechanism responsible for very late recurrence (VLR) has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanism underlying VLR. The study population included 150 consecutive patients with AF who underwent a second session of catheter ablation due to recurrence. We divided them into two groups according to the point of initial AF recurrence: the late recurrence group (LR group, initial recurrence 3 to 12 months after ablation, n = 124) and the VLR group (initial recurrence > 12 months after ablation, n = 26). We identified PVs with ectopic foci (trigger PVs) in the first procedure and checked their electrical reconnection in the second procedure. The prevalence of PV reconnection and trigger PV reconnection were significantly lower in the VLR group than in the LR group (LR vs. VLR, 90% vs. 69% and 48% vs. 27%, p = 0.007 and p = 0.045, respectively). In the VLR group, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function were significantly worse than in the LR group, and more patients in the VLR group required non-PV trigger ablation in the second session than those in the LR group (30% vs. 54%, p = 0.034). In conclusion, electrical PV reconnection contributed less to VLR than to LR. Progression of the AF substrate might be an important mechanism responsible for VLR.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to atrioventricular nodal ablation, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering atrioventricular node ablation combined with CRT in severely symptomatic patients with permanent AF and at least one hospitalization for HF. This approach aims to reduce symptoms, physical limitations, re-hospitalization due to HF, and mortality.

### Clinical outcome of very late recurrence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^115hxjfz]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

A high recurrence rate remains a significant challenge associated with the ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), with most recurrences occurring within six months post-ablation. However, the characteristics of very late recurrence of AF (reAF) occurring more than 12 months after ablation have not been thoroughly documented.

- **Methods and results**: Two hundred seven patients with drug-refractory AF successfully underwent focal ablation or isolation of AF foci. Symptomatic reAF was evaluated using Holter monitoring and event recorders following the initial ablation procedure. A second ablation was recommended if antiarrhythmic drugs failed to control reAF. During a long-term follow-up (mean 30 ± 11 months, up to 51 months), 70 patients experienced reAF. This included 13 patients (6%) with very late (> 12 months) reAF (group 1) and 57 patients (28%) with late (within 12 months) reAF (group 2). Group 1 patients had a significantly lower incidence of multiple (≥ 2) AF foci (23% vs. 63%, P = 0.02) compared to group 2. Additionally, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm after the first episode of reAF was notably lower in group 1 than group 2 (38% vs. 84%, P = 0.001). The incidence of a second intervention procedure also tended to be lower in group 1 compared to group 2 (8% vs. 35%, P = 0.051).

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of very late reAF after ablation of paroxysmal AF is minimal, and the clinical outcome for patients experiencing very late reAF appears benign.

### Effect of electrical cardioversion on 1-year outcomes in patients with early recurrence after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^1162ijLt]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

In this large contemporary cohort of Chinese patients with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), we found that electrical cardioversion (ECV) was associated with a lower recurrence rate during the one‐year follow‐up in patients with early recurrence of AF (reAF) after catheter ablation. We observed no relationship between ECV and rehospitalization or cardiovascular rehospitalization at one year, even in the subgroup analysis.

Previous studies reported that early recurrence rates of AF after catheter ablation varied between 16% and 65% and might be related to transient inflammatory reactions resulting from ablation lesions or pericarditis. Other possible mechanisms include a transient imbalance of the autonomic nervous system, which acts as an arrhythmia trigger, and a reconnection of the pulmonary veins (PVs). AF causes electrical and structural changes driving the atrial remodeling process. The proinflammatory phase following ablation also favors the maintenance of AF. When AF persists, its progression is facilitated, leading to fibrosis and enlargement of the left atrium. The reduction of AF burden could initiate a long‐term process of reverse remodeling.

Some studies supporting rapid functional and structural remodeling during AF encourage clinicians to administer cardioversion early in patients with recurrence after AF ablation. Therefore, we believe that the maintenance of sinus rhythm during the "blanking period" after ablation is beneficial for improving long‐term outcomes. In clinical practice, we usually administer antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) and ECV to restore sinus rhythm in these patients. Patients who experience early recurrence of AF are more likely to have persistent…

### Optimal substrate modification strategies using catheter ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation: 3-year follow-up outcomes [^113NLgkr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

For patients whose persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) failed to terminate after initial pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), subsequent substrate modifications targeting the ablation of rotors/drivers, assisted by spatiotemporal integration (SI) and phase mapping, led to a reduced risk of AF recurrence compared to adjuvant linear or complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) ablation during long-term follow-up. Patients with persistent AF and an enlarged atrium greater than 40 mm may experience a lower risk of AF recurrence by employing the rotor/driver ablation strategy rather than an adjuvant linear or CFAE ablation strategy.

### 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^115swVU3]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Recurrences of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial tachycardia (AT) after initial AF ablation procedures lead to repeat ablation in a considerable number of patients. Recent data indicate a repeat procedure rate of 15% to 50%, depending on the duration of follow-up and patient characteristics. Since early recurrences of AF or the development of AT are common during the first 2–3 months after AF ablation and may resolve spontaneously, repeat ablation procedures should be deferred for at least 3 months following the initial procedure if possible. Nevertheless, such early recurrences are associated with decreased long-term success of the procedure.

It is also recognized that some patients will experience highly symptomatic early recurrence of atrial arrhythmias that cannot be controlled with antiarrhythmic therapy or rate-controlling medications and are best managed with a reablation procedure within the first 3 months post-AF ablation. Most studies report that patients who do not achieve success with the initial ablation and undergo a repeat procedure demonstrate resumption of electrical conduction of the previously isolated pulmonary veins (PVs), rather than new arrhythmogenic foci from non-targeted PVs or areas outside the PVs. This outcome is predominantly the case for the first reablation procedure. In further redo procedures (e.g. second or third redo), other mechanisms also appear to play a more significant role.

Consequently, the first step in performing a second AF ablation procedure is to check each PV for reconduction of electrical activity.

### Recurrence after atrial fibrillation ablation and investigational biomarkers of cardiac remodeling [^113k8aiC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Five hundred eighty-one participants (31.0%) showed evidence of arrhythmia recurrence within 3 to 12 months after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Among these participants, AF recurrence was most common, observed in 460 participants (79.2%), followed by atrial flutter in 113 participants (19.4%), and atrial tachycardia in 52 participants (8.9%). Of those who experienced recurrence, 84 participants (14.5%) required at least one electrical cardioversion, and 143 participants (24.6%) underwent a second ablation procedure for AF and/or atypical atrial flutter within 12 months of the initial ablation.

Univariate logistic regression analysis indicated associations between arrhythmia recurrence and various factors:

- **Age at ablation**: (OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.03], P < 0.001).
- **Female sex**: (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.23–1.84], P < 0.001).
- **Height**: (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.98–0.996], P = 0.004).
- **Persistent and long-standing persistent AF**: (OR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.33–1.97]; P < 0.001 and OR, 2.21 [95% CI, 1.30–3.74]; P = 0.003, respectively).
- **Presence of a continuous monitor**: (OR, 4.0 [95% CI, 3.2–5.1]; P < 0.001).
- **Left atrial (LA) diameter**: (OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.009–1.04]; P = 0.001).
- **Estimated glomerular filtration rate**: (OR, 0.99 [0.986–0.996]; P < 0.001).
- **Atrial arrhythmia as the baseline rhythm at the start of the ablation**: (OR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.34–2.06], P < 0.001).
- **APPLE score**: (OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.18–1.39], P < 0.001).

Results of the univariate logistic regression are detailed in Table 3.

### The 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society comprehensive guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation [^111wd9na]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for atrial fibrillation, and specifically concerning surgical ablation, the CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend considering surgical AF ablation in conjunction with a planned cardiac surgical procedure, such as mitral valve, aortic valve, or coronary artery bypass surgery. This is advised for patients with symptomatic nonpermanent AF when the likelihood of success is high, the additional risk is low, and sinus rhythm is expected to achieve substantial symptomatic benefit.

### Five-year change in the renal function after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^116EnrhR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The detailed technique and strategy for the repeat ablation procedures were presented in a previous study. If there were reconnections of PV potentials or a previous linear ablation, we completed the circumferential pulmonary vein isolation and accomplished bidirectional block of the circumferential pulmonary vein isolation, cavotricuspid isthmus, or linear ablation as much as possible. Then, we provoked extra-PV foci with an isoproterenol infusion (5–10 μg/min) and carefully mapped and ablated mappable AF triggers or frequent atrial premature beats. If there were multiple extra-PV triggers, we conducted an additional linear ablation or an electrogram-guided ablation at the operators' discretion.

- **Postablation management and follow-up**: Patients visited the outpatient clinic at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and every 6 months thereafter or whenever symptoms developed after the AFCA. ECG was performed at every visit. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months after the AFCA according to the 2012 Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society expert consensus statement guidelines. Patients underwent an annual laboratory examination (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, urine hemoglobin, and dipstick urine protein). eGFR was estimated by the CKD-EPI equation. Patients who suffered from symptoms of palpitations underwent Holter/event-monitor examinations to investigate the possibility of an arrhythmia recurrence. We defined an AF recurrence as any episode of atrial tachycardia.

### Catheter ablation as first-line therapy for atrial fibrillation [^115HWx2x]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The treatment for atrial fibrillation has evolved significantly over time. Previously, medication management was the mainstay of treatment. As we have developed more robust technologies and modalities for catheter ablation, these treatment recommendations have changed. Catheter ablation is a safe and effective strategy for treating atrial fibrillation that is now considered first-line therapy in some patient populations.

This review discusses historical perspectives regarding the treatment and management of atrial fibrillation. We review the literature on studies investigating catheter ablation as first-line therapy, including the impact of catheter ablation on arrhythmia recurrence, cardiovascular outcomes, and healthcare utilization. Finally, we discuss future directions for the management of atrial fibrillation as the technology for catheter ablation continues to grow and progress.

### 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APSHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^116PWyji]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Explanations for the gap between prior expert consensus recommendations and routine clinical practice might reflect the disconnect between indications for catheter ablation and clinical outcomes of the procedure. Another factor can be cost. The main indication for catheter ablation is symptomatic AF, and decisions regarding continuation of anticoagulation therapy should be based on the patient's risk factors for stroke and not on the presence or type of AF. Transtelephonic or long-term monitoring is sometimes recommended after ablation to capture asymptomatic episodes of AF, evaluating the need to continue anticoagulation. The majority of writing group members do not believe that data currently exists to support this common practice of making decisions regarding anticoagulation based on the presence or absence of AF (see Section 7).

A significant amount of information has accumulated showing that cardiac risk factors such as obesity, sleep apnea, and hypertension are associated with structural and electrical remodeling of the atria, which forms the substrate leading to AF development and progression (see Section 3). The recommended indefinite annual follow-up visits with a healthcare professional allow for the evaluation and treatment of associated diseases and lifestyle modification rather than monitoring of the rhythm itself.

- **Early recurrence after ablation**: Early recurrences of AF after AF ablation have been defined as any recurrence of AF lasting more than 30 seconds during the first three months of follow-up.

### Repeat catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^1134ToQg]. Heart Rhythm (2024). High credibility.

Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is an established therapy that reduces AF burden, improves quality of life, and reduces the risks of cardiovascular outcomes. Although there are clear guidelines for the application of de novo catheter ablation, there is less evidence to guide recommendations for repeat catheter ablation in patients who experience recurrent AF. In this review, we examine the rationale for repeat ablation, mechanisms of recurrence, patient selection, optimal timing, and procedural strategies.

- **Mechanisms of recurrence**: Mechanisms of recurrent AF are often due to non-pulmonary vein (non-PV) triggers; however, there is insufficient evidence supporting the routine use of empiric lesion sets during repeat ablation.

- **Emerging techniques**: The emergence of pulsed field ablation may alter the safety and effectiveness of de novo and repeat ablation.

- **Data requirements**: Extrapolation of data from randomized trials of de novo ablation does not optimally inform efficacy in cases of redo ablation.

Additional important considerations include treatment of comorbidities and risk factors, risk of complications, and effectiveness. Additional large, randomized controlled trials are needed to address important clinical questions regarding procedural strategies and timing of repeat ablation.

### Approach and strategy for repeat catheter ablation of recurrent atrial fibrillation [^114nsNHE]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation often undergo repeat catheter ablation due to the recurrence of tachyarrhythmia. If the pulmonary veins were isolated in a prior procedure, the operator should focus on substrate homogenization, identifying and ablating only the arrhythmogenic areas.

### Sinus rhythm restoration and arrhythmia noninducibility are major predictors of arrhythmia-free outcome after ablation for long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation: a prospective study [^113UY854]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

The impact of restoring sinus rhythm (SR) by initial ablation in patients with long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (LSPAF) is not fully established.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of SR restoration at the initial procedure and arrhythmia noninducibility at the final repeat procedure for long-term outcome.

- **Methods**: A total of 203 patients (22% female; age 59 ± 9 years) underwent stepwise catheter ablation for LSPAF.

- **Results**: The procedural endpoint of SR restoration was achieved in 50% of patients. During follow-up (median 48 months) and after 1.7 procedures per patient, 72% of patients were free from arrhythmia off antiarrhythmic drugs. Failure to restore SR was independently predicted by left atrial (LA) long-axis diameter ≥ 68 mm (relative risk [RR] 1.55, P = 0.03), proportion of high-voltage LA sites < 20% (RR 1.62, P = 0.02), and left atrial appendage (LAA) atrial fibrillation cycle length (AFCL) < 155 ms (RR 1.5, P = 0.05). Arrhythmia recurrence after the initial procedure was predicted by SR nonrestoration (RR 2.99, P < .000001) and LAA AFCL ≥ 155 ms (RR 1.90, P = 0.0002). Arrhythmia recurrence after the final procedure was predicted by SR nonrestoration at the initial procedure (RR 2.83, P = 0.0007), persistent AF duration ≥ 24 months (RR 2.74, P = 0.002), LAA outflow velocity < 40 cm/s (RR 2.21, P = 0.006), and LAA AFCL ≥ 155 ms (RR 1.92, P = 0.02). In 115 patients with repeat procedure(s), failure to achieve arrhythmia noninducibility at the final procedure (19% of patients) was associated with arrhythmia recurrence.

### Antiarrhythmics after ablation of atrial fibrillation (5A study): Six-month follow-up study [^114Fs3ZT]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

We previously demonstrated that treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) during the first six weeks after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation reduces the incidence of clinically significant atrial arrhythmias and the need for cardioversion or hospitalization for arrhythmia management. Whether early rhythm suppression decreases longer-term arrhythmia recurrence is unknown. We now report the six-month follow-up data from this study.

- **Methods and results**: The Antiarrhythmics After Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation study prospectively randomized patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing ablation to either receive (AAD group) or not receive (no-AAD group) AAD treatment for the first six weeks after ablation; all patients received atrioventricular nodal blockers. Physicians were encouraged to stop the AADs after the six-week treatment period. All patients underwent four weeks of transtelephonic monitoring to document asymptomatic AF and an evaluation at six weeks and six months. A total of 110 patients (71% men) aged 55 ± 9 years were randomized, with 53 to AAD and 57 to no AAD. At six months, there was no difference in freedom from AF between the early AAD and no-AAD groups (38/53 [72%] versus 39/57 [68%]; P = 0.84). Lack of early AF recurrence during the initial six-week period was the only independent predictor of six-month freedom from AF (64/76 [84%] without early recurrence versus 13/34 [38%] with early recurrence; P = 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: Although short-term use of AADs after AF ablation decreases early recurrence of atrial arrhythmias, early use of AADs does not prevent arrhythmia recurrence.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114YuL7V]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning rhythm control and pharmacological cardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the "pill-in-the-pocket" approach. This involves administering a single oral dose of flecainide or propafenone, along with a concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking agent, for pharmacological cardioversion. This approach should be considered if it has been previously tested in a monitored setting in patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation occurring outside the hospital.

### 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^116M1B21]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Several other approaches have recently been developed to identify rotational activity as a potential target for ablation. One of these systems involves the use of high-density multipolar recordings with nonlinear analysis of the similarity index and phase mapping of rotational activity. This approach has resulted in improved ablation outcomes for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).

Another system developed to noninvasively map rotational activity is the ECGI mapping system. This system utilizes a multielectrode vest that records 224 body surface ECGs. Electrical potentials, electrograms, and isochrones are then reconstructed on the heart's surface using geometrical information from computed tomography (CT). A mathematical algorithm combines the body surface potentials recorded by the electrodes and the geometric information provided by CT, solving the electrocardiographic inverse problem to noninvasively obtain estimated epicardial electrograms. An advantage of this approach is its noninvasiveness, allowing for detailed follow-up information on AF recurrence.

However, the system is limited to providing virtual electrograms of the atrial epicardium; activity on the interatrial septum, the PV-LAA ridge, etc. is not recorded. Another limitation involves the workflow since CT imaging is required to obtain the torso geometry. Additionally, the system assumes that the torso has uniform electrical properties, despite the fact that thoracic tissue conducts electricity nonuniformly.

### Incidence and predictors of very late recurrence of atrial fibrillation after ablation [^115DAyM6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation can effectively treat patients with refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). Very late AF recurrence, defined as occurring 12 months or more post-ablation, is uncommon and may represent a unique patient cohort.

- **Methods and results**: A nested case-control study was performed in the cohort who underwent AF ablation at the University of Pennsylvania to characterize patients who develop very late AF recurrence after ablation. The procedure consisted of the isolation of pulmonary veins (PVs) that demonstrated triggers and the elimination of non-PV triggers initiating AF. Twenty-seven (7.9%) patients with very late recurrence were compared to 219 patients without recurrence and 12 or more months of follow-up. The mean age was 54.6 ± 11.3 years, with 79% being men. Very late recurrence patients were more likely to weigh over 200 lbs (70% vs. 55%, P = 0.01), had fewer PVs isolated during initial ablation (2.8 ± 1.1 vs. 3.3 ± 1.0, P = 0.03), were less likely to have right inferior PV isolation (37% vs. 61%, P = 0.02), less likely to have isolation of all PVs (30% vs. 56%, P = 0.01), and more likely to have non-PV triggers (30% vs. 11%, OR 3.4 [95% CI, 1.3–8.7], P = 0.01). PV reconnectivity and new triggers were found in the majority of patients with very late recurrence of AF who underwent repeat ablation.

- **Conclusion**: Very late recurrence of AF was more likely in patients weighing over 200 lbs, demonstrating non-PV triggers, and not undergoing right inferior PV isolation. The majority of patients undergoing repeat ablation for very late recurrence demonstrated PV reconnectivity and new non-PV triggers.

### Improvement in quality of life after catheter ablation for paroxysmal versus long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation: A prospective study with 3-year follow-up [^113X4Wek]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Freedom from AF/AT recurrence was achieved in 51% versus 29% of patients (P = 0.002) following the initial ablation and in 68% versus 68% of patients (P = 0.99) after the last (single or repeat) ablation for PAF versus LSPAF groups, respectively. Among patients with arrhythmia recurrences, paroxysmal AF/AT prevailed in those with baseline PAF versus LSPAF (81% versus 19%, P < 0.05) three months after any repeat ablation in 75% versus 62% (P = 0.008), 88% versus 87% (P = 0.82), and 93% versus 95% (P = 0.41) of patients at follow‐up years 1, 2, and 3 for PAF versus LSPAF patients, respectively.

At the end of follow‐up, good arrhythmia control was present in 224 (86%) and 110 (87%) patients with PAF versus LSPAF (P = 0.69), and 69% versus 69% were off AADs (P = 0.99). Use of Class I and III AADs and warfarin was significantly reduced in both groups.

Five (1.3%) patients (3 PAF, 2 LSPAF) died more than 25 months after the initial ablation.

### Progression of atrial fibrillation after cryoablation or drug therapy [^114qAMhN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a chronic, progressive disorder, and persistent forms of atrial fibrillation are associated with increased risks of thromboembolism and heart failure. Catheter ablation as initial therapy may modify the pathogenic mechanism of atrial fibrillation and alter progression to persistent atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: We report the 3-year follow-up of patients with paroxysmal, untreated atrial fibrillation who were enrolled in a trial in which they had been randomly assigned to undergo initial rhythm-control therapy with cryoballoon ablation or to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy. All the patients had implantable loop recorders placed at the time of trial entry, and evaluation was conducted by means of downloaded daily recordings and in-person visits every six months. Data regarding the first episode of persistent atrial fibrillation (lasting ≥ 7 days or lasting 48 hours to 7 days but requiring cardioversion for termination), reatrial tachyarrhythmia (defined as atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia lasting ≥ 30 seconds), the burden of atrial fibrillation (percentage of time in atrial fibrillation), quality-of-life metrics, health care utilization, and safety were collected.

- **Results**: A total of 303 patients were enrolled, with 154 patients assigned to undergo initial rhythm-control therapy with cryoballoon ablation and 149 assigned to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Over 36 months of follow-up, 3 patients (1.9%) in the ablation group had an episode of persistent atrial fibrillation, as compared with 11 patients (7.4%) in the antiarrhythmic drug group.

### Safety and efficacy of cryoablation for atrial fibrillation in young patients: A multicenter experience in the 1STOP project [^116FFsBR]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in young patients presents significant challenges. Understanding the longer-term effects of AF in this demographic is crucial, as they will live with the disease ramifications for many decades. Guidelines identify young symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF and no structural heart disease as ideal candidates for catheter ablation. Previous studies have shown better outcomes in younger patients compared to older ones. In young patients, pulmonary vein isolation often leads to the elimination of AF triggers before the development of atrial electrical and structural remodeling, which can lead to new atrial triggers and disease progression.

Surprisingly, our analysis revealed that younger patients did not experience better outcomes compared to the general AF population, with a recurrence rate of almost 10% per year of follow-up. Consequently, the history of patients who develop AF early will likely involve several catheter ablations in an attempt to control a multifactorial AF arrhythmia throughout the disease's course.

### Natural history of arrhythmia after successful isolation of pulmonary veins, left atrial posterior wall, and superior vena cava in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: A multi-center experience [^113mCSbw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The ablation strategy of the repeat procedure was heterogeneous, following the performing operators' preferences. In cases of pulmonary veins (PV), posterior wall (PW), and superior vena cava (SVC) reconnection, these structures were re-isolated. Additional ablation was carried out according to two main strategies:

- **Strategy one**: Further ablation of non-PV triggers, including ablation of significant triggers observed during the procedure. If neither PV, PW, and SVC reconnections nor additional non-PV triggers were detected, empirical isolation of the left atrial appendage (LAA) and coronary sinus (CS) was performed. A high-dose isoproterenol challenge (up to 30 µg/min) was used to disclose non-PV triggers, which were then targeted using additional radio frequency energy.

- **Strategy two**: Targeted ablation of any presenting atrial tachycardia, or empirical left-sided ablation lines (roof, mitral isthmus) if the patient was in sinus rhythm.

Significant non-PV triggers were defined as focal atrial tachycardia (AT; sustained or non-sustained), frequent premature atrial contractions (≥ 10/min), or premature atrial contractions triggering atrial fibrillation/flutter. The procedural endpoint was their elimination, including targeted ablation of non-CS/LAA triggers, with CS or LAA isolates if triggers originated from these structures. The endpoint for CS and LAA isolation was electrical silence, confirmed by entrance block.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy peri-catheter ablation, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend continuing oral anticoagulation for at least two months after AF ablation in all patients, irrespective of rhythm outcome or CHA₂DS₂-VA score, to reduce the risk of periprocedural ischemic stroke and thromboembolism.

### Long-term follow-up after catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The incidence of recurrence and progression of atrial fibrillation [^111Vhk1d]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although catheter ablation (CA) is a standard treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), its long-term efficacy remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the incidences of AF recurrence and progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF after CA in patients with paroxysmal AF.

- **Methods and results**: We examined the incidence of AF recurrence and AF progression in 1220 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 years) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, undergoing CA, based on extensive pulmonary vein isolation and focal ablation for nonpulmonary vein foci. AF recurrence-free survival probabilities at 5 years were 59.4% after the initial CA and 81.1% after the final CA (average, 1.3 procedures). During a median follow-up period of 47.9 months (range, 5.3–123.3 months) after the initial CA, AF progressed from paroxysmal to persistent in 15 (1.2%) patients (0.3% per year). The duration of AF history (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; P < 0.0001), number of ineffective antiarrhythmics (HR, 1.09; P = 0.005), and left atrial diameter indexed by body surface area (HR, 1.05; P = 0.001) were significant predictors of AF recurrence. Patient age (HR, 1.12; P = 0.0001) and left atrial diameter indexed by body surface area (HR, 1.26; P = 0.0006) were significantly associated with AF progression. Patients aged ≤ 65 years and with a left atrial diameter indexed by the body surface area of ≤ 24.0 mm² did not develop AF progression for ≤ 10 years after the initial CA.

- **Conclusions**: Although the long-term follow-up revealed the effect of CA on preventing AF recurrence, repeated CA sessions might be required.
