## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting medications for neuropathic pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and etiologies that drive treatment choice. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic classes and their evidence base. Next, I will examine second-line and adjunctive options, including topical agents and opioids. After that, I need to check special populations such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and spinal cord injury. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm, address implementation gaps, and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations throughout [^111bFbBi] [^1168nP2x] [^114D4kum].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why etiology matters. Neuropathic pain is common, heterogeneous, and often chronic, with diabetes being the leading cause and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy representing a distinct, treatment-refractory phenotype; importantly, tight glycemic control slows progression in type 1 diabetes but has modest effects in type 2, so symptomatic therapy is essential in most patients [^114Yregc] [^114aetr1]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy is underutilized; indeed, real-world data show frequent opioid use and low uptake of recommended agents, underscoring a quality gap that we need to address in practice [^117MgmFJ] [^113Pkg7D].

> Next, I should review first-line systemic classes and their comparative effectiveness. Wait, let me verify the core agents: gabapentinoids, SNRIs, and TCAs consistently emerge as foundational options across high-quality guidelines and meta-analyses, with sodium channel blockers like mexiletine reserved for select cases due to tolerability concerns [^114D4kum] [^1168nP2x] [^115S7auQ]. I need to ensure I cite the right numbers; NeuPSIG meta-analytic NNTs for 50% pain relief are approximately 6.4 for SNRIs, 7.7 for pregabalin, and 7.2 for gabapentin, while TCAs often show lower NNTs but with more adverse effects, which shapes their placement in algorithms [^115S7auQ]. Let me double-check head-to-head signals; in COMBO-DN, duloxetine 60 mg showed lower pain scores than pregabalin 300 mg over 8 weeks, suggesting a modest efficacy edge in some contexts, though this was a secondary endpoint and should be interpreted cautiously [^112mhqEw].

> I will now examine gabapentinoids more closely. Gabapentin at 1200–3600 mg/day and pregabalin at 150–600 mg/day have robust evidence in painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, with Cochrane estimates showing meaningful response rates and clear separation from placebo, albeit with dose-limiting dizziness and somnolence; I should confirm that pregabalin is FDA-approved for DPN while gabapentin is widely used off-label for this indication, which aligns with practice patterns [^113J3HNe] [^113KihfK]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all nerve injuries; a recent meta-analysis of peripheral nerve injury found no clinically important pain reduction with gabapentinoids, reminding me to tailor expectations by etiology and to screen for misuse risk, which is rising in some populations [^114bnGDR] [^113KihfK].

> Next, I should review SNRIs, especially duloxetine. Duloxetine 60–120 mg/day has consistent benefit in DPN and is FDA-approved, with favorable effects on mood and sleep; venlafaxine has supportive data but less robust evidence and requires blood pressure monitoring, so I need to ensure cardiovascular comorbidities are considered before choosing it [^115S7auQ] [^112mhqEw]. Let me reconsider comparative performance; in cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy, nortriptyline and duloxetine outperformed pregabalin and mexiletine when balancing efficacy and tolerability, reinforcing SNRIs and TCAs as early options in many patients [^113V5o7F].

> Now, TCAs deserve careful appraisal. Amitriptyline and nortriptyline have long track records and low NNTs, but anticholinergic and cardiac effects limit use in older adults or those with arrhythmias; I should double-check that contemporary guidelines still include TCAs as first-line given these trade-offs, and yes, they do, with explicit cautions and shared decision-making emphasized [^114D4kum] [^1168nP2x]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought amitriptyline had first-tier RCT evidence; hold on, I should verify the Cochrane assessments, which conclude that unbiased high-quality evidence is limited and that many TCA data are from smaller, older studies, so I need to communicate uncertainty while acknowledging clinical utility in selected patients [^113ymtNU] [^1117j81k].

> I need to check second-line and adjunctive options. Topical lidocaine 5% patches and high-concentration capsaicin 8% patches are reasonable for localized pain, with capsaicin showing an NNT around 10.6 and the advantage of minimal systemic adverse effects; however, capsaicin application pain and the need for clinic administration can limit uptake, so patient selection and counseling are key [^115S7auQ] [^112wq7BA]. Let me verify topical amitriptyline or compounded gels; evidence is limited and mixed, so I should avoid overpromising benefit outside of specialized settings or trials [^112wq7BA].

> But wait, what about opioids and tramadol. I should confirm that major guidelines discourage routine opioid use for chronic neuropathic pain, including DPN, due to limited benefit and substantial harms; the AAN position and AAFP guidance advise against starting opioids, reserving them, if at all, for carefully selected refractory cases with close monitoring and safe tapering plans, and even then as last-line after other options fail [^111ftvS8] [^112fh99y]. ASCO allows duloxetine for painful CIPN but does not endorse opioids for CIPN treatment, reinforcing a conservative stance in oncology populations as well [^117Nkojt].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Hold on, I should verify the most defensible option; ASCO recommends duloxetine 60 mg/day as the only pharmacologic treatment with consistent benefit for established painful CIPN, and it does not improve numbness or tingling, so functional rehabilitation and fall-risk mitigation remain essential adjuncts [^117Nkojt] [^1139aXp5]. I need to ensure I note that gabapentinoids have not shown benefit in CIPN prevention or treatment trials, which helps avoid off-label extrapolation in this group [^117Nkojt].

> For spinal cord injury–related neuropathic pain, let me verify the first-line signal. Pregabalin has the most consistent RCT evidence in SCI neuropathic pain, with NNTs around 7 in high-quality trials, making it a reasonable initial choice in this phenotype, though I should still screen for sedation and edema and consider combination therapy if monotherapy is insufficient [^113YpjKd].

> Next, I should review HIV-associated neuropathy. I need to check whether antidepressants help here; evidence suggests TCAs are not effective in HIV neuropathy, so gabapentinoids or topical options may be preferred based on limited but available data, and I should be cautious with drug–drug interactions given antiretroviral regimens [^111DENQb] [^111rGMd1].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while acknowledging that sequencing is individualized. Start with one first-line agent from a different class if the first fails, reassess at about 12 weeks, and consider combination therapy across mechanistic classes if partial response occurs; this mirrors AAN guidance and aligns with meta-analytic conclusions about modest average efficacy necessitating trials of multiple agents [^112dCQTK] [^115S7auQ]. I should double-check that this approach is consistent with primary care guidance; yes, AAFP similarly recommends offering duloxetine or pregabalin first-line with amitriptyline or gabapentin as alternatives, emphasizing patient-specific comorbidities and tolerability [^116ji9na] [^1171aVBU].

> Implementation matters, so I need to ensure we address real-world gaps. Opioids are overprescribed while guideline-concordant agents are underused, and clinical decision support alone has not reliably changed prescribing; therefore, clinician education, patient counseling about expected benefits and adverse effects, and systematic follow-up at 2–4 week intervals during titration are critical to improve adherence and outcomes [^117MgmFJ] [^111ux7s7] [^113Pkg7D]. Hold on, I should verify that we are also measuring what matters; quality measures now track whether patients with neuropathy are offered appropriate neuropathic pain medications and whether opioid exposure is minimized, which can drive practice change when embedded in feedback loops [^113KmwWt].

> Key takeaways I need to emphasize: first, no single agent works for everyone, so a structured trial-and-error approach across classes is expected and should be explained upfront; second, duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin, and TCAs remain the pharmacologic backbone, with topical agents as valuable adjuncts for focal pain; third, avoid routine opioid initiation and prioritize safety, comorbidity screening, and functional goals; fourth, tailor choices to etiology, with duloxetine favored in CIPN and pregabalin often preferred in SCI, while recognizing that evidence strength varies across conditions [^112dCQTK] [^1168nP2x] [^117Nkojt] [^113YpjKd]. I should confirm that this synthesis aligns with contemporary high-credibility guidelines; yes, AAN, ADA, AAFP, and ASCO converge on these principles, supporting the clinical approach outlined here [^114D4kum] [^1168nP2x] [^116ji9na] [^117Nkojt].

---

Neuropathy treatment is individualized by etiology, comorbidities, and response, with **first-line options** including gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) [^1168nP2x] [^114D4kum]. Topical agents (lidocaine 5% patch, capsaicin 8% patch) are useful for localized pain or when systemic therapy is limited [^112wq7BA] [^113QzTv2]. Second-line options include tramadol, tapentadol, and mexiletine; **opioids are generally avoided** due to limited efficacy and significant risks [^112fh99y] [^111ftvS8]. Combination therapy is often needed, and treatment should be reassessed every 12 weeks for efficacy and tolerability [^112dCQTK] [^114ys2rZ].

---

## First-line pharmacological treatments

### Gabapentinoids

- **Gabapentin**: Effective for diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia; typical dose 1,200–3,600 mg/day divided TID [^113J3HNe] [^113KihfK].
- **Pregabalin**: Effective for diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and spinal cord injury pain; typical dose 300–600 mg/day divided BID [^113KihfK] [^113YpjKd].
- **Mechanism**: α2-δ subunit blockade of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing excitatory neurotransmitter release [^113KihfK].

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

- **Duloxetine**: Effective for diabetic neuropathy; typical dose 60–120 mg/day [^116ji9na].
- **Venlafaxine**: Alternative SNRI with moderate evidence; typical dose 150–225 mg/day [^111DENQb].
- **Mechanism**: Inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, enhancing descending inhibitory pathways [^notfound].

---

### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

- **Amitriptyline**: Long-standing evidence; typical dose 25–150 mg/day [^1117j81k].
- **Nortriptyline**: Better tolerability than amitriptyline; typical dose 25–150 mg/day [^notfound].
- **Mechanism**: Inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake; also block sodium channels [^notfound].

---

## Topical treatments

### Lidocaine 5% patch

The **indication** is localized neuropathic pain, particularly postherpetic neuralgia; apply 1–3 patches/day for up to 12 hours [^112wq7BA] [^1111c843]. The **mechanism** is sodium channel blockade, reducing ectopic discharges [^113QzTv2].

---

### Capsaicin 8% patch

The **indication** is localized neuropathic pain, including diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia; apply one 30–60 minute session every 3 months [^112wq7BA] [^112MXFZq]. The **mechanism** is TRPV1 receptor desensitization, depleting substance P [^1111c843].

---

## Second-line and adjunctive treatments

### Tramadol and tapentadol

Tramadol is a weak opioid with SNRI activity for **breakthrough pain** or when first-line agents fail; monitor for dependence and serotonin syndrome [^111NK1fd] [^117M5HAm]. Tapentadol is a strong opioid with **dual mechanism** (μ-opioid receptor agonism and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition) for refractory cases [^111NK1fd].

---

### Mexiletine

Mexiletine is a sodium channel blocker for **refractory cases**; monitor for **cardiac adverse effects** [^111RibRD] [^1111c843].

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

- **Opioids**: Generally avoided due to limited efficacy, risk of dependence, and adverse effects; consider only in refractory cases with close monitoring [^112fh99y] [^111ftvS8].
- **SSRIs**: Limited efficacy; not first-line for neuropathic pain [^111DENQb] [^112mhqEw].
- **Acetyl-l-carnitine**: Not recommended for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy [^117Nkojt].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy is often necessary for **partial responders**; common combinations include gabapentinoids with TCAs or SNRIs, and gabapentinoids with opioids in refractory cases [^112dCQTK] [^114ys2rZ].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Treatment should be reassessed every 12 weeks for efficacy and tolerability; adjust dose, switch class, or add a second agent if needed [^112dCQTK].

---

Neuropathy management is **individualized**, with first-line options including gabapentinoids, SNRIs, and TCAs, and topical agents for localized pain. Second-line options include tramadol, tapentadol, and mexiletine, while opioids are generally avoided. Combination therapy is common, and regular reassessment ensures optimal outcomes.

### Painful peripheral neuropathy and its nonsurgical treatment [^111AAzWS]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of neuropathic pain is the primary focus of management for many patients with painful peripheral neuropathy. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants are the two pharmacological classes most widely studied and represent first-line agents in the management of neuropathic pain. The number of pharmacological agents that have demonstrated effectiveness for neuropathic pain continues to expand. In the current review, we summarize data from randomized, controlled pharmacological trials in painful peripheral neuropathies. Although neuropathic pain management remains challenging because the response to therapy varies considerably between patients, and pain relief is rarely complete, a majority of patients can benefit from monotherapy using a well-chosen agent or polypharmacy that combines medications with different mechanisms of action.

A recent review and meta-analysis on pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain provides a precise update on treatment efficacy and adverse effects. The authors offer revised evidence-based recommendations for first-line therapies and subsequent options, but we still a need to improve individual treatment decisions, including nonpharmacological therapies, in affected patients.

### Novel insights on diagnosis, cause and treatment of diabetic neuropathy: focus on painful diabetic neuropathy [^114GWyPv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy is common, under or misdiagnosed, and causes substantial morbidity with increased mortality. Defining and developing sensitive diagnostic tests for diabetic neuropathy is not only key to implementing earlier interventions but also to ensure that the most appropriate endpoints are employed in clinical intervention trials. This is critical as many potentially effective therapies may never progress to the clinic, not due to a lack of therapeutic effect, but because the endpoints were not sufficiently sensitive or robust to identify benefit. Apart from improving glycaemic control, there is no licensed treatment for diabetic neuropathy, however, a number of pathogenetic pathways remain under active study. Painful diabetic neuropathy is a cause of considerable morbidity and whilst many pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are currently used, only two are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We address the important issue of the 'placebo effect' and also consider potential new pharmacological therapies as well as nonpharmacological interventions in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Clinical approach to the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy [^114vuxM6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Painful neuropathy is a common and often progressive complication of diabetes. Patients frequently report symptoms of tingling, burning, lancinating pain, hyperesthesia and allodynia. The natural history of the disease may vary from intermittent mild symptoms to severe chronic daily pain; the latter is often associated with diminished quality of life. There are a variety of pharmaceutical agents from different medicinal categories available for the symptomatic treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, however selecting an agent is often challenging given the breadth of choices and lack of consistent guidelines. As a result, many patients remain untreated or undertreated. This article presents a practical clinical approach to the treatment of pain in diabetic neuropathy. Recommendations for first, second and third line medications are based on specific evidence for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy as well as safety, tolerability, drug interactions and cost. Additional topics of discussion include breakthrough pain, opioid use and topical therapies. This review does not comprehensively discuss all possible treatments for painful neuropathy, but provides a systematic approach designed to guide clinicians in tailoring therapies to the individual patient.

Purpose Of Review

Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurotoxic effect of medications. When medications are used to treat life-threatening illnesses, balancing the toxic effects of peripheral neuropathy with the therapeutic benefits of the drug can be difficult. This article examines recent research into the cellular mechanisms associated with neuropathy after treatment with medications to treat cancer, and HIV, and to prevent transplant rejection.

Recent Findings

Cisplatin and suramin induce a length, dose, and time-dependent axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Cisplatin and suramin both result in apoptosis in dorsal root ganglion neurons that may partially explain the neuropathy that develops with treatment. In contrast, nerve growth factor prevents initiation of the programmed cell death associated with cisplatin neurotoxicity. Suramin causes accumulation of lamellar inclusion bodies in dorsal root ganglion neurons related to dose of administration and severity of the neuropathy. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors affect mitochondrial function and lead to depletion of the nerve's mitochondrial DNA and inhibition of DNA polymerase. These effects on the mitochondrion may be related to the polyneuropathy that develops in these patients. In contrast to the axonal neuropathies, tacrolimus and rarely suramin can result in a demyelinating neuropathy that may mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Many of these neuropathies can be reversed by early recognition of the symptoms or by using sensitive electrophysiological testing. In certain instances, specific therapies may ameliorate the neuropathy. Glutamine may reduce paclitaxel-induced toxicity, while some patients with tacrolimus or suramin-induced demyelinating neuropathy may respond to intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis.

Summary

Improved understanding of neurotoxic mechanisms in the peripheral nervous system associated with chemotherapeutic and anti-HIV medications, coupled with early improved diagnosis, promises to help limit neurotoxicity associated with these medications.

### From data to decision: critical appraisal of the 2025 neuPSIG review and recommendations on neuropathic pain treatments [^114NF7GX]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2025 recommendations of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) constitute a methodologically rigorous update on the management of neuropathic pain, integrating a large-scale meta-analysis of pharmacological treatments and neuromodulation intervention. Yet, they also expose persistent challenges: under-representation of common aetiologies, a narrow scope of neuromodulation, reliance on placebo-controlled designs, and conflicts of interest that might affect the perception of neutrality. Addressing these issues requires not only transparency, but also broader inclusion of neglected conditions, adaptation of methods to nonpharmacological interventions, and attention to diverse healthcare contexts. We aim to both to critically appraise the current guidelines and to encourage broader reflection on how future research and guideline development could foster greater relevance and generalisation.

### What role for capsaicin in diabetic peripheral neuropathy? [^114ULFNS]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common long-term complication of diabetes mellitus. In many patients, neuropathy is accompanied by pain, which is often difficult to manage effectively. Drug treatment options include certain antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs. Another option is the use of topical capsaicin. In this article, we consider the evidence for capsaicin in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and how it fits with current management strategies.

### Patient-reported strategies for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^112f1nzo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating toxicity of many drugs used in cancer treatment. There are numerous available strategies for preventing or treating CIPN, but few are guideline-recommended, due to limited evidence of their effectiveness. The primary objective of this survey was to understand what strategies patients used to prevent or treat CIPN, and to understand their perceptions around CIPN prevention and treatment.

Methods

The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Neurological Complications Study Group created a cross-sectional online survey to recruit individuals who are currently or had previously received neurotoxic chemotherapy treatment and self-reported peripheral neuropathy. Descriptive statistics were reported.

Results

Most of the 447 survey participants did not use any CIPN prevention strategy (71%), though given options of any strategy the plurality preferred a prescribed medication or supplement (30%). The most common treatment strategy used was exercise (47%), with some patients trying prescription medications including non-guideline recommended gabapentin (33%) or guideline-recommended duloxetine (8%) options. Nearly half of participants (49%) used at least one non-prescribed medication for treating CIPN. Patients often followed suggestions of their medical oncology clinical team, but sometimes relied on the internet or other patients to recommend non-prescription strategies.

Conclusion

In the absence of many guideline-recommended strategies for CIPN prevention and treatment, some patients use options with minimal evidence of effectiveness. Additional research is needed to determine which strategies are effective for prevention and treatment so these can be implemented in practice to improve treatment outcomes in patients with cancer.

### New developments in the treatment algorithm for peripheral neuropathic pain [^111nxpTr]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain often imposes a substantial and unrelenting burden on those individuals who have it; single-agent analgesics typically only reduce pain at best. Worldwide, five sets of treatment recommendations offer insight into managing neuropathic pain, including two European guidelines, one Canadian, one Latin American, and another constructed under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). The analgesics common to these guidelines are topical lidocaine, secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors, calcium channel α(2)-δ ligands, tramadol, and opioid antagonists. Still, significant knowledge gaps in the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions have hampered the development of algorithms and multimodal approaches. As the evidence base expands, the addition of new comparative trial data will further refine the development of new guidance for clinical management of neuropathic pain. New alternatives for managing neuropathic pain, such as the high-concentration capsaicin patch, will enlarge the treatment armamentarium and potentially impact therapeutic guidelines.

### What is new in neuropathic pain? [^113j5PUG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain occurs in 1% of the population and is difficult to manage. Responses to single drugs are limited in benefit. Thirty percent will fail to respond altogether. This is a review of newer drugs and treatment paradigms.

Methods

A literature review was performed pertinent to new drugs and treatment algorithms in the management of neuropathic pain.

Results

New information on opioids (tramadol and buprenorphine) suggests benefits in the management of neuropathic pain and has increased interest in their use earlier in the course of illness. Newer antidepressants, selective noradrenaline, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have evidence for benefit and reduced toxicity without an economic disadvantage compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Treatment paradigms are shifting from sequential single drug trials to multiple drug therapies. Evidence is needed to justify this change in treatment approach.

Conclusion

Drug choices are now based not only on efficacy but also toxicity and drug interactions. For this reason, SNRIs and gabapentin/pregabalin have become popular though efficacy is not better than TCAs. Multiple drug therapies becoming an emergent treatment paradigm research in multiple drug therapy are needed.

### Pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain: evidence-based recommendations [^112YtQ4X]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with neuropathic pain (NP) are challenging to manage and evidence-based clinical recommendations for pharmacologic management are needed. Systematic literature reviews, randomized clinical trials, and existing guidelines were evaluated at a consensus meeting. Medications were considered for recommendation if their efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically-sound, randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrating superiority to placebo or a relevant comparison treatment. Recommendations were based on the amount and consistency of evidence, degree of efficacy, safety, and clinical experience of the authors. Available RCTs typically evaluated chronic NP of moderate to severe intensity. Recommended first-line treatments include certain antidepressants (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants and dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine), calcium channel alpha2-delta ligands (i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics and tramadol are recommended as generally second-line treatments that can be considered for first-line use in select clinical circumstances. Other medications that would generally be used as third-line treatments but that could also be used as second-line treatments in some circumstances include certain antiepileptic and antidepressant medications, mexiletine, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, and topical capsaicin. Medication selection should be individualized, considering side effects, potential beneficial or deleterious effects on comorbidities, and whether prompt onset of pain relief is necessary. To date, no medications have demonstrated efficacy in lumbosacral radiculopathy, which is probably the most common type of NP. Long-term studies, head-to-head comparisons between medications, studies involving combinations of medications, and RCTs examining treatment of central NP are lacking and should be a priority for future research.

### Basic science and clinical management of painful and non-painful chemotherapy-related neuropathy [^114hxq6g]. Gynecologic Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting toxicity of several chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of all the most common malignancies. There are several defined mechanisms of nerve damage that take place along different areas of the peripheral and the central nervous system. Treatment is based on symptom management and there are several classes of medications found to be efficacious in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain that persists despite appropriate pharmacotherapy may respond to interventional procedures that span a range of invasiveness. The purpose of this review article is to examine the basic science of neuropathy and currently available treatment options in the context of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.

### Contemporary assessment and management of neuropathic pain [^11687XZu]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Preclinical studies have increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain at the anatomic, cellular, and molecular levels. These lines of investigation have enabled more logical uses of older therapies for neuropathic pain and have contributed to our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of newer remedies. The identification of receptor systems and the development of genetically modified animal models for the study of neuropathic pain have greatly increased our understanding of effective clinical treatments. This review focuses on the central and peripheral nervous system changes believed to be important in the initiation and perpetuation of neuropathic pain. Currently used medications, as well as medications that are on the horizon, are highlighted.

3 TREATMENT OF PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN

3.1 Medications

Several medications from a wide range of pharmaceutical classes have been used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Summary of pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) are anti‐epileptic medications and are frequently used for treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. They work by inhibiting alpha 2‐delta subunits of voltage‐gated calcium channels. Gabapentin has a strong recommendation as a first line choice in peripheral neuropathic pain at doses of 1200 mg‐3600 mg daily divided into three different doses, or two different doses for an extended‐release formulation. Pregabalin is also a first line agent, dosed at 300–600 mg divided into two doses daily. Gabapentin and pregabalin are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for post‐herpetic neuralgia, with pregabalin also being approved for diabetic neuropathy and spinal cord injury pain. Additionally, both medications have evidence that endorses their benefits for use in peripheral diabetic neuropathy. The study of off label use for gabapentinoids has shown they provide little to no improvement in treating other etiologies of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as radiculopathy and HIV associated neuropathy. Common side effects of gabapentinoids include dizziness and sedation. Gabapentin has become subject to abuse in recent years with people taking it in large doses to induce euphoria.

### Therapy of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^11235p58]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is still a common and disabling side effect of many chemotherapy agents in use today. Unfortunately, neither prophylactic strategies nor symptomatic treatments have proven useful yet. This review will discuss the diagnosis and evaluation of neuropathy in cancer patients, as well as reviewing the various prophylactic and symptomatic treatments that have been proposed or tried. However, sufficient evidence is lacking to recommend any of these treatments to patients suffering with CIPN. Therefore, the best approach is to treat symptomatically, and to start with broad-spectrum analgesic medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If NSAIDs fail, a reasonable second-line agent in properly selected patients may be an opioid. Unfortunately, even when effective in other types of neuropathic pain, anti-depressants and anticonvulsants have not yet proven effective for treating the symptoms of CIPN.

### From guideline to patient: a review of recent recommendations for pharmacotherapy of painful diabetic neuropathy [^115Lbnan]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2014). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, affecting, by some estimates, up to one quarter of diabetic patients. Since 2010, no fewer than 5 major international treatment guidelines for painful DPN have been issued, and there are meaningful differences among them. Duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin, and tricyclic antidepressants are the mainstays of treatment, but the choice of which class or agent to use in any given patient should be informed by patient characteristics. This review seeks to describe the differences among the recently issued guidelines, to assess the evidence on which they are based, and to offer insight into the most appropriate treatment choices based on patient characteristics.

### Peripheral neuropathy and cancer [^114PHAYy]. Current Oncology Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy has a major impact on quality of life and may limit the amount of treatment patients can receive. Neurotoxic agents are used increasingly in oncologic practice, yet clinicians are often unaware of the protean manifestations of neuropathy and find its management troubling. Recent knowledge about the mechanisms of neuropathic disease and new treatments may help to minimize the impact of neuropathy on this vulnerable patient population.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy: advantage of novel drugs over old drugs? [^1148yuhx]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

SYMPTOMATIC PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF PAINFUL NEUROPATHY

Diabetic painful neuropathy may constitute a considerable management problem. The efficacy of a single therapeutic agent is not the rule, and simple analgesics are usually inadequate to control the pain. Therefore, various therapeutic schemes have been previously proposed, but none have been validated. Nonetheless, there is agreement that patients should be offered the available therapies in a stepwise fashion. Effective pain treatment consists of a favorable balance between pain relief and adverse events without implying a maximum effect.

The various pharmacological treatment options are summarized in Table 1. The advantages and disadvantages of the various drugs and drug classes used for treatment of DPN under consideration of the various comorbidities and complications associated with diabetes are summarized in Table 2. Before any decision regarding the appropriate treatment, the diagnosis of the underlying neuropathic manifestation should be established. In contrast to the agents that have been derived from the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy, those used for symptomatic therapy were designed to modulate the pain, without favorably influencing the underlying neuropathy. A number of trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drugs, but only a few included large patient samples.

The relative benefit of active treatment over a control in clinical trials is usually expressed as the relative risk, the relative risk reduction, or the odds ratio. However, to estimate the extent of a therapeutic effect (i.e. pain relief) that can be translated into clinical practice, it is useful to apply a simple measure that helps the physician to select the appropriate treatment for the individual patient. Such a practical measure is the "number needed to treat" (NNT), i.e. the number of patients who need to be treated with a particular therapy to observe a clinically relevant effect or adverse event in one patient. The NNTs and numbers needed to harm for the individual agents used in the treatment of DPN are given in Table 1.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^116S3rZ3]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological Management

Medications form the basis of first- and second-line therapy for neuropathic pain (Table 1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentanoids, tramadol, lidocaine, and capsaicin are the most effective options. Most of these first- and second-line options come with considerable potential for side effects. Depending on the medication, a three- to eight-week trial is recommended with review midway and at the end of the trial to assess effectiveness. If the patient does not receive significant relief or has adverse effects from a medication, then dosing should be adjusted, an alternative medication or combination therapy should be tried, or the patient should be considered for a trial of neurostimulation.

Table 1
First- and second-line medications for neuropathic pain

Tricyclic Antidepressants. TCAs are one of the most studied antidepressants for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Their use as a firstline therapy is supported across multiple guidelines. They have been shown to be effective in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and neuropathic pain post–spinal cord injury and of limited effect in radiculopathy, HIV, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

### Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults [^113J3HNe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is commonly used to treat neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). This review updates a review published in 2014, and previous reviews published in 2011, 2005 and 2000.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2014 to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing gabapentin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). We performed a pooled analysis for any substantial or moderate benefit. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included four new studies (530 participants), and excluded three previously included studies (126 participants). In all, 37 studies provided information on 5914 participants. Most studies used oral gabapentin or gabapentin encarbil at doses of 1200 mg or more daily in different neuropathic pain conditions, predominantly postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. Study duration was typically four to 12 weeks. Not all studies reported important outcomes of interest. High risk of bias occurred mainly due to small size (especially in cross-over studies), and handling of data after study withdrawal. In postherpetic neuralgia, more participants (32%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (17%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1); NNT 6.7 (5.4 to 8.7); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (46%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (25%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0); NNT 4.8 (4.1 to 6.0); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). In painful diabetic neuropathy, more participants (38%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (21%) (RR 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.3); NNT 5.9 (4.6 to 8.3); 6 studies, 1277 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (52%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (37%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6); NNT 6.6 (4.9 to 9.9); 7 studies, 1439 participants, moderate-quality evidence). For all conditions combined, adverse event withdrawals were more common with gabapentin (11%) than with placebo (8.2%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.7); NNH 30 (20 to 65); 22 studies, 4346 participants, high-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were no more common with gabapentin (3.2%) than with placebo (2.8%) (RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 19 studies, 3948 participants, moderate-quality evidence); there were eight deaths (very low-quality evidence). Participants experiencing at least one adverse event were more common with gabapentin (63%) than with placebo (49%) (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4); NNH 7.5 (6.1 to 9.6); 18 studies, 4279 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Individual adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Participants taking gabapentin experienced dizziness (19%), somnolence (14%), peripheral oedema (7%), and gait disturbance (14%).

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg daily (1200 mg to 3600 mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very limited. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by patients, and the achievement of this degree of pain relief is associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference, fatigue, and depression, as well as quality of life, function, and work. Around 3 or 4 out of 10 participants achieved this degree of pain relief with gabapentin, compared with 1 or 2 out of 10 for placebo. Over half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief but may experience adverse events. Conclusions have not changed since the previous update of this review.

### Algorithm for neuropathic pain treatment: an evidence based proposal [^114n9Cn9]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

New studies of the treatment of neuropathic pain have increased the need for an updated review of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to support an evidence based algorithm to treat neuropathic pain conditions. Available studies were identified using a MEDLINE and EMBASE search. One hundred and five studies were included. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) were used to compare efficacy and safety of the treatments in different neuropathic pain syndromes. The quality of each trial was assessed. Tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin were the most frequently studied drug classes. In peripheral neuropathic pain, the lowest NNT was for tricyclic antidepressants, followed by opioids and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin. For central neuropathic pain there is limited data. NNT and NNH are currently the best way to assess relative efficacy and safety, but the need for dichotomous data, which may have to be estimated retrospectively for old trials, and the methodological complexity of pooling data from small cross-over and large parallel group trials, remain as limitations.

### Toxic neuropathies: a practical approach [^11667cLm]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Toxic neuropathies result from exogenous substances damaging the peripheral nerves. There are numerous causes, including prescribed and recreational drugs, heavy metals, industrial agents and biological toxins. Timely recognition of these neuropathies gives better outcomes, as they usually improve or stabilise once the toxin is removed. Most toxic neuropathies are axonal, length-dependent and sensory predominant, although some have significant motor involvement or can present acutely or subacutely. Here, we outline our clinical approach and discuss the major causes of toxic neuropathy, while emphasising the clinical and neurophysiological features and the neuropathy phenotype. We also include an update on newer medications that can cause neuropathy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors.

### Polyneuropathy quality measurement set: quality improvement in neurology [^112up3V1]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology Institute (AANI) painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) — prevalence context, effective medication classes, and opioid guidance are outlined as follows: Peripheral neuropathy affects ∼5% of the population and diabetes is the most common cause, and given the effect of PDN on patients' quality of life, appropriate treatment is essential. To increase effective management, the American Academy of Neurology Institute published and recently updated a PDN treatment guideline and the American Academy of Neurology provides quality measures to implement. Based on a meta-analysis, the guideline identified gabapentinoids, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers as having the highest efficacy for PDN, and noted that topical, nontraditional, and nonpharmacologic interventions are available. Based on the considerable potential harms of opioids, the practice guideline update suggested against starting opioids and recommends offering the option of a safe taper of opioids for those already taking them.

Key Points

(1) A large number of treatment options have shown generally moderate efficacy in the treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy.(2) Tricyclic antidepressants are the mainstay of therapy, with anticonvulsants, opioids and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors also having a place.(3) Head-to-head trials of current treatments are needed. Meanwhile, selection of therapeutic agents should be individualised.

### Diabetic neuropathy [^114Yregc]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes has led to a corresponding epidemic of complications of these disorders. The most prevalent complication is neuropathy, of which distal symmetric polyneuropathy (for the purpose of this Primer, referred to as diabetic neuropathy) is very common. Diabetic neuropathy is a loss of sensory function beginning distally in the lower extremities that is also characterized by pain and substantial morbidity. Over time, at least 50% of individuals with diabetes develop diabetic neuropathy. Glucose control effectively halts the progression of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, but the effects are more modest in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These findings have led to new efforts to understand the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy, along with new 2017 recommendations on approaches to prevent and treat this disorder that are specific for each type of diabetes. In parallel, new guidelines for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy using distinct classes of drugs, with an emphasis on avoiding opioid use, have been issued. Although our understanding of the complexities of diabetic neuropathy has substantially evolved over the past decade, the distinct mechanisms underlying neuropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes remains unknown. Future discoveries on disease pathogenesis will be crucial to successfully address all aspects of diabetic neuropathy, from prevention to treatment.

### Treatment of neuropathic pain: an overview of recent guidelines [^111RibRD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A number of different treatments for neuropathic pain have been studied, but the literature is sizable, rapidly evolving, and lacks important information about practical aspects of patient management. Under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG), a consensus process was used to develop evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on health-related quality of life, convenience, and costs. On the basis of randomized clinical trials, medications recommended as first-line treatments for neuropathic pain included certain antidepressants (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants and dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine), calcium channel alpha(2)-delta ligands (i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics and tramadol were recommended as second-line treatments that can be considered for first-line use in selected clinical circumstances. Other medications that generally would be used as third-line treatments include certain other antidepressant and antiepileptic medications, topical capsaicin, mexiletine, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists. Two other national and international associations recently published pharmacologic treatment guidelines for neuropathic pain, which are summarized and contrasted with the NeuPSIG recommendations. Recent guidelines for the use of neurostimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain also are summarized. For all treatments for neuropathic pain, long-term studies, head-to-head comparisons, and studies of treatment combinations are a priority for future research.

### An integrated perspective on diabetic, alcoholic, and drug-induced neuropathy, etiology, and treatment in the US [^113aEdtS]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain (NeuP) is a syndrome that results from damaged nerves and/or aberrant regeneration. Common etiologies of neuropathy include chronic illnesses and medication use. Chronic disorders, such as diabetes and alcoholism, can cause neuronal injury and consequently NeuP. Certain medications with antineoplastic effects also carry an exquisitely high risk for neuropathy. These culprits are a few of many that are fueling the NeuP epidemic, which currently affects 7%–10% of the population. It has been estimated that approximately 10% and 7% of US adults carry a diagnosis of diabetes and alcohol disorder, respectively. Despite its pervasiveness, many physicians are unfamiliar with adequate treatment of NeuP, partly due to the few reviews that are available that have integrated basic science and clinical practice. In light of the recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that advise against the routine use of μ-opioid receptor-selective opioids for chronic pain management, such a review is timely. Here, we provide a succinct overview of the etiology and treatment options of diabetic and alcohol- and drug-induced neuropathy, three different and prevalent neuropathies fusing the combined clinical and preclinical pharmacological expertise in NeuP of the authors. We discuss the anatomy of pain and pain transmission, with special attention to key ion channels, receptors, and neurotransmitters. An understanding of pain neurophysiology will lead to a better understanding of the rationale for the effectiveness of current treatment options, and may lead to better diagnostic tools to help distinguish types of neuropathy. We close with a discussion of ongoing research efforts to develop additional treatments for NeuP.

### NCCN task force report: management of neuropathy in cancer [^115koTyJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

Neuropathy is a common, often debilitating complication of cancer and its treatment. Effective management of this disorder depends on early diagnosis and an understanding of its underlying causes in the individual patient. In January 2009, NCCN gathered a multidisciplinary group to review the literature and discuss intervention strategies currently available to patients as well as areas that require research efforts. The task force, which comprised experts in anesthesiology, medical oncology, neurology, neuro-oncology, neurophysiology, nursing, pain management, and rehabilitation, was charged with the goal of outlining recommendations for the possible prevention, diagnosis, and management of neuropathy. This report documents the proceedings of this meeting with a general background on neuropathy and neuropathy in oncology, followed by discussions on challenges and research issues, evaluation criteria, and management of different symptoms associated with this disorder.

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: treatment of diabetic neuropathy [^113mfatA]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

VG: Which medications are used in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy?

UA: So the typical medications which tend to be used and which are categorised as really being either first- or second-line are anticonvulsants and antidepressants. Within the anticonvulsant class, we have pregabalin and gabapentin and within the antidepressant class, we have duloxetine and the tricyclic antidepressant i.e. amitriptyline, although other tricyclic antidepressants have also been used.

VG: What are the differences in the international treatment guidelines for painful diabetic neuropathy?

UA: The international guidelines tend to agree that pregabalin, gabapentin and duloxetine and also tricyclics are either first- or second-line in the treatment regime. After this, there is some real divergence in what the recommendations are. But if we think about those four medications [classes], these are the ones that tend to be used as either first- or second-line. Now, one difference in the American Association of Neurology 2011 guidelines recommended that pregabalin as first-line. Now, this is largely due to a technical aspect of the duloxetine studies in which some of them have a greater than 20% dropout and thus the level of evidence was not considered quite as strong. The newer American Academy of Neurology guidelines are due and we'll see what their recommendations are.

VG: What are the differences in efficacy between gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants?

UA: A study has looked at the differences between these two drugs but there's really no significant differences [in efficacy] found. A meta-analysis of head-to-head trials comparing the results of gabapentin with two tricyclics did not show any difference and we know that pregabalin is similar efficacy to gabapentin in the most part, so there's no real difference so far that has been identified. However, there is a study which is underway which is called OPTION-DM this is still underway and this is looking at combination therapy and treatment pathways with pregabalin, duloxetine and amitriptyline and certainly, this will shed more light on this question.

VG: And which medications in the drug class anticonvulsants are used in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy?

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: treatment of diabetic neuropathy [^112mhqEw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

VG: Which medications in the class of selective serotonin–norepinephrine inhibitors (SNRIs) are used in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy?

UA: The two medications commonly used within this class are duloxetine and venlafaxine. Duloxetine is certainly more commonly used and has more robust evidence, and duloxetine is the only one which actually has a label for the use in painful diabetic neuropathy. Other SNRIs are rarely used.

VG: And which medications in the class of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) are used in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy?

UA: Although studies have been done in this class, the evidence is not particularly great. However, we are aware that for people who have a low mood or are depressed and have painful neuropathic symptoms, if we can improve their depressive symptoms then certainly they will have an improvement in their painful neuropathy symptoms. But these don't really form a part of any international guidance and they're not routinely used. The two SSRIs which are used within clinical practice and have been looked at in painful neuropathy are paroxetine and citalopram, but I wouldn't recommend their use either as first-, second- or even third-line.

VG: So between pregabalin, gabapentin and duloxetine is any drug superior?

UA: So there's not a great deal of data on this; however, I must refer back to the COMBO-DN study. So this was a study looking at combination therapy in terms of a combination of pregabalin and duloxetine vs high-dose monotherapy. But in the first instance, there was a run-in phase where people were either put on duloxetine or pregabalin [at standard doses]; duloxetine was at 60 mg per day and pregabalin was a total dose of 300 mg per day. And over the first 8 weeks, duloxetine had lower pain scores. Now I do emphasise that this was a secondary endpoint of the study but if we're thinking about head-to-head studies really this is the one probably with the most robust data where it did show that duloxetine was superior to pregabalin.

### Concomitant medications and risk of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^116LaC4R]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral neuropathy is the dose-limiting toxicity of many oncology drugs, including paclitaxel. There is large interindividual variability in the neuropathy, and several risk factors have been proposed; however, many have not been replicated. Here we present a comprehensive study aimed at identifying treatment and physiopathology-related paclitaxel-induced neuropathy risk factors in a large cohort of well-characterized patients.

Patients and Methods

Analyses included 503 patients with breast or ovarian cancer who received paclitaxel treatment. Paclitaxel dose modifications caused by the neuropathy were extracted from medical records and patients self-reported neuropathy symptoms were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify concomitant medications and comorbidities associated with paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.

Results

Older patients had higher neuropathy: for each increase of 1 year of age, the risk of dose modifications and grade 3 neuropathy increased 4% and 5%, respectively. Cardiovascular drugs increased the risk of paclitaxel dose reductions (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; p = .006), with a stronger association for beta-adrenergic antagonists. The total number of concomitant medications also showed an association with dose modifications (OR, 1.25; p = .012 for each concomitant drug increase). A dose modification predictive model that included the new identified factors gave an area under the curve of 0.74 (p = 1.07 × 10–10). Preexisting nerve compression syndromes seemed to increase neuropathy risk.

Conclusion

Baseline characteristics of the patients, including age and concomitant medications, could be used to identify individuals at high risk of neuropathy, personalizing chemotherapy treatment and reducing the risk of severe neuropathy.

Implications For Practice

Peripheral neuropathy is a common adverse effect of many cancer drugs, including chemotherapeutics, targeted therapies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. About 40% of survivors of cancer have functional deficits caused by this toxicity, some of them irreversible. Currently, there are no effective treatments to prevent or treat this neuropathy. This study, performed in a large cohort of well-characterized patients homogenously treated with paclitaxel, identified concomitant medications, comorbidities, and demographic factors associated with peripheral neuropathy. These factors could serve to identify patients at high risk of severe neuropathy for whom alternative non-neurotoxic alternatives may be considered.

### Concomitant medication polypharmacy, interactions and imperfect adherence are common in Australian adults on suppressive antiretroviral therapy [^111rGMd1]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most HIV-infected patients in resource-rich settings are successfully treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, up to two-thirds of these patients take a concomitant medication to mitigate ART side effects and/or to treat comorbid conditions. Concomitant medication use is more prevalent in those with HIV than in the general population and has been associated with older age, female sex, obesity and hepatitis B/C coinfection. Concomitant medications could complicate HIV care by contributing to polypharmacy, interactions, side effects and suboptimal adherence.

Polypharmacy (commonly defined as use of five or more medications) is associated with increased risk for morbidity, nonadherence, drug interactions and side effects in the general population, and is more common in HIV-infected adults than in the general population. Polypharmacy increases with age, but is likely underestimated given that most studies in HIV-infected adults only account for prescribed medicines. Polypharmacy of concomitant medications in HIV has been associated with adverse drug reactions leading to hospitalization and suboptimal adherence to ART; however, others have shown that initiation of concomitant medication is favourable to ART adherence.

Concomitant medication use in HIV-infected adults increases the risk of pharmacokinetic interactions, particularly in patients receiving a boosted protease or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (due to cytochrome P450 3A inhibition). Furthermore, pharmacodynamic interactions between ART and concomitant medications can result in additive, antagonistic or synergistic effects of one or the other medication. Contraindicated combinations of ART and concomitant medications have been found in 2–7% of ART-treated patients. In one cohort, clinically significant drug–drug interactions (DDIs) were found in 27% of patients, and only 35% of these were correctly identified by clinicians.

Side effects of ART include nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, sleep disturbance, myalgia, rash, lipodystrophy and peripheral neuropathy. Concomitant medications may cause similar adverse effects, and it is unknown if adverse effects are more prevalent in those who take concomitant medications or have polypharmacy.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^113QzTv2]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Section 2. Topical Treatments

While oral medications are commonly used to treat painful diabetic neuropathy, their use is typically limited by significant side effects, a high number-needed-to-treat (NNT), and a high non-responder rate. As such, the application of topical medications is gaining significant interest and has in many instances become a routine aspect of patient care in patients with PDN. While many medications are used in the topical treatment of PDN, this section focuses on the most commonly utilized medications including, lidocaine, capsaicin, and amitriptyline.

Topical Lidocaine

Though not specifically mentioned in the 2021 American Diabetes Association guidelines for standard of care management of PDN, topical lidocaine presents a low-risk option for patients refractory to FDA approved treatments. Lidocaine, an amide local anesthetic, mitigates neuropathic pain by reversibly blocking voltage-gated sodium channels on neuronal membranes. This action inhibits sodium influx during action potential generation, dampening nerve impulse transmission and inducing a numbing state. Lidocaine preferentially targets channels in hyperexcitable, pathologically signaling neurons, due to its higher affinity for open and inactivated states. This selective targeting lends to its effectiveness in managing chronic neuropathic pain.

Topical lidocaine has been the subject of significant clinical research in the management of PDN for years. In 2004, Argoff et al performed an open-label, non-randomized prospective study with 41 subjects which demonstrated that a 5% lidocaine patch significantly improved pain scores as compared to baseline, with no systemic side effects or drug interactions over a 2-week observation period. Barbano et al observed a similar pain reduction (VAS 68.6 at baseline vs 42.4 at 3 weeks, p < 0.001) in a 3-week trial with 56 participants in an open-label, flexible-dosing prospective study. While effective as proof of concepts for the utilization of topical lidocaine in the management of PDN, both of these studies had significant limitations in that they were non-randomized, non-blinded, and did not have a control arm.

### Randomized controlled trial of a clinical decision support system for painful polyneuropathy [^111ux7s7]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the existence of guidelines, painful neuropathy is often inappropriately treated. We sought to determine the effectiveness of a clinical decision support system on guideline-recommended medication use.

Methods

We randomized neurology providers, stratified by subspecialty, to a best practice alert (BPA) linked to a Smartset or a BPA alone when seeing patients with neuropathy. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with uncontrolled nerve pain prescribed a guideline-recommended medication. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess effectiveness.

Results

Seventy-five neurology providers (intervention 38, control 37) treated 2697 patients with neuropathy (intervention 1026, control 671). Providers did not acknowledge the BPA in 1928 (71.5%) visits. Only four of eight intervention arm neurologists who treated patients with uncontrolled nerve pain opened the Smartset. The intervention was not associated with guideline-recommended medication use (odds ratio 0.52, 0.18–1.48; intervention 52%, control 54.8%).

Discussion

Our intervention did not improve prescribing practices for painful neuropathy. Physicians typically ignored the BPAs/Smartset; therefore, future studies should mandate their use or employ alternate strategies.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^1167GdV3]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain has a significant impact on patients' quality of life, as well as social, economic, and psychological well-being. Notably, it has an even larger economic burden on society as a whole when one considers the financial cost of managing it in the chronic setting. Estimates of its prevalence in the general population vary from as little as 1% to as much as 7–8%; however, when taking into account conditions such as diabetes (26%), herpes zoster/shingles (19%), and postsurgical pain (10%), the incidence is much higher. There are a number of national and international guidelines/recommendations for the assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain, yet there remains to be a consensus or agreement on the positioning of pharmacologic management (specifically opioids), neurostimulation, or targeted drug delivery. The purpose of this publication is to create a comprehensive algorithm for the treatment and management of chronic, noncancer neuropathic pain by merging the aforementioned guidelines/recommendations and integrating the currently available data from systemic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and published case reports/series (Figure 1).

### Longitudinal pattern of pain medication utilization in peripheral neuropathy patients [^114pKQAu]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

We aimed to investigate the pattern and utilization of neuropathic pain medications in peripheral neuropathy patients. Using a privately insured, health care claims database from 2001 to 2014, we identified a retrospective cohort of incident peripheral neuropathy patients (validated ICD-9 definition) after excluding other chronic pain conditions. Outcome measures included opioid prescriptions, chronic opioid therapy (greater than or equal to 90 days of continuous supply), guideline-recommended medications for painful peripheral neuropathy (serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and gabapentinoids), and pain specialists (neurologists, physiatrists, and anesthesiologists). Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations of patient-level factors with these outcomes. The peripheral neuropathy population included 14,426 individuals with a mean (SD) age of 43.1 years (2.8) and 52.4% men followed for 3.1 (1.7) years before and 4.5 (1.4) years after the diagnosis. In this population, 65.9% received ≥ 1 opioid prescription, and 8.8% received chronic opioid therapy. Of those receiving chronic opioid therapy, only 26.4% received a guideline-recommended medication before chronic opioid status. For guideline-recommended medications, 35.7% received ≥ 1, 12.4% ≥ 2, and 3.8% ≥ 3 different medications. No patient-level factors were associated with both high opioid utilization (initiation and chronic use) and low guideline-recommended medication utilization. Pain specialists were associated with high opioid utilization and high guideline-recommended medication utilization. In conclusion, opioid initiation and transition to chronic opioid therapy are frequent in a peripheral neuropathy population despite few patients receiving more than one guideline-recommended medication. Efforts to decrease opioid utilization and increase guideline-recommended medication use are needed to improve current neuropathic pain treatment.

### Nortriptyline for neuropathic pain in adults [^114QDrbb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage), usually in doses below those at which they exert antidepressant effects. An earlier review that included all antidepressants for neuropathic pain is being replaced by new reviews of individual drugs examining individual neuropathic pain conditions. Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is occasionally used for treating neuropathic pain, and is recommended in European, UK, and USA guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of nortriptyline for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 7 January 2015, and the reference lists of retrieved papers and other reviews. We also searched two clinical trials databases for ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing nortriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain. Participants were adults aged 18 years and over. We included only full journal publication articles and clinical trial summaries.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We considered the evidence using three tiers. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design); second tier evidence from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison; and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that was considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. We planned to calculate risk ratio (RR) and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) and harmful outcome (NNH) using standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six studies treating 310 participants (mean or median age 49 to 64 years) with various neuropathic pain conditions. Five studies used a cross-over design, and one used a parallel-group design; 272 participants were randomised to treatment with nortriptyline, 145 to placebo, 94 to gabapentin, 56 to gabapentin plus nortriptyline, 55 to morphine, 55 to morphine plus nortriptyline, 39 to chlorimipramine, and 33 to amitriptyline. Treatment periods lasted from three to eight weeks. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias. No study provided first or second tier evidence for any outcome. Only one study reported our primary outcome of people with at least 50% reduction in pain. There was no indication that either nortriptyline or gabapentin was more effective in postherpetic neuralgia (very low quality evidence). Two studies reported the number of people with at least moderate pain relief, and one reported the number who were satisfied with their pain relief and had tolerable adverse effects. We considered these outcomes to be equivalent to our other primary outcome of Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) much or very much improved. We could not pool data, but third tier evidence in individual studies indicated similar efficacy to other active interventions (gabapentin, morphine, chlorimipramine, and amitriptyline), and to placebo in the conditions studied (very low quality evidence). Adverse event reporting was inconsistent and fragmented. More participants reported adverse events with nortriptyline than with placebo, similar numbers with nortriptyline and other antidepressants (amitriptyline and chlorimipramine) and gabapentin, and slightly more with morphine (very low quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events or deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

We found little evidence to support the use of nortriptyline to treat the neuropathic pain conditions included in this review. There were no studies in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The studies were methodologically flawed, largely due to small size, and potentially subject to major bias. The results of this review do not support the use of nortriptyline as a first line treatment. Effective medicines with much greater supportive evidence are available, such as duloxetine and pregabalin.

### AAN position: opioids [^111ftvS8]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) position on opioid therapy for pain emphasizes limited benefit and significant risk: There is insufficient evidence that opioids are effective for the treatment of chronic pain, particularly neuropathic pain, and clear evidence that they can contribute to migraine disease progression. It may be acceptable to consider opioids for pain or other symptoms at the end of life as part of a palliative care treatment plan. However, the risks of opioid therapy for most chronic conditions outweigh the benefits, and the risks of opioid medication use should be discussed extensively with patients before prescribing opioids.

### Antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^116PdoQc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.

Objectives

To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain. Migraine and headache studies were not considered.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2003); EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2003); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 1; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Fifty trials of 19 antidepressants were considered eligible (2515 patients) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) estimates and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects.

Main Results

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline has an NNT of 2 (95%CI 1.7 to 2.5) RR 4.1(95%CI 2.9–5.9) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs (SSRIs). There were insufficient data for an assessment of evidence of effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort, venlafaxine and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95%CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4(95%CI 5.2–29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.2 (95%CI 1.7 to 3.1), RR 4.8(95%CI 2.5–9.5)(three studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm(NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 16 (95%CI: 10–45). The NNH for minor adverse effects was 4.6 (95%CI 3.3–6.7)

Authors' Conclusions

Antidepressants are effective for a variety of neuropathic pains. The best evidence available is for amitriptyline. There are only limited data for the effectiveness of SSRIs. It is not possible to identify the most effective antidepressant until more studies of SSRIs are conducted.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: a systematic review [^113NyaEt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines need to be evaluated not only for methodological quality but also for validity of their content in terms of recommendations. Thus, this study also analyzed the recommendations of these guidelines for the management of NP. In general, these recommendations were consistent on the diagnosis, assessment and pharmacological management despite scoring poorly in their rigor of development. It was difficult to tell whether we obtained these results because there was insufficient evidence to develop the guidelines or because the CPG authors did not search and make use of the best evidence available.

A large number of the drug development research has been devoted to the field of NP. A large number of analgesic agents have shown efficacy for the treatment of NP. However, no more than 40–60% of patients have obtained sufficient pain relief with medications alone and in combination. Thus, it should be noted that treatment of patients with NP should be considered an integral component of a more comprehensive approach.

In general, the guidelines for the management of NP vary considerably in terms of quality, because of the apparently low standards. To reduce the variability of the CPGs, guideline development groups should have standard methodology and strategy. Further, it would be helpful to become familiarized with the AGREE II instrument domains to know what information should be reported and how it ought to be reported in the CPGs. Here, we also give some pointers to reduce the variability among the CPGs:

1) The study should describe the specific health question it aims to address, such as prevention, screening, diagnosis, or treatment, and target population, including sex, age clinical condition, severity stage of the disease, comorbidities, and others. 2) The guideline development group should include individuals from all relevant professional groups, not only or mainly health care providers. Competing interests of guideline development group members should be fully recorded and addressed. 3) In the guideline development process, appropriate methodologies and rigorous strategies are important for successful implementation of the resulting recommendations, such as the systematic methods and criteria for selecting the evidence, methods for formulating the recommendations, health benefits, side effects considered in formulating the recommendations, links between the recommendations and the evidence. Additionally, guidelines should be externally reviewed prior to their publication, and a procedure for guideline updating should be planned and described. 4) The different options for the management of the condition or health issue should be clearly presented and the recommendations should be specific and unambiguous. 5) The views of the funding body and interests of the development group should been recorded and addressed.

### Nonopioid pharmacologic management of chronic noncancer pain [^114kcF7u]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic neuropathy, more specifically with respect to systemic therapy, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to offer gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain [^112LiBq9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Currently, no consensus on the optimal management of neuropathic pain exists and practices vary greatly worldwide. Possible explanations for this include difficulties in developing agreed diagnostic protocols and the coexistence of neuropathic, nociceptive and, occasionally, idiopathic pain in the same patient. Also, neuropathic pain has historically been classified according to its etiology (e.g., painful diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, spinal cord injury) without regard for the presumed mechanism(s) underlying the specific symptoms. A combined etiologic/mechanistic classification might improve neuropathic pain management. The treatment of neuropathic pain is largely empirical, often relying heavily on data from small, generally poorly-designed clinical trials or anecdotal evidence. Consequently, diverse treatments are used, including non-invasive drug therapies (antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs and membrane stabilizing drugs), invasive therapies (nerve blocks, ablative surgery), and alternative therapies (e.g., acupuncture). This article reviews the current and historical practices in the diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain, and focuses on the United States, Europe and Japan.

### A practical approach to peripheral autonomic neuropathies [^112q259X]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review focuses on the practical evaluation and management of patients with autonomic neuropathies.

Recent Findings

Autonomic neuropathies are complex disorders and result in diverse clinical manifestations that affect the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and sudomotor systems. The autonomic medical history is key when seeing a patient with suspected autonomic neuropathy. The history guides the clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and autonomic testing in patients with autonomic neuropathies. The treatment of autonomic neuropathies is based on the combination of disease-modifying therapies, symptomatic pharmacologic therapies, and nonpharmacological management. Response to treatment can be assessed with quantitative autonomic biomarkers.

Summary

Treatment of autonomic neuropathies should be individualized, guided by disease state, medications' mechanism of action and adverse event profile as well as cost. Genetic discoveries and pathologic understanding lead to the development of disease-modifying therapies as seen in familial amyloid polyneuropathy.

### Diabetic neuropathy: clinical manifestations and current treatments [^1111ugsB]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a prevalent, disabling disorder. The most common manifestation is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP), but many patterns of nerve injury can occur. Currently, the only effective treatments are glucose control and pain management. While glucose control substantially decreases the development of neuropathy in those with type 1 diabetes, the effect is probably much smaller in those with type 2 diabetes. Evidence supports the use of specific anticonvulsants and antidepressants for pain management in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, the lack of disease-modifying therapies for diabetic DSP makes the identification of new modifiable risk factors essential. Growing evidence supports an association between components of the metabolic syndrome, including prediabetes, and neuropathy. Studies are needed to further explore this association, which has implications for the development of new treatments for this common disorder.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^114KNuRm]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Painful DPN, a highly prevalent and disabling complication of diabetes, impacts negatively on patient function and HR-QoL and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. A variety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological options are available to treat painful DPN which may be combined as part of an individualized, comprehensive pain management plan. Healthcare providers are encouraged to increase their familiarity with the available options and to incorporate a comprehensive understanding of the clinical evidence substantiating their efficacy. In recognition of the needs of this fast-growing segment of the diabetic population, research into painful DPN has become increasingly active. Numerous studies are underway evaluating drugs with novel mechanisms of action and various noninvasive electrical stimulation devices. Beyond providing more effective pain relief, identifying disease-modifying interventions that can prevent or reverse the nerve damage associated with DPN should be a research priority. Pharmacoeconomic evaluations should be conducted to determine whether the enormous healthcare burden associated with painful DPN might be mitigated to some extent through the use of modern treatments with greater efficacy and improved tolerability relative to conventional oral agents, despite their higher acquisition costs.

### Gastric cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1139aXp5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Gastric Cancer Version 3.2025 — survivorship symptom management — common issues include weight loss, diarrhea, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and fatigue. Weight loss and fatigue can be effectively managed by monitoring patients' weight regularly, encouraging more frequent consumption of smaller meals without fluid intake, and encouraging physical activity and energy conservation measures. Anti-diarrheal medications, bulk-forming agents, or diet manipulation can be considered to treat diarrhea. Duloxetine can be considered to treat painful chemotherapy-induced neuropathy but is ineffective for numbness or tingling, and referral to occupational, rehabilitation, and/or physical therapy should be considered for patients with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy who are at risk for falls. Osteopenia/osteoporosis caused by deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and other vitamins and minerals is another common long-term sequelae; supplementation with vitamin D has been shown to improve bone health, and bone density should be screened at regular intervals with low bone density managed as per established national guidelines.

### Antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^111DENQb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2005 of The Cochrane Library. For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.

Objectives

To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 2005); EMBASE (1980 to Oct 2005); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.

Selection Criteria

RCTs reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Sixty one trials of 20 antidepressants were considered eligible (3293 participants) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects. This update includes 11 additional studies (778 participants).

Main Results

Sixty one RCTs were included in total. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective and have an NNT of 3.6 (95% CI 3 to 4.5) RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer SSRIs but no studies of SNRIs were found. Venlafaxine (three studies) has an NNT of 3.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.1) RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.1). There were insufficient data to assess effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4 (95% CI 5.2 to 29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.7 (95% CI 2 to 4.1), RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.1) (four studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm (NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 28 (95% CI 17.6 to 68.9) for amitriptyline and 16.2 (95% CI 8 to 436) for venlafaxine. The NNH for minor adverse effects was 6 (95% CI 4.2 to 10.7) for amitriptyline and 9.6 (95% CI 3.5 to 13) for venlafaxine.

Authors' Conclusions

This update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs. SSRIs are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required.

### Clinical manifestations and current treatment options for diabetic neuropathies [^116jApUR]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical manifestations and current treatment options for diabetic neuropathies, one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We performed a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature using a combination of words (diabetic neuropathy, diabetic autonomic neuropathy, diagnosis and treatment) to identify original studies, consensus statements, and reviews on diabetic neuropathies published in the past 25 years. Emphasis was placed on clinical manifestations of distal polyneuropathy and its treatment, especially new therapies.

Results

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common form of diabetic neuropathy, usually involves small and large nerve fibers. Small-nerve fiber neuropathy often presents with pain and loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers, but without objective signs or electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage. This type of neuropathy is a component of impaired glucose tolerance and the metabolic syndrome. The greatest risk from small-fiber neuropathy is foot ulceration and subsequent gangrene and amputation. Large-nerve fiber neuropathy produces numbness, ataxia, and incoordination, thus impairing activities of daily living and causing falls and fractures. Successfully treating diabetic neuropathy requires addressing the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, treating symptoms to improve quality of life, and preventing progression and complications of diabetes mellitus. Two new drugs, duloxetine hydrochloride and pregabalin, have recently been approved for treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetes mellitus.

Conclusion

Symptomatic therapy has become available and newer and better treatment modalities, based on etiologic factors, are being explored with potential for clinically significant reduction of morbidity and mortality. Preventive strategies and patient and physician education still remain key factors in reducing complication rates and mortality.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^111NK1fd]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this review was to merge current treatment guidelines and best practice recommendations for management of neuropathic pain into a comprehensive algorithm for primary physicians. The algorithm covers assessment, multidisciplinary conservative care, nonopioid pharmacological management, interventional therapies, neurostimulation, low-dose opioid treatment, and targeted drug delivery therapy.

Methods

Available literature was identified through a search of the US National Library of Medicine's Medline database, PubMed.gov. References from identified published articles also were reviewed for relevant citations.

Results

The algorithm provides a comprehensive treatment pathway from assessment to the provision of first- through sixth-line therapies for primary care physicians. Clear indicators for progression of therapy from firstline to sixth-line are provided. Multidisciplinary conservative care and nonopioid medications (tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentanoids, topicals, and transdermal substances) are recommended as firstline therapy; combination therapy (firstline medications) and tramadol and tapentadol are recommended as secondline; serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors/anticonvulsants/NMDA antagonists and interventional therapies as third-line; neurostimulation as a fourth-line treatment; low-dose opioids (no greater than 90 morphine equivalent units) are fifth-line; and finally, targeted drug delivery is the last-line therapy for patients with refractory pain.

Conclusions

The presented treatment algorithm provides clear-cut tools for the assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain based on international guidelines, published data, and best practice recommendations. It defines the benefits and limitations of the current treatments at our disposal. Additionally, it provides an easy-to-follow visual guide of the recommended steps in the algorithm for primary care and family practitioners to utilize.

### Routine prescribing of gabapentin or pregabalin in supportive and palliative care: what are the comparative performances of the medications in a palliative care population? [^113TrqXB]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a prevalent and distressing problem faced by people with life-limiting illness that is often difficult to palliate. Gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed as part of the routine approach to palliating neuropathic pain. Although they are often viewed as interchangeable agents, very little comparative data of their benefits and harms exists in clinical practice. Two previously reported pharmacovigilance studies that had used the same methodology for gabapentin and pregabalin were compared. These studies examined the benefits and harms of gabapentin and pregabalin after the medications had been routinely prescribed by clinicians working in a network of palliative care services using the same data collection tools with the same definitions and the same time points. Data were collected over 21 days from 282 patients prescribed either gabapentin or pregabalin for pain. Items included medication doses, pain scores, and adverse effects. In order to compare the medication responses, the final doses of pregabalin were converted to gabapentin does equivalents using previously published recommendations. The final pain scores were similar for both groups, and the reduction in pain were similar (OR = 11.2; 95% CI 3.9, 32.7, p < 0.001). However, this was achieved at lower doses of gabapentin compared to pregabalin. Those receiving gabapentin were more likely to experience harms (OR = 3.5; 95% CI 1.4, 9.1, p = 0.009) with the reported harms including somnolence, ataxia, nausea, tremor and nystagmus This hypothesis-generating work strongly supports the need for further trials to best delineate clinical differences in the GABA analogues.

Specific treatment options

The following sections present first-line treatments, B, C and D options, and "advise against use" recommendations made by the WG. Within each category, the information is organized as follows:
New recommendations: Any new recommendations for the 2021 CPG are listed first, with clinical considerations that provide context for these recommendations immediately following the recommendation (listed as "2021 Clinical Considerations").
Existing recommendations: Unchanged recommendations from the 2016 CPG are listed under this heading. "Clinical Considerations" accompanying each recommendation were included in the 2016 CPG to provide additional context and relevant clinical information. These "Clinical Considerations" are provided in this update as they appeared in 2016 ("2016 Clinical Considerations"). Additional context relating to any newly identified studies are provided in the section "2021 Update". Although the WG did not formally evaluate effects on pain interference, these outcomes were discussed if those outcomes were available in the literature. Effects on pain interference are noted in the "2021 Update" section as appropriate, as they were not specifically included in the 2016 version.

First-line treatments

First-line treatments have a high GRADE of evidence and a strong recommendation from the panel.

New recommendations

No new first-line treatment recommendations were proposed.

Existing recommendations

2016 clinical considerations

Pregabalin is recommended as the first choice of first-line medications, as it has the strongest evidence of any treatment modality in below-level NP: all studies demonstrate a significant reduction in pain intensity. Pregabalin studies used larger sample sizes than most treatment studies for SCI-related NP and rigorous methodology. Two high-quality randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) and one moderate-quality placebo-controlled RCT, which was downgraded based on wide confidence intervals around numbers needed to treat, comprise the evidence base for pregabalin. When defining successful treatment of individual patients as a 50% reduction in pain level, the NNT for these 3 trials was 7.1, 7.0, and 3.3. All studies focused on NP and measured pain intensity. One trial studied a mixed population that included stroke patients (n = 19), but a subgroup analysis was performed for the group with SCI. A pharmaceutical company funded two pregabalin RCTs. Pregabalin studies used flexible dosing between 150 and 600 mg/day. Adverse effects include somnolence, dizziness, and edema which were usually of mild-to-moderate intensity and transient.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^114ys2rZ]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current Danish treatment algorithms for pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain (NeP) are tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), gabapentin and pregabalin as first-line treatment for the most common NeP conditions. Many patients have insufficient pain relief on monotherapy, but combination therapy had not been included in guidelines until recently. Based on clinical empiricism and scientific evidence, a Delphi consensus process provided a consolidated guidance on pharmacological combination treatment of NeP.

Methods

A two-round virtual internet-based Delphi process with 6 Danish pain specialists was undertaken. In the first round, questions were answered individually and anonymously, whereas in the second round, the panel openly discussed first round's summary of outcomes. Combinations of pharmacological pain treatments, that is, pregabalin/gabapentin, TCAs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, opioids, other antiepileptics and cutaneous patches, were assessed based on both scientific and clinical practice experiences. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grading system was used for evidence rating.

Results

Combination of pregabalin/gabapentin with TCA is useful in patients who do not gain sufficient pain relief or tolerate either drug in high doses, or to improve sleep disturbance. Also, combination of pregabalin/gabapentin and SNRIs is reasonably well documented and experienced by some experts to result in sufficient pain relief and fewer side effects than monotherapy. Good evidence on efficacy was found for the combination of pregabalin/gabapentin or TCAs and opioids, which was also frequently used in clinical practice. The evidence for combining TCAs and SNRIs is insufficient, although sometimes used in clinical practice despite the risk of serotonin syndrome. For localized NeP, combination therapy with cutaneous patches should be considered. There was insufficient scientific evidence for any pharmacologic combination therapies with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - as well as for other potential combinations.

Conclusions

The study revealed that combination therapy is widely used in clinical practice and supported by some scientific evidence. However, further studies are needed.

### Are gabapentinoids effective at reducing pain and improving sleep after nerve injury? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114bnGDR]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Gabapentinoids are increasingly prescribed off-label to reduce the intensity of peripheral nerve injury-related pain and improve sleep. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing gabapentinoids to placebo show differing results, and the crossover design used in some of these trials carries a significant risk of unblinding. Considering that side effects of gabapentinoids are common and misuse is increasing, we pooled the blinded data to provide the best available evidence on the efficacy of gabapentinoids compared with placebo.

Questions/Purposes

In this meta-analysis of RCTs of patients with peripheral nerve injuries, we asked: Are gabapentinoids superior to placebo in terms of (1) pain reduction or (2) mitigating sleep disruption?

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for RCTs from January 2000 up to January 2022. Only studies reporting on nerve injuries, measuring pain intensity with a VAS or numeric rating scale, were included. Our search yielded 1862 articles: 1218 from Embase, 559 from PubMed, and 85 from the Cochrane Library. We excluded 338 duplicate studies, leaving 1524 remaining studies. After an initial title and abstract screen, we excluded an additional 1512 studies. In all, 12 full texts were analyzed, and 4 studies were included in our meta-analysis, which involved 919 total patients: 402 were treated with either gabapentin or pregabalin, 394 with placebo, and 123 with both in two crossover trials. In the 3 of 4 studies wherein gender distribution of the patient populations was specified, women represented 57% (143 of 250) and 47% (118 of 250) of the patients in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. The mean ± SD age was 52 ± 13 years for both the treatment and placebo groups. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and was low for all included studies. We addressed the high risk of unblinding in the crossover trials by excluding the after crossover (unblinded) results. Certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was moderate. All included studies lacked an objective consensus reference test to diagnose peripheral nerve injury, therefore leading to indirectness of available results.

Results

Gabapentinoids did not reduce pain compared with placebo at 1 month (-0.21 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.72 to 0.29]; p = 0.40) nor at 2 to 4 months (-0.38 [95% CI -0.76 to 0.00]; p = 0.05) after treatment. Additionally, gabapentinoids showed no clinically important difference in sleep interference compared with placebo at 2 to 4 months (-0.56 [95% CI -0.91 to -0.22]; p < 0.01), with a minimum clinically important difference of -1.5.

Conclusion

The best available evidence, now consisting of four RCTs, suggests that gabapentinoids should not be used to reduce pain intensity or sleep disruption in patients with peripheral nerve injuries, especially given their substantial side effects and potential for misuse.

Level Of Evidence

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^1111c843]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Another medication that has been shown to be efficacious for treating particular conditions with neuropathic pain, such as CSPN, is mexiletine, a class Ib antiarrhythmic oral medication. Unfortunately, its side effect profile makes it intolerable for many patients and due to this, mexiletine has previously carried a strong recommendation against its use in treatment of neuropathic pain more broadly but may have use in limited instances, such as CSPN.

Other forms of treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain include topical agents, namely, capsaicin and lidocaine patches. Capsaicin is derived from chili peppers. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is thought to cause an analgesic effect through desensitization of the TRPV1 receptor which can diminish the amount of substance P in nerve fibers leading to pain relief. Capsaicin is typically applied either in the high concentration form of capsaicin patches (8%) or in the low concentration form of capsaicin cream (< 1%). Capsaicin 8% patches have a weak recommendation for use as a second line agent specifically in peripheral neuropathic pain. Guidelines suggest using one to four patches on the painful area for 30–60 min in a single session which can be repeated every 3 months as needed. Capsaicin cream on the other hand, has less research supporting its use and thus is categorized with an inconclusive recommendation via the current guidelines. Common side effects of capsaicin include pain, erythema, rash, and itching. Lidocaine patches also have a weak recommendation for use as a second line agent in peripheral neuropathic pain. Topical lidocaine is absorbed into the skin and diffuses across the neural sheath where it binds to sodium channels which inhibits depolarization. The recommendation for use in peripheral neuropathic pain is one to three patches applied to the skin around the painful area once a day for up to 12 h. Common side effects include erythema, itching, and rash.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^112ZuKik]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is among the most common complications of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), in the United States (US), approximately 37 million individuals have diabetes, predominantly (90–95%) T2D, with an additional 96 million adults having prediabetes. An estimated 50% of diabetic patients and 10‒30% of prediabetic patients will develop neuropathy. Neuropathy is accompanied by pain in approximately 20–40% of afflicted patients, many of whom continue to have unresolved pain even with treatment. Diabetic neuropathic pain is associated with a high prevalence of anxiety, depression and sleep disorders which can amplify the disease burden and increase the complexity of management, particularly with respect to treatment selection and potential for drug–drug interactions (DDIs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the presence of polypharmacy.

Major risk factors for DPN are hyperglycemia in T1D and metabolic syndrome in T2D. Although glycemic control helps to prevent DPN in patients with T1D, it provides modest or no benefits in preventing DPN in patients with T2D, likely due to the presence of co-morbidities. The development of painful DPN has been associated with numerous factors including poorly controlled glucose levels, worsening glucose tolerance, T2D (relative to T1D), insulin resistance, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, advanced age and duration of diabetes, diabetic vessel disease, abdominal obesity, hypertension, elevated triglyceride levels, and low high-density lipoprotein levels.

Typically, DPN presents initially as distal neuropathy without pain in the feet, followed by a gradual and symmetric progression of predominantly sensory symptoms including, paradoxically, numbness with exquisite sensitivity, allodynia and hyperalgesia. Neuropathy symptoms arise from damage to the peripheral sensory nerves, accompanied by a gradual decrease in epidermal nerve fiber density, resulting in a worsening of sensory loss and an increase in responsiveness to painful stimuli. The pathophysiological processes involved in the development of painful DPN are complex and appear to involve sustained hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and altered insulin signaling. These lead to several possible pathological alterations (eg, DNA and macrophage activation damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and loss of neurotrophic signaling) in neurons and other cells critical to normal functioning. Disruptions to the intracellular processes of neurons, some of which are directly related to the effects of the metabolic syndrome, may lead to nerve dysfunction and, ultimately, neuropathy.

### Trends in pain medication initiation among patients with newly diagnosed diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 2014–2018 [^1158w9w6]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects approximately half of people living with diabetes. Approximately half of patients with DPN have painresulting in debility, disability, and impaired quality of life. Clinical guidelines recommend use of anticonvulsants, antidepressants (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), or topical analgesics for painful DPN owing to their demonstrated efficacy and safety in this context. To promote safe and evidence-based pain management, we examined initiation of pain medication among adults with newly diagnosed DPN.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: a systematic review [^113NRWmG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The management of neuropathic pain (NP) is challenging despite it being the recent focus of extensive research. A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of NP have been published worldwide over the past 2 decades. This study aimed to assess the quality of these CPGs.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of published CPGs for the management of NP. Three reviewers independently assessed the quality of the CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument, and recommendations of CPGs were also appraised.

Results

A total of 16 CPGs were included. Thirteen CPGs were developed using an evidence-based approach, and the remaining CPGs were produced by consensus panels. None of CPGs obtained a score greater than 50% in all six AGREE II instrument domains mainly owing to poor performance in the "Applicability" domain. The highest score of the CPGs was achieved in "Clarity and Presentation" domain, followed by "Scope and Purpose" and "Editorial Independence" domains, and the lowest scores were found the in "Applicability" domain. The majority of the CPG recommendations on the management of patients with NP were relatively consistent, especially regarding the recommendation of stepwise treatment with medication.

Conclusions

Greater efforts are needed not only to improve the quality of development and presentation of the CPGs, but also to provide more efficacy evidence for the management of patients with NP.

### Update on treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a review of current US guidelines with a focus on the most recently approved management options [^112MXFZq]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

FDA-Approved Treatments for Painful DPN

Five treatments are currently approved by the FDA to treat painful DPN based on their efficacy and safety in RCTs in this patient population. These include three oral medications (duloxetine, pregabalin, and tapentadol extended release [ER]); one topical agent (capsaicin 8% topical system); and low- and high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices indicated for the treatment of chronic intractable painful DPN, which is defined as constant moderate to severe pain that has no known cure and requires daily medical treatment.

Table 2 summarizes the year of approval, indication, contraindications, and most common adverse events reported with the use of FDA-approved options to treat DPN. Although pain-related endpoints among RCTs differed to some extent, all treatments were associated with significant improvements from baseline in pain scores relative to placebo or standard therapy, as well as increases in the proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful pain response (ie, a ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% improvement in pain score).

Table 2
Current FDA-Approved Options for the Management of Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (Trade name; Year of FDA Approval for Painful DPN)

In reverse chronological order of their FDA approval, the efficacy and safety of these treatments in their pivotal RCTs are examined, with emphasis on the two most recently approved options (ie, SCS devices and the capsaicin 8% topical system).

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: mechanisms and therapeutic avenues [^115etVj5]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a serious and often persistent adverse consequence of certain chemotherapeutic agents. It is a major dose-limiting factor of many first-line chemotherapies, affecting 20–50% of patients at standard doses and nearly all patients at high doses. As cancer survivorship continues to increase with improvements in early diagnosis and treatment, more patients will experience CIPN despite completing cancer treatment, which interferes with recovery, leading to chronic pain and worsening quality of life. The National Cancer Institute has identified CIPN as a priority in translational research. To date, there are no FDA-approved drugs for preventing or treating CIPN, with emerging debate on mechanisms and promising new targets. This review highlights current literature and suggests novel approaches to CIPN based on proposed mechanisms of action that aim either to confer neuroprotection against chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity or reverse the downstream effects of painful neuropathy.

### Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults [^1117j81k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage) and fibromyalgia, and is recommended in many guidelines. These types of pain can be treated with antidepressant drugs in doses below those at which the drugs act as antidepressants.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. To assess the adverse events associated with the clinical use of amitriptyline for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to September 2012, together with reference lists of retrieved papers, previous systematic reviews, and other reviews; we also used our own handsearched database for older studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least four weeks' duration comparing amitriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and two study authors examined issues of study quality independently. We performed analysis using two tiers of evidence. The first tier used data meeting current best standards, where studies reported the outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction over baseline (or its equivalent), without the use of last observation carried forward (LOCF) or other imputation method for dropouts, reported an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, lasted 8 to 12 weeks or longer, had a parallel-group design, and where there were at least 200 participants in the comparison. The second tier used data that failed to meet this standard and were therefore subject to potential bias.

Main Results

Twenty-one studies (1437 participants) were included; they individually involved between 15 and 235 participants, only four involved over 100 participants, and the median study size was 44 participants. The median duration was six weeks. Ten studies had a cross-over design. Doses of amitriptyline were generally between 25 mg and 125 mg, and dose escalation was common. There was no top-tier evidence for amitriptyline in treating neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. Second-tier evidence indicated no evidence of effect in cancer-related neuropathic pain or HIV-related neuropathic pain, but some evidence of effect in painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), mixed neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia. Combining the classic neuropathic pain conditions of PDN, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and post-stroke pain with fibromyalgia for second-tier evidence, in eight studies and 687 participants, there was a statistically significant benefit (risk ratio (RR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8 to 3.1) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4.6 (3.6 to 6.6). The analysis showed that even using this potentially biased data, only about 38% of participants benefited with amitriptyline and 16% with placebo; most participants did not get adequate pain relief. Potential benefits of amitriptyline were supported by a lower rate of lack of efficacy withdrawals; 8/153 (5%) withdrew because of lack of efficacy with amitriptyline and 14/119 (12%) with placebo. More participants experienced at least one adverse event; 64% of participants taking amitriptyline and 40% taking placebo. The RR was 1.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.7) and the number needed to treat to harm was 4.1 (95% CI 3.2 to 5.7). Adverse event and all-cause withdrawals were not different.

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline has been a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain for many years. The fact that there is no supportive unbiased evidence for a beneficial effect is disappointing, but has to be balanced against decades of successful treatment in many patients with neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. There is no good evidence of a lack of effect; rather our concern should be of overestimation of treatment effect. Amitriptyline should continue to be used as part of the treatment of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, but only a minority of patients will achieve satisfactory pain relief. Limited information suggests that failure with one antidepressant does not mean failure with all. It is unlikely that any large randomised trials of amitriptyline will be conducted in specific neuropathic pain conditions or in fibromyalgia to prove efficacy.

### Topical analgesics for neuropathic pain: an evidence-informed guide for the practicing clinician [^112wq7BA]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate available evidence regarding efficacy and safety of topical analgesics for neuropathic pain and offer treatment guidance.

Methods

An expert panel searched PubMed (Medline) and reference lists of published articles for available literature assessing 8 categories of topical analgesics used to treat various neuropathic pain conditions. The panel rated the level of analgesic efficacy evidence for each treatment and considered safety, ease of use, and cost. Degree of consensus among panelists regarding recommendations was measured.

Results

There was strong evidence and high consensus that capsaicin 8% is effective for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, and lidocaine is effective for postherpetic neuralgia. There was strong evidence and moderate consensus that capsaicin 8% may be effective for HIV-induced neuropathy. There was moderate evidence and high consensus that lidocaine is likely effective for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, idiopathic neuropathy, and post-surgical neuropathy and that capsaicin 8% may be effective for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome. Evidence was weak for other topical medications, though the panel strongly agreed that antidepressants may help with postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, post-surgical neuropathy, and post-traumatic neuropathy; that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help with post-surgical neuropathy; and that gabapentin may benefit vulvodynia. There was less agreement whether antidepressants may benefit diabetic peripheral neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and vulvodynia and whether capsaicin 8% could be effective for post-surgical neuropathy.

Conclusions

Recommendations were based on a survey and grading of existing literature and, when strong evidence was lacking, the collective clinical expertise of panelists.

### An integrated perspective on diabetic, alcoholic, and drug-induced neuropathy, etiology, and treatment in the US [^114PoFWR]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain (NeuP) arises from aberrant or incomplete regeneration of damaged nerves, and is characterized by hyperalgesia and allodynia, enhanced sensitivity to pain, and exaggerated pain response to normal stimuli. The prevalence of NeuP varies around the world, but has been cited as at a minimum of 3%,–and true prevalence has been estimated to be around 7%–10%. The incidence of NeuP also varies by type, as categorized by the mechanism of injury: diabetic neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, and medication-induced neuropathy. A concerning trend in the US is the rise in diagnosis of neuropathies caused by type 2 diabetes. This may in part be fueled by increased health care costs hampering proper management of diabetes. Alcoholic neuropathy in the US occurs in roughly 65% of patients diagnosed with an alcohol-use disorder. Anticancer medications, especially taxanes, are also known to cause neuropathy. A study found that 100% of patients receiving paclitaxel developed symptoms of neuropathy. On a clinical level, NeuP translates to a complex syndrome that is often multidrug-resistant and unresponsive to alternative therapies. Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians understand the etiology of NeuP and the mechanism and effectiveness of the current repertoire of treatments.

Significance and limitations

In this integrative review, an internal medicine physician and preclinical behavioral pharmacologist summarize differences and overlap in etiologies and treatment options for NeuP. This review focuses on three of the most common neuropathies – diabetic, alcohol-induced, and drug-induced neuropathy – describes the specific nerve fibers associated with each neuropathy, and lists recommended treatment options for NeuP. The review is purposely succinct, aimed at providing clinicians with insight into the etiology of NeuP and educating preclinical scientists on the diagnosis and choice of treatment for NeuP. The review favors conciseness over an extensive in-depth analysis of the available literature, thus limiting its scope.

### Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain in adults [^113ymtNU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 12, 2012. That review considered both fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, but the effects of amitriptyline for fibromyalgia are now dealt with in a separate review. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). It is recommended as a first line treatment in many guidelines. Neuropathic pain can be treated with antidepressant drugs in doses below those at which the drugs act as antidepressants.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline for relief of chronic neuropathic pain, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to March 2015, together with two clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of retrieved papers, previous systematic reviews, and other reviews; we also used our own hand searched database for older studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least four weeks' duration comparing amitriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design), second tier from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison, and third tier from data involving small numbers of participants that were considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both.

Main Results

We included 15 studies from the earlier review and two new studies (17 studies, 1342 participants) in seven neuropathic pain conditions. Eight cross-over studies with 302 participants had a median of 36 participants, and nine parallel group studies with 1040 participants had a median of 84 participants. Study quality was modest, though most studies were at high risk of bias due to small size. There was no first-tier or second-tier evidence for amitriptyline in treating any neuropathic pain condition. Only third-tier evidence was available. For only two of seven studies reporting useful efficacy data was amitriptyline significantly better than placebo (very low quality evidence). More participants experienced at least one adverse event; 55% of participants taking amitriptyline and 36% taking placebo. The risk ratio (RR) was 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 1.8) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome was 5.2 (3.6 to 9.1) (low quality evidence). Serious adverse events were rare. Adverse event and all-cause withdrawals were not different, but were rarely reported (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline has been a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain for many years. The fact that there is no supportive unbiased evidence for a beneficial effect is disappointing, but has to be balanced against decades of successful treatment in many people with neuropathic pain. There is no good evidence of a lack of effect; rather our concern should be of overestimation of treatment effect. Amitriptyline should continue to be used as part of the treatment of neuropathic pain, but only a minority of people will achieve satisfactory pain relief. Limited information suggests that failure with one antidepressant does not mean failure with all.

### Steering peripheral neuropathy workup [^113qo7sT]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Learning to recognize the various clinical and electrodiagnostic patterns of peripheral neuropathy enables a targeted approach to etiologic investigation, and subsequently guides patient discussions of self-management, disease course, and prognosis. Moreover, as advancements in neuropathology and pharmacotherapy inform the many etiologies of polyneuropathy, it is imperative for clinicians to identify the underlying etiology to appropriately guide treatment options and prevent complications.

### Diabetic neuropathy collection: treatment of diabetic neuropathy [^117M5HAm]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

VG: Can non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) be used for painful diabetic neuropathy?

UA: NSAIDs is relatively ineffective for chronic painful diabetic neuropathy, so they do not form a part of the treatment guidelines.

VG: And what about opioids? Is morphine helpful?

UA: Well, we have to think about opioid class within the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy as two separate areas. The first one is what I call "opioid plus" medication; when I mean opioid plus these are medications that have an opioid effect plus an SNRI effect as well. Now there's two of these medications which can be very helpful: tramadol, which is a weak opioid and has a greater SNRI effect can certainly be used for breakthrough pain and I do tend to use this personally myself for people with breakthrough pain. Now there is a slight caution in people who are already on duloxetine as it can lower the seizure threshold [and serotonin syndrome] and there is a caution with the use of both of these in tandem [concurrently]. The other opioid of the opioid plus category, as I call it, is tapentadol, which is a strong opioid but has a weaker SNRI effect. Now both of these can be relatively effective in treating painful neuropathic symptoms. Morphine itself is of little benefit; the standard opioid medication does not have a great effect with painful diabetic neuropathy. There have been some studies of oxycodone but again it certainly doesn't form a part of the first- or second-line therapy that we should be using as third-line therapy is generally reserved as tramadol in some of the international guidelines.

### Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115S7auQ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

New drug treatments, clinical trials, and standards of quality for assessment of evidence justify an update of evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), we revised the Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain based on the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Between April, 2013, and January, 2014, NeuPSIG of the International Association for the Study of Pain did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind studies of oral and topical pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain, including studies published in peer-reviewed journals since January, 1966, and unpublished trials retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov and websites of pharmaceutical companies. We used number needed to treat (NNT) for 50% pain relief as a primary measure and assessed publication bias; NNT was calculated with the fixed-effects Mantel-Haenszel method.

Findings

229 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Analysis of publication bias suggested a 10% overstatement of treatment effects. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals reported greater effects than did unpublished studies (r(2) 9·3%, p = 0·009). Trial outcomes were generally modest: in particular, combined NNTs were 6·4 (95% CI 5·2–8·4) for serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, mainly including duloxetine (nine of 14 studies); 7·7 (6·5–9·4) for pregabalin; 7·2 (5·9–9·21) for gabapentin, including gabapentin extended release and enacarbil; and 10·6 (7·4–19·0) for capsaicin high-concentration patches. NNTs were lower for tricyclic antidepressants, strong opioids, tramadol, and botulinum toxin A, and undetermined for lidocaine patches. Based on GRADE, final quality of evidence was moderate or high for all treatments apart from lidocaine patches; tolerability and safety, and values and preferences were higher for topical drugs; and cost was lower for tricyclic antidepressants and tramadol. These findings permitted a strong recommendation for use and proposal as first-line treatment in neuropathic pain for tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, pregabalin, and gabapentin; a weak recommendation for use and proposal as second line for lidocaine patches, capsaicin high-concentration patches, and tramadol; and a weak recommendation for use and proposal as third line for strong opioids and botulinum toxin A. Topical agents and botulinum toxin A are recommended for peripheral neuropathic pain only.

Interpretation

Our results support a revision of the NeuPSIG recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain. Inadequate response to drug treatments constitutes a substantial unmet need in patients with neuropathic pain. Modest efficacy, large placebo responses, heterogeneous diagnostic criteria, and poor phenotypic profiling probably account for moderate trial outcomes and should be taken into account in future studies.

Guidelines for Managing Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN)

The management of painful DPN involves controlling the underlying diabetic condition and symptomatically treating the associated pain, as recommended in multiple clinical practice guidelines and expert reviews. Given their influence and importance in determining recommendations in other relevant expert opinions and reviews, we have focused on evidence-based guidelines and recommended treatment algorithms from the following US organizations:
American Academy of Neurology (AAN): Published in December 2021, the Oral and Topical Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: Practice Guideline Update Summaryprovides updated recommendations on the treatment of painful DPN. Graded recommendations for the use of numerous drug classes and individual agents are based on a systematic and statistical analysis of the results of 133 relevant peer-reviewed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).
American Diabetes Association (ADA): Three publications guiding the treatment of painful DPN are available from the ADA. Diabetic Neuropathy: A Position Statementwas published in 2017 and provides graded recommendations on all aspects of DPN management — including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment — based on several technical reviews and associated supporting references. The clinical compendium on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathyand Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes‒2022, were published in 2022. The clinical compendium focuses on the screening, diagnosis and treatment of painful DPN in routine clinical practice, and summarizes the latest guidance on effective therapies, including pharmacological agents, nutraceutical products, and non-pharmacological therapies. Guidance on treating painful DPN is also provided in Chapter 12: Retinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Careof the updated Standard of Medical Care in Diabetes ‒2022.
American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE). Published in 2022, the AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan‒2022 Updateprovides graded recommendations for the care of diabetic patients, including diagnosis and management of DPN, based on a comprehensive search and appraisal of the current literature.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^113wtJ85]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Painful diabetic polyneuropathy (PDN) — research needs are highlighted, noting key gaps that should be addressed in future studies, including that few studies have investigated the effect of interventions on quality of life, patient functioning, mood, or sleep and few comparative effectiveness studies have been performed; studies with an active comparator have rarely included more than one other intervention, limiting data to support one intervention over another. Another limitation to the current evidence is the lack of data beyond 16 weeks for any intervention, and future studies should focus on the long-term effects (positive and negative) of opioids in this population to determine whether there is any role for these medications in this population.

Medication-induced neuropathy

Disulfiram is not unique in causing NeuP; in fact, many and more commonly prescribed drugs, which span the spectrum of chemotherapy to cardiovascular medications, are known to induce neuropathy. This section focuses on taxanes, with mention of statin-induced neuropathy. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are antineoplastic taxanes used to treat numerous types of solid tumors, including ovarian, breast, lung, and head and neck malignancies. Paclitaxel has its chemotherapeutic effect by promoting microtubule assembly in a disorganized manner, thereby prohibiting mitotic division. It is by this very same mechanism that paclitaxel causes peripheral neuropathy, one of the most common and limiting side effects of the drug. In vivo studies have demonstrated that paclitaxel causes abnormal microtubule accumulation, leading to demyelination, and inhibits the regenerative capacities of neurons. In a non-dose-dependent manner, paclitaxel causes hyperalgesia and allodynia without affecting motor performance. Clinically, patients have complained of sensory neuropathy and decreased vibration and proprioception, indicating that both small C and Aδ fibers are affected (Figure 1).–One of the original articles on paclitaxel-induced neuropathy studied paclitaxel infusion at three doses, and found that neuropathy developed in > 80% of the patients at all doses and was dose-limiting in 70% of patients at the highest dose.

It is noteworthy that diabetes is a predisposition to drug-induced neuropathy. In a retrospective study comparing the rates of taxane-induced neuropathy, chronic diabetics (defined by > 5 years) developed neuropathy more frequently compared to nondiabetics. With regard to treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, SNRIs have been shown to be superior to placebo. These drugs are also used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Together, these data suggest that taxanes and diabetes act differently but synergistically in causing peripheral nerve damage and NeuP.

Statins are prescribed to > 40 million patients in the US alone, and are frequently prescribed to diabetics to reduce their cardiovascular risk. It is interesting to note that there have been reports of statin-induced peripheral neuropathy. Though statins are demonstrated to have pleiotropic effects, preclinical studies suggest that they can attenuate NeuP by potentiating antioxidation. Promising data have also been found in human studies where rosuvastatin improved both the intensity of diabetic neuropathy pain and nerve conduction. In combination with the rarity of statin-induced neuropathy, these data suggest that this potential side effect of statin should minimally influence the physician's decision to prescribe statins for vascular protection.

### Neuropathic pain in the community: more under-treated than refractory? [^111Ug4gd]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

We have been conservative in our approach to identifying those individuals who had an "adequate trial" of a neuropathic pain medication. It was apparent that, on some occasions, these drugs were not prescribed for chronic possible neuropathic pain, for example, opioids, tramadol, and morphine, where respondents indicated that they had taken these drugs for an acute episode of pain, for example, postsurgical. These were appropriately excluded from criteria for an adequate trial. Conversely, a number of individuals indicated that they had taken neuropathic pain medication "in the past", but did not specify the length of time these were prescribed/taken for; again, we excluded these people from the "adequate trial" criteria. It is possible this may have resulted in misclassification. We did not ask about dosage of the neuropathic pain medications, as this was felt to be too onerous for respondents, possibly further diminishing the response rate, and unlikely to be accurately reported. Future research, with more detailed drug history, is required to explore this. Levels of prescribing in studies in general practice settings is generally low in patients with presumed neuropathic pain(identified by screening questionnaires, such as the S-LANSS and DN4) and in patients with specific neuropathic pain diagnoses, such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In our study, three quarters of respondents with "Possible neuropathic pain" (S-LANSS positive and relevant history) had consulted their GP regarding their pain in the previous 6 months, suggesting that opportunities to improve management and treatment may have been missed. This is likely to be for a combination of reasons, including education and resources. Recent guidelines describe the full range of drug treatments availableand, in the UK, evidence-based guidelines focus on primary care/nonspecialist settings. This work highlights the scale of under- or untreated neuropathic pain, and the opportunity to improve its management in primary care, where the great majority of these pain patients exist.

### Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: diagnosis, agents, general clinical presentation, and treatments [^113W8dyV]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to discuss pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation, and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Agent-specific presentation and pathophysiology is also being discussed.

Recent Findings

As new systemic oncological treatments continue to be developed, the number of cancer survivors continues to grow. Survivors are living longer with the long-term side effects of oncological treatments. We reviewed the pathophysiology of agent-specific chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and the updates in its treatment and preventative tools. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating long-term side effect that often impairs cancer survivors' function and quality of life. The increasing life expectancy of cancer survivors has resulted in increased prevalence of this condition. Understanding its intricacies can provide physicians with better treatment tools and research opportunities to develop or identify new therapeutic agents.

### Suboptimal treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in the United States [^116cXa89]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Approximately one third of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) also experience neuropathic pain, resulting in a significant health care burden, and reduced quality of life. Pregabalin, duloxetine, and tapentadol extended-release are approved for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP), but many other medications are commonly used "off-label" with various degrees of success. We examined US health insurance claims to determine the current DPNP treatment patterns.

Methods

This retrospective analysis used the MarketScan claims database to identify adults with continuous health plan enrollment for 12 months pre- and postindex who were initially diagnosed with DPN between 2006 and 2011 and were provided a prescription for a medication reported to be beneficial for treating DPNP (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, opioids, or topical agents). We evaluated the frequency and types of medication dispensed within 1 year after first diagnosis, treatment adherence, and patterns of treatment alteration.

Results

Overall, 12,074 patients met inclusion criteria, with 66.6% initiating an anticonvulsant (gabapentin 45.0%; pregabalin 21.6%), and 5.2% initiating duloxetine. Patients commonly received less than the recommended dose of prescribed medication, and adherence was suboptimal for all treatments. It is estimated that up to 50% of patients discontinued their initial treatment within 3 months of initiation.

Conclusions

Newly diagnosed patients with DPNP are most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants. Many patients receive lower than recommended dosages, potentially resulting in poor outcomes. Initial treatments are frequently discontinued, indicating low levels of satisfaction and/or poor tolerability. New therapies with improved efficacy and better tolerability are urgently needed for DPNP.

### Painful diabetic neuropathy [^114aetr1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Diabetes is a worldwide epidemic, and associated neuropathy is its most costly and disabling complication. Given the rising prevalence of painful diabetic neuropathy, it is increasingly important that we understand the best ways to diagnose and treat this condition. Diagnostic tests in this field are evolving rapidly. These include the use of skin biopsies to measure small unmyelinated fibers, as well as even newer techniques that can measure both small unmyelinated fibers and large myelinated fibers in the same biopsy. The main treatments for painful diabetic neuropathy remain management of the underlying diabetes and drugs for the relief of pain. However, emerging evidence points to major differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including the ability of glycemic control to prevent neuropathy. Enhanced glucose control is much more effective at preventing neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 disease. This dichotomy emphasizes the need to study the pathophysiologic differences between the two types of diabetes, because different treatments may be needed for each condition. The impact of the metabolic syndrome on neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes may account for the difference between the two types of diabetes and requires further study. Finally, neuropathic pain is under-recognized and undertreated despite an ever evolving list of effective drugs. Evidence exists to support several drugs, but the optimal sequence and combination of these drugs are still to be determined.

### Oral and topical treatment of painful diabetic polyneuropathy: practice guideline update summary: report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^112dCQTK]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation 7 and Statements 7a–7d — trialing, switching, and combining medications: A series of medications may need to be tried to identify the treatment that most benefits a given patient with PDN, and a treatment to reduce neuropathic pain should be considered ineffective when titrated to a demonstrated effective dose and duration without significant pain reduction; the typical duration in which efficacy is demonstrated is approximately 12 weeks, with a range from 4 to 16 weeks. An intervention should be considered intolerable when medication causes adverse effects that outweigh any benefit, and overall failure is defined as either ineffective after 12 weeks or intolerable; choosing a different mechanism or class is expected to increase the likelihood of achieving new pain relief, and if only partial efficacy is achieved, adding a second medication of a different class may provide combined efficacy greater than that provided by each medication individually. Clinicians should counsel patients that a series of medications may need to be tried (Level B), should determine failure as approximately 12 weeks without clinically significant pain reduction or when side effects outweigh benefit (Level B), should offer a trial of a medication from a different effective class when there is no meaningful improvement or significant adverse effects with the initial therapeutic class (Level B), and should offer a trial of a medication from a different class for patients with partial improvement with an initial therapeutic class (Level B).

### Comprehensive insights into diabetic peripheral neuropathy: pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches [^111ucrYZ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common and debilitating complication of diabetes, resulting from prolonged hyperglycemia-induced peripheral nerve dysfunction. It leads to neuropathic pain, sensory impairment, and diminished quality of life.

Methods

This review summarizes the current literature available on the pathophysiology and treatment approaches for DPN. The literature search was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between 2009 and 2025. The search used keywords such as "Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy", "pathophysiology", "pharmacological treatments", and "non-pharmacological treatments". Relevant data were collected from peer-reviewed journals, clinical trials, and authoritative databases. Only studies published in English were included. Studies limited to animal models or addressing other complications of diabetes were excluded.

Results

The pathogenesis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is driven by metabolic and inflammatory changes that contribute to nerve damage and neuropathic pain. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved pharmacological treatments for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: pregabalin, duloxetine, gabapentin, extended-release tapentadol, tramadol, and the capsaicin 8% patch. Non-Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies, such as amitriptyline and the 5% lidocaine patch, are also widely used. Non-pharmacological interventions, including tonic spinal cord stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, manual acupuncture, local plantar vibration, and the Frequency Rhythmic Electrical Modulated System, show promise in alleviating symptoms and promoting nerve regeneration.

Conclusion

A multifaceted approach incorporating pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies is essential for optimizing patient outcomes in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeting underlying pathophysiological mechanisms while providing symptomatic relief can enhance treatment efficacy and improve the quality of life for individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^117Nkojt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — treatment of established chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) states that for treatment of established painful neuropathy, duloxetine remains the sole recommended treatment, and when patients stop duloxetine, it should be tapered slowly, as stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms. The guideline recommends against acetyl-l-carnitine for the treatment of established chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. There were 3 treatments that were inconclusive in the original guideline but "reasonable to try in some situations" — tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentinoids, and a topical gel containing baclofen, amitriptyline, and ketamine — and there is waning enthusiasm regarding them; currently, the use of tricyclic antidepressants does not appear to be common because of their lack of established benefit and/or their unfavorable side effects. Regarding topical baclofen, amitriptyline, and ketamine, reasons to be less enthusiastic now include that (1) no additional trials have been conducted, (2) there is not an US Food and Drug Administration–approved product and compounding is required, and (3) a subsequent publication of a negative trial of topical amitriptyline and ketamine. For gabapentinoids, with the 1 older placebo-controlled clinical trial showing no benefit for gabapentin and 2 subsequent pregabalin prevention trials (1 for paclitaxel and 1 for oxaliplatin), trials failed to provide evidence of benefit.

### Painful peripheral neuropathies of the lower limbs and / or lower extremities treated with spinal cord stimulation: a systematic review with narrative synthesis [^111Vsk7M]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathies are common neurological diseases, with an estimated prevalence of between 1% and 12% in all age groups and higher rates in older people. Etiologies are diverse; nevertheless, the unifying feature is damage to the peripheral nervous system, resulting in either motor, sensory or autonomic dysfunction. Common causes of peripheral neuropathies include Carpal tunnel syndrome, Bells' palsy, diabetes mellitus, toxic exposure (eg, oncologic therapy), and hereditary polyneuropathy (eg, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease). Sensory and/or motor nerves are the most often affected, with common neurological symptoms including burning pain, numbness, paresthesia, muscle weakness and atrophy, and gait abnormalities.

Neuropathic pain is prevalent in peripheral neuropathy, affecting up to two-thirds of patients and severely impairing quality of life. Currently, oral pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, with gabapentinoids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants being the main recommended medications for symptom relief. However, these drugs generally have limited efficacy, and tolerability is often poor due to their systemic or centrally mediated effects. Other localized agents are also used in drug-refractory patients, including an 8% capsaicin patch recently approved by the FDA for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). However, overall, many patients are left with unrelieved pain. Furthermore, the unmet need for efficacious treatments in patients with painful peripheral neuropathy (PPN) is set to increase, with the rising prevalence of diabetes a major contributing factor.

### Treatment of symptomatic diabetic neuropathy [^111NQYNf]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Painful diabetic neuropathy is a common and particularly unpleasant long-term complication of diabetes that affects a significant minority of patients with distal polyneuropathy. After exclusion of other causes of neuropathic pain, attention should be focused on achieving optimal and stable glycaemic control avoiding flux of blood glucose levels, which have been shown to aggravate pain. Most patients will require pain control therapy and whilst the tricyclic drugs remain a first-line approach, their use is often hampered by predictable but troublesome side effects. Gabapentin, the only agent specifically licensed for the treatment of neuropathic pain in the United Kingdom, is useful in diabetic neuropathy and is generally better tolerated than the tricyclics. Additionally, other pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management approaches may be useful. Patient education has a significant role to play in the avoidance of late neurological complications.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^111pMTts]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common finding in patients with peripheral nerve injury. It has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a pain "caused by lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system". Peripheral neuropathic pain is typically chronic in nature and is caused by a heterogenous group of diseases. It has an estimated prevalence of between 6.9% and 10% of the population. It is typically described as a "pins and needles", burning, cramping, or tingling pain by patients. Prior research has demonstrated that neuropathic causes of pain may be underrecognized and inadequately managed. In this review, we seek to briefly outline the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathic pain and provide a comprehensive list of non‐interventional treatment approaches.

### Polyneuropathy quality measurement set: quality improvement in neurology [^113Pkg7D]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Avoidance of Opioid Medications for Patients With Diabetic Neuropathy — measure definition, rationale, and exclusions: This measure assesses the percentage of patients with diabetic neuropathy who are taking opioid medications; it is an inverse measure where a lower score is desirable, and zero percent performance is not the goal, with users advised to establish a baseline for benchmarking. This is an intermediate outcome measure and, based on current evidence on treatment options for patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), opioids are not indicated as a treatment for pain for patients with DPN. Reported utilization highlights the need for this measure: opioids were used as first-line agents for DPN (33.33%) compared to pregabalin (5.66%); 62% of patients were prescribed a short-acting opioid; out of 14,426 patients with peripheral neuropathy, 65.9% received at least one opioid prescription; and, even excluding other chronic pain conditions, almost 9% of patients with polyneuropathy are prescribed opioids for more than 90 consecutive days. Exclusions are specified as follows: required exclusions prevent entry into the denominator and include an opioid prescription from a different clinician; allowable exclusions can only help performance and include patients counseled on the last visit of the calendar year with agreement to discontinue opioid medication, patients receiving opioids in a controlled/monitored program to manage an opioid dependency (e.g., a methadone maintenance program), patients with active diagnosis of cancer during the measurement period, and patients admitted to hospice care or at end of life.

### Comparison of medications to treat cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy… [^113V5o7F]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Trial Protocol Data Sharing Statement Question Which of the most commonly prescribed medications is best tolerated and most effective for reducing pain in patients with cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy. Findings In a bayesian adaptive randomized clinical trial including 402 patients with cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy, none of the 4 drugs were clearly superior in performance. However, nortriptyline and duloxetine performed better than pregabalin and mexiletine when efficacy and tolerability were both considered. Our findings could affect how these 4 drugs are used by all physicians who treat patients with neuropathy. Findings support duloxetine and nortriptyline as better-performing drug choices in this population with neuropathic pain, suggesting that they should be prescribed before pregabalin or mexiletine are considered.

However, this study also supports a finding that all 4 drugs helped improve pain in at least some patients, so each could be tried if others failed. These findings support the conclusions of prior systematic reviews. A Cochrane review on nortriptyline in neuropathic pain and earlier literature stated that the drug has a role in pain management, even though it is not FDA approved for that indication. 35 The evidence-based guideline for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy showed strong recommendations for the use of nortriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin, while providing a strong recommendation against using mexiletine based on the Grade classification. Furthermore, it had been established in many prior studies that tricyclic antidepressants are more effective in relieving pain and often more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
36.

There was no clearly superior performing drug in the study; however, of the 4 medications, nortriptyline and duloxetine performed better when efficacy and dropouts were both considered. Therefore, we recommend that either nortriptyline or duloxetine be considered before selecting pregabalin or mexiletine for the treatment of pain among patients with CSPN. We recognize that several other nonnarcotic drugs are used to treat painful peripheral neuropathy. These include gabapentin, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants, other sodium channel inhibitors such as lacosamide, topiramate, and carbamazepine. Additional comparative effectiveness research studies can be performed on those drugs, so physicians can have a library of data on all these drugs for CPSN.

### Cochrane abstract… [^112bSHUD]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 70-year-old man with a long-standing history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents with increasing burning and tingling in his feet. Clinical Question Should antidepressants be used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Evidence-Based Answer Tricyclic antidepressants, particularly amitriptyline, are effective for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and post herpetic neuralgia, and may be beneficial in other neuropathic pain syndromes, but they should be used with caution in patients at increased risk of adverse events.

1. The Cochrane review also evaluated studies with respect to specific causes of neuropathic pain. There was good evidence for the effect of tricyclic antidepressants for diabetic neuropathy, but only limited evidence of effectiveness was available regarding the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine, citalopram, and paroxetine.

Archives of Neurology, advocate five options for the initial treatment of neuropathic pain: tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, 5% lidocaine patch, opioids, and tramadol. 2 This conference was sponsored by the manufacturer of the 5% lidocaine patch. The recommendations cite evidence supporting the use of gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain syndromes; the lidocaine patch for postherpetic neuralgia; opioids for postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy; and tramadol for diabetic neuropathy and painful polyneuropathy. They also note that although tricyclic anti-depressants were the first medications to be demonstrated effective for neuropathic pain in placebo-controlled trials, they must be used cautiously because of the potential for adverse effects.
2. Primary Results. Tricyclic antidepressants are effective treatments for neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline has an NNT of 2, RR 4. 1, for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs.
