## Question

protocol for vitamin d level of 23

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what protocol to follow for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 23 ng/mL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret 23 ng/mL against historical and contemporary guideline thresholds. Then, I should verify whether treatment is indicated or if empiric supplementation without targeting a specific level is more appropriate. Next, I will categorize the patient into the correct risk group to choose an initial repletion regimen. After that, I need to specify follow-up labs and safety monitoring. Finally, I will lay out maintenance dosing and special circumstances that might alter the plan, ensuring I reconcile older and newer guidance explicitly.

> Let me first confirm the interpretation of the laboratory value: in this context "23" is ng/mL for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which the 2011 Endocrine Society (ES) guideline classifies as insufficiency (21–29 ng/mL) rather than deficiency (< 20 ng/mL), and below the > 30 ng/mL level they recommended as a target for optimal musculoskeletal outcomes, whereas the UK National Osteoporosis Society regarded 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) as sufficient for most people, which introduces a deliberate tension I need to keep in mind when deciding whether to treat to a number or to focus on risk-based supplementation [^115TEChd] [^113zRN7e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal treatment thresholds; I should verify the current stance on screening and targets because newer guidance shifted emphasis. The USPSTF concluded evidence is insufficient to screen asymptomatic adults, and the Endocrine Society's 2024 materials no longer endorse fixed "sufficiency" or "insufficiency" thresholds like 30 ng/mL for generally healthy adults, favoring empiric supplementation in selected populations instead of treat-to-target testing, which means if I choose a repletion protocol to move from 23 to > 30 ng/mL I am aligning with the 2011 ES clinical approach rather than the 2024 prevention framework, a choice that should be explicit and clinically justified by comorbid risk or bone-health context [^112a2CfF] [^1113S3oR].

> I need to check which patient group we're dealing with because the repletion strategy changes with obesity, malabsorption, certain medications, CKD, pregnancy, pediatrics, or established osteoporosis; in adults without obesity or malabsorption I would use a standard repletion dose, whereas in high-risk adults with obesity, malabsorption, or enzyme-inducing drugs I should use 2–3 times higher doses; in CKD, KDIGO advises treating deficiency/insufficiency using general-population strategies; in pregnancy and pediatrics, age-specific ES recommendations apply; and in osteoporosis care, several guidelines still operationalize vitamin D sufficiency as part of fracture-risk management and therapy support, which can justify correcting a 23 ng/mL value toward > 30 ng/mL in that context [^115rP1Fz] [^111TsKkR] [^1113Mtyi] [^1149M8tu] [^111X74a6] [^1125PW8f] [^111oBqLc].

> Let me now examine the repletion (corrective) regimen if I decide to treat as per ES 2011: for non-obese, otherwise healthy adults a practical option is vitamin D2 or D3 at 50,000 IU orally once weekly for 8 weeks, or an equivalent daily regimen of about 6,000 IU, aiming to raise 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL if following the 2011 target; for high-risk adults with obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications, I should initiate 6,000–10,000 IU daily until repletion, recognizing that D3 tends to produce more sustained 25(OH)D increases than D2 in many trials and that D2 can decrease circulating 25(OH)D3, so if available I generally prefer cholecalciferol while acknowledging both forms are acceptable per ES 2011 [^116Tw7ci] [^115rP1Fz] [^114GRJMf] [^1114hFbb] [^113uxCYa] [^112565fW].

> Wait, I should confirm my monitoring and safety steps before prescribing high-dose therapy; I need a baseline or concurrent calcium and to plan a 25(OH)D recheck about 8–12 weeks after starting therapy, which aligns with pharmacokinetics and consensus statements; I should also monitor for hypercalcemia or unmasked primary hyperparathyroidism, keep typical adult intakes at or below the tolerable upper limit of 4,000 IU/day outside supervised repletion, and remember that vitamin D toxicity is rare but serious; if the patient is a calcium stone former, available randomized data suggest repletion, including 50,000 IU weekly protocols, does not meaningfully increase urine calcium or calcium salt supersaturation over 6 weeks, which reassures me about short-term correction when indicated [^113cP2er] [^1123HSa4] [^113YzgpM] [^111cYEcX] [^114jjzc7] [^115XunQh].

> Next, I should review maintenance once the target is achieved or once the repletion phase is complete; for standard-risk adults, 1,500–2,000 IU/day usually sustains levels above 30 ng/mL if I am following the 2011 approach, whereas high-risk adults often require more; Group B maintenance 3,000 — hmm, wait a minute, I should correct that to 3,000–6,000 IU/day in obesity or malabsorption to maintain > 30 ng/mL per ES 2011's high-risk maintenance guidance, with dose titration to labs, adherence, and seasonality; I also need to reconcile that the 2024 ES prevention guideline does not endorse treat-to-number maintenance in generally healthy adults, so my choice to maintain > 30 ng/mL should be anchored to bone-health indications or individualized risk [^116Tw7ci] [^114Hfpqn] [^115rP1Fz] [^1113S3oR].

> But wait, what if there is CKD or primary hyperparathyroidism; in CKD, KDIGO says treat deficiency or insufficiency with the same nutritional vitamin D strategies as the general population, reserving active vitamin D analogs for other indications, and in primary hyperparathyroidism, cautious correction of vitamin D insufficiency can lower PTH without exacerbating hypercalcemia when monitored appropriately; in patients on potent antiresorptives such as denosumab or zoledronic acid, annual vitamin D checks are often programmatic and sensible given hypocalcemia risk mitigation [^1113Mtyi] [^1135x1et] [^113cP2er].

> Let me put this into a concrete protocol for a typical non-obese adult at 23 ng/mL when choosing the ES 2011 corrective pathway: prescribe cholecalciferol 50,000 IU orally once weekly for 8 weeks, or cholecalciferol 6,000 IU daily for 8 weeks if weekly dosing is impractical; ensure adequate calcium intake without excess; check serum calcium now if not recent and recheck 25(OH)D (and calcium) in about 8–12 weeks; if the repeat level is > 30 ng/mL and calcium is normal, transition to 1,500–2,000 IU/day maintenance; if still < 30 ng/mL or if the patient has obesity, malabsorption, or interacting drugs, extend or increase dosing within supervised ranges (for example 6,000–10,000 IU/day) and then maintain at 3,000–6,000 IU/day, with interval lab checks tailored to risk, adherence, and comorbidities; if following the 2024 prevention perspective instead, consider empiric maintenance dosing without routine retesting unless high risk or on high-dose therapy, recognizing this will not explicitly target > 30 ng/mL [^116Tw7ci] [^113cP2er] [^115rP1Fz] [^1113S3oR].

---

A vitamin D level of 23 ng/mL indicates **insufficiency** [^115TEChd] and should be managed with **1,500–2,000 IU/day** of vitamin D3 [^114Hfpqn], along with 1,000–1,200 mg/day of calcium from diet or supplements. Recheck 25(OH)D in **3 months** [^113cP2er] and adjust the dose to maintain **≥ 30 ng/mL** [^114Hfpqn]; use higher doses (3,000–6,000 IU/day) in the presence of obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications [^115rP1Fz] [^111TsKkR]. Monitor calcium and renal function during high-dose or long-term therapy, and **avoid exceeding 4,000 IU/day without supervision** [^111cYEcX].

---

## Clinical significance of vitamin D insufficiency

Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and musculoskeletal symptoms [^111oBqLc]; correcting insufficiency **improves bone health and reduces fracture risk** [^111J52a5] [^115w1t3Y].

---

## Recommended supplementation protocol

### General adult population

For the general adult population, **daily supplementation** with 1,500–2,000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is recommended [^114Hfpqn] to achieve and maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL [^111oBqLc]. Calcium intake of **1,000–1,200 mg/day** from diet or supplements supports bone health and calcium homeostasis.

---

### Special populations requiring higher doses

Certain populations require **higher doses** due to reduced absorption or increased metabolism [^115rP1Fz].

| **Population** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) | 3,000–6,000 IU/day [^115rP1Fz] |
| Malabsorption syndromes (e.g. celiac, IBD, bariatric surgery) | 3,000–6,000 IU/day [^115rP1Fz] |
| Medications affecting vitamin D metabolism (e.g. anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids) | 3,000–6,000 IU/day [^111TsKkR] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Re-evaluation**: Check serum 25(OH)D after 3 months of supplementation to assess response and adherence [^113cP2er].
- **Maintenance**: Once ≥ 30 ng/mL is achieved, continue 1,500–2,000 IU/day and recheck every 6–12 months.
- **Safety monitoring**: Monitor serum calcium and renal function if high-dose or long-term therapy is used.

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Vitamin D supplementation is generally safe; however, **excessive intake can cause hypercalcemia** [^114jjzc7], hypercalciuria, and renal impairment; avoid exceeding 4,000 IU/day without medical supervision [^111cYEcX].

---

## Clinical outcomes of correcting vitamin D insufficiency

Correcting insufficiency improves bone mineral density [^111oBqLc], **reduces fracture risk** [^111J52a5], and may lower fall risk, especially in older adults and those with osteoporosis.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Supplementation | 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 |
| Calcium intake | 1,000–1,200 mg/day |
| Monitoring | - Recheck 25(OH)D in 3 months <br/> - Maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL |
| Special populations | Higher doses (3,000–6,000 IU/day) for obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications |
| Safety | - Avoid > 4,000 IU/day without supervision <br/> - Monitor calcium and renal function |

---

A vitamin D level of 23 ng/mL indicates insufficiency [^115TEChd]; **treat with 1,500–2,000 IU/day** of vitamin D3, ensure adequate calcium, recheck in 3 months [^113cP2er], and adjust to maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL. Use higher doses for obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications [^115rP1Fz], and monitor for hypercalcemia and renal effects.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, the ES (2011) guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently above 30 ng/mL.

### Update in women's health for the general internist [^115w1t3Y]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

- **Osteoporosis**:

Vitamin D and fractures have been studied regarding the prevention of nonvertebral fractures with oral vitamin D and dose dependency through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

- **What was known**:

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in older adults, homebound individuals, and women admitted with hip fractures. The association between vitamin D levels and fracture risk has been inconsistent. However, a recent well-conducted case-control study showed that women with lower serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels had a higher fracture risk than those with higher levels, demonstrating a dose-response effect. Although women are frequently treated for vitamin D deficiency, it has not been definitively known whether vitamin D supplementation prevents nonvertebral and hip fractures.

- **What this study adds**:

This well-done meta-analysis included twelve studies that evaluated vitamin D supplementation with the reporting of at least one fracture. Studies had to be double-blind with at least one year of follow-up and provide data on adherence. Participants took either cholecalciferol (D 3) or ergocalciferol (D 2). Vitamin D doses greater than 400 IU per day were found to reduce nonvertebral and hip fractures, whereas lower doses did not. The overall reduction in fractures was relatively small, with a relative risk of 0.86 (95% CI 0.77–0.96) for nonvertebral fractures. The addition of calcium did not enhance the effect of vitamin D, although the anti-fracture efficacy was higher with greater achieved 25-OH vitamin D levels.

- **How should I change my practice**:

Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation have typically aimed at achieving a specific 25-OH-vitamin D level rather than focusing on a clinical outcome.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically concerning vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D for adults aged 50–70 years and 800 IU/day for those aged over 70 years. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 600 and 800 IU/day of vitamin D are adequate to provide all of the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. It is recognized that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, "Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management", in 2013. This serves as a practical clinical guideline for the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency, its assessment, and treatment, and clinical practice remains inconsistent.

This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses, and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment**: Bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate.

- **Musculoskeletal symptoms**: Symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency.

The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned. It sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3, followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required. However, loading doses are not necessary where the correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked regularly.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^113uxCYa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). High credibility.

In the D2/D3 group, 25(OH)D2 levels increased to about one third to one half the levels in the three D2 treated groups (Fig. 4a); however, 25(OH)D3 did not increase. Further, in the three D2 treated groups, 25(OH)D3 levels progressively and consistently decreased over the course of the study (Fig. 4c). It declined from a mean of 39.2 nmol/L at day 0 to 33.0, 31.6, 28.6, and 22.9 at days 7, 14, 28, and 140, respectively. To further explore the effect of D2 treatment on 25(OH)D3 levels, we examined the correlation between the changes (day 140 minus day 0) in 25(OH)D3 levels and 25(OH)D2 levels in the three D2 treated groups. As shown in Fig. 5a, there was a significant negative correlation (r = −0.48, p < 0.001). However, the change in 25(OH)D3 level also correlated negatively with day zero 25(OH)D3 level (r = −0.58, p < 0.001) and with day 140 25(OH)D levels (r = −0.32, p = 0.003). Of note, in one participant who started with measurable 25(OH)D2 level and received D3 bi-weekly, the 25(OH)D2 level decreased by 16.4 nmol/L between days 0 and 140 (Fig. 5b). In comparison, the mean decrease in 25(OH)D3 level in the three D2 treated groups was 16.4 nmol/L (CI, 14.0 to 18.7, p < 0.001), suggesting that D3 treatment may also induce a decline in 25(OH)D2 levels of the same magnitude.

### Vitamin D supplementation and bone health in adults with diabetic nephropathy: The protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^112kpz9u]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). High credibility.

Outcome measurements are integral to the study design.

- **Study design**: Key elements include Northern Alberta Renal Program (NARP), Alberta Health Services (AHS), randomized controlled trial (RCT), and various measurement abbreviations such as:
	- **General measurements**: micrograms (mcg), body mass index (BMI), dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
	- **Bone health related**: bone mineral density (BMD), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx)
	- **Diabetes management**: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), random blood glucose (RBG)
	- **Kidney function and related**: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23)
	- **Vitamin D forms**: 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D)

- **Primary outcome variables**:
	- Serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are critical metrics. Serum 25(OH)D is deemed the most reliable measure of vitamin D status, accounting for both cutaneous and dietary sources. A mean increase in serum 25(OH)D of 25–50 nmol/L was chosen as a conservative target, given that 1,000 IU/d is known to increase serum 25(OH)D by 25 nmol/L in renal patients. The 1,25(OH)2D concentration was measured to explore its relationship with 25(OH)D levels and bone health.
	- Vitamin D levels were measured using validated, specific, and sensitive methodologies by the provincial laboratory system. The ratio of 1,25(OH)2D (product) to 25(OH)D (precursor) was calculated as a surrogate measure of 1α-hydroxylase activity, indicated by the product-to-precursor ratio.

- **Bone health**: This was assessed by measuring BMD and plasma/serum levels of bone turnover.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^117VCote]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves a diverse panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been demonstrated to act as a key transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend solely on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D dietary intake.

Besides the potential utility of evaluating noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is currently the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels derive from international guidelines and are crucial for understanding vitamin D's role in human health.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112a2CfF]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The 2021 guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) address screening and diagnosis for vitamin D deficiency. Specifically, regarding indications for screening the general population, the USPSTF states that there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults.

### Making sense of the latest advice on vitamin D therapy [^1146EXyq]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine recently published recommendations for the daily intake and optimal serum levels of vitamin D based on an extensive review of the existing literature. Here, we examine the issue and put levels of vitamin D in context for the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease. Large randomized controlled trials are necessary to ensure that recommendations are appropriate.

### The effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on hepcidin-25 and erythropoiesis in patients with chronic kidney disease [^11275mz5]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Blood was collected after an overnight fast, and routine biochemical analyses were carried out locally by standard laboratory methods. The quantification of serum 25(OH)D for screening purposes was performed locally using high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) in Malmoe and Gothenburg, while a chemiluminescent method (Diasorin) was used in Uppsala. Baseline and week-12 measurements of 25(OH)D were all analyzed centrally by HPLC–MS. Measurements of serum HEP-25 were carried out with mass spectrometry that specifically measures HEP-25, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.5 nmol/L, an intra-assay coefficient of variation of 6%, and an inter-assay coefficient of variation of 8%. Finally, the quantification of intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) was performed using an enzyme-link immunosorbent method (Kainos, Japan).

In healthy individuals, it has been shown that serum ferritin explains 60% of the variance in serum levels of hepcidin-25. It is therefore relevant to consider not only serum levels of HEP-25 but also the H/F ratio to relate the level of HEP-25 to the size of the iron reserves, as the ratio better reflects the adequacy of hepcidin expression in relation to body iron reserves.

Data were collected on demography, the cause of CKD, concomitant medical treatment of relevance, and eGFR.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: Review and recommendations on evaluation, diagnosis, and management. A Canadian and international consensus [^1135x1et]. Osteoporosis International (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, particularly in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, preoperative guidelines from CTFH 2017 recommend correcting vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency to lower serum PTH levels without further elevating serum calcium. This correction should aim to achieve a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level greater than 50 nmol/L.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^114jjzc7]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, vitamin D toxicity (VDT) is a rare but life-threatening event, mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and non-classic adverse events for VDT.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: An Endocrine Society guideline update [^111J52a5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for postmenopausal osteoporosis, specifically in relation to vitamin D supplementation, the ES 2020 guidelines recommend offering daily vitamin D supplementation to prevent hip fractures in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures and unable to tolerate bisphosphonates, estrogen, selective estrogen response modulators, denosumab, tibolone, teriparatide, and abaloparatide.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level below 20 ng/mL, which leads to adverse health outcomes. Prevalence rates indicate that groups such as individuals living at higher latitudes (greater than 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.

Diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency include rickets in children, osteomalacia, osteopenia, and osteoporosis in adults. The guideline recommends certain populations be screened for vitamin D deficiency and suggests dietary supplementation and sensible sun exposure as preventive measures. Additionally, health professionals are advised to initiate treatment with vitamin D2 or D3 supplements to restore adequate serum levels in deficient patients. Regular monitoring of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels is encouraged to ensure efficacy of treatment.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on assisted reproduction technology (ART) outcomes and underlying biological mechanisms: Protocol of a randomized clinical controlled trial. The "Supplementation of Vitamin D and Reproductive Outcome" (SUNDRO) study [^112BWyPw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin D plays an important role in human physiology and pathology. The receptor for vitamin D regulates 0.5–5% of the human genome. Accordingly, vitamin D insufficiency has been shown to increase the risk of several diseases. In recent years, based on growing evidence, a role of vitamin D has been postulated in reproductive health both in animals and humans, especially in female fertility. In vitro fertilization success has been shown to be higher in women with appropriate reserves of vitamin D. However, a causal relation has not been demonstrated, and randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in IVF are warranted.

- **Methods**: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study aimed at determining the benefits of vitamin D [25(OH)D] supplementation in improving the clinical pregnancy rate in women undergoing IVF. Eligible women with a serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 30ng/ml will be randomized. Recruited women will be given the drug (either 600,000IU of 25(OH)D or placebo in a single oral administration) at the time of randomization. Two centers will participate, and the sample size (700 women) is foreseen to be equally distributed between the two. Patients will be treated according to standard IVF protocols.

- **Discussion**: The primary aim of the study is the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate per oocyte retrieval. Clinical pregnancy is defined as the presence of at least one intrauterine gestational sac with a viable fetus at the first ultrasound assessment (3 weeks following a positive test).

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116XbWDR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The new USPSTF recommendation addresses screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults.

- **Methods**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency. This included examining the benefits and harms of both screening and early treatment.

- **Population**: This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings. Importantly, it excludes individuals who are known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. This is identified as an I statement.

### Calcitriol [^1165vUWT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the management of **hypoparathyroidism**, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg per day, administered in the morning. If the biochemical parameters and clinical manifestations of the disease do not show satisfactory improvement, the dose may be increased at intervals of 2 to 4 weeks. During the dosage titration period, it is crucial to obtain serum calcium levels at least twice weekly. If hypercalcemia is observed, calcitriol should be discontinued immediately until normocalcemia is achieved. Additionally, it is advisable to consider reducing dietary calcium intake. Regular monitoring of serum calcium, phosphorus, and 24-hour urinary calcium is recommended.

Most adult and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older respond to dosages ranging from 0.5 mcg to 2 mcg daily. For pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years with hypoparathyroidism, typical dosages range from 0.25 mcg to 0.75 mcg daily. Due to the limited number of treated patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism under 6 years of age, specific dosage recommendations cannot be made.

Occasionally, malabsorption is noted in patients with hypoparathyroidism; hence, larger doses of calcitriol may be necessary.

For **predialysis patients**, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg per day for adults and pediatric patients aged 3 years and older. This dosage may be increased to 0.5 mcg per day if required. For pediatric patients under 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage is 10 to 15 ng per kg per day.

### A systematic review supporting the Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Low vitamin D status is prevalent and is linked to a variety of common medical conditions.

- **Objective**: To support the development of the Endocrine Society's clinical practice guideline on vitamin D for the prevention of disease.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple databases for studies addressing 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Of these, 10 questions assessed the effect of vitamin D versus no vitamin D in the general population across the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes. One question examined dosing, and three questions focused on screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was utilized to evaluate the certainty of evidence.

- **Results**: From the electronic searches yielding 37,007 citations, we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested a reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years, with variable certainty of evidence. High certainty of evidence indicated a very small reduction in mortality among adults over 75 years. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested potential benefits on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence indicated a reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. High-dose intermittent vitamin D administration may increase falls compared to lower-dose daily dosing.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^111yc5Hu]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

We recommend treatment in symptomatic adults with X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) using active vitamin D together with oral phosphorus (phosphate salts) to reduce osteomalacia and its consequences and to improve oral health (grade B, moderate recommendation). We suggest treating pregnant and lactating women with active vitamin D in combination with phosphate supplements if needed (grade D, weak recommendation). Routine treatment of asymptomatic adults with XLH is not recommended (grade C, moderate recommendation).

- **Dosing recommendations**: We recommend using substantially lower doses of active vitamin D and oral phosphate than are used in children (grade C, moderate recommendation). Specifically, a dose range of 750–1,600 mg daily (based on elemental phosphorus) for phosphate and of 0.50–0.75 and 0.75–1.5 μg daily for calcitriol and alfacalcidol, respectively, is recommended (grade C, weak recommendation).
- **Immobilization considerations**: Reducing doses of active vitamin D in patients in whom long-term immobilization is anticipated is recommended to prevent hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia (grade D, weak recommendation).
- **Phosphate supplements adjustment**: We recommend stopping phosphate supplements in patients with markedly increased parathyroid hormone levels (grade C, moderate recommendation).
- **Secondary hyperparathyroidism management**: Active vitamin D might be given without phosphate supplements to adult patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism if careful follow-up is provided (grade D, weak recommendation).
- **Vitamin D deficiency supplementation**: We suggest supplementing patients with native vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) in case of vitamin D deficiency.

### Calcitriol [^112rZ77J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Calcitriol injection is intended for intravenous use only, and the optimal dose must be carefully determined for each patient.

The effectiveness of calcitriol injection therapy assumes that each patient receives an adequate and appropriate daily intake of calcium. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium in adults is 800 mg. To ensure adequate calcium intake, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or advise the patient on proper dietary measures.

The recommended initial dose of calcitriol injection, depending on the severity of hypocalcemia and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism, ranges from 1 mcg (0.02 mcg/kg) to 2 mcg, administered intravenously three times weekly, approximately every other day. Initial doses may range from as small as 0.5 mcg to as large as 4 mcg three times weekly.

If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 1 mcg at intervals of two to four weeks. During this titration period, serum calcium and phosphorus levels should be obtained at least twice weekly. If hypercalcemia or a serum calcium times phosphate product greater than 70 is noted, the drug should be immediately discontinued until these parameters are appropriate. Subsequently, the calcitriol injection should be reinitiated at a lower dose.

Doses may need to be reduced as the parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels decrease in response to therapy. Thus, incremental dosing must be individualized and based on PTH, serum calcium, and phosphorus levels.

### Validation of a vitamin D replacement strategy in vitamin D-insufficient patients with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^115s2BSw]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The primary study goal is to determine if vitamin D replacement in insufficient patients can improve 12-month event-free survival in the lymphoma arm and increase time to chemotherapy and overall survival in the CLL arm. Since the study goals hinge on achieving 25(OH)D levels of ⩾30 ng/ml, we demonstrate in this initial report that our vitamin D replacement strategy, which is simple to implement for physicians and patients, is safe and effective.

Between January 2013 and June 2016, 158 patients were enrolled in the study and completed at least 12 weeks of follow-up. One hundred forty-five (92%) patients had a diagnosis of lymphoma (combined diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and T-cell NHL), and 13 had CLL. Seventy-one (45%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency at baseline with a mean 25(OH)D of 17.0 ± 5.2 ng/ml. Seventy patients completed 12 weeks of vitamin D replacement, and one patient elected not to take the replacement dose. At the end of the 12-week induction period, 97% (69/70) of insufficient patients had achieved vitamin D sufficiency, with a new mean 25(OH)D of 54.7 ± 13.9 ng/ml. The one patient in whom 25(OH)D levels remained below 30 ng/ml at 12 weeks had severe hypovitaminosis D at study entry (baseline level, 6.0 ng/ml) and had achieved a 25(OH)D level at 12 weeks of 28 ng/ml. After an additional 12 weeks of vitamin D at 50 000 IU twice weekly, this patient achieved target 25(OH)D levels (36 ng/ml). The remaining 87 (55%) patients had baseline 25(OH)D levels ⩾25 ng/ml with a mean of 36.6 ± 9.6 ng/ml, with 22 subjects having 25(OH)D levels ⩾25 but < 30 ng/ml.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^115KQvuK]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The evidence from large-scale MR studies and RCTs converges and does not support vitamin D supplementation to prevent T2D in the general population. However, vitamin D supplementation benefits those with prediabetes and a predisposition to T2D, especially those with vitamin D deficiency. Additional studies or more in-depth analyses of the existing studies are needed to validate these findings.

- **Mortality**: Observational data have repeatedly linked poor vitamin D status with increased mortality. Large, older meta-analyses, dealing mostly with women older than 70 years, showed a 6% to 11% reduction in mortality. However, adding the newest megatrials eliminated this effect, possibly because they recruited a younger population. In these megatrials, overall mortality was much lower than shown in the previous meta-analyses, and no effect of vitamin D supplementation on overall mortality was observed.

	- A Cochrane meta-analysis of 56 randomized trials, including almost 100,000 participants (mostly women older than 70 years), revealed that vitamin D, administered over four years, decreased mortality; this effect was seen in 38 trials of vitamin D3, but not with other forms of vitamin D. A newer meta-analysis of 52 RCTs, including more than 75,000 individuals, concluded that vitamin D (either vitamin D3 or D2) supplementation did not change mortality compared with no supplementation. Again, subanalyses found that vitamin D3 (instead of D2) supplementation tended to reduce mortality. Some MR studies found a link between lower predicted serum 25(OH)D and mortality.

### Vitamin D levels in couples undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment: Lack of association with embryo quality or pregnancy rates [^111BCmRk]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Low credibility.

To investigate the potential impact of vitamin D (VD) serum levels on couples undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment in terms of embryo quality and pregnancy rates, a retrospective cohort study was conducted at a private human reproduction center.

A total of 267 couples underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injections between January 2017 and March 2019. The couples were categorized into four groups based on 25-hydroxy VD (25OHD) levels measured at the beginning of the stimulation protocol: Group 1 with 25OHD levels ≥ 30 ng/mL for both women and men; Group 2 with 25OHD levels < 30 ng/mL for both; Group 3 with women having 25OHD levels < 30 ng/mL and men with 25OHD levels ≥ 30 ng/mL; and Group 4 with women having 25OHD levels ≥ 30 ng/mL and men with 25OHD levels < 30 ng/mL.

The main outcome measures considered were the quantity and quality of embryos during the cleavage and blastocyst stages as primary outcomes, with the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) regarded as a secondary outcome. Our findings revealed no significant correlations between the studied VD groups and the evaluated outcomes, including the quantity and quality of embryos during the cleavage and blastocyst stages, as well as the CPR. Primary analysis revealed a small but statistically significant difference in the duration of controlled ovarian stimulation between Group 1 and Group 2 (95% confidence interval, 0.07–3.04) and between Group 1 and Group 3 (95% confidence interval, 0.05–3.23).

### Vitamin D repletion in kidney stone formers: A randomized controlled trial [^115XunQh]. The Journal of Urology (2017). High credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is often detected during metabolic evaluation in the nephrolithiasis population. Multiple vitamin D repletion protocols exist, although their differing impact on urinary stone formation risk factors is unclear. Patients with a history of calcium stones and vitamin D deficiency (less than 30 ng/ml) were randomized to receive either 1,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly of vitamin D supplementation for 6 weeks. Patients completed a pretreatment and posttreatment serum vitamin D level evaluation and 24-hour urine collections to assess the response and any changes in urine stone formation risk parameters.

A total of 21 patients completed the study, including 8 who received 1,000 IU daily and 13 who received 50,000 IU weekly. The 50,000 IU weekly group showed a significant increase in median serum vitamin D levels of 23 ng/ml (135%, p < 0.01), while the 1,000 IU daily group showed a nonsignificant median increase of 9 ng/ml (49%, p = 0.12). Post-repletion 24-hour urine analysis demonstrated no significant change in urine calcium between the groups, including a median change of -11 mg (IQR -143–29) in patients receiving 1,000 IU and -16 mg (IQR -42–66) in those receiving 50,000 IU. Between the groups there was no significant difference in the supersaturation of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate.

High dose and low dose vitamin D repletion had no effect on urine calcium excretion or the supersaturation of calcium salts in known stone formers. The higher dosing regimen, which had superior repletion, may be beneficial in vitamin D deficient individuals within this population.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1147pFqd]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency has been extensively related to the occurrence of skeletal disorders, such as rickets and osteomalacia. It can also negatively impact osteopenia and osteoporosis, which must be mandatorily managed with vitamin D supplements. More recently, the interest in the putative extraskeletal effects of vitamin D has resulted in several clinical trials addressing vitamin D's influence on cancer and cardiovascular (CV) risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality.

The null results of some of these RCTs — especially the megatrials — hampered the enthusiasm around these topics. However, these trials were progressively revised, and their null results were mainly related to the enrollment of vitamin D–replete adults, in whom benefit would be unlikely, and the inhomogeneous methodologies in vitamin D supplementation with different forms, metabolites, and doses. Indeed, subsequent secondary analyses have progressively shown that vitamin D might be useful in reducing cancer incidence and mortality in the long term, in reducing autoimmune diseases and CV events (in particular central arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation) occurrence, and the development of diabetes from prediabetes forms. Nonetheless, these RCTs and the following meta-analyses were not powerful enough to evaluate these crucial subgroups, and further studies with better methodological conduction are warranted.

Regarding the different forms and metabolites used for vitamin D supplementation, oral administration is the preferred route, and parenteral administration is less commonly employed.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed. This is to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

Regarding the medical management of vitamin D deficiency, particularly concerning vitamin D supplementation, the Endocrine Society 2011 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once weekly for 8 weeks. Alternatively, an equivalent dose of 6,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily may be used for adult patients with vitamin D deficiency, with the goal of achieving a serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL. This treatment should be followed by maintenance therapy of 1,500–2,000 IU daily.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of osteoporosis and fracture prevention in Canada: 2023 update [^112Yn4sg]. CMAJ (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, the OC 2023 guidelines recommend advising daily supplementation of vitamin D of 400 IU in adults aged over 50 years. This is in addition to consuming vitamin D-rich foods to achieve the recommended dietary allowance (600 IU/day for individuals aged 51–70 years and 800 IU/day for individuals over 70 years). Given that few foods contain vitamin D, it is difficult to achieve this level of intake through diet alone.

### From vitamin D to hormone D: Fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system essential for good health [^111Mq8q3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

New knowledge of the biological and clinical importance of the steroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and its receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has resulted in significant contributions to good bone health. However, worldwide reports have highlighted a variety of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency diseases.

Despite many publications and scientific meetings reporting advances in vitamin D science, a disturbing realization is growing that the newer scientific and clinical knowledge is not being translated into better human health. Over the past several decades, the biological sphere of influence of vitamin D(3), as defined by the tissue distribution of the VDR, has broadened at least ninefold from the target organs required for calcium homeostasis (intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid).

Now, research has shown that the pluripotent steroid hormone 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) initiates the physiologic responses of at least 36 cell types that possess the VDR. In addition to the kidney's endocrine production of circulating 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), researchers have found a paracrine production of this steroid hormone in more than 10 extrarenal organs.

This article identifies the fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system, including its potential for contributions to good health in five physiologic arenas in which investigators have clearly documented new biological actions of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) through the VDR. As a consequence, the nutritional guidelines for vitamin D(3) intake (defined by serum hydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations) should be reevaluated.

### Vitamin D supplementation and bone health in adults with diabetic nephropathy: The protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^111baPVm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is a nutrient of concern for individuals with diabetes and nephropathy, particularly for those living in northern climates with limited sunlight exposure. Dietary restriction of vitamin D-rich food sources, such as dairy products, is a common issue due to concerns around phosphorus, potassium, and carbohydrate content. Additionally, avoidance of sunlight is often necessary due to instructions related to concomitant medications. Vitamin D supplementation is required in this population; however, the most effective dose and efficient dosing strategy remain unknown. Low adherence rates to routine vitamin D supplementation present an inherent challenge; therefore, developing alternative approaches, such as alterations in dosing frequency (monthly versus daily), is an important consideration.

Previous studies have been limited by small sample sizes, short intervention durations, or retrospective designs. This study prospectively investigated the impact of two different oral vitamin D3 supplementation dosing strategies (2,000 IU/day vs. 40,000 IU/month) for six months on markers of vitamin D status and bone health in a large group of adults with diabetes and nephropathy.

Measurement of markers of dynamic expression of bone turnover enables evaluation of changes over time, in contrast to the assessment of static changes in bone physiology via DXA, which is a conferred added strength. Markers of collagenous bone resorption (e.g. serum NTx), bone formation (e.g. serum BAP and OC), and the bone-kidney axis/mineral homeostasis (e.g. plasma FGF-23) will allow for the exploration of dynamic bone remodeling.

### Vitamin D supplementation: Guidelines and evidence for subclinical deficiency [^116p1oAq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

To summarize recommendations from the 2011 US Institute of Medicine report on vitamin D and the new guideline from the US Endocrine Society, there is an emphasis on treating and preventing vitamin D deficiency, including in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and those with a prior gastric bypass.

The US Institute of Medicine recommended a dietary allowance of vitamin D as follows: 400 IU per day for children younger than 1 year of age, 600 IU per day for children at least 1 year of age and adults up to 70 years, and 800 IU per day for older adults. The Institute concluded that a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level of 20 ng/ml or more will cover the requirements of 97.5% of the population.

In contrast, the US Endocrine Society's clinical practice guideline suggested that 400–1000 IU per day may be needed for children aged less than 1 year, 600–1000 IU per day for children aged 1 year or more, and 1500–2000 IU per day for adults aged 19 years or more to maintain 25(OH)D levels above the optimal level of 30 ng/ml. Patients, particularly those with inflammatory bowel disease, even in a quiescent state, and those with gastric bypass, have issues absorbing vitamin D and require higher doses to sustain their vitamin D status.

The difference in recommendations between the US Institute of Medicine and the US Endocrine Society's practice guideline reflects different goals and views on evidence. Significant gaps remain in the literature, and more studies on vitamin D treatment assessing changes in outcomes at different 25(OH)D levels are necessary.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113cP2er]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for an extended period, regardless of whether the dosage is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly). This is due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These include institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use certain concomitant medications (e.g. anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption issues, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (e.g. denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

**Different forms of vitamin D supplementation**: The main supplemental oral forms of vitamin D are cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). Both are readily available without a prescription. Cholecalciferol is the most commonly used form of supplemental vitamin D. Calcidiol (calcifediol, 25(OH)D), the inactive vitamin D metabolite produced in the liver, and other vitamin D analogues, such as calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D, the physiologically active form of vitamin D) and alfacalcidol (1-hydroxyvitamin D), are used as prescription medicines for certain conditions.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^114xwr92]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Assessment of vitamin D status: At the time of writing, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status. Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — these are referred to as pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

- **Overview of vitamin D metabolism**: Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results.

In recent years, the number of assessments of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] for diagnostic purposes has increased significantly. Techniques for quantifying 25(OH)D have both increased and evolved; some changes have been beneficial, while others have not. Most methods appear to provide valid results as long as the operator of the technique is properly trained and motivated.

Any laboratory that assesses circulating 25(OH)D for clinical diagnosis needs to participate in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme. Research has shown that circulating 25(OH)D is extremely stable in stored serum or plasma samples, allowing for accurate, long-term epidemiologic studies of circulating 25(OH)D. This article provides an overview of the techniques available for measuring 25(OH)D, compares these techniques with one another, and assesses their clinical utility. It also briefly discusses the stability of 25(OH)D in biological media and presents an overview of the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^1114hFbb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). High credibility.

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its worldwide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency, as well as on dosing schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

- **Methods**: We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over 140 days). The randomization sequence, stratified by body mass index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants, who were then blinded to the capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 serum levels were determined blindly on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. The primary endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2+25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

- **Results**: The mean (SD) age was 33.0 (8.5) years, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. The baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8 (11.9) and increased by 3.3 (11.6) and 28.6 (16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. The AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). The 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in the daily than the 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. The 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in the daily than the 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was a 16.4 nmol/L decrease.

### Evaluation of vitamin D repletion regimens to correct vitamin D status in adults [^116d6EtC]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of commonly prescribed regimens for the treatment of vitamin D insufficiency, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 306 consecutive patients. These patients were prescribed ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) for correction of vitamin D insufficiency at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center between February 2003 and May 2006. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), and calcium were compared before and after treatment with ergocalciferol. Patients who did not have a 25-OHD determination (n = 41) were excluded from the analysis. Vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency were defined as serum 25-OHD levels < 20 ng/mL, 21–29 ng/mL, and ≥ 30 ng/mL, respectively.

- **Results**: We identified 36 discrete prescribing regimens. The three most common regimens were:
	1. Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU once weekly for 4 weeks followed by 50,000 IU once monthly for 5 months (n = 48).
	2. Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU once monthly for 6 months (n = 80).
	3. Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU three times weekly for 6 weeks (n = 27).

	- Each of these treatments significantly increased serum 25-OHD (P < 0.001) with no cases of hypercalcemia. Out of the analyzed regimens, those providing over 600,000 IU of ergocalciferol over an average of 60 ± 40 days achieved sufficiency in 64% of cases, without causing vitamin D toxicity.

In conclusion, regimens containing at least 600,000 IU of ergocalciferol appeared to be the most effective in achieving vitamin D sufficiency. Guidelines for the treatment of vitamin D insufficiency should consider these findings.

### Revisiting vitamin D guidelines: A critical appraisal of the literature [^1154h9dU]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to compare the 2024 and 2011 Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guidelines on vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 (vitamin D). The 2024 Guideline made recommendations for the general healthy population for skeletal and extra-skeletal health benefits of vitamin D. This contrasts with the 2011 Guidelines, which provided clinicians with guidance on evaluating and treating patients with vitamin D deficiency and preventing recurrence.

- **Discussion**: The 2024 Guideline focused on randomized controlled trials and ignored association studies and other studies that have supported the skeletal and extra-skeletal health benefits of vitamin D. The 2024 Guideline recommended empiric vitamin D in children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, for pregnant women to improve pregnancy-related outcomes, for prediabetic patients to reduce the risk of diabetes, and to improve mortality in those over 75 years.

- **Conclusion**: These guidelines do not apply to individuals with abnormalities in calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and bone metabolism, which were provided in the 2011 Guidelines. For nonpregnant adults up to the age of 75, they recommend the Dietary Reference Intakes of 600 IUs (international units; 1 IU = 25 ng of vitamin D) and 800 IUs as recommended by the Institute of Medicine. Association studies have suggested that to obtain maximum extraskeletal benefits from vitamin D, including reducing the risk of upper respiratory tract infections for children and adults, autoimmune disorders, and pre-eclampsia, adequate intake is necessary.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^112565fW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). High credibility.

The primary aim of this randomized placebo-controlled, partially-blinded study on 269 healthy adults with a mean 25(OH)D of 39.8 (11.9) nmol/L was to evaluate the relative efficacy of equi-unit D2 and D3 oral supplements given daily, biweekly, or monthly in raising 25(OH)D levels over 20 weeks. Predetermined secondary aims included comparing D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 levels. The primary outcome measure was the adjusted area-under-the-curve between days 0 and 140 (AUC 140).

- **Main results**:
	1. In the long term (20 weeks), the D3 biweekly regimen, followed by the D3 monthly and D2 daily regimens, were superior in raising 25(OH)D levels. However, in the first few weeks of treatment, the monthly regimen, followed by the biweekly regimen, were superior to all daily regimens.
	2. The D3 biweekly and monthly regimens were consistently superior to the corresponding D2 regimens. However, the D2 daily regimen was consistently superior to the D3 daily regimen.
	3. 25(OH)D2 levels were significantly higher in the daily groups compared to the biweekly and monthly D2-treated groups, whereas 25(OH)D3 levels were lower in the daily groups compared to the biweekly and monthly D3-treated groups.
	4. The increase in 25(OH)D levels was inversely related to baseline levels. Its inverse relation to BMI appeared to be D-type and time-dependent, mainly occurring shortly after D2 treatment.
	5. Daily, biweekly, and monthly D2 regimens were associated with a similar and significant decrease in 25(OH)D3 levels that correlated with the increase in 25(OH)D2 levels and baseline 25(OH)D levels.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: A randomized controlled trial [^115WpQzu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The interpretation of the results of this study may be limited by its sample size, 15% follow-up loss, lower compliance with daily compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly regimens, capsule content that is lower than label claim, and capsule formulation based on weight equipotency of D2 and D3.

The rate of follow-up loss was similar across the groups. The characteristics of participants who completed the study were similar to those of the entire cohort. The incompliance rate was 1 to 1.6% in the daily groups, and the discrepancy between capsule content and label claim was similar across the capsules; thus, these factors would not be expected to affect the main findings of the study. Although the incompliance rate was low, it was measured by capsule count, which may not be reliable. Thus, the lower dose–response observed with daily D3 treatment compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3 treatments could be explained at least in part by incompliance. However, such an explanation is not likely given our observation that the dose–response was higher with daily D2 treatment compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly D2 treatments and the fact that assignment to daily D2 or D3 treatment was random and blinded.

The lower capsule content implies that the observed increments in D and 25(OH)D levels may have been up to 10% higher. Furthermore, the fact that the molecular weight of D2 is about 3% higher compared to D3 indicates that our study may have underestimated the response to D2 treatment. Nevertheless, such a difference would not be expected to change the conclusions of the study.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^114hqviD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). High credibility.

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable due to their worldwide deficiency. Controversy continues regarding the relative potency of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), as well as the role of dosing schedule and sex in raising 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, which is the best indicator of vitamin D status.

- **Methods**: We randomized 279 adults to receive either daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or a placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over 140 days). The randomization sequence, stratified by body mass index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants, who were blinded to the capsules' content. Serum levels of D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 were determined blindly on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, and then 2-weekly thereafter by high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. The primary endpoint was the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3), adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

- **Results**: The mean (SD) age was 33.0 (8.5) years, 41% of participants were male, and 85% completed follow-up. The baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8 (11.9) nmol/L and increased by 3.3 (11.6) and 28.6 (16.3) nmol/L in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active treatment than with placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than in 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily compared to 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008).

### Treatment with 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ every other week and effect on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D₂, 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃, and total 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a clinical setting [^115J9jnE]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ supplementation in a clinical setting on serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), 25-hydroxyvitamin D₂ (25[OH]D₂), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (25[OH]D₃).

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in an urban tertiary referral hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Patients who had been prescribed 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ repletion and maintenance programs were identified through a search of our electronic medical record. Baseline and follow-up total serum 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D₂, and 25(OH)D₃ levels were compared.

- **Results**: We examined the medical records of 48 patients who had been prescribed 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ in our clinic. The mean ± standard deviation baseline total 25(OH)D was 31.0 ± 10.6 ng/mL, which rose to 48.3 ± 13.4 ng/mL after treatment (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D₂ increased from 4.2 ± 4.3 ng/mL to 34.6 ± 12.3 ng/mL after treatment (p < 0.001) over an average of 158 days (range, 35–735 days). Serum 25(OH)D₃ decreased from 26.8 ± 10.8 ng/mL to 13.7 ± 7.9 ng/mL (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Fifty thousand IU vitamin D₂ repletion and maintenance therapy substantially increases total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D₂ despite a decrease in serum 25(OH)D₃. This treatment program is an appropriate and effective strategy to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency.

### Vitamin D insufficiency and epistemic humility: An Endocrine Society guideline communication [^1113S3oR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

A long-held precept is that vitamin D supplementation primarily, if not exclusively, benefits individuals with low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at baseline. However, the most appropriate 25(OH)D threshold to distinguish unacceptably low vs. reliably adequate concentrations remains controversial. Such threshold proposals have largely been based on observational studies, which provide less robust evidence compared to randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

Since the Endocrine Society's first vitamin D-related guideline was published in 2011, several large vitamin D-related RCTs have been published. A newly commissioned guideline development panel (GDP) prioritized four clinical questions related to the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation in generally healthy individuals with 25(OH)D levels below a threshold. The GDP determined that available clinical trial evidence does not permit the establishment of 25(OH)D thresholds that specifically predict meaningful benefit with vitamin D supplementation.

The panel noted important limitations in the available evidence, and the panel's overall certainty in the available evidence was very low. Nonetheless, based on the GDP's analyses and judgments, the Endocrine Society no longer endorses its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "sufficiency" (i.e. at least 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]) or its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "insufficiency" (i.e.g.reater than 20ng/mL [50nmol/L] but lower than 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]). The Endocrine Society's rationale for such is the subject of this guideline communication.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on assisted reproduction technology (ART) outcomes and underlying biological mechanisms: Protocol of a randomized clinical controlled trial. The "Supplementation of Vitamin D and Reproductive Outcome" (SUNDRO) study [^116jrQwG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

The study has been designed according to the CONSORT methodology.

- **Aim**: The present trial is aimed at determining the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in improving cumulative clinical pregnancy rate in women undergoing IVF. In particular, the three main aims of the study are as follows: Aim 1: To determine the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in improving cumulative clinical pregnancy rate in women undergoing IVF. Aim 2: To investigate whether vitamin D supplementation might improve clinical and embryological variables such as the number of cancelled cycles, number of available oocytes, number of good quality embryos, and units of FSH administered per retrieved oocyte, as well as the implantation rate of transferred embryos. Aim 3: To investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on oocyte and endometrium quality at a molecular level through a comparative analysis between treated and untreated patients based on the analysis of cumulus cells, follicular, and endometrial fluids.

- **Setting**: This is a multicenter randomized superiority double blinded placebo controlled clinical trial with parallel groups and allocation 1:1. Two Italian academic infertility units will be involved: IRCCS Fondazione Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy, and IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.

- **Participants**: Inclusion criteria of women will be as follows: indication to IVF, age 18–39 years, less than 3 previous IVF attempts, and body mass index (BMI) 18–25 kg/m². Exclusion criteria will be as follows: patients with anti-Müllerian hormone serum level < 0.5 ng/ml.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^117GUmKc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The Endocrine Society 2024 guidelines recommend considering empiric vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy as a preventative measure for vitamin D deficiency. This supplementation has the potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^112JLweK]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Generally, there is a lack of consensus about the recommended vitamin D supplementation regimen, including doses, administration schedule, and treatment duration. Such heterogeneity can be explained, at least partly, by the scarcity of comparative pharmacokinetics studies for different dosing schedules. Moreover, different underlying conditions, such as obesity, might reduce the effect of vitamin D supplementation. Growing evidence suggests that the treatment schedule itself, whether bolus or frequent administration, may differently affect the effectiveness of the treatment and also clinical outcomes. Recent studies and a few meta-analyses show more promising results with frequent administration schedules on skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes.

In this perspective, vitamin D supplementation guidelines should be specific for age group, body weight, ethnicity (skin type), and latitude of residence. For example, differences in serum 25(OH)D by BMI and absolute body weight have been reported. Vitamin D dose per kilogram of body weight per day could explain a 34.5% variation in circulating 25(OH)D in multivariable regression analyses of data pooled from several studies, leading to pronounced differences across BMI categories. Obese and overweight individuals tend to have serum 25(OH)D levels that are, on average, around 20 nmol/L lower and 8 nmol/L lower than those of normal-weight individuals, requiring 2.6 and 1.47 times higher supplementation, respectively. This is somewhat consistent with ES guidelines suggesting that the vitamin D dosage for obese people is "three times" greater.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on psoriasis severity in patients with lower-range serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: A randomized clinical trial [^113i61wJ]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

The study "Vitamin D in Psoriasis" was published in 2023 in the journal JAMA Dermatology. This research focused on psoriasis and investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on psoriasis severity in patients with lower-range serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. The study design was a single-center, double-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT).

The study population consisted of 122 patients, including 46 females and 76 males. Inclusion criteria required adult patients with active plaque psoriasis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 24 ng/mL. Key exclusion criteria were nut allergy, primary hyperparathyroidism, granulomatous diseases, pregnancy, and clinical signs of proximal myopathy.

- **Study interventions**:
	- **Vitamin D group**: 60 patients received cholecalciferol oral capsules, with a 100,000 IU loading dose followed by 20,000 IU per week for 4 months.
	- **Placebo group**: 62 patients received matching placebo oral capsules for 4 months.

- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in the reduction of the psoriasis area severity index score (0.34 points vs. 0.41 points; absolute difference [AD] -0.11 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.45 to 0.23).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference was observed in the reduction of the self-administered psoriasis area severity index (0.5 vs. -0.25; AD 0.6, 95% CI -0.55 to 1.76).
	- No significant improvement was found in the dermatology life quality index (-0.59 vs. 0.1; AD -0.86, 95% CI -1.9 to 0.19).

The findings indicated no significant benefits of vitamin D supplementation on psoriasis severity or quality of life measures in this patient population.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

- **Objective**: To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower disease risk. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions such as pregnancy and prediabetes. The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) e

### Correction of vitamin D deficiency in critically ill patients - VITdAL@ICU study protocol of a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial [^117TzyaK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

For the general population, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a daily allowance of 600 to 800 IU for adults, while the Endocrine Society guideline recommends 1,500 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day for the at-risk population. The upper daily limits for adults are 4,000 (IOM) to 10,000 (Endocrine Society) IU per day. Guidelines for parenteral nutrition recommend 200 IU per day, and typical enteral nutrition formulas contain 200 to 300 IU of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol per 1,000 ml. Available over-the-counter multivitamin preparations commonly contain 200 IU of vitamin D2 or D3. Currently, there is no intravenous vitamin D-monopreparation available, although high-dose intramuscular preparations may be an option in selected patients.

In summary, vitamin D plays a pivotal role in calcium homeostasis and is associated with disease severity and mortality in critically ill patients. Moreover, vitamin D exhibits a number of pleiotropic effects that are of special interest to ICU patients. However, it is unclear whether a low vitamin D status is causally linked to adverse outcomes or merely an epiphenomenon reflecting poor health status. In contrast to previous clinical trials that failed to show a benefit for correcting hormonal insufficiencies in critical illness (e.g. administration of growth hormone or steroids), one must consider that vitamin D acts not only on an endocrine level but also on an autocrine level, which allows for tissue-specific control of 1,25(OH)₂D regulation and action.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, specifically in pediatric patients, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of either 2,000 IU/day of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 for at least 6 weeks or 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 once weekly for at least 6 weeks. This should be followed by maintenance therapy of 600–1,000 IU/day in pediatric patients aged 1–18 years with vitamin D deficiency, to achieve a blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL.

### A randomized comparison of intramuscular high-dose versus oral maintenance vitamin D to prevent severe exacerbations in deficient/insufficient asthmatic children [^113KfeDE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

With new guideline committee members, the Endocrine Society abruptly and drastically lowered the blood concentration defining deficiency; it may change again in the future. The data provided allow physicians and families to estimate the degree of possible benefit from baseline blood concentration, irrespective of guideline committee membership.

- **Blood concentration guidelines**: Because injected vitamin D treatment was unmasked, it is interesting to ask whether injections per se reliably lead to reduced unplanned ED visits for asthma. Participants in the concurrently enrolled preschool children aged 2 to 4 years are included, providing detailed results for the four treatment groups stratified by study period and quartile of baseline 25(OH)D concentration. For the preschoolers and their parents/guardians, blinded randomization to injections (receiving injected IM + Oral) versus oral-only did not reduce unplanned ED visits for exacerbations during 0 to 3 months (58% vs. 56%) nor during 0 to 12 months (87% vs. 85%).
