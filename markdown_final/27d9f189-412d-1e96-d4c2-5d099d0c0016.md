## Question

What antibiotics are used to treat ESBL?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics are used to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of infection. Then, I should verify the infection site, especially distinguishing urinary from non-urinary disease. Next, I will review first-line and alternative agents by scenario, including carbapenems, oral options, and when to avoid piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime. After that, I need to check special populations and stewardship principles. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-aligned algorithm and highlight key caveats and exceptions, making sure I double-check any points that seem uncertain before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity, because treatment hinges on whether the infection is severe or the patient is critically ill, and whether we are dealing with definitive therapy after susceptibilities return versus empiric coverage. I should confirm that IDSA guidance emphasizes carbapenems as preferred for severe infections and for infections outside the urinary tract, with attention to patient-specific factors like hypoalbuminemia and critical illness that push toward meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin rather than ertapenem initially [^38b90ac5] [^47f73a65].

> Next, I should review the infection site, since urinary tract infections, especially uncomplicated cystitis, allow more oral and non-carbapenem options than bloodstream or intra-abdominal infections. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: for uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX are preferred if susceptible; for pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, oral fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX are preferred if susceptible, with carbapenems reserved when oral agents are inactive or not tolerated; for non-urinary infections, carbapenems are preferred first-line, and I should not overgeneralize exceptions without checking the evidence base [^b7255428] [^ce01c77f] [^38b90ac5].

> I will now examine first-line therapy for severe or non-urinary ESBL-E infections. Carbapenems remain the cornerstone, with meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem as acceptable choices; however, I need to ensure I prioritize meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin in critically ill patients or those with hypoalbuminemia, given observational signals of higher mortality with ertapenem in hypoalbuminemia and the MERINO trial data showing inferior outcomes with piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL bloodstream infection, which I should keep front-of-mind when selecting therapy [^38b90ac5] [^be16052a] [^06875937].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about piperacillin-tazobactam. I initially thought it might be reasonable for non-urinary ESBL-E if the MIC is low, but wait, I should double-check the highest-quality evidence. The MERINO randomized trial demonstrated higher 30-day mortality with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem for ESBL bloodstream infection, and IDSA subsequently advises against piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL-E infections outside the urinary tract, even if susceptible; thus, I should correct my earlier inclination and avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for these indications despite in vitro susceptibility [^06875937] [^ad9c486b].

> Let me consider oral and non-carbapenem options for uncomplicated cystitis. Nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX are preferred if susceptible, with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, a single-dose aminoglycoside, or oral fosfomycin for E. coli as alternatives; I should confirm that amoxicillin-clavulanate is not recommended due to lower clinical cure and higher vaginal colonization in comparative data, and I need to ensure I do not extend these oral options to pyelonephritis or non-urinary disease where carbapenems or carefully selected oral fluoroquinolones are preferred if active [^b7255428] [^fa253dbf].

> For pyelonephritis or complicated UTI due to ESBL-E, I should confirm that oral fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX are preferred when susceptible, with carbapenems as preferred parenteral options if resistance or intolerance preclude oral therapy; aminoglycosides are reasonable alternatives, though I need to weigh nephrotoxicity and consider once-daily dosing and duration-limited courses, and I should remember that fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI due to limited parenchymal penetration despite in vitro activity [^ce01c77f] [^868445cc].

> Now, I need to check special scenarios and stewardship guardrails. Newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and cefiderocol have activity against ESBL-E but should be preferentially reserved for carbapenem-resistant organisms or polymicrobial infections including CRE, rather than used routinely for ESBL-E; I should confirm that this reservation is explicitly recommended to preserve these agents and align with stewardship principles [^edefd257] [^fccdbb51].

> But wait, what if cefepime tests susceptible? Should I use it for ESBL-E infections outside the urinary tract? I should confirm that IDSA advises against cefepime for pyelonephritis, complicated UTI, and non-urinary ESBL-E infections due to concerns about ESBL hydrolysis, unreliable MIC testing, and lack of supportive clinical trial data, even if the lab reports susceptibility; the exception is that if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis and the patient is improving, no change is needed, which I should state clearly to avoid overcorrection [^9c8963d8] [^1f75f357].

> Next, I should review pediatric considerations. IDSA guidance applies to adults and children, and while pediatric-specific PK/PD and trial data are more limited, the same principles hold: carbapenems for severe or non-urinary ESBL-E, oral agents for susceptible uncomplicated cystitis, and careful attention to local epidemiology and susceptibilities; I need to ensure dosing adjustments and monitoring plans are age-appropriate when I operationalize this [^38b90ac5] [^be16052a].

> I should double-check the role of cephamycins. IDSA does not suggest cephamycins for ESBL-E infections, including uncomplicated cystitis, due to mixed and generally unfavorable outcomes data and lack of optimal dosing strategies, so I should avoid cefoxitin or cefotetan for these infections despite historical interest in carbapenem-sparing strategies [^e8ab118e] [^5f826204].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against the references. For severe infection or non-urinary ESBL-E, use meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, consider ertapenem in stable, non-critically ill patients with normal albumin, and avoid piperacillin-tazobactam; for uncomplicated cystitis, use nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX if susceptible, with fluoroquinolones, single-dose aminoglycoside, or fosfomycin for E. coli as alternatives; for pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, prefer oral fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX if susceptible, otherwise use ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem-cilastatin, with aminoglycosides as alternatives; reserve newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors for CRE or select polymicrobial scenarios; and avoid cefepime outside of the narrow exception for improving uncomplicated cystitis started empirically [^38b90ac5] [^b7255428] [^ce01c77f] [^edefd257] [^9c8963d8].

> Finally, I need to ensure I incorporate stewardship and follow-up. I should confirm susceptibilities as soon as possible, de-escalate from carbapenems to active oral agents when clinically appropriate, and avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum therapy; I should also remember that removing the ESBL designation from routine reports can inadvertently increase piperacillin-tazobactam use, so I must communicate clearly with microbiology and stewardship teams to align reporting with guideline-concordant therapy [^38b90ac5] [^28544294].

---

Carbapenems are the **first-line therapy** for severe ESBL infections, with meropenem or imipenem preferred in critically ill patients and ertapenem for stable patients or outpatient therapy [^38b90ac5] [^be16052a]. For uncomplicated UTIs, **nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX** are preferred if susceptible, with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or a single-dose aminoglycoside as alternatives [^b7255428] [^084d1a72]. Piperacillin-tazobactam is **not recommended** for ESBL bloodstream or severe infections due to inferior outcomes, though it may be considered for susceptible UTIs [^ad9c486b] [^35a6f408]. Cefepime should be avoided for ESBL infections outside the urinary tract, even if susceptible, due to clinical failure risk [^9c8963d8] [^1f75f357]. Newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. ceftazidime-avibactam) are reserved for carbapenem-resistant organisms or when carbapenems are contraindicated [^edefd257] [^fccdbb51].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

### Carbapenems

Carbapenems are the **preferred first-line therapy** for severe ESBL infections, including bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and intra-abdominal infections [^38b90ac5] [^be16052a]. They provide broad-spectrum coverage and are highly effective against ESBL-producing organisms [^c98612f4]. Preferred carbapenems include:

- **Meropenem**: Preferred in critically ill patients or those with hypoalbuminemia due to its robust tissue penetration and clinical efficacy [^38b90ac5] [^be16052a].
- **Imipenem-cilastatin**: Alternative carbapenem with similar efficacy to meropenem [^38b90ac5] [^be16052a].
- **Ertapenem**: Suitable for stable patients or outpatient therapy due to once-daily dosing; however, it is not recommended for critically ill patients or those with hypoalbuminemia [^38b90ac5] [^be16052a].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapy

### Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, have been studied as **carbapenem-sparing options**. However, recent evidence suggests inferior outcomes compared to carbapenems, particularly in bloodstream infections [^06875937] [^b5e05467]. Current guidelines recommend against the use of piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL bloodstream infections or severe infections outside the urinary tract [^ad9c486b] [^be16052a]. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be considered for uncomplicated UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms if susceptibility is demonstrated, but caution is advised due to variability in susceptibility testing and clinical outcomes [^35a6f408] [^06875937].

---

### Fluoroquinolones

Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, are **effective alternatives** for uncomplicated UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms if susceptibility is demonstrated [^b7255428] [^084d1a72]. They are not recommended for severe infections or bloodstream infections due to the risk of treatment failure and resistance development [^notfound].

---

### Aminoglycosides

Aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin, are **alternative options** for uncomplicated UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms [^b7255428] [^084d1a72]. They are particularly useful as single-dose therapy for uncomplicated cystitis, but their use is limited by nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity risks [^868445cc].

---

### Oral agents for uncomplicated UTIs

For uncomplicated UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms, the following **oral agents are recommended** if susceptibility is demonstrated:

| **Antibiotic** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | Preferred |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) | Preferred |
| Ciprofloxacin | Alternative |
| Levofloxacin | Alternative |
| Fosfomycin (for E. coli only) | Alternative |
| Aminoglycosides (single dose) | Alternative |

---

## Antibiotics to avoid

Certain antibiotics should be **avoided** in the treatment of ESBL infections:

- **Cefepime**: Despite in vitro susceptibility, cefepime should be avoided for ESBL infections outside the urinary tract due to clinical failure risk [^9c8963d8] [^1f75f357].
- **Piperacillin-tazobactam**: Not recommended for ESBL bloodstream infections or severe infections outside the urinary tract due to inferior outcomes [^ad9c486b] [^be16052a].
- **Cephamycins (e.g. cefoxitin, cefotetan)**: Not recommended due to limited clinical evidence and potential for inferior outcomes [^e8ab118e] [^5f826204].

---

## Emerging therapies

Newer **beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations**, such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam, have demonstrated activity against ESBL-producing organisms [^bd930a92]. However, current guidelines recommend reserving these agents for carbapenem-resistant organisms or when carbapenems are contraindicated, due to concerns about resistance development and cost [^edefd257] [^fccdbb51].

---

## Clinical outcomes and considerations

Prompt initiation of **appropriate antibiotic therapy** is critical in the management of ESBL infections, as delays are associated with increased mortality and morbidity [^40c4fd2e]. Clinical outcomes vary depending on the severity of infection, patient comorbidities, and the antibiotic chosen. Carbapenems consistently demonstrate superior clinical outcomes compared to alternative therapies, particularly in severe infections [^be16052a] [^70e3a939].

---

Carbapenems remain the **first-line therapy** for severe ESBL infections, while fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and oral agents are suitable alternatives for uncomplicated UTIs. Piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime should be avoided in severe infections due to inferior outcomes. Emerging therapies are reserved for specific cases, and antibiotic selection should be guided by susceptibility testing, patient factors, and clinical judgment.

### Current options for the treatment of infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in different groups of patients [^800ad962]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are a frequent cause of invasive infections worldwide. Carbapenems are nowadays the most used drugs to treat these infections. However, due to the increasing rates of resistance to these antimicrobials, carbapenem-sparing alternatives are being investigated.

Objectives and Sources

The aim of this narrative literature review is to summarize the published information on the currently available antibiotics for the treatment of ESBL-E infections, providing specific information on three subgroups of patients: Group 1, patients with severe infections or infections from high-risk sources or in severely immunocompromised patients; Group 2, patients with non-severe infections from intermediate-risk source; and Group 3, patients with non-severe urinary tract infection.

Content and Implications

For patients in Group 1, the current data would support the use of carbapenems. For milder infections, however, particularly urinary tract infections, other non-carbapenem antibiotics can be considered in selected cases, including beta-lactam/beta-lactam inhibitor combinations, cephamycins, temocillin and aminoglycosides. While specific studies should be performed in these situations, individualized decisions may be taken in order to avoid overuse of carbapenems.

### Risks of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^0b25f120]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are an increasingly important cause of multi-drug resistant infections throughout the world.1,2 Bacteria carrying such enzymes have long been recognised as a cause of healthcare-associated infection.3 However, of concern, the incidence of such organisms also appears to be increasing in the community, typically as a cause of urinary tract infection.1,4 Infections due to ESBL-producing organisms can pose a major threat to life; are often difficult and expensive to treat; and can delay discharge from hospital.5(-)8 Here we discuss the bacteria that produce ESBLs and treatment of patients who are infected with such organisms.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases and clinical outcomes: current data [^a86cc37b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Nosocomial infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria complicate therapy and limit treatment options. However, the clinical significance of infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria remains unclear. A critical examination of the literature provides divergent views of the effect of ESBL carriage on morbidity and mortality and suggests that ESBL production may have its most marked effect on ceftazidime. Effective strategies for the empirical and directed treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens include the use of carbapenems and, possibly, the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. Studies indicate that the use of cefepime to treat serious nosocomial infections (e.g., bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections) is associated with high rates of microbiological and clinical success. The probability of attaining time above the minimum inhibitory concentration targets of at least 70% of the dosing interval, an important pharmacodynamic indicator of clinical success, is higher with cefepime than with other antimicrobials against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains exhibiting ESBL phenotypes. However, for non-ESBL-producing strains, there is no difference in the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration between ceftazidime and cefepime. When used appropriately in institutional settings, cefepime reduces the overall use of cephalosporins, thereby decreasing selection pressure for presumptive ESBL-producing pathogens.

### The continuing plague of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae infections [^f7ee5570]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a common iatrogenic complication of modern life and medical care. One of the most demonstrative examples is the exponential increase in the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) production among Enterobacteriaceae, which is the most common human pathogens outside of the hospital settings. Infections resulting from ESBL-producing bacteria are associated with devastating outcomes, now affecting even previously healthy individuals. This development poses an enormous burden and threat to public health. This paper aims to narrate the evolving epidemiology of ESBL infections, and highlight current challenges in terms of management and prevention of these common infections.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases: implications for the clinical microbiology laboratory, therapy, and infection control [^26d76dd0]. The Journal of Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacilli are a growing concern in human medicine today. When producing these enzymes, organisms (mostly K. pneumoniae and E. coli) become highly efficient at inactivating the newer third-generation cephaloporins (such as cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). In addition, ESBL-producing bacteria are frequently resistant to many classes of non-beta-lactam antibiotics, resulting in difficult-to-treat infections. This review gives an introduction into the topic and is focused on various aspects of ESBLs; it covers the current epidemiology, the problems of ESBL detection and the clinical relevance of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. Therapeutic options and potential strategies for dealing with this growing problem are also discussed in this article.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: an emerging public-health concern [^54a21c7e]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

The medical community relies on clinical expertise and published guidelines to assist physicians with choices in empirical therapy for system-based infectious syndromes, such as community-acquired pneumonia and urinary-tract infections (UTIs). From the late 1990s, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (mostly Escherichia coli) that produce extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs), such as the CTX-M enzymes, have emerged within the community setting as an important cause of UTIs. Recent reports have also described ESBL-producing E coli as a cause of bloodstream infections associated with these community-onset UTIs. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although comparative clinical trials are scarce. Thus, more rapid diagnostic testing of ESBL-producing bacteria and the possible modification of guidelines for community-onset bacteraemia associated with UTIs are required.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases: a challenge for clinical microbiologists and infection control specialists [^5d5e0d41]. American Journal of Infection Control (2005). Low credibility.

Since first reported in Europe in the early 1980s, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have spread worldwide. When producing these broad-spectrum plasmid-encoded enzymes, organisms become highly effective at inactivating penicillins, most cephalosporins, and aztreonam. Mainly produced by Klebsiella spp, ESBLs have been isolated worldwide in different species, most of them belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae. ESBL-producing bacteria can appear as in vitro susceptible to beta-lactams by conventional laboratory methods, making the laboratory diagnosis problematic. Once detected, all beta-lactams except carbapenem and beta-lactamase inhibitor compounds should be reported as resistant. In addition, organisms harboring ESBLs are frequently resistant to other antibiotic classes, such as fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Because of the very limited remaining alternatives for treatment and ESBLs significant prevalence worldwide, infection control remains the best way to deal with this bacterial resistance mechanism.

### Β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae: time for a reappraisal in the era of few antibiotic options? [^e79c12ba]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes in Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp is a major challenge to modern medical practice. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL producers; however, carbapenem resistance has increased globally. ESBL producers might be susceptible to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combination antibiotics such piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate. These drugs are frequently avoided in serious infections caused by ESBL producers because of the inoculum effect in-vitro (especially for piperacillin-tazobactam), animal data suggesting inferior efficacy when compared with carbapenems, concerns about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug target attainment with standard doses, and poor outcomes shown in some observational studies. Prospective cohort data and a meta-analysis suggest that BLBLIs are non-inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ESBL producers. We examine why BLBLIs are perceived as inferior in the treatment of infection with ESBL producers, and discuss data that suggest these concerns might not be strongly supported by clinical evidence.

### Evolution and epidemiology of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and ESBL-producing microorganisms [^10735927]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

The rapid and irrepressible increase in antimicrobial resistance of pathogenic bacteria that has been observed over the last two decades is widely accepted to be one of the major problems of human medicine today. Several aspects of this situation are especially worrying. There are resistance mechanisms that eliminate the use of last-choice antibiotics in the treatment of various kinds of infection. Many resistance mechanisms that emerge and spread in bacterial populations are those of wide activity spectra, which compromise all or a majority of drugs belonging to a given therapeutic group. Some mechanisms of great clinical importance require specific detection procedures, as they may not confer clear resistance in vitro on the basis of the interpretive criteria used in standard susceptibility testing. Finally, multiple mechanisms affecting the same and/or different groups of antimicrobials coexist and are even co-selected in more and more strains of pathogenic bacteria. The variety of beta-lactamases with wide spectra of substrate specificity illustrates very well all the phenomena mentioned above. Being able to hydrolyze the majority of beta-lactams that are currently in use, together they constitute the most important resistance mechanism of Gram-negative rods. Three major groups of these enzymes are usually distinguished, class C cephalosporinases (AmpC), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and different types of beta-lactamases with carbapenemase activity, of which the so-called class B metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are of the greatest concern. This review is focused on various aspects of the evolution and epidemiology of ESBLs; it does not cover the problems of ESBL detection and clinical relevance of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms.

### The continuing plague of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterbacterales infections: an update [^7e26a434]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a common iatrogenic complication of modern life and medical care. One of the most demonstrative examples is the exponential increase in the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) production among Enterobacteriaceae, that is, the most common human pathogens outside of the hospital setting. Infections resulting from ESBL-producing bacteria are associated with devastating outcomes, now affecting even previously healthy individuals. This poses an enormous burden and threat to public health. This article aims to narrate the evolving epidemiology of ESBL infections and highlights current challenges in terms of management and prevention of these common infections.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases in ambulatory care: a clinical perspective [^28b61990]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms are emerging as a cause of infection in outpatients in many areas of the world. Most of these involve urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli harbouring CTX-M types of ESBLs. Risk-factors for such infections include older age and previous use of quinolones and cephalosporins. Oral alternatives for such infections are limited. These organisms may also cause some community-acquired life-threatening infections, such as bacteraemic urinary tract or intra-abdominal infections. Patients with these infections are at increased probability of receiving inappropriate empirical treatment. More studies addressing the risk-factors and therapeutic options for these infections are needed.

### Extended spectrum beta lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections: a review of the literature [^4cc66ce5]. Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae, are increasing. The epidemiology of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, the mechanisms of resistance, and treatment strategies for infections caused by these organisms are reviewed.

### Antibiotic policy and prescribing strategies for therapy of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: the role of piperacillin-tazobactam [^35b0c832]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Therapy of infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria with an antimicrobial to which they are resistant results in treatment failure, higher cost and increased mortality. The CLSI recommends reporting ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. as resistant to all penicillin, true cephalosporin and monobactam antimicrobials, but as susceptible to beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, including piperacillin-tazobactam, when they test as such. Current literature supports the action of piperacillin-tazobactam against susceptible strains of ESBL-producing bacteria based on the structure-activity relationship between inhibitors and the ESBLs, as well as on recent clinical outcome studies.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-Negative infections [^47f73a65]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections. This guidance document focuses on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), AmpC β- lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR P. aeruginosa), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This updated document replaces previous versions of the guidance document.

Methods

A panel of six infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial- resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-E, AmpC-E, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa, CRAB, and S. maltophilia.

### The use of noncarbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase infections [^18a3a3e1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The continued rise in infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens is recognized globally as one of the most pressing concerns facing the healthcare community. Carbapenems are widely regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of ESBL-producing infections, even when in vitro activity to other β-lactams has been demonstrated. However, indiscriminant carbapenem use is not without consequence, and carbapenem overuse has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The use of non-carbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of ESBL infections has yielded conflicting results. In this review, we discuss the available data for the use of cephamycins, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam for the treatment of ESBL infections.

### ESBL-producing enterobacterales in healthcare settings… [^14c798ef]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

To survive the effects of antibiotics, germs are constantly finding new defense strategies, called "resistance mechanisms. " For example, some Enterobacterales can produce enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. ESBL enzymes break down and destroy some commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins, and make these drugs ineffective for treating infections. Learn about CRE Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales This resistance means that there are fewer antibiotic options available to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections. In many cases, even common infections, such as urinary tract infections, caused by ESBL-producing germs require more complex treatments. Instead of taking oral antibiotics at home, patients with these infections might require hospitalization and intravenous carbapenem antibiotics.

See CDC's report Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 Carbapenems are one of the few remaining antibiotics that can treat ESBL-producing germs, but resistance enzymes that destroy these antibiotics are on the rise, too. The more we rely on this important class of antibiotics, the greater the risk of spreading resistance to them. Who is at risk. These infections most commonly occur in people with exposure to healthcare, including those in hospitals and nursing homes. However, unlike many other resistant germs, ESBL-producing Enterobacterales can also cause infections in otherwise healthy people who have not been recently been in healthcare settings. In healthy people, this often means urinary tract infections. ESBL germs have also been identified in people returning to the United States after traveling abroad, especially to places where these germs are more commonly found. Top of Page. How are these infections treated.

Infections caused by ESBL-producing germs are treated with antibiotics, but because they are resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics, treatment options might be limited. People with these infections sometimes need to be hospitalized for treatment with IV antibiotics. Carbapenem antibiotics, which are typically reserved for highly resistant infections, are often used to treat serious ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections. Top of Page. What is CDC doing to address these infections. CDC and partners are working to assess and understand why infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales have increased since 2012. Top of Page.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This guidance document focuses on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This updated document replaces previous versions of the guidance document.

### Controversies over the management of infections caused by amp-C-and ESBL-producing enterobacterales: what questions remain for future studies? [^c66b99dc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The continuous rise in infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales) is a major health concern. Carbapenems are regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of these infections. However, their indiscriminant use is not without consequences, and has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. In this review, we discuss the available evidence supporting the use of other betalactams, nonbetalactams and the new betalactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLA/BLI) to treat these infections. We also analyze unresolved issues in this field.

Recent Findings

Piperacillin tazobactam (PTZ) was classically recommended as a carbapenem-sparing agent. However, data have emerged against its use and it is now a controversial recommendation. IDSA, European and British guidelines reject the empirical use of PTZ for these pathogens, reserving its use for rare clinical situations. Other issues that continue to generate debate are the use of extended infusion (3h) PTZ, the use of older antibiotics, a shortened course of carbapenems and reserving the new BLA/BLI for these infections.

Summary

New treatment strategies should be based on clinical evidence, local epidemiology and the microbiological activity of these drugs.

### Role of new antibiotics in extended-spectrum β-lactamase-, ampC-infections [^bd930a92]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)- and ampicillinase class C (AmpC)-producing Enterobacterales represent one of the major public threats of the current era. As a consequence, during the last decades there have been great efforts to develop new therapeutic agents against these microorganisms. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical features associated with novel antibiotics with activity against ESBL- and AmpC-producing isolates.

Recent Findings

There a number of therapeutic agents with activity against ESBL and AmpC than have been introduced and approved over the past few years. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious Gram-negative infections. Other new β-lactams/ β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. cefepime-enmetazobactam; ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam; aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam) as well as eravacycline, omadacycline, and plazomicin are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL- and AmpC- infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy in comparison to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/ β-lactamase inhibitors remains to be clarified.

Summary

New therapeutic agents against ESBL- and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their use in patients with serious infections due to ESBL- and/or AmpC- infections.

### Overview of the epidemiological profile and laboratory detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^ad1853d3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are plasmid-mediated bacterial enzymes that confer resistance to a broad range of beta-lactams. They are descended by genetic mutation from native beta-lactamases found in gram-negative bacteria, especially infectious strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Genetic sequence modifications have broadened the substrate specificity of the enzymes to include third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftazidime. Because ESBL-producing strains are resistant to a wide variety of commonly used antimicrobials, their proliferation poses a serious global health concern that has complicated treatment strategies for a growing number of hospitalized patients. Another resistance mechanism, also common to Enterobacteriaceae, results from the overproduction of chromosomal or plasmid-derived AmpC beta-lactamases. These organisms share an antimicrobial resistance pattern similar to that of ESBL-producing organisms, with the prominent exception that, unlike most ESBLs, AmpC enzymes are not inhibited by clavulanate and similar beta-lactamase inhibitors. Recent technological improvements in testing and in the development of uniform standards for both ESBL detection and confirmatory testing promise to make accurate identification of ESBL-producing organisms more accessible to clinical laboratories.

### Is It time to rethink the notion of carbapenem-sparing therapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections? A critical review [^0122c8f3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To present systematic recommendations for carbapenem-sparing therapy against extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections (BSIs) derived from a critical review of clinical data.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search using PubMed and MEDLINE databases (January 1, 2012, to June 30, 2017) was performed using key MESH terms: ESBL or extended-spectrum β-lactamases and bacteremia or bloodstream infection with piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, cefepime, cephamycins, carbapenem, doripenem, meropenem, and ertapenem. References within articles of interest were also evaluated.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English language trials were considered, and results were limited to clinical efficacy trials. Articles were screened by title and abstract for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Studies comparing noncarbapenem versus carbapenem therapy for ESBL BSIs were critically analyzed to identify heterogeneity among studies. Data abstracted included empirical or definitive therapy, patient population, dosing, source of infection and severity, infectious etiology, and outcome.

Conclusions

Completely sparing carbapenem therapy cannot be justified among patients with ESBL BSIs. Determining the source of infection is critical to identify patients for whom carbapenem-sparing therapy is appropriate.

### Innovative approaches in phenotypic β-lactamase detection for personalised infection management [^c98612f4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are a rapidly evolving group of beta-lactamases. To date, the total number of characterised ESBLs exceeds 400. Historically, TEM and SHV-type ESBLs were the most prevalent, but since the early 2000s, CTX-M-type enzymes have been the most common ESBL, with the CTX-M-15 variant dominating worldwide. ESBLs are defined by their ability to hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins, oxyaminopenicillins, and the monobactam aztreonam, but can be inhibited by clavulanic acid in vitro. ESBL-producing organisms can also exhibit resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. This often leaves limited treatment options due to co-inheritance of resistance mechanisms on the plasmid, such as plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and plasmid-mediated dihydrofolate reductase isoforms driving sulphonamide resistance. As a result, carbapenems are considered the drug of choice against ESBL infections. In 2017, there were an estimated 197,400 cases of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae among hospitalised patients and 9100 estimated deaths in the United States.

### Antibiotic utilization: is there an effect on antimicrobial resistance? [^d63aae12]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

The antimicrobial resistance problem in hospitals continues to worsen. In particular, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. Treating infections caused by these pathogens presents therapeutic dilemmas. The association between broad-spectrum beta-lactam overutilization and selection for ESBL-KP has been appreciated for some time; several institutions have reported a decrease in the prevalence of ESBL-KP with a shift in antibiotic utilization from third-generation cephalosporins to other broad-spectrum drugs. Currently, optimal treatment of ESBL-KP includes the carbapenems, but widespread use of these drugs is expensive and may be associated with further selection of antibiotic resistance and/or superinfection with other inherently resistant pathogens. VRE are especially difficult organisms to treat because of their inherent and acquired resistance to most currently available antibiotics. The prevalence of VRE has also been documented to decrease upon a shift in antibiotic use from third-generation cephalosporins to broad-spectrum antibiotics of other classes. Thus, antibiotic utilization measures appear to contribute to the control of the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as ESBL-KP and VRE.

### Treatment of infections with ESBL-producing organisms: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations [^afbea62d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Susceptibility surveillance investigations have demonstrated an increased incidence of ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli. Case cohort studies have suggested clinical relevance associated with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaciae infection. Yet, current laboratory reporting guidelines classify a large percentage of these organisms in the susceptible category. The regulatory agencies Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (formly NCCLS) and EUCAST, which oversee these guidelines are in the process of re-evaluating the appropriateness of the current classification system. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies examine the relationship between drug exposure (pharmacokinetics), antibiotic potency (MIC), and treatment efficacy. PK/PD studies and analyses have been useful in demonstrating the relevance of increasingly less susceptible pathogens and specific emerging resistance mechanisms. Recent investigations have examined the impact of ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacilli relative to advanced generation cephalosporin pharmacokinetics. Animal model studies suggest that the pharmacodynamic target associated with efficacy in treatment of ESBL-producing organisms is the same as that in therapy against non-ESBL-producing bacteria (50% T > MIC). Simulation of human pharmacokinetics can predict the likelihood of achieving this PD target with specific cephalosporin dosing regimens. In general, the exposure from usual regimens of the advanced generation cephalosporins would not be anticipated to achieve the PD target for many of the organisms currently classified as susceptible. PK/PD analyses should be useful in re-evaluating current susceptibility breakpoints for ESBL-producing organisms and for optimising drug and regimen choice in treatment of these infections.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^70e3a939]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infection — carbapenem preference and extrapolation: In those with clinical isolates available for retesting, 30-day mortality occurred in 9% vs 4% in the piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem arms, respectively, and although the 95% confidence interval ranged from −1% to 11%, the panel still suggests carbapenem therapy as the preferred treatment of ESBL-producing bloodstream infections. Comparable clinical trial data are not available for ESBL-E infections from other body sites, but the panel suggests extrapolating evidence for ESBL-E bloodstream infections to other common sites of infection, and suggests extending the findings to imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem, with the latter limited to patients with normal serum albumin and patients who are not critically ill.

### Clinical outcomes with ertapenem as a first-line treatment option of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria [^4f7aa318]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative organisms are a growing concern in hospitalized patients. Traditionally, these infections can be effectively treated by the carbapenem class of drugs. In 2005, our institution initiated a protocol for use of ertapenem, a carbapenem, as the first-line treatment option for these infections. It is unknown whether ertapenem is associated with similar clinical response and microbiologic cure rates as those achieved with group 2 carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem).

Objective

To describe clinical response and microbiologic cure rates associated with ertapenem as first-line treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms.

Methods

This case series included patients who received ertapenem for more than 48 hours to treat a documented infection with a positive culture for an ESBL-producing organism. Efficacy was determined by the clinical response and microbiologic cure rates achieved with ertapenem.

Results

Seventy-three patients received ertapenem for a mean (SD) of 10.7 (5.9) days. The most common (59%) infection site was urine. The most common causative organisms were ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (47%) and Escherichia coli (48%). Clinical response was observed in 78% of patients. Microbiologic cure was achieved in 92% of the evaluable population (n = 50). There were no significant differences in clinical or microbiologic cure rates across important subgroups.

Conclusions

Patients treated with ertapenem achieved favorable clinical response and microbiologic cure rates. Our data suggest that ertapenem can be used as an alternative to group 2 carbapenems for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing gram-negative organisms.

### Epidemiology and management of emerging drug-resistant Gram-Negative bacteria: extended-spectrum β-lactamases and beyond [^63aa1c97]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Worldwide prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is rapidly increasing, primarily a result of antibiotic misuse in the medical community. Resistant infections involving the urinary tract are typically caused by gram-negative bacteria. When treating these infections, clinicians have few effective antimicrobials to choose from and many are associated with significant adverse effects. There are now situations when clinicians are tasked with managing infections from pan-resistant organisms; thus, it is of paramount importance that spread of resistance be controlled. This review discusses common gram-negative resistance classes, highlighting the mechanisms of resistance, risk factors, type of infections, treatment, and outcomes associated with each class.

### Evolution and clinical importance of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^fb9ed04c]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

In the process of evolution, bacteria have acquired well-developed mechanisms of resistance to an extensive array of hostile substances. This time-tempered system of defense is so intricate and adaptable that contemporary medicine has been hard-pressed to maintain an advantage. In this article, the processes responsible for bacterial resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases that have emerged to provide bacteria with formidable resistance to modern drugs. Avoidance of this problem requires limitations on extended-spectrum cephalosporin usage. While carbapenems are clearly the treatment of choice for infections caused by these pathogens, empirical use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors such as piperacillin/tazobactam has been associated with reduction in the prevalence of cephalosporin resistance.

### Β-lactams without a suicide inhibitor [^f7acf33f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Existing clinical studies concerning the impact of therapy with third-generation cephalosporins or cefepime on infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are retrospective, non-randomised, and have been carried out with a small number of patients and low-dosage schedules that lack PK-PD correlations with clinical efficacy. Rates of clinical failure and mortality are higher than those in studies with non-ESBL- producing Enterobacteriaceae. Therefore, in settings with a high prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, empirical therapy with advanced cephalosporins should be avoided. Temocillin, an old beta-lactam that is stable in the presence of both ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases, seems to deserve revival, although clinical data are limited.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^0344b90b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The first beta-lactamase was identified in an isolate of Escherichia coli in 1940. To date, there are > 130 TEM-type and > 50 sulfhydryl variable (SHV)-type beta-lactamases, mainly in E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis but also in other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family and in some nonenteric organisms, such as Acinetobacter species. The incidence of expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) varies, depending on which area of the globe the isolates originate from. ESBLs render the oxyimino-cephalosporins ineffective, and ESBL-producing organisms frequently also possess resistance factors to other classes of antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and possibly also piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. These results suggest that microbiology laboratories should routinely test for the presence of these strains among their isolates and that the antibiotics of choice for infections believed to be caused by these types of organisms are the carbapenems.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^b0e0ca3b]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

None of the antimicrobials currently in development has activity against the entire spectrum of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. The mortality associated with the failure rates from the current salvage therapies highlighted above is disconcerting. The treatment of serious infections with CRE remains an enormous challenge. A concerted global commitment to the intelligent use of antimicrobials, better antibiotic stewardship, the implementation of effective infection control strategies, and the development of more effective therapies are desperately needed.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of ampC β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections [^00cb971f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. A previous guidance document focused on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa). Here, guidance is provided for treating AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections. A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of AmpC-E, CRAB, and S. maltophilia infections. Answers are presented as suggested approaches and corresponding rationales. In contrast to guidance in the previous document, published data on the optimal treatment of AmpC-E, CRAB, and S. maltophilia infections are limited. As such, guidance in this document is provided as "suggested approaches" based on clinical experience, expert opinion, and a review of the available literature. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States. Preferred and alternative treatment suggestions are provided, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Suggestions apply for both adult and pediatric populations. The field of antimicrobial resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae: risk factors for infection and impact of resistance on outcomes [^f50c022b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The prevalence of antibiotic resistance among extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) — producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae has increased markedly in recent years. Thirty-three patients with infection due to ESBL-producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae (case patients) were compared with 66 matched controls. Total prior antibiotic use was the only independent risk factor for ESBL-producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae infection (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.18; P = 0.006). Case patients were treated with an effective antibiotic a median of 72 hours after infection was suspected, compared with a median of 11.5 hours after infection was suspected for controls (P < .001). ESBL-producing E. coli or K. pneumoniae infection was associated with a significantly longer duration of hospital stay and greater hospital charges (P = 0.01 and P < .001, respectively). Finally, many ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were closely related. ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae infections have a significant impact on several important clinical outcomes, and efforts to control outbreaks of infection with ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae should emphasize judicious use of all antibiotics as well as barrier precautions to reduce spread.

### Practice guidelines-resistant bacterial infections… [^f2205c4d]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- Complicated UTIs caused by resistant Enterobacterales can be treated with TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin. Nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are recommended for uncomplicated cystitis.
- Primary treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacterales that occur outside the urinary tract is carbapenems.
- Primary treatment of infections due to CRE that occur outside the urinary tract is medication that combines beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors.
- Primary treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections with difficult-to-treat resistance includes ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, or cefiderocol. From the AFP Editors Antimicrobial resistance is a global crisis, and resistant pathogens cause more than 2. 8 million infections and 35, 000 deaths annually. Even when bacterial cultures indicate resistance, choosing the most effective antibiotic can be challenging.

The global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is increasingly becoming a major challenge in clinical and public health settings. To date, the treatment for serious CRE infections remains difficult. The intelligent use of antimicrobials and effective infection control strategies is crucial to prevent further CRE spread. Early consultation with experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms is valuable in patient management. This brief review will focus on the current, yet limited, treatment options for CRE infections.

### Evaluation of the efficacy of piperacillin / tazobactam in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producingUrinary tract infections: a systematic review of the literature [^35a6f408]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam (PTZ) for the treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Data Sources

A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central through July 2024.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies providing efficacy data associated with PTZ in patients ≥ 18 years old experiencing an ESBL-PE UTI that documented clinical and microbiological cure data were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 577 articles were obtained for screening. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 7 studies comparing PTZ with carbapenems comprised of 1156 patient cases were analyzed. Piperacillin/tazobactam was found to be noninferior to carbapenems in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTI's caused by ESBL-PE. The observed noninferiority encompassed clinical response, clinical cure, and microbiological cure outcome metrics. Although not specifically evaluated in this systematic review, adverse effects associated with PTZ were found to be minimal and lesser in incidence than with the carbapenem comparators in aggregate.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

While a definitive dosing strategy remains elusive, a PTZ total daily dose of 13.5 g infused over 3 to 4 hours may be appropriate for this indication.

Conclusion

Piperacillin/tazobactam may be an effective carbapenem-sparing agent for the treatment of ESBL-PE UTIs that show in-vitro susceptibility to PTZ. However, additional robust randomized clinical trials are still needed to validate the findings of this review and determine the best dosage regimen of PTZ for ESBL-PE UTIs.

### Current trends in culture-based and molecular detection of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase-harboring and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^5dcce99a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

The ever-expanding role of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-harboring and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in causing serious infections poses a grave public health threat because these organisms also tend to be multidrug resistant, for which very few (if any) antibiotic options remain available. Rapid detection of such panresistant organisms offers one of the best solutions to improve patient screening and hospital infection control practices as well as curb inappropriate antibiotic use. This review discusses and compares primarily the current state-of-the-art culture-based and molecular methods that are commercially available for detection or screening of ESBL-harboring and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

### Multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) [^9fcb3dad]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

In 1983, just two years after the introduction of the oxymino-beta-lactams to the market, the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were isolated in Germany from Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Since then several outbreaks have been reported in many European countries and the USA, and nowadays in several places worldwide the problem seems to reach endemic dimensions, with rates exceeding 50% in some countries, such as Portugal and Turkey. On the other hand not only K. pneumoniae but also Escherichia coli strains, with Enterobacter aerogenes predominating among the other enterobacteriaceal species, are increasingly reported as ESBL producers. In this review types, molecular characteristics, detection methods, epidemiology as well as interventions for therapy and antibiotic strategies to prevent and control infections caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms, are presented and discussed.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^c17b06bd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) producing Enterobacteriaceae

Over the past few years a notable increase in antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative bacteria recovered from hospitalized patients has been reported, especially in critically ill patients.

During the last decade, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae has become a growing problem.

In the specific context of intra-abdominal infections, resistance to β-lactams, mediated by extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) is a particular concern.

Acquired resistance to beta-lactams is mainly mediated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) that confer resistance to the penicillins, first-, second-, and third-generation cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and are inhibited by b-lactamase inhibitors. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) which are encoded by genes that can be exchanged between bacteria. Beta-lactamase genes are often associated with resistance determinants to non-beta-lactam agents such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and strains producing ESBLs often exhibit complex multidrug resistant phenotypes and sometimes are panresistant. Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the drugs of choice for treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms in intra-abdominal infections even if, use of carbapenems has been associated with the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacterial species. Tigecycline has substantial antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae but it merits further evaluation.

Avoid using cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis, complicated UTIs, and infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to cefepime is demonstrated.

Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and carbapenems are alternative agents for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and although effective, their use is discouraged when nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are active. An aminoglycoside (as a single dose) and oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) are also alternative treatments for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and treatment suggestions for ESBL-E infections assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Efficacy of ertapenem for consolidation therapy of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing gram-negative infections: a case series report [^2650236c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative organisms are becoming increasingly common and present significant challenges in terms of treatment. Carbapenems is the antibiotic class of choice for treatment of these types of infections. Ertapenem is the newest carbapenem, capable of being dosed once daily, and has some in vitro but little in vivo evidence supporting its use for the treatment of these resistant infections.

Objective

To examine the clinical and microbiologic outcomes associated with ertapenem therapy of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis infections.

Methods

This was a retrospective case series that examined the clinical and microbiologic outcomes of 22 patients who received ertapenem for treatment of an ESBL infection at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, IL, during 2003–2005.

Results

The majority (16/22) of patients received ertapenem for consolidation rather than initial therapy. Different antibiotics most commonly used were other carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and aminoglycosides. The most common infections treated were lower urinary tract infections and osteomyelitis. Clinical efficacy was determined in all 22 patients, with 20 (91%) patients having a positive outcome, defined as either clinical improvement or clinical cure. The best clinical cure rate was seen with wound infections, where all 3 patients examined were found to be clinically cured. Microbiologic efficacy was determined in 7 patients, with 6 (85.7%) defined as microbiologic cure. One patient was found to be both a clinical and microbiologic failure and was also found to have developed an ertapenem-resistant strain of E. coli.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate potential microbiologic and clinical efficacy of ertapenem for treatment of ESBL-producing infections and the need for a prospective, randomized study examining its efficacy versus that of other carbapenems.

### Private benefit of β-lactamase dictates selection dynamics of combination antibiotic treatment [^a80444e3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

β-lactam antibiotics have been prescribed for most bacterial infections since their discovery. However, resistance to β-lactams, mediated by β-lactamase (Bla) enzymes such as extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), has become widespread. Bla inhibitors can restore the efficacy of β-lactams against resistant bacteria, an approach which preserves existing antibiotics despite declining industry investment. However, the effects of combination treatment on selection for β-lactam resistance are not well understood. Bla production confers both private benefits for resistant cells and public benefits which faster-growing sensitive cells can also exploit. These benefits may be differentially impacted by Bla inhibitors, leading to non-intuitive selection dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate strain-to-strain variation in effective combination doses, with complex growth dynamics in mixed populations. Using modeling, we derive a criterion for the selection outcome of combination treatment, dependent on the burden and effective private benefit of Bla production. We then use engineered strains and natural isolates to show that strong private benefits of Bla are associated with increased selection for resistance. Finally, we demonstrate that this parameter can be coarsely estimated using high-throughput phenotyping of clonal populations. Our analysis shows that quantifying the phenotypic responses of bacteria to combination treatment can facilitate resistance-minimizing optimization of treatment.

### The management of multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^99c657c6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae are often related to the production of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and represent an increasing global threat. Recommendations for the therapeutic management of MDR-related infections, however, are mainly derived from retrospective and nonrandomized prospective studies. The aim of this review is to discuss the challenges in the treatment of patients with infections because of MDR Enterobacteriaceae and provide an expert opinion while awaiting for more definitive data.

Recent Findings

To avoid the selection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-sparing strategies should be considered. B-lactams/b-lactamase inhibitors, mainly piperacillin-tazobactam, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 16/4mg/ml or less represents the best alternative to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL-producing strains. Overall, combination therapy may be preferred over monotherapy for CRE. The combination of a carbapenem-containing regimen with colistin or high-dose tigecycline or aminoglycoside can be administered at high-dose prolonged infusion with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of CRE with MIC for meropenem 8–16 mg/l or less. For MIC higher than 8–16 mg/l, the use of meropenem should be avoided and various combination therapies based on the in-vitro susceptibility of antimicrobials (e.g., colistin, high-dose tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides) should be selected.

Summary

Carbapenem-sparing strategies should be used, when feasible, for ESBL infections. The majority of available nonrandomized studies highlight that combination for CRE seem to offer some therapeutic advantage over monotherapy. Strict infection control measures toward MDR Gram-negative pathogens remain necessary while awaiting for new treatment options.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^7eca961a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E background — enzymatic activity, prevalence, and laboratory detection are outlined as follows: ESBLs are enzymes that inactivate most penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and ESBLs do not inactivate non-β-lactam agents such as ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), gentamicin, and doxycycline, although organisms carrying ESBL genes often harbor additional genes or mutations in genes expanding their resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. ESBL genes are most prevalent in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis. Routine ESBL testing is not performed by most clinical microbiology laboratories; rather, non-susceptibility to ceftriaxone (ie, ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] ≥ 2 μg/mL), is often used as a proxy for ESBL production, although this threshold has limitations, and for this guidance document, ESBL-E refers to presumed or confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or P. mirabilis.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Is carbapenem therapy necessary for the treatment of non-CTX-M extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales bloodstream infections? [^e0bba9db]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Investigations into antibiotics for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infections (BSIs) have focused on blaCTX-M genes. Patient outcomes from non-CTX-M-producing ESBL-E BSIs and optimal treatment are unknown.

Methods

A multicenter observational study investigating 500 consecutive patients with ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacterales BSIs during 2018–2022 was conducted. Broth microdilution and whole-genome sequencing confirmed antibiotic susceptibilities and ESBL gene presence, respectively. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) using propensity scores ensured patients with non-CTX-M and CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs were similar before outcome evaluation.

Results

396 patients (79.2%) were confirmed to have an ESBL-E BSI. ESBL gene family prevalence was as follows: blaCTX-M (n = 370), blaSHV (n = 16), blaOXY (n = 12), and blaVEB (n = 5). ESBL gene identification was not limited to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. In the IPW cohort, there was no difference in 30-day mortality or ESBL-E infection recurrence between the non-CTX-M and CTX-M groups (odds ratio [OR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI].87–1.11; P = 0.83 and OR, 1.10; 95% CI, .85–1.42; P = 0.47, respectively). In an exploratory analysis limited to the non-CTX-M group, 86% of the 21 patients who received meropenem were alive on day 30; none of the 5 patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam were alive on day 30.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that non-CTX-M and CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs are equally concerning and associated with similar clinical outcomes. Meropenem may be associated with improved survival in patients with non-CTX-M ESBL-E BSIs, underscoring the potential benefit of comprehensive molecular diagnostics to enable early antibiotic optimization for ESBL-E BSIs beyond just blaCTX-M genes.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^40c4fd2e]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Despite the progress made in medical management over the past few decades, sepsis remains an important global health problem causing millions of deaths around the world. One essential facet of sepsis management is the administration of appropriate antimicrobials. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that failure or delay in the administration of appropriate antimicrobials is associated with substantial increases in the mortality of sepsis. On the basis of the evidence, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommended empiric broad-spectrum therapy to cover all likely pathogens as soon as possible after sepsis is recognized.

Broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics are commonly used as empiric therapy for sepsis. Among them, carbapenems offer an exceptionally broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The existing evidence suggests that carbapenems are associated with relatively low mortality in several infectious diseases, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens. For these reasons, carbapenems are the preferably used antibiotics for the initial treatment of sepsis, and consumption of carbapenem has been reported to be increasing in different parts of the world. However, indiscriminate use of carbapenems against sepsis should be avoided because it has contributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, updating knowledge on the efficacy of alternative empiric regimens for sepsis is required.

The fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime and cefpirome, and piperacillin/tazobactam are nearly equal to carbapenems in antimicrobial activity and thus are considered alternative therapies against sepsis. Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of carbapenems compared with these antibiotics against several specific pathogens, such as Acinetobacter species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. However, there is little evidence of the efficacy of carbapenems against unidentified mixed pathogens. Causative pathogens are not usually identified at the time of initiating antibiotics in sepsis because of the strong recommendation to initiate immediate treatment, ideally within 1 hour after sepsis is first suspected. Thus, there is a significant need to comprehensively evaluate differences in mortality and morbidities between carbapenems versus noncarbapenem broad-spectrum antibiotics as initial treatment of sepsis, including various underlying infectious diseases and causative pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate mortality and morbidities in patients with community-acquired sepsis treated with carbapenems as initial antibiotic therapy compared with those treated with noncarbapenem antibiotics.

### Fosfomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing, enterobacteriaceae infections: a systematic review [^6245d0af]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Rising rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs among Enterobacteriaceae limit the choice of reliably active forms of these drugs. We evaluated the evidence on fosfomycin as a treatment option for infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs, including producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). We systematically reviewed studies evaluating the antimicrobial activity, or the clinical effectiveness of fosfomycin. 17 antimicrobial-susceptibility studies were found and included in our Review, accounting for 5057 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with advanced resistance to antimicrobial drugs (4448 were producers of ESBL); 11 of the 17 studies reported that at least 90% of the isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Using a provisional minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility breakpoint of 64 mg/L or less, 1604 (96.8%) of 1657 Escherichia coli isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin. Similarly, 608 (81.3%) of 748 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates producing ESBL were susceptible to fosfomycin. In two clinical studies, oral treatment with fosfomycin-trometamol was clinically effective against complicated or uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing E coli in, cumulatively, 75 (93.8%) of the 80 patients evaluated. Initial clinical data support the use of fosfomycin for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by these pathogens, although further research is needed.

### Colonization dynamics of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales in the gut of Malawian adults [^b4bcbff5]. Nature Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Main

Antimicrobials are one of the most successful therapies available to modern medicine but the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to their effective use. Considerable global effort is being directed at antimicrobial stewardship programmes which the World Health Organization considers a key tool in reducing AMR. Antimicrobial stewardship at the individual level often emphasizes rationalization of antimicrobials through narrowing their spectrum of action as soon as possible after commencement of broad empiric antimicrobial therapy in severely unwell individuals. The time frame (for example, 48 h) for this is typically pragmatically selected to match likely availability of diagnostic test results. Rationalization of therapy is partly based on the assumption that it will reduce emergence of AMR but the mechanism by which antimicrobial exposure acts at the individual level to promote colonization and/or infection with resistant pathogens, and the dynamics of colonization and decolonization, are not well understood –. Improved understanding of the dynamics of individual-level AMR-acquisition under antimicrobial pressure can therefore inform the design of stewardship protocols.

One setting in which antimicrobial stewardship is a considerable challenge is in the treatment of severe febrile illness in the low- and middle-income countries of sub-Saharan Africa (sSA). In Blantyre, Malawi, for example, as in much of sSA, limited availability of diagnostics results in prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antimicrobials — mainly ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) antibiotic — for severe febrile illness. Ceftriaxone has been extensively used since its introduction to the Malawian national formulary in 2005but this has been associated with an increase in 3GC resistance, particularly in bacteria of the order Enterobacterales. This is mainly mediated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes –. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (henceforth ESBL-E) are an increasing public health challenge throughout much of sSA, and often have few or no locally available treatment options; in Blantyre, 91% of invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae are now 3GC resistantand strategies to reduce ESBL-E infections are needed.

### Epidemiology and risk factors for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms: a case control study at a tertiary care center in Lebanon [^ef819a5b]. American Journal of Infection Control (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacilli constitute a growing problem worldwide. At the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), we have observed a significant rise in the rates of ESBL-producing organisms over the past 5 years.

Methods

Using a case control study design, we compared 99 patients with infections caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and 99 frequency-matched controls from which ESBL-nonproducing isolates were recovered at AUBMC.

Results

The most notable risk factor for acquiring infections with ESBL-producing organisms was antibiotic consumption within 30 days of the infection (OR, 7.06; 95% CI: 3.27–15.24), with third-generation cephalosporins being associated with the highest risk (OR, 28.4; 95% CI: 3.7–215.8). Other risk factors included recent surgery, presence of a urinary catheter, and need for mechanical ventilation. Moreover, cases had a longer mean duration of hospitalization and were more likely to have relapse of their infection than controls.

Conclusions

Recent antibiotic use is by far the most important predisposing factor to infection with ESBL-producing organisms. Such infections are associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased morbidity. Attention should be redirected toward the unjustified liberal use of broad-spectrum antibiotics both in the hospital and in the community.

### Carbapenem-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales in children, United States, 2016–2020 [^7c6db8dd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a critical public health threat. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) have been identified as an urgent public health threat and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) as a serious public health threat. Both bacteria types remain of concern because of transmissibility of the AMR genes they harbor and limited treatment options. Particularly concerning are plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms in which genes encoding carbapenemases and ESBLs, as well as other resistance determinants, can disseminate between different organisms, thus furthering the spread of CRE and ESBL-E. Knowledge of the burden of these infections has implications for public health and the control strategies needed to prevent spread in adult and pediatric populations.

Most US studies have focused on risk factors for infection or colonization of CRE and ESBL-E in adults; national epidemiologic data for children are comparatively lacking. Moreover, attention to antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections in children has perhaps been further disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and trends have potentially worsened over the past 3 years. Few antimicrobial drugs can treat CRE and ESBL-E infections, and limited pediatric-specific clinical trials of antimicrobial drugs contribute to a scarcity of knowledge with regard to children compared with adults. A small number of studies have described the continued emergence of AMR mechanisms in US children and identified variations in epidemiology by hospital and bacteria species across multiple pediatric medical centers. However, most studies were conducted in earlier years and were not designed to characterize the clinical and molecular features of cases identified from community and hospital settings on a population level.

### Molecular mechanisms of re-emerging chloramphenicol susceptibility in extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales [^d94dbce5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global health. Drug-resistant bacterial infections were estimated to be associated with 4.95 million deaths in 2019, with sub-Saharan Africa being the worst affected region. Among the most problematic drug-resistant bacteria are extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) which are resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) and classified as priority pathogens by the WHO. ESBL-E infections are associated with higher morbidity, mortality and economic burden in the treatment of bloodstream infections in Malawi, and in low resource settings such as Malawi access to effective treatment alternatives (e.g. carbapenems, or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) is often lacking. The prevalence of ESBL-E rapidly increased in Malawi after the 3GC ceftriaxone replaced chloramphenicol (CHL) as first-line empiric therapy for suspected sepsis from 2004.

### High burden of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producingandBacteremia in older adults: a seven-year study in two rural Thai provinces [^a890a009]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

The antibiotic treatment choices for infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens are limited. We found a high prevalence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins among ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which is consistent with previous reports from Thailand. A 2016 reportexamined treatment options for children (0–15 years) with E. coli and K. pneumonia e infections visiting a tertiary care center in Bangkok. They also found the vast majority of ESBL-producing isolates were susceptible to amikacin but noted that poor tissue penetration and potential nephrotoxicity limited the use of amikacin and other aminoglycosides outside of urinary tract infections. Another potential treatment option is piperacillin/tazobactam, but we found substantial non-susceptibility (> 25%) to this combination among ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, similar to Sethaphanich, who found only 62.6% of K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam. This makes it a poor choice for empiric treatment. For now, carbapenems remain a reliable treatment option, but it is troubling that we identified carbapenem-resistant, ESBL-producing isolates from five patients (two E. coli and three K. pneumoniae), especially in light of the recent identification of colistin-resistant E. coli from clinical isolates, healthy adults, and the environment in Thailand. If we cannot prevent and control the spread of these types of multidrug-resistant bacteria, few options will remain for patients infected with this organism in the near future.

IDSA 2023 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), piperacillin–tazobactam suggested approach — If piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an ESBL-E and clinical improvement occurs, no change or extension of antibiotic therapy is necessary. The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Impact of a restrictive antibiotic policy on the acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in an endemic region: a before-and-after, propensity-matched cohort study in a caribbean intensive care unit [^31789117]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance is among the most important public health concerns worldwide. Recently, the World Health Organization published a global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in which extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are included in the priority 1 group. In intensive care units (ICUs), ESBL-E have been increasingly reported for many years, which strengthens the requirement for efficient prevention strategies. Occurrence of ESBL-E in the ICU may result either from the introduction of an exogenous strain through newly hospitalized patients with a possible further dissemination through cross-contamination, or from the in vivo selection of resistant isolates from preexisting strains, mainly in the gut microbiota, through horizontal gene transfer. Among risk factors for ESBL-E acquisition, antibiotic exposure to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations has been identified as an independent risk factor for colonization or infection with ESBL-E pathogens.

Antibiotic therapy is heavily used in ICUs where it has been reported that more than 70% of patients are treated with at least one antibiotic. Consequently, antibiotic overuse and the resulting selection pressure makes the ICU an important determinant of the spread of ESBL-E in the hospital. Different stewardship policies have been developed and implemented in many settings, including ICUs, to improve antibiotic use and clinical outcomes and to reduce the overall antibiotic selective pressure. Among the strategies that have been implemented to optimize antibiotic prescription in ICUs, some restrictive policies, such as delaying the initiation of antibiotics in selected patients or avoiding broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, have been successfully proposed.

In the Caribbean region, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is high, including ESBL-E, and this particular local ecology often leads clinicians to use broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically. Although stewardship programs are urgently needed, no such restrictive strategy has been evaluated in ICUs. In order to overcome this issue, we implemented a stewardship program based on a restrictive antibiotic policy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this strategy on ESBL-E acquisition in the ICU when compared to a conventional and unrestricted antibiotic policy.

How should the correct antibiotic be chosen in patients with IAIs?

14. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the local microbiological epidemiology, clinical severity, and individual patient risk factors for resistant bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

15. In most patients with IAIs, agents with a narrow spectrum of activity should be preferred. In community-acquired IAIs, the most common resistance problem is posed by alarmingly prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

16. The following risk factors for ESBLs-producing Enterobacterales infections should be always considered: (a) hospitalization for 48 h within the last 90 days, (b) use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days within the last 90 days, (c) gut colonization by ESBLs within 90 days and (d) patients coming from healthcare settings with a high incidence of MDR bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

17. Antibiotic therapy aimed at enterococcal coverage should not be routinely prescribed in patients with community-acquired IAIs unless they are immunocompromised (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

18. Empirical antibiotic therapy covering MDR Gram-negative bacteria should be considered only in specific settings, and based on country-wide epidemiological conditions, clinical severity, immunological impairment, knowledge of colonization status, prolonged exposure to carbapenems and/or quinolones (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

In the setting of IAIs, inappropriate choice of initial antibiotic therapy in patients leads to more clinical failure, resulting in a longer hospital stay and higher costs of hospitalization compared with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Before causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, the optimal choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the local prevalence of resistant bacteria and patient risk factors for them as long as available microbiological data (e.g. colonization status).

### Dynamics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance genes in Escherichia coli from Europe and north America [^5a78ea10]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins are broad-spectrum β-lactam antimicrobial agents classified as critically important for human medicine by the World Health Organization due to their use in the management and treatment of serious infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Third-generation cephalosporins were introduced for medical use in the early 1980s, with fourth-generation cephalosporins introduced in 1994; since then, resistance to these drugs has increased. Resistance to these extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) is widespread worldwide in Enterobacterales from both humans and animals, and is mediated predominantly by two main groups of inactivating enzymes: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases (AmpCs).

### Current evidence for therapy of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacteremia [^b5e05467]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article aims to give a state-of-the-art assessment of treatment options for bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In particular, this review assesses whether current data support 'carbapenem-sparing options' for treatment of these serious infections.

Recent Findings

The MERINO trial refuted earlier observational studies some of which showed equivalence in outcomes between beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and carbapenems for treatment of bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Although numerous factors influence mortality following bloodstream infection, the variability in piperacillin/tazobactam MICs observed in the MERINO trial make this a less secure option than meropenem. However, the search for carbapenem-sparing options continues with four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in progress and a number of other options in clinical development.

Summary

Hard outcomes from RCTs are still needed before intravenous carbapenems can be displaced as the treatment of choice for ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

### Impact of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species on clinical outcomes and hospital costs: a matched cohort study [^9f72f7ee]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the economic and clinical impact of infection with extended-spectrum beta -lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species (ESBL-EK).

Design

A matched-cohort analysis of the cost of illness.

Setting

An 810-bed, urban, community hospital in Hartford, Connecticut.

Patients

Twenty-one case patients infected with ESBL-EK at a site other than the urinary tract were matched with 21 control subjects infected with a non-ESBL-producing organism on the basis of pathogen species, age, anatomic site of infection, hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the time of infection, date of hospitalization, and initial antibiotics received.

Results

Mean infection-related costs per patient were significantly greater for case patients than for control patients ($41,353 vs $24,902; P = 0.034). Infection-related length of stay was the main driver of cost, which was prolonged for case patients, compared with control patients (21 vs 11 days; mean difference, 9.7 days [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.2–14.6 days]; P = 0.006). The additional cost attributed to the presence of an ESBL-EK infection was $16,450 per patient (95% CI, $965-$31,937). Case patients were more likely than control patients to have clinical failure (P = 0.027), and the rate of treatment success for case patients whose initial treatment involved antibiotics other than carbapenems was lower than that for their matched control patients (39% vs 83%; P = 0.013). Treatment was successful in patients for whom initial treatment was with a carbapenem, regardless of the ESBL status of the pathogen.

Conclusion

The cost of non-urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-EK was 1.7 times the cost of non-urinary tract infections caused by non-ESBL producers. Prompt recognition and appropriate antimicrobial selection may minimize this ESBL-related impact on hospital costs.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacterial infections in adult solid organ transplant recipients [^59c19673]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Limited research is available evaluating infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms in adult recipients of solid organ transplant (SOT).

Objective

To evaluate clinical response and rate of recurrence of ESBL-producing organisms in 20 SOT recipients.

Methods

In a retrospective case series, records of adult SOT recipients with an admitting diagnosis of infection and a positive culture for an ESBL-producing organism from January 2003 through August 2006 were reviewed.

Results

Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. The median time to infection following transplant was 3.5 years (range 1–23 years). Overall, 85% of the patients received inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy, including ciprofloxacin or piperacillin/tazobactam, to manage their infection. Nineteen patients had clinical resolution; however, 12 patients required at least 1 readmission due to infection recurrence. One patient's death occurred during the study period. The median time to readmission for a recurrence was 41 days (18–455 days). All recurrent infections were caused by the same ESBL-producing pathogen and 10 of 12 (83%) infections occurred at the same site as the initial infection. Among patients with recurrent infections, 75% received inadequate empiric therapy upon readmission. All 12 patients with recurrent infections had successful clinical responses to both initial and recurrent infections.

Conclusions

The provision of inadequate empiric therapy for new and recurrent infections due to ESBL-producing pathogens was common in this study population. SOT recipients with a history of infection due to an ESBL-producing organism presenting with a new infection should receive adequate empiric therapy with a carbapenem agent until a definitive diagnosis can be established.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases: the European experience [^60cf17da]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases mediate resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics and were first discovered in Europe in the early 1980s. They have become a widespread problem, particularly in Klebsiella pneumoniae, but increasingly in non-typhoid Salmonella species. Traditionally, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have been derivatives of TEM and SHV parent enzymes. The last year, however, has seen an explosion of developments in extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of non-TEM, non-SHV lineage in Europe. The CTX-M type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have become particularly widespread. At the same time, European clinical microbiology laboratories have become more aware of the pressing need for detection methods given increasing awareness of the lack of reliability of cephalosporins in the treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers.

### A multinational survey of risk factors for infection with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in nonhospitalized patients [^b633676d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are increasing in frequency and are associated with high mortality rates. Circulation of CTX-M-type ESBLs in the community is of particular concern, because it may confound standard infection-control measures.

Methods

We analyzed the results of epidemiologic studies of infection caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in nonhospitalized patients from 6 centers in Europe, Asia, and North America. Risk factors for infection with an ESBL-producing organism were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

A total of 983 patient-specific isolates were reviewed (890 [90.5%] of which were Escherichia coli, 68 [6.9%] of which were Klebsiella species, and 25 [2.5%] of which were Proteus mirabilis); 339 [34.5%] of the isolates produced ESBLs. CTX-M types were the most frequent ESBLs (accounting for 65%). Rates of co-resistance to ciprofloxacin among ESBL-producing isolates were high (> 70%), but significant variation was seen among centers with respect to rates of resistance to gentamicin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Similar risk factors for infection with an ESBL-producing organism were found in the different participating centers. Significant risk factors, identified by multivariate analysis, were recent antibiotic use, residence in a long-term care facility, recent hospitalization, age 65 years, and male sex (area under the receiver-operator characteristic [ROC] curve, 0.80). However, 34% of ESBL-producing isolates (115 of 336 isolates) were obtained from patients with no recent health care contact; the area under the ROC curve for the multivariate model for this group of patients was only 0.70, which indicated poorer predictive value.

Conclusions

Community-acquired ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are now prevalent worldwide, necessitating international collaboration. Novel approaches are required to adequately address issues such as empirical treatment for severe community-acquired infection and infection control.

### Innovative approaches in phenotypic β-lactamase detection for personalised infection management [^06875937]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Quantifying the absolute amount of beta-lactamase enzyme produced by bacterial isolates and its level of activity on specific antibiotics is more challenging than measuring gene expression or gene abundance. These enzymes are often present in small quantities, and their activity can be influenced by various factors, including type of beta-lactamase, site of infection and bacterial species. There are a few indirect methods to estimate beta-lactamase enzyme activity, including colourimetric assaysand western blot, but these methods only provide a relative measure of enzyme activity rather than absolute quantification.

The MERINO trial and post-hoc analysis highlighted a need for better data on enzyme activity in relation to minimal inhibitory concentration in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The trial failed to demonstrate that piperacillin-tazobactam was non-inferior to meropenem, with the former associated with a higher mortality rate (12.3% vs. 3.7%). Concerns about the trial methodology, particularly the determination of MIC and susceptibility reporting, were raised. The post-hoc analysis revealed a higher nonsusceptibility rate to piperacillin-tazobactam using broth microdilution compared to gradient MIC test strips, demonstrating the need for accurate and consistent susceptibility testing approaches. The trial also found that 30-day mortality was significantly higher for patients with piperacillin-tazobactam MICs > 16 mg/L. Further analysis found that genotypic factors, such as the presence of AmpC and OXA-1 genes with CTX-M, could be associated with elevated MICs and increased mortality.

### Treating infections caused by carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^1a9745f7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) have spread worldwide, causing serious infections with increasing frequency. CPE are resistant to almost all available antibiotics, complicating therapy and limiting treatment options. Mortality rates associated with CPE infections are unacceptably high, indicating that the current therapeutic approaches are inadequate and must be revised. Here, we review 20 clinical studies (including those describing the largest cohorts of CPE-infected patients) that provided the necessary information regarding isolate and patient characteristics and treatment schemes, as well as a clear assessment of outcome. The data summarized here indicate that treatment with a single in vitro active agent resulted in mortality rates not significantly different from that observed in patients treated with no active therapy, whereas combination therapy with two or more in vitro active agents was superior to monotherapy, providing a clear survival benefit (mortality rate, 27.4% vs. 38.7%; p < 0.001). The lowest mortality rate (18.8%) was observed in patients treated with carbapenem-containing combinations.

### Emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing pathogens in community-acquired urinary tract infections among infants at a pediatric emergency department [^0009d32f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens are common among adults and are associated with extended and multiple hospitalizations. They cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) among children with known risk factors such as urinary tract abnormalities and antimicrobial prophylaxis. The emergence of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms among infants has not been well characterized.

Objective

We sought to describe the incidence and current clinical management of infants who were diagnosed with UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms at a pediatric emergency department (ED). In addition, we sought to describe risk factors associated with inpatient hospitalization for UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms.

Methods

We retrospectively identified infants who were treated in the ED from 2013 to 2017 and who had positive urinalyses and urine cultures positive for greater than 50,000 colony-forming unit per milliliter of a single ESBL-producing urinary pathogen. We abstracted details of clinical management and known previous risk factors, including prior neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization stay, prior UTI caused by an ESBL-producing organism, and known urologic abnormalities.

Results

Forty-five UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms occurred in 43 patients (mean age of 5.9 months and 59% female)-ESBL Escherichia coli represented the majority (42/45). The incidence of UTIs caused by ESBL-producing organisms ranged from 0.9% to 4.5% during the 5-year study period. The 13 patients (26%) admitted from the ED were significantly younger than discharged patients (1.9 vs 6.7 months, P = 0.016) and more likely to have had prior neonatal intensive care unit hospitalizations (50% vs 15.6%, P = 0.0456). Of the 33 visits (77%) resulting in initial outpatient management, 5 were followed by readmission for parenteral antibiotic treatment. Of those who were readmitted, 40% (n = 2) were afebrile at the time of admission. The remainder (28/33) completed outpatient oral antibiotic courses guided by susceptibilities. Two patients (4%) had negative repeat urine cultures despite in vitro resistance to initial antibiotic coverage.

Conclusions

Extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms are an increasing cause of UTIs in infants presenting at a pediatric ED, and outpatient management may be reasonable for infants older than 2 months.

### Influx of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae into the hospital [^cd7069fc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of infections caused by extended-spectrum beta -lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is increasing worldwide. The influx of these bacteria into hospitals has major implications for infection-control and empirical treatment strategies.

Methods

Isolates from 2 patient cohorts — patients with gram-negative bacteremia within 2 days after admission and patients screened for fecal colonization at admission — were assessed for ESBL production. ESBL phenotype was confirmed according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Predictors of ESBL phenotype were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses.

Results

Of 80 Enterobacteriaceae isolates from blood samples obtained at admission to the hospital, 13.7% produced ESBL. Thirty-eight patients with ESBL-positive isolates and 72 with ESBL-negative isolates were included in a case-control study. Predictors of ESBL production were male sex and nursing home residence (area under receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.7). Of 241 persons screened at admission, 26 (10.8%) had fecal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Predictors of fecal carriage were poor functional status, antibiotic use, chronic renal insufficiency, liver disease, and use of histamine2 blockers (area under receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.8). Four (15.4%) of the 26 individuals with fecal carriage had subsequent bacteremia with ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, compared with 1 (0.5%) noncarrier (odds ratio, 38.9; P < .001). Of 80 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained at admission, 65 were health care associated, and 15 were community acquired. The 15 community-acquired ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae belonged to diverse clones. The most prevalent ESBL gene among these isolates was CTX-M-2 (found in 53.3% of the isolates).

Conclusions

We report high rates of bacteremia and colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae at admission to our institution, which may undermine infection-control measures and complicate the selection of empirical treatment.

### Intervention study of the association of antibiotic utilization measures with control of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria [^2e77db45]. Microbes and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

We investigated the effects of replacing third-/fourth-generation cephalosporins with piperacillin-tazobactam on the rate of acquisition of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli by patients hospitalized in a Department of Respiratory Medicine. This 9-month, prospective, non-controlled, intervention study comprised two phases: a 3-month pre-intervention phase (Phase I) and a 6-month intervention phase (Phase II), during which the use of third-/forth-generation cephalosporins was restricted and replaced by piperacillin-tazobactam. Rectal swabs were obtained within 24 h after admission (baseline screening), weekly, and 48 h before discharge during Phase I and the last 3 months of Phase II (Phase IIb). Swabs were tested for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and extended spectrum beta-lactamase production was detected with the double disc test. Use of third/fourth-generation cephalosporins decreased by 63.0% and 100%, respectively; while the use of piperacillin-tazobactam increased by 28-fold. The rate of acquisition of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae together in rectal swab specimens decreased in Phase IIb as compared with Phase I (19.5% vs 29.5%). Few rectal swab specimens were positive for extended spectrum beta-lactamases-producing K. pneumoniae, and no substantial decrease in the rate of its acquisition was observed.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^868445cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^87d6f742]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

IDSA treatment guidelines for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis recommend that, if the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate is > 10%, then in addition to a fluoroquinolone, an agent of another class (i.e. ceftriaxone or gentamicin) should be administered. Our findings indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates for E. coli are approaching or exceed this threshold for patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis in many parts of the United States. For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines recommend alternative agents if the resistance rate is > 20%, which is the current situation for fluoroquinolones in many settings for patients with complicated pyelonephritis. Unfortunately, we found that only one half to two thirds of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli infections correlate to geographic location. Prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs or a healthcare setting, travel outside the United States, and a history of an antimicrobial drug–resistant infection substantially increases the chance that a person will have a current fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli infection. Therefore, in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance rates, in settings where ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections have emerged, or among persons with antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors (especially patients with or at risk for severe sepsis), healthcare providers should consider empirical treatment with a carbapenem or another agent found to be consistently active on the basis of the local antibiogram. In this study, ≈50% of patients with pyelonephritis were managed as outpatients. Currently, no oral antimicrobial drugs with consistent in vitro activity are available for empirical treatment of pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing E. coli uropathogens. Our findings, including the variability in the prevalence of resistance by site, show that increased local efforts to enhance surveillance for antimicrobial drug resistance are necessary to best inform treatment decisions. Furthermore, availability of new antimicrobial drugs must be expedited.

A recent, frequently quoted study has suggested that for bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL) Escherichia coli, treatment with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLIs) might be equivalent to treatment with carbapenems. However, the majority of BSIs originate from the urinary tract. A multicenter, multinational efficacy analysis was conducted from 2010 to 2012 to compare outcomes of patients with non-urinary ESBL BSIs who received a carbapenem (69 patients) vs those treated with piperacillin-tazobactam (10 patients). In multivariate analysis, therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with increased 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 7.9, P = 0.03). For ESBL BSIs of a non-urinary origin, carbapenems should be considered a superior treatment to BLBLIs.

### Bench-to-bedside review: the role of β-lactamases in antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative infections [^08c63b47]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Multidrug resistance has been increasing among Gram-negative bacteria and is strongly associated with the production of both chromosomal- and plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases, whose number now exceeds 890. Many of the newer enzymes exhibit broad-spectrum hydrolytic activity against most classes of beta-lactams. The most important plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases include (a) AmpC cephalosporinases produced in high quantities, (b) the expanding families of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases such as the CTX-M enzymes that can hydrolyze the advanced-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams, and (c) carbapenemases from multiple molecular classes that are responsible for resistance to almost all beta-lactams, including the carbapenems. Important plasmid-encoded carbapenemases include (a) the KPC beta-lactamases originating in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and now appearing worldwide in pan-resistant Gram-negative pathogens and (b) metallo-beta-lactamases that are produced in organisms with other deleterious beta-lactamases, causing resistance to all beta-lactams except aztreonam. beta-Lactamase genes encoding these enzymes are often carried on plasmids that bear additional resistance determinants for other antibiotic classes. As a result, some infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens can now be treated with only a limited number, if any, antibiotics. Because multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is observed in both nosocomial and community isolates, eradication of these resistant strains is becoming more difficult.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^fa253dbf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) uncomplicated cystitis — amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and doxycycline guidance is as follows: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is not suggested for the treatment of ESBL-E cystitis, with a randomized trial comparing a 3-day amoxicillin-clavulanic regimen (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) to ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) in 370 women showing clinical cure in 58% versus 77% and higher persistent vaginal bacterial colonization in 45% versus 10%; the proportion infected with ESBL-E strains was not available and both agents were administered at dosages lower than generally suggested. The panel suggests against the use of doxycycline for ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis, citing limited urinary excretion (35%–60%) and lack of convincing data for clinical effectiveness.

### WSES / GAIS / SIS-E / WSIS / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with intra-abdominal infections [^c7a311c9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with IAI should include agents with activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae), aerobic streptococci, and obligate enteric anaerobic organisms found in the gastrointestinal tract, although coverage of the latter may not be absolutely essential in patients with an upper gastrointestinal source of infection. Additional antibiotic agents, providing coverage of less common resistant or opportunistic pathogens such as Candida spp. may be warranted in selected conditions. Generally, the most important factors in predicting the presence of resistant pathogens in IAIs is acquisition in a healthcare setting (particularly if the patient becomes infected in the ICU or has been hospitalized for more than 1 week), corticosteroid use, organ transplantation, baseline pulmonary or hepatic disease, and previous antimicrobial therapy.

In the last two decades, antimicrobial resistance has become a global threat to public health systems and some of the most common causes of misuse of antibiotics, and poor prevention and control with respect to infections. Particularly, infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent and now constitute a serious threat to public health worldwide because they are difficult to treat and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Bacterium-producing carbapenemases, such as K. pneumoniae, are rapidly emerging as a major source of multidrug-resistant infections worldwide and pose a serious threat in clinical situations where administration of effective empiric antibiotics is essential to prevent mortality following bacteremia and infections in immunocompromised patients. Non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii) have exhibited alarming rates of increased resistance to a variety of antibiotics in health facilities worldwide. These species are intrinsically resistant to several drugs and could acquire additional resistance to other important antimicrobial agents.

In the context of IAIs, the main resistance problem is posed by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are alarmingly prevalent in nosocomial infections and frequently observed in community-acquired infections, albeit to a lesser extent. ESBL are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing and inactivating a wide variety of beta-lactams, including third-generation cephalosporins, penicillins, and aztreonam.

Most ESBLs of clinical interest are encoded by genes located on plasmids. These plasmids may also carry genes encoding resistance to other multiple drug classes including aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

The main risk factors for ESBL are:
hospitalization for 48h within the last 90 days,
broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days within the last 90 days,
colonization by ESBL within 90 days.

### Overview of changes in the clinical and laboratory standards institute performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing: M100 32nd and 33rd editions [^9a197ec8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2010, CLSI lowered the Enterobacterales cephalosporin and carbapenem breakpoints, eliminating the requirement to perform specific resistance mechanism identification for ESBLs or carbapenemase producers for laboratories that adopted the lower breakpoints. At the time, the lower breakpoints were considered sufficient to accurately detect wild-type organisms lacking acquired resistance mechanisms. However, with the publication of the MERINO trial data that focused on infections caused by ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacterales and the development of new antimicrobials that target specific mechanisms of resistance, the need to identify the mechanism of certain types of resistance has resurfaced. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated its treatment guidelines to reflect these newer developments and made therapeutic recommendations based on the known presence of a specific resistance mechanism. The M100 33rd edition provides a comment in Table 2A, pointing the laboratory user to consult with ASP when deciding whether to perform phenotypic or genotypic testing for ESBLs to guide therapeutic management. Laboratories may still choose to report ESBLs for infection control or epidemiological purposes but may also report for therapeutic decisions. A similar comment concerning carbapenemase producers was also added to the carbapenem section of M100 Table 2A.

There are several factors that need to be taken into consideration before implementing these new testing and reporting recommendations. One such consideration is whether the laboratory has the workflow and methodology capabilities to assess ESBL and carbapenem resistance mechanisms — either by phenotypic or genotypic methods. False-negative results of phenotypic ESBL testing have been observed due to the coproduction of AmpC beta-lactamases, and false-positive results have occurred among isolates with multiple mechanisms of resistance. Phenotypic testing may require additional setup and incubation times and lead to a longer time to results compared to genotypic testing. Certain tests are limited to select species of Enterobacterales, and laboratories using commercial systems may have additional reporting limitations. One must also consider how to report the resistance mechanism accurately and clearly in the laboratory report so that it conveys the correct message to the clinician treating the patient. It is important to note that CLSI M100 does not include specific treatment recommendations. The IDSA treatment guidelines recommend that piperacillin-tazobactam should not be used for ESBL-producing isolates of Enterobacterales, even if the antimicrobial tests are susceptible; however, there is no guidance in the M100 33rd edition that recommends hiding susceptible piperacillin-tazobactam results or changing the interpretation to resistant when an ESBL is detected. These decisions are institution-specific and are to be discussed in collaboration with the laboratory and relevant stakeholders.

### About ESBL-producing enterobacterales… [^36ad4a71]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales are resistant to common antibiotics and may require complex treatments.
- Infections caused by ESBL-E can occur both in and outside of healthcare settings.
- Good hand hygiene and infection prevention practices can help reduce infection risk. Overview Enterobacterales Enterobacterales are a group of bacteria that cause infections in healthcare settings and communities. Some species are also a normal part of the human gut. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales Some Enterobacterales produce enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Antimicrobial resistance ESBLs break down certain antibiotics, making some infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales difficult to treat. Prevalence In 2017, there were an estimated 197, 400 cases of ESBL-E among hospitalized patients and 9, 100 estimated deaths in the United States.

Types ESBL-producing Enterobacterales include germs like Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Signs and symptoms ESBL-E can cause several different infections, including urinary tract and bloodstream infections. These bacteria can also live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, known as colonization. Testing To determine if someone has an ESBL-E infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. CDC provides data that can be used for setting breakpoints for interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Treatment and recovery Antimicrobial resistance and its effect on treatment ESBL-E infections are resistant to many prescribed antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. These infections might require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics.

Carbapenems and risk of greater resistance Carbapenems are often used to treat serious ESBL-E infections, but resistance is on the rise for them, too. The more we rely on this important class of antibiotics, the greater the risk of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. What CDC is doing
- Tracking ESBL-E infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
- Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
- Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales and slow the spread of resistant germs.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (endorsed by European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) [^ece28ce6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope

These ESCMID guidelines address the targeted antibiotic treatment of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCephRE) and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, focusing on the effectiveness of individual antibiotics and on combination versus monotherapy.

Methods

An expert panel was convened by ESCMID. A systematic review was performed including randomized controlled trials and observational studies, examining different antibiotic treatment regimens for the targeted treatment of infections caused by the 3GCephRE, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Treatments were classified as head-to-head comparisons between individual antibiotics and between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens, including defined monotherapy and combination regimens only. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, preferably at 30 days and secondary outcomes included clinical failure, microbiological failure, development of resistance, relapse/recurrence, adverse events and length of hospital stay. The last search of all databases was conducted in December 2019, followed by a focused search for relevant studies up until ECCMID 2021. Data were summarized narratively. The certainty of the evidence for each comparison between antibiotics and between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens was classified by the GRADE recommendations. The strength of the recommendations for or against treatments was classified as strong or conditional (weak).

Recommendations

The guideline panel reviewed the evidence per pathogen, preferably per site of infection, critically appraising the existing studies. Many of the comparisons were addressed in small observational studies at high risk of bias only. Notably, there was very little evidence on the effects of the new, recently approved, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors on infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Most recommendations are based on very-low- and low-certainty evidence. A high value was placed on antibiotic stewardship considerations in all recommendations, searching for carbapenem-sparing options for 3GCephRE and limiting the recommendations of the new antibiotics for severe infections, as defined by the sepsis-3 criteria. Research needs are addressed.
