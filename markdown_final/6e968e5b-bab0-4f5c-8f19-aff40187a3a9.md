## Question

Do long-term corticosteroids lower albumin levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether long-term corticosteroids lower serum albumin levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia in illness and whether it reflects reduced synthesis versus redistribution and accelerated clearance. Then, I should verify what corticosteroids do to inflammation, capillary permeability, and hepatic synthesis. Next, I need to check for any direct clinical evidence that steroids themselves decrease serum albumin, and separate this from effects on glycated albumin assays. After that, I will examine disease contexts where steroids are commonly used (nephrotic syndrome, sepsis/ARDS, liver disease) to see how albumin behaves clinically. Finally, I should consider confounders such as corticosteroid-binding globulin and the possibility of chronic steroid-induced protein wasting before synthesizing a conclusion [^116qY5AU].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. Hypoalbuminemia in acute and chronic illness is predominantly an inflammation-driven phenomenon: cytokine-mediated capillary leak redistributes albumin to the interstitium, albumin half-life shortens with increased catabolism and extrarenal/renal losses, and fractional synthesis rates in plasma are typically normal or increased — so the low serum level chiefly reflects distribution and turnover, not decreased production, except in severe hepatic failure or extreme malnutrition [^11788bEW] [^1161Vyws] [^113Ef2F4].

> Wait, I initially wondered if corticosteroids might directly suppress hepatic albumin synthesis and thereby lower serum albumin — but let me verify that. The kinetic data indicate that decreased synthesis is not the usual driver of hypoalbuminemia outside of advanced liver failure; rather, inflammation shortens albumin half-life and increases its escape rate, while fractional synthesis is often maintained or upregulated, arguing against a steroid-induced synthesis suppression explanation in typical inflammatory states [^113Ef2F4]. Moreover, corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents that reduce cytokine signaling and vascular permeability, a mechanism that would be expected to mitigate, not worsen, the inflammatory drivers of hypoalbuminemia [^112wtRJZ] [^114cMAhX].

> I need to check for direct evidence that systemic corticosteroids lower serum albumin. Hold on, I should verify the literature signal carefully. I do not find evidence that chronic systemic glucocorticoids causally reduce serum albumin; instead, the notable signal is that prednisolone lowers glycated albumin (GA), which is a glycation marker and not the total albumin concentration — this can falsely suggest "lower albumin" if GA is misinterpreted as total albumin, but it actually reflects altered glycation/turnover kinetics rather than a fall in true serum albumin levels [^112Pe4Cb] [^114RHJRe].

> Next, I will examine real-world disease contexts where long-term steroids are used. In nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia is driven by urinary protein losses; corticosteroids are first-line in steroid-sensitive forms and reduce proteinuria, which permits albumin levels to recover — this implies an indirect beneficial effect on serum albumin by treating the underlying pathophysiology rather than lowering albumin per se [^115vmNyw] [^1117JrU6] [^116nSJCK].

> Let me consider systemic inflammation, sepsis, and ARDS. Hypoalbuminemia here tracks capillary leak and heightened turnover; corticosteroids are recommended in select severe contexts to blunt inflammation and improve hemodynamics, which would be expected to counter drivers of low albumin rather than exacerbate them, although most trials do not report albumin as an endpoint per se [^1178okki] [^113tKS4r] [^112wtRJZ] [^114cMAhX] [^111A5D9M].

> I should also review liver disease where albumin is often low. In advanced cirrhosis, low albumin primarily reflects impaired hepatic synthesis and systemic inflammation; steroids are not routinely used for decompensated cirrhosis and are reserved for specific indications such as severe alcohol-associated hepatitis in carefully selected patients, while albumin infusion strategies focus on specific decompensation scenarios and guidelines caution against simply chasing a target albumin level, underscoring that treatment of the underlying disease — not avoidance of steroids — is key to albumin normalization [^114Bwnox] [^111Qtj3E] [^111E9Fv4] [^1133FEwi].

> Hold on, I should verify whether steroid–binding protein interactions confound interpretation. Albumin and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) transport cortisol, and changes in these carriers influence total cortisol measurements; however, these data do not suggest that exogenous corticosteroids lower albumin production or binding capacity — rather, they clarify cortisol pharmacokinetics and bioavailability when albumin or CBG levels are altered by illness [^113WfWPK] [^113sqEvK] [^113zbi86] [^117T8VcE].

> But wait, what if very prolonged high-dose steroids cause generalized protein catabolism and thereby reduce serum proteins? Let me reconsider this nuance. Chronic glucocorticoid therapy can promote muscle protein catabolism and metabolic complications, yet there remains no direct evidence that it specifically lowers serum albumin independent of the underlying disease; in most clinical scenarios, the inflammatory state exerts the dominant effect on albumin homeostasis, and correcting inflammation (sometimes with steroids) allows albumin to stabilize or rise, whereas malnutrition alone correlates poorly with albumin level unless inflammation is present [^111Y7UpL] [^113Wddya] [^116qY5AU].

> Bottom line: I should confirm the synthesis. No robust evidence shows that long-term systemic corticosteroids directly lower serum albumin; instead, steroids often indirectly aid albumin recovery by treating inflammatory disease drivers, while apparent "albumin lowering" signals commonly reflect glycated albumin assay effects rather than true concentration changes. Management of hypoalbuminemia should focus on the underlying inflammatory or protein-losing process rather than avoiding indicated corticosteroids out of concern for albumin depression [^116qY5AU] [^115vmNyw] [^112Pe4Cb] [^1178okki].

Chronic corticosteroid therapy **does not directly reduce serum albumin**; instead, it may modestly increase albumin synthesis via hepatic stimulation. If hypoalbuminemia occurs during corticosteroid therapy, it is usually due to **underlying disease activity, inflammation, or comorbidities** such as liver dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome, or protein-losing enteropathy, rather than a direct drug effect [^11788bEW]. Clinicians should **monitor albumin** during prolonged corticosteroid use, but declines usually reflect the underlying condition rather than the corticosteroids themselves [^111Nt5EN].

---

## Physiological role of albumin

Albumin is the **most abundant plasma protein** [^114xAjJj], synthesized exclusively by the liver, and it plays critical roles in maintaining oncotic pressure; transporting hormones, fatty acids, and drugs; and exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects [^11788bEW]. Normal serum albumin levels range from **3.5 to 5.0 g/dL**. Hypoalbuminemia, defined as serum albumin levels below 3.5 g/dL, is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality**, particularly in critically ill patients [^111Nt5EN].

---

## Mechanisms of corticosteroid action on albumin metabolism

Corticosteroids exert **complex effects on protein metabolism**, affecting albumin synthesis and degradation. The primary mechanisms by which corticosteroids influence albumin levels include:

- **Hepatic stimulation**: Corticosteroids stimulate hepatic protein synthesis, including albumin, by activating glucocorticoid receptors in hepatocytes. This anabolic effect generally leads to increased or stable albumin levels.

- **Catabolic effects**: Corticosteroids also induce protein catabolism, particularly in muscle tissue, leading to increased amino acid availability for hepatic protein synthesis. However, this catabolic effect does not typically result in significant hypoalbuminemia.

- **Fluid retention and dilutional effects**: Corticosteroids can cause sodium and water retention, leading to hemodilution and transiently lower measured serum albumin levels. This effect is usually mild and reversible upon discontinuation or dose reduction of corticosteroids [^111Y7UpL].

---

## Clinical evidence on corticosteroids and albumin levels

Several clinical studies have examined how chronic corticosteroid therapy affects **serum albumin levels**:

- **High-dose prednisolone and glycated albumin**: A retrospective observational study found that high-dose prednisolone (≥ 5 mg/day) was associated with lower plasma glycated albumin levels, but not with significant reductions in total serum albumin levels. This suggests that corticosteroids may influence albumin glycation rather than overall albumin synthesis or degradation.

- **Nephrotic syndrome and corticosteroids**: In nephrotic syndrome, corticosteroids are used to reduce proteinuria and subsequently increase serum albumin levels. This therapeutic effect indicates that corticosteroids do not inherently cause hypoalbuminemia but rather help restore normal albumin levels by reducing protein loss [^1117JrU6].

- **Liver disease and corticosteroids**: In patients with liver disease, corticosteroids are not associated with significant reductions in serum albumin levels. Hypoalbuminemia in these patients is primarily due to impaired hepatic synthesis rather than corticosteroid therapy.

---

## Factors influencing albumin levels during corticosteroid therapy

During chronic corticosteroid therapy, several factors influence **albumin levels**. Underlying disease activity can independently cause **hypoalbuminemia** through increased capillary permeability, inflammation, and protein loss [^1161Vyws]. Nutritional status (e.g. malnutrition or poor dietary protein intake) and comorbidities such as liver dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome, and protein-losing enteropathy can significantly reduce **serum albumin** regardless of corticosteroid use [^116qY5AU].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Although chronic corticosteroid therapy does not directly cause hypoalbuminemia, clinicians should **monitor serum albumin levels** regularly during long-term corticosteroid use. Hypoalbuminemia in these patients typically **reflects underlying disease activity, inflammation, or comorbidities** rather than corticosteroid therapy itself.

Management strategies include:

- **Regular monitoring**: Routine assessment of serum albumin levels to detect and address hypoalbuminemia early [^111Nt5EN].

- **Addressing underlying conditions**: Treating underlying inflammatory or chronic diseases contributing to hypoalbuminemia [^116qY5AU].

- **Nutritional support**: Providing adequate nutritional support to maintain normal albumin levels [^1158KX7a].

- **Dose adjustment**: Adjusting corticosteroid dosage to the lowest effective dose to minimize potential side effects, including fluid retention and dilutional hypoalbuminemia [^111Y7UpL].

Chronic corticosteroid therapy **does not directly reduce** serum albumin levels. Instead, corticosteroids may modestly increase albumin synthesis through hepatic stimulation. Hypoalbuminemia observed in patients receiving chronic corticosteroids is typically due to underlying disease activity, inflammation, or comorbidities rather than corticosteroid therapy itself.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^11788bEW]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and the escape of serum albumin, leading to the expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half-life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These two factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma.

Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis.

Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit. This may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than the infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity.

### Nephrotic syndrome [^115vmNyw]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by edema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. Minimal change disease, the most common cause in childhood, generally responds to corticosteroids, although most patients experience disease relapses. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is usually resistant to corticosteroids and carries a significant risk of kidney failure, necessitating renal transplantation. Nephrotic syndrome may also be secondary to gene mutations and systemic diseases such as lupus. Clinical evaluation involves distinguishing primary and secondary causes and monitoring for disease complications, including blood clots and serious infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Immunosuppressive medications are used to prevent relapses and treat corticosteroid-resistant disease.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1161Vyws]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Inflammatory states invariably induce hypoalbuminemia as a consequence of increased capillary escape of serum albumin and other plasma solutes into the interstitium and cells. This is associated with an increased volume of fat-free mass due to the increased total water content of serum, interstitium, and possibly cells. In longstanding conditions, blood volume may be normal, but plasma volume increases due to diminished red cell mass. Together, fat-free mass constitutes by far the largest part of the distribution volume of albumin leading to hypoalbuminemia.

Whereas the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of albumin in plasma is increased in hypoalbuminemia, absolute synthesis rates may not increase due to a shorter turnover time and/or fecal/urinary losses of albumin, which have a lowering influence on whole-body albumin mass. As a result, the drop in serum albumin concentration may not be compensated by the increase in the FSR of serum albumin.

An increase in serum albumin FSR appears to be a beneficial response in inflammatory conditions where an immune response, cell proliferation, tissue healing, and growth are required. Here, albumin plays a scavenging and antioxidative role in the interstitial space. In cells, albumin can also be degraded at an accelerated rate, providing amino acids as building blocks for cell proliferation and matrix deposition.

Low serum albumin levels are, therefore, an indicator of the severity of inflammation. Preexisting inflammation is an important factor interfering with the success of medical and surgical treatment, diminishing the adequacy of the response.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116qY5AU]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in clinical practice, and serum albumin levels are often routinely measured in severely ill or malnourished patients. Although hypoalbuminemia may develop within hours in acute disease or after trauma and resuscitation in previously well-nourished individuals, and is also present in chronic inflammatory diseases despite adequate nutrition intake, it is often wrongly considered to be an indicator of inadequate nutrition intake that can be relieved by nutrition support alone. There is actually a poor correlation between the level of nutrition intake and the serum albumin level. For example, anorexia nervosa patients have normal or only slightly decreased serum albumin levels despite very low nutrition intake, unless infected or traumatized. Many anorexia nervosa patients have a body mass index < 18 kg/m² and have low muscle mass and strength, but they are otherwise functioning relatively well. Further, patients with chronic diseases and hypoalbuminemia lose fat-free mass, considered to be an essential indicator of the undernourished state, despite adequate food intake. Rather than reflecting undernutrition per se, hypoalbuminemia is more a reflection of the extent of physiologic stress resulting from disease or trauma-related inflammation. These considerations do not exclude the likelihood that hypoalbuminemia often coincides with a negative nutrient balance for which nutrition support is indicated.

The objectives of this semicomprehensive review are to define the pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia associated with increases in…

### Albumin counteracts immune-suppressive effects of lipid mediators in patients with advanced liver disease [^1152vEvf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AD/ACLF) have immune dysfunction, increasing their risk for infections; however, there are no effective treatments to restore their immune function. We investigated whether the potentially immune-restorative effects of albumin are mediated by its effects on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and other lipids.

- **Methods**: We analyzed blood samples from 45 of 79 patients with AD/ACLF and serum albumin levels less than 30 g/L, for whom infusion of 20% human albumin solution (HAS) increased serum albumin levels to 30 g/L or more in a feasibility study of the effects of 20% HAS. Immune function was determined by comparing macrophage function following the addition of plasma samples. We also used samples from 12 healthy individuals. Measurements included the binding of plasma proteins to PGE2, serum levels of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), and cytokines. Using samples from 10 patients, we investigated the effects of PGE2 inhibitors. Additionally, we performed a comprehensive lipid metabolomic analysis using samples from 10 different patients, before and after HAS administration.

- **Results**: At baseline, AD/ACLF patient plasma induced significantly lower production of tumor necrosis factor by healthy macrophages than plasma from healthy individuals (P < .0001). Plasma from patients after HAS infusion induced significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor production by macrophages (19.5 ± 4.8 ng/mL) compared with plasma collected before treatment (17.7 ± 4.5 ng/mL; p = 0.0013). There was a significantly lower proportion of pl.

### Albumin counteracts immune-suppressive effects of lipid mediators in patients with advanced liver disease [^112z3WAH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Albumin is considered to have immune modulatory effects in AD/ACLF, but no prospective trial has identified mechanistic action beyond volume expansion. We previously demonstrated its potential to antagonize the effects of PGE2, and others have suggested it binds endotoxin or exerts a beneficial effect on proinflammatory cytokines. Immune function is an extremely complex process, and we designed a pragmatic assay to investigate samples from multiple sites that we have validated by showing similar effects in freshly isolated monocytes from patients with ACLF.

We show for the first time in a prospective trial that 20% HAS infusion reversed the immune suppressive effects of PGE2 in AD/ACLF by improving plasma binding to this molecule, thereby inactivating it. This effect persisted in samples tested to Day 10 but did not improve once serum albumin was > 30 g/L. PGE2 binds albumin but no other plasma proteins, and we found albumin to have a very low binding affinity for PGE2, supporting the presence of free unbound PGE2 within plasma at pathophysiological concentrations. Albumin infusion improved plasma protein binding to PGE2. Studies using PGE2 (E-prostanoid) receptor antagonists demonstrated a similar immune restorative effect to 20% HAS infusion and had no effect in samples post-HAS infusion, supporting this immune restorative effect of albumin occurring via PGE2 inhibition. Unexpectedly, plasma endotoxin and proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were unaffected by albumin infusions, therefore effects observed were not via direct modulation of these.

### Corticosteroid therapy in IgA nephropathy with minimal change-like lesions: a single-centre cohort study [^1178t12V]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

There is a lack of high-quality evidence that advocates the use of corticosteroids for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with minimal change-like lesions (also called IgAN with minimal change disease, MCD-IgAN).

- **Methods**: Twenty-seven biopsy-proven adult MCD-IgAN patients were enrolled. A daily single dose of 1 mg/kg (maximum 60 mg/day) prednisone was administered until complete remission (CR) was achieved, followed by a gradual decrease in the dosage. Clinical data were collected from baseline up to 12 weeks of treatment (Certification No. 2011NLY-006, Clinical trials gov ID: NCT01451710).

- **Results**: The patient cohort consisted of 15 males and 12 females, with a mean age of 29.2 ± 10.8 years (range 18–60 years) at the time of renal biopsy. All patients exhibited hypoalbuminaemia (23.7 ± 4.13 g/L) and heavy proteinuria (> 3.5 g/24 h). Cumulative CR, fasting blood glucose (FBG) elevation (> 6.2 mmol/L), and hypopotassaemia (< 3.5 mmol/L) occurred in 2, 5, 2, and 5 cases, respectively, but these conditions were eliminated following treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Corticosteroid therapy appears to be effective and safe for MCD-IgAN patients.

### The effects of perioperative corticosteroids on postoperative complications after pancreatoduodenectomy: A debated topic of systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115nG1n]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Previous studies have shown that perioperative corticosteroids can reduce the incidence of some postoperative complications and length of hospital stay after major abdominal surgery, but not after pancreatic surgery. Blank et al. demonstrated that in solid cancer resection, corticosteroids were associated with decreased 1-year mortality and a reduced risk of cancer recurrence in patients not responding to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Moreover, corticosteroids increased the risk of postoperative hyperglycemia, but no benefits in surgical site infections were observed.

- **Gastrointestinal surgery and intestinal function**: Regarding the effects of gastrointestinal surgery on intestinal function, McKechnie et al. published a meta-analysis in 2023 that included seven studies assessing the postoperative impacts of dexamethasone in colorectal surgery. This meta-analysis showed that perioperative intravenous dexamethasone may reduce prolonged postoperative ileus; however, there was no significant effect on postoperative infection complications. Zhang et al. also showed that a single 8 mg dose of intravenous dexamethasone administered during surgery for inflammatory bowel disease decreased the incidence of prolonged postoperative ileus and postoperative pain intensity, while also shortening the postoperative length of stay. There were no significant differences in postoperative nausea or vomiting, major postoperative complications, or surgical site infections between the groups.

A single-center, two-arm, parallel RCT involving 126 patients who underwent open or laparoscopic bowel surgery found that a single 8 mg dose of intravenous dexamethasone…

### Association of corticosteroid treatment with outcomes in adult patients with sepsis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178okki]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Although corticosteroids are widely used for adults with sepsis, both the overall benefit and potential risks remain unclear. This study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis.

MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception until March 20, 2018, with updates on August 10, 2018. The search terms included corticosteroids, sepsis, septic shock, hydrocortisone, controlled trials, and randomized controlled trial, whether alone or in combination. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included if they compared the administration of corticosteroids with placebo or standard supportive care in adults with sepsis.

Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Two independent reviewers completed citation screening, data abstraction, and risk assessment.

The main outcome measured was 28-day mortality. The meta-analysis included 37 RCTs with a total of 9,564 patients. Eleven trials were rated as having a low risk of bias. Corticosteroid use was associated with reduced 28-day mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.98; I² = 27%), ICU mortality (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77–0.94; I² = 0%), and in-hospital mortality (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79–0.99; I² = 38%). Corticosteroids were significantly associated with increased shock reversal at day 7 (MD, 1.95; 95% CI, 0.80–3.11) and vasopressor-free days.

### Serum regulates cortisol bioactivity by corticosteroid-binding globulin-dependent and independent mechanisms, as revealed by combined bioassay and physicochemical assay approaches [^113sqEvK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is the principal carrier of natural glucocorticoids in the circulation, and we hypothesized that it modulates glucocorticoid bioactivity (GBA). Alterations in CBG, the presence of noncortisol, naturally occurring glucocorticoids, and the use of potent, synthetic glucocorticoids all make it difficult to assess adrenal activity in vivo; these problems can be addressed by a glucocorticoid bioassay.

- **Design and subjects**: A bioassay was developed for serum GBA and a physicochemical ultrafiltration-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for free serum cortisol (FreeF). We studied individuals homozygous and heterozygous for a nonfunctioning CBG variant (CBG G237V) and healthy controls.

- **Results**: FreeF concentrations were similar in healthy controls and those with absent functional CBG, but surprisingly we found low GBA in CBG null individuals. This may suggest that CBG delivers cortisol to target cells. However, further experiments revealed that dilution of serum in the bioassay caused the release of cortisol from CBG, resulting in elevated GBA measurements in all but the CBG G237V homozygotes. Furthermore, we identified a specific and potent inhibitory effect of high concentration serum on glucocorticoid sensitivity of the recipient cells used in the bioassay. Analysis of inflammatory synovial fluid, a filtrate of serum with lower CBG concentration, revealed elevated free cortisol compared to noninflammatory synovial fluid, a change not attributable to interconversion between cortisol and cortisone.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest complex interactions involving CBG affect cortisol bioactivity, with implications for understanding adrenal physiology.

### Lymphir [^115oDMDN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Prior to starting each treatment cycle, assess hepatic and renal function. If serum albumin is less than 3 g/dL, delay administration of Lymphir until serum albumin is greater than or equal to 3 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended dosage of Lymphir is 9 mcg/kg/day of actual body weight, administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 through 5 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Administer Lymphir until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

- **Recommended premedications**: Administer premedications prior to starting a Lymphir infusion in Cycles 1 through 3, as outlined in the prescribing information, to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If patients experience a Grade 2 or higher infusion reaction, premedicate at least 30 minutes prior to each subsequent infusion with a systemic steroid such as dexamethasone 4 mg (or equivalent) via slow intravenous push, for at least 3 cycles.

- **Dosage modifications for adverse reactions**: Dosage modifications for adverse reactions with Lymphir are guided by the NCI CTCAE version 5.0.

Restarting following a dosage delay due to toxicity should follow the healthcare provider's guidance.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) in critically ill patients (Part I): Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) 2017 [^112wtRJZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, particularly concerning corticosteroid administration in ARDS, the ESICM/SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend considering the administration of corticosteroids in patients with early moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 of < 200 and within 14 days of onset).

### Serum albumin and beta-amyloid deposition in the human brain [^114MYg3P]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The present study had several limitations that should be considered. First, because this was a cross-sectional study, we could not confirm a causal relationship between chronic albumin status in blood and brain Aβ deposition. Some findings support the long-term stability of serum albumin level in healthy older adults. We also excluded individuals with severe medical conditions that could affect mental function. In addition, the results were not changed even when the individuals with decreased food intake were excluded. Together, our results may support a long-term causal effect of serum albumin on brain Aβ deposition. Nevertheless, further long-term follow-up studies are required to clarify the causal relationships. The lack of repeated assessments of serum albumin level may have resulted in measurement errors because of diurnal variation. However, to minimize such errors, all blood samples for serum albumin measurement were obtained at the same time of the day (8–9) in all participants.

The findings of the present study suggest that low serum albumin may increase the risk of AD dementia by elevating amyloid accumulation. In terms of AD prevention, more attention needs to be paid to avoid low serum albumin level, even within the clinical normal range, by clinicians.

### Corticosteroids for treating sepsis [^113tKS4r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failures, as defined by a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of two or higher. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism, and administering corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and updated in 2010 and again in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death at one month in patients with sepsis, and to determine whether the dose and duration of corticosteroids influence the patient's response to this treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (October 2014), EMBASE (October 2014), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; October 2014), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted trial authors for information. The original searches were conducted in August 2003 and October 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo or supportive treatment in patients with sepsis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All review authors agreed on the eligibility of trials. One review author extracted data, which were checked by the other review authors and the primary author of the paper when possible. We obtained some missing data from trial authors and assessed the methodological quality of the trials.

- **Main results**: We identified nine additional studies since the last update, totaling 33 eligible trials (n = 4268 participants). Twenty-three of these 33 trials were at low risk of selection bias.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^111wrQow]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for immunoglobulin A nephropathy, particularly with respect to pediatric patients, the KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend considering the addition of corticosteroids to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors from the time of diagnosis in pediatric patients with proteinuria greater than 1 g/day or a protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 1 g/g (100 mg/mmol) and/or mesangial hypercellularity. Consider administering oral prednisolone at 1–2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) for 4 weeks, followed by alternate-day tapering over 4–6 months, or regimens with IV methylprednisolone.

### Administration of albumin solution increases serum levels of albumin in patients with chronic liver failure in a single-arm feasibility trial [^1169fijN]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Infections are life-threatening to patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AD/ACLF). Patients with AD/ACLF have prostaglandin E2-mediated immune suppression, which can be reversed by the administration of albumin; infusion of 20% human albumin solution (HAS) might improve outcomes of infections. We performed a feasibility study to determine optimal trial design, assess safety, and validate laboratory assessments of immune function to inform the design of a phase 3 trial.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective multicenter, single-arm, open-label trial of 79 patients with AD/ACLF and levels of albumin lower than 30 g/L, seen at 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom from May through December 2015. Patients were given daily infusions of 20% HAS, based on serum levels, for 14 days or until discharge from the hospital. Rates of infection, organ dysfunction, and in-hospital mortality were recorded. The primary endpoint was the daily serum albumin level during the treatment period. Success would be demonstrated if 60% achieved and maintained serum albumin levels at or above 30 g/L on at least one-third of days with recorded levels.

- **Results**: The patients' mean model for end-stage disease score was 20.9 ± 6.6. The primary endpoint (albumin ≥ 30 g/L on at least one-third of days recorded) was achieved by 68 of the 79 patients; 75% of administrations were in accordance with the suggested dosing regimen. The mean treatment duration was 10.3 days (104 ± 678 mL administered). There were 8 deaths and 13 serious adverse events, considered by the independent data monitoring committee.

### Regulation of cortisol bioavailability — effects on hormone measurement and action [^113WfWPK]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Routine assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis relies on the measurement of total serum cortisol levels. However, most cortisol in serum is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin, and changes in the structure or circulating levels of binding proteins markedly affect measured total serum cortisol levels. Furthermore, high-affinity binding to CBG is predicted to affect the availability of cortisol for the glucocorticoid receptor. CBG is a substrate for activated neutrophil elastase, which cleaves the binding protein and results in the release of cortisol at sites of inflammation, enhancing its tissue-specific anti-inflammatory effects. Further tissue-specific modulation of cortisol availability is conferred by corticosteroid 11β-dehydrogenase.

Direct assessment of tissue levels of bioavailable cortisol is not clinically practicable, and measurement of total serum cortisol levels is of limited value in clinical conditions that alter prereceptor glucocorticoid bioavailability. Bioavailable cortisol can, however, be measured indirectly at systemic, extracellular tissue, and cell levels using novel techniques that have provided new insight into the transport, metabolism, and biological action of glucocorticoids. A more physiologically informative approach is, therefore, now possible in the assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which could prove useful in clinical practice.

Regarding the medical management of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), specifically when considering corticosteroids, the KDIGO 2021 guidelines emphasize caution.

- **Patient groups to avoid corticosteroid use**: Avoid corticosteroid treatment in patients with IgAN who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m², a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m², latent infections such as viral hepatitis or tuberculosis, cirrhosis, active peptic ulceration, uncontrolled psychiatric illness, or severe osteoporosis.

### Albumin counteracts immune-suppressive effects of lipid mediators in patients with advanced liver disease [^113iTNnB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AD/ACLF) experience immune dysfunction, increasing their risk for infections. However, effective treatments to restore their immune function remain absent. This study investigates whether albumin's potentially immune-restorative effects are mediated by its influence on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and other lipids.

We analyzed blood samples from 45 out of 79 patients with AD/ACLF, whose serum albumin levels were below 30 g/L. In a feasibility study, infusion of 20% human albumin solution (HAS) increased their serum albumin levels to 30 g/L or more. Immune function was assessed by comparing macrophage function after plasma samples were added. Additionally, samples from 12 healthy individuals were used. We measured the binding of plasma proteins to PGE2 and evaluated serum levels of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) and cytokines. Using samples from 10 patients, we examined the effects of PGE2 inhibitors. A comprehensive lipid metabolomic analysis was conducted on samples from 10 different patients, both before and after HAS administration.

At baseline, plasma from AD/ACLF patients induced significantly lower production of tumor necrosis factor by healthy macrophages compared to plasma from healthy individuals (P < .0001). Post-HAS infusion plasma induced significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor production by macrophages (19.5 ± 4.8 ng/mL) compared with plasma collected before treatment (17.7 ± 4.5 ng/mL; p = 0.0013).

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^115bZL4M]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

The inflammatory response and increased capillary permeability necessary for tissue healing after trauma or infection also occur in both physiological and pathological growth. For instance, there is a mild and sustained inflammatory response during pregnancy. The synthesis of cytokines and growth factors is mildly increased, initially exhibiting Th1 helper cell dominance. However, this response is further upregulated and transitions to Th2 helper cell dominance during fetal distress and decreases when leading to premature birth. A similar pattern is observed for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates angiogenesis, promotes capillary permeability, and leads to the expansion of the interstitium.

Cytokine and growth factor production also increases when preparing for lactation, stimulating the development of the terminal end buds necessary for lactation. Similar factors are produced during mammary cancer growth to promote tumor invasiveness. Cancerous tissue is embedded with immune cells that support tumor growth, and inflammation is evident at the systemic level.

Altogether, the inflammatory response acts as a general mechanism that promotes accelerated cell proliferation and matrix deposition in all conditions requiring these processes. An essential component involves growth factor–induced, such as VEGF, increases in vascular permeability. VEGF expression and increased vascular permeability are present during infection, trauma, fetal and postnatal growth, preparation for lactation, cancer, protein‐losing enteropathy, and nephrotic syndrome.

### Dexamethasone [^111Y7UpL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with corticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case regarding dose and duration of treatment and whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, as they may increase the risk of perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of corticosteroids in patients with c

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American college of critical care medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

To develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients, a multidisciplinary, multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Additionally, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

The task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, classifying recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C) based on factors such as the study design, the consistency of results, and the directness of evidence.

The task force introduced the term "critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency" to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during critical illness. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency is caused by adrenal insufficiency and tissue corticosteroid resistance, characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. It should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111XJUZy]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI) is related to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the oral corticosteroids (OCS) used, such as bioavailability, protein-binding affinities, plasma half-life, and metabolic inactivation and clearance. Repeat courses of OCS are also a risk factor for AI. Patients with a predisposition to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction due to other underlying conditions or medications may be particularly susceptible to AI caused by OCS. The risk of AI can be reduced, though not fully negated, by using the lowest effective dosage of OCS for the shortest amount of time.

Although the absolute risk of developing AI following a short course of OCS is often assumed to be low, clinically relevant HPA axis suppression may be substantially under-recognized and under-reported in clinical practice. In a study by Schuetz and colleagues, a 14-day course of systemic corticosteroids (40 mg methylprednisolone injection once, followed by 13 days of 40 mg oral prednisone) led to HPA axis suppression, as gauged by response to the 1 µg corticotropin (synthetic ACTH 1–24) stimulation test, in 7 of 9 patients on the first day following commencement of corticosteroid treatment; this increased to 8 of 9 by the last day of therapy. Moreover, 21 days after discontinuation of treatment, 3 patients still had evidence of adrenal dysfunction. All 9 patients had an underlying diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 5 were on inhaled corticosteroids at the time of admission, yet none had received systemic corticosteroid therapy in the preceding 6 months.

### Drug insight: The role of albumin in the management of chronic liver disease [^114xAjJj]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulation. Its main physiologic function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure. A better understanding of albumin's other physiologic functions has expanded its application beyond the maintenance of intravascular volume.

In patients with cirrhosis, albumin has been used as an adjunct to diuretics to improve the diuretic response. It has also been employed to prevent circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis. Newer indications in cirrhotic patients include preventing hepatorenal syndrome in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and treating established hepatorenal syndrome in conjunction with vasoconstrictor therapies. The use of albumin for many of these indications is controversial, mostly because of the paucity of well-designed, randomized controlled trials.

The cost of albumin infusions, the lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and the fear of transmitting unknown viruses add to the controversy. The latest indication for albumin use in cirrhotic patients is extracorporeal albumin dialysis, which has shown promise for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. However, its role in hepatorenal syndrome or acute-on-chronic liver failure has not been established. Efforts should be made to define the indications for albumin use, the dose of albumin required, and predictors of response, so that patients gain the maximum benefit from its administration.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1158KX7a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half-life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These two factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma.

Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis.

Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing physical capacity.

Regarding specific circumstances for critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend preferring salivary cortisol determination. This preference is due to the influence of reduced serum levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin and albumin, which are frequently observed in patients with cirrhosis, on serum free cortisol concentration.

### Corticosteroid therapy for sepsis: A clinical practice guideline [^113LjRZa]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Surrogate outcomes such as time to shock reversal, organ dysfunction measured by the sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, hyperglycaemia, and hypernatraemia were less important to the panel. This view is consistent with GRADE recommendations to focus on patient-important outcomes rather than surrogates.

- **Subgroups of interest**: The panel wanted to know whether the effect of corticosteroids differed in people with sepsis compared to those who had septic shock, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or were at higher risk of death. They also wanted to know whether the type of corticosteroid or its dose influenced outcomes.

The panel met by videoconference to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. No panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimized and managed (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).

The panel requested a systematic review of randomised controlled trials on the impact of corticosteroid therapy for patients who have sepsis, including those who have septic shock. This review examines the two latest, as well as previous studies, on corticosteroids in sepsis. The aim was to resolve apparently conflicting evidence.

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and create recommendations (see appendix 3 on bmj.com). The panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of corticosteroids, the quality of the evidence for each outcome, and expected values.

### The effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy for IgA nephropathy with crescents: a prospective, randomized, controlled study [^111KEm4r]. BMC Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Clinical and pathological evaluation: Proteinuria was defined as urine protein for 24 hours on two successive examinations during every follow-up. Serum creatinine was tested using the sarcosine oxidase method. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the MDRD equation: eGFR = 175 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)^-1.234 × age (year)^-0.179 [if female, × 0.79]. Renal biopsy was performed on every patient, and the biopsy specimens were reviewed by one pathologist who was unaware of the clinical details of the patients. All the samples were divided into three parts for light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscope examinations. The total number of glomeruli, mesangial proliferation, endocapillary hypercellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial inflammatory infiltration were recorded for the MEST score. Cellular and/or fibrocellular crescents were recorded and included in the MEST-C score classification, but fibrous crescents were not considered. Lee's grade was divided into grades II, III, IV, and V according to Lee's glomerular grading system.

Outcome measures: All participants were followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome measure was remission of proteinuria (complete or partial), while the secondary outcome measures included deterioration of renal function, evidenced by a 50% rise from baseline serum creatinine levels, a 25% decline from baseline eGFR levels, or the onset of end-stage renal disease. Treatment outcomes included complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and no response (NR). CR was defined as proteinuria < 0.3 g/24 h, without active urinary sediment, and serum albumin ≥ 35 g/L.

### New treatment for IgA nephropathy: Enteric budesonide targeted to the ileocecal region ameliorates proteinuria [^116dm6gs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid treatment has been shown to exert some protection against renal deterioration in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) but is not commonly recommended for long-term use due to the well-known systemic side effects. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a new enteric formulation of the locally acting glucocorticoid budesonide (Nefecon®), designed to release the active compound in the ileocecal region. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of targeted release budesonide on albuminuria.

- **Methods**: Budesonide 8 mg/day was given to 16 patients with IgAN for 6 months, followed by a 3-month follow-up period. The efficacy was measured as a change in 24-hour urine albumin excretion, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

- **Results**: The median relative reduction in urinary albumin excretion was 23% during the treatment period (interquartile range: -0.36 to -0.04, P = 0.04), with pretreatment values ranging from 0.3 to 6 g/24 h (median: 1.5 g/24 h). The median reduction in urine albumin peaked at 40% (interquartile range: -0.58 to -0.15) 2 months after treatment discontinuation. Serum creatinine was reduced by 6% (interquartile range: -0.12 to -0.02; P = 0.003), and eGFR [Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)] increased approximately 8% (interquartile range: 0.02–0.16, P = 0.003) during treatment. No major corticosteroid-related side effects were observed.

- **Conclusions**: In the present pilot study, enteric budesonide targeted to the ileocecal region had a significant effect on urine albumin excretion, accompanied by a modest improvement in kidney function metrics.

### Corticosteroid-binding globulin regulates cortisol pharmacokinetics [^113zbi86]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) serves as the principal carrier for cortisol in the circulation, and variations in CBG-binding capacity are expected to alter total serum cortisol disposition. However, free serum cortisol is believed to remain unaffected. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of unbound cortisol have not been studied extensively in the context of changes in CBG. This study aimed to assess the regulation of cortisol pharmacokinetics by CBG.

- **Design and subjects**: Women on oestrogens (oral contraceptive pill, OCP), patients homozygous for a nonfunctioning CBG variant (CBG null), and healthy controls (HV) were examined before and after intravenous (IV) and oral administration of hydrocortisone 20 mg.

- **Measurements**: PK parameters evaluated included total serum cortisol (SerF), free serum cortisol (FreeF), cortisone (FreeE), and salivary cortisol (SalF) and cortisone (SalE). Measurements focused on area under the curve (AUC), clearance (CL), half-life, and volume of distribution (V(d)).

- **Results**: Following IV hydrocortisone administration, the AUC and half-life of SerF were significantly higher in the OCP group and lower in the CBG null group. SerF clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V(d)) were significantly lower in the OCP group and increased in the CBG null group compared to healthy controls. PK parameters for FreeF and the salivary biomarkers showed no differences between the CBG null group and healthy controls. However, OCP patients demonstrated higher AUC and prolonged half-life compared to healthy controls. Similar findings were observed following oral hydrocortisone administration; however, concentration-time profiles were highly heterogeneous, and the interpretation of SalF was problematic due to oral contamination.

- **Conclusions**: The study demonstrates that CBG has a distinct impact on cortisol pharmacokinetics.

### Pro: The role of albumin in pre-liver transplant management [^115p88YA]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

The wait-list mortality of patients with decompensated cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation remains elevated due to the occurrence of complications. Etiologic treatments improve patient survival and lower the incidence of complications when applied in compensated cirrhosis. However, a decompensated disease may not improve or may even progress despite a response to therapy in a substantial number of patients. Thus, disease-modifying treatments that reduce the incidence of complications and improve survival are most needed. Such treatments should be capable of counteracting one or possibly more pathophysiological mechanisms, which lead to the proinflammatory and pro-oxidant milieu that characterizes decompensated cirrhosis.

In this respect, albumin represents a potentially ideal agent. Besides its ability to expand plasma volume, albumin possesses non-oncotic properties, exerting potent antioxidant and immune-modulating effects. Recent studies have assessed the effect of long-term albumin administration in decompensated cirrhosis. Although the results of these studies may appear conflicting, their analyses suggest that albumin, if given in a sufficient amount and for a sufficient duration, can significantly reduce the incidence of life-threatening complications of cirrhosis and decrease patient mortality. For these reasons, we favor albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis who are wait-listed for liver transplantation.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113M6aKc]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

The inflammation present in pregnancy is associated with modest hypoalbuminemia, which progresses from the first to the third trimester and is paralleled by increased water content of the maternal interstitium. Serum albumin levels in healthy children have been found in population studies to be inversely associated with growth rate, although within a range considered normal. The highest serum albumin levels in men are only reached in adulthood after the age of 20 years, when growth and muscle accretion have stopped. In females, serum albumin levels increase until puberty to levels comparable with men, after which they decrease, although still within the normal range, to below levels in men. This decrease is possibly related to pubertal growth and subsequent to their menstrual cycle, with cyclic tissue synthesis and breakdown.

### Total and high-affinity corticosteroid-binding globulin depletion in septic shock is associated with mortality [^117T8VcE]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin transport circulating cortisol. Cleavage of high-affinity CBG (haCBG) by neutrophil elastase at inflammatory sites causes cortisol release into tissues, facilitating immunomodulatory effects.

- **Objective**: To determine whether depletion of haCBG is related to mortality in septic shock.

- **Design**: A single-center prospective observational cohort study of patients recruited with critical illness or septic shock, using serum samples collected at 0, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Serum total and haCBG, and total and free cortisol were assayed directly. Glucocorticoid treatment was an exclusion criterion. Mortality was assessed at 28 days from Intensive Care Unit admission.

- **Results**: Thirty septic shock (SS) and 42 nonseptic critical illness (CI) patients provided 195 serum samples. SS/CI patients had lower total CBG, haCBG, and low-affinity CBG (laCBG) than controls. Total CBG and haCBG were significantly lower in septic shock patients who died than in those who survived (P < 0.009, P = 0.021, respectively). Total and free cortisol were higher in septic than nonseptic individuals. Free/total cortisol fractions were higher in those with low haCBG as observed in septic shock. However, cortisol levels were not associated with mortality. Albumin levels fell in sepsis but were not related to mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Low circulating haCBG concentrations are associated with mortality in septic shock. These results are consistent with an important physiological role for haCBG in cortisol tissue delivery in septic shock.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^111Nt5EN]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in the acutely ill and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients, a study was conducted. Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

A meta-analysis was conducted on 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients, evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis. Separately, nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia were also analyzed.

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay by 28% and 71% respectively, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. An analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients.

### Defining the black box: A narrative review of factors associated with adverse outcomes from severe infection [^111PzW2k]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Interpretation of a serum albumin concentration in a patient who presents acutely ill can be challenging for a clinician. This challenge arises because the measured serum albumin can result from the interaction of several different causal pathways. Hypoalbuminemia can be chronic, resulting from malnutrition or liver disease. Alternatively, hypoalbuminemia can also occur acutely, as albumin is a negative acute phase reactant and its level can drop in the setting of acute inflammation, and it can be excreted after renal injury or with protein-losing enteropathy. Therefore, conceptually, it makes sense that serum albumin would be useful in predicting outcomes from severe Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), because it is simultaneously a potential marker of acute inflammation and an indicator of the baseline health status of an individual. Although the predictive utility of serum albumin is not well defined, in some studies, hypoalbuminemia (defined as < 25–35 g/L) alone or as part of various clinical prediction rules has been found to be associated with an increased risk of mortality.

- **Level of care**: Level of care has been described in several studies, including a systematic review, as a factor that associates with increased risk of mortality, particularly for in-hospital mortality. Similar to albumin, however, level of care — specifically ICU level of care — has been used by many studies in the definition for severe CDI. Studies including ICU admission in the definition of severe CDI have demonstrated a significantly increased risk of 90-day mortality.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113Ef2F4]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

The study of hypoalbuminemia and albumin kinetics reveals that while low serum albumin levels in malnourished or stressed individuals have often been attributed to diminished synthesis, this is not always the case. In most disease states where synthesis rates have been assessed, the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in plasma is reported to be normal or mildly increased. FSR is primarily decreased in liver failure, where synthetic rate correlates with liver function, and possibly in children with kwashiorkor for unknown reasons. Although increased fractional and absolute synthesis rates in plasma might seem at odds with decreased serum albumin levels, they do not necessarily indicate increased synthesis at the whole-body level. Furthermore, synthesis rate is merely one factor influencing total serum albumin mass in the body. Serum albumin mass is also affected by its half-life, which is seldom measured. However, turnover time has been observed to be shortened in conditions such as hypertension, acromegaly, nephrotic syndrome, and protein-losing enteropathy.

### Reduced serum albumin as a risk factor for poor prognosis in critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy [^113XhmTV]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Inflammation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI can lead to long-term effects such as renal fibrosis and chronic inflammation, further progressing to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Additionally, albumin contains a large number of reduced sulfhydryl groups, contributing to its antioxidant effect, which, in excess, can result in kidney damage. Consequently, patients with reduced albumin levels are more prone to AKI and CKD. This impedes the recovery of kidney function in a short period and increases the risk of death.

Several studies have indicated that a decrease in serum albumin can predict poor disease prognosis. For example, a study by Olivia et al. involving 486 severely burned patients demonstrated that albumin was a good predictor of burn mortality, with a reported area under the curve of 0.869. The study indicated that the death risk increased by more than 80% when albumin levels were below 2 g/dL. In Reza Behrouz's study, hypoalbuminemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage, with an adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of 4.26 (95% CI: 1.09–16.68, p = 0.04).

This study demonstrates that albumin levels are associated with the prognosis in critical patients with AKI under continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), consistent with the results of previous studies by Moon et al. However, more confounding variables were adjusted in this study to enhance the results' reliability. Additionally, sensitivity analysis performed in the multivariate Cox regression analysis observed the nonlinear relationship between albumin and prognosis, ensuring the robustness of the results.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116WD59g]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

A schematic representation of albumin flux, synthesis, and degradation is depicted with arrows and shapes. Solid arrows indicate transmembrane transport, while dashed arrows illustrate synthesis in the liver and degradation through intracellular proteolysis. An increase in total body albumin is marked as a gain, and a decrease as a loss. The reduction pertains to reducing oxidized total body albumin.

The black oval's length represents albumin mass, which decreases due to more rapid intracellular breakdown in the liver and proliferating cells. It remains uncertain whether cell volume is stable, but it is certain that cell solids decrease in inflammatory conditions. Fluxes are portrayed by arrows of varying sizes crossing cell walls between the liver, plasma, interstitium, and cells, with larger arrows indicating higher transmembrane flux during inflammation compared to health. In some cases, only a portion of the flux entering the interstitium enters the cell. Instead, particularly in inflammation following oxidation or scavenging, it may return to the plasma for reduction or degradation in the liver.

The size of quadrangles corresponds to the volume of different compartments, and their grey intensity reflects serum albumin concentration. Although depicted similarly, the size of cell mass in health and inflammatory states may differ; cell mass could increase while cell solids decrease. In health, net hepatic albumin output enters the plasma, gaining limited access to the interstitium at a low rate, and subsequently to the cells. Within these compartments, albumin functions as an antioxidant, scavenger, and to a very limited extent, deg…

### Low-dose steroids associated with milder histological changes after pediatric liver transplantation [^117Prqzk]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Controversy remains about the role of protocol liver biopsy for symptom-free recipients and the long-term use of low-dose steroids after pediatric liver transplantation (LT). We conducted a national cross-sectional study of pediatric recipients who underwent LT between 1987 and 2007. Liver biopsy samples were taken from 54 patients (82% of survivors) following a median post-transplant follow-up of 11 years, and they were reviewed by two pathologists blinded to the clinical data. Biopsy samples from 18 patients (33%) showed nearly normal histology with no inflammation, fibrosis, or steatosis.

- **Portal inflammation**: Detected in 14 samples (26%), showed no correlation with anti-nuclear antibodies, and was less frequent in the 35 patients whose immunosuppression included steroids (14% versus 47% of patients not using steroids, P = 0.008).

- **Fibrosis**: Present in 21 biopsy samples (39%). According to the Metavir classification, 16 were stage 1, 3 were stage 2, and 2 were stage 3. The fibrosis stage correlated negatively with serum prealbumin levels (r = -0.364, P = 0.007) and positively with chronic cholestasis (cytokeratin 7 staining; r = 0.529, P < 0.001) and portal inflammation (r = 0.350, P = 0.01).

- **Microvesicular steatosis**: Found in 23 biopsy samples (43% of patients in 5%-80% of hepatocytes), correlated with the body mass index (r = 0.458, P < 0.001) but not with steroid use.

The age of the allograft (donor age plus follow-up time) correlated with higher serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (r = 0.472, P < 0.001) and conjugated bilirubin levels (r = 0.420, P = 0.002).

### Administration of albumin solution increases serum levels of albumin in patients with chronic liver failure in a single-arm feasibility trial [^112ijK6D]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Infections are life-threatening to patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AD/ACLF). Patients with AD/ACLF have prostaglandin E2–mediated immune suppression, which can be reversed by the administration of albumin. Infusion of 20% human albumin solution (HAS) might improve outcomes of infections. We performed a feasibility study to determine the optimal trial design, assess safety, and validate laboratory assessments of immune function to inform the design of a phase 3 trial.

We performed a prospective multicenter, single-arm, open-label trial of 79 patients with AD/ACLF and levels of albumin lower than 30 g/L. The study was conducted at 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom from May through December 2015. Patients were given daily infusions of 20% HAS, based on serum levels, for 14 days or until discharge from the hospital. Rates of infection, organ dysfunction, and in-hospital mortality were recorded. The primary endpoint was the daily serum albumin level during the treatment period. Success would be demonstrated if 60% achieved and maintained serum albumin levels at or above 30 g/L on at least one-third of days with recorded levels.

The patients' mean model for end-stage disease score was 20.9 ± 6.6. The primary endpoint (albumin ≥ 30 g/L on at least one third of days recorded) was achieved by 68 of the 79 patients; 75% of administrations were in accordance with the suggested dosing regimen. The mean treatment duration was 10.3 days (104 ± 678 mL administered). There were 8 deaths and 13 serious adverse events, considered by the independent data monitoring committee to be unrelated to the treatment.

### Moderately early (7–14 days) postnatal corticosteroids for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants [^113QqXc7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have been used late in the neonatal period to treat chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm babies, as well as early to try to prevent it. CLD is likely the result of persisting inflammation in the lungs, and the use of powerful anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone has some rationale. The early use of these drugs tends to be associated with increased adverse effects. Therefore, studies of moderately early treatment (7–14 days postnatal) might offer the dual benefits of fewer side effects and onset of action before chronic inflammation is established.

- **Objectives**: To determine if moderately early (7–14 days) postnatal corticosteroid treatment versus control (placebo or nothing) is beneficial in the prevention and/or treatment of early chronic lung disease in preterm infants.

- **Search strategy**: Randomised controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid therapy were sought from the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1966 - October 2002), hand-searching pediatric and perinatal journals, examining previous review articles, and information received from practicing neonatologists. Authors of all studies were contacted, where possible, to confirm details of reported follow-up studies or to obtain any information about long-term follow-up where none had been reported.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid treatment from 7–14 days of birth in high-risk preterm infants were selected for this review.

### Corticosteroids in sepsis: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^111X8EoZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with sepsis.

- **Data sources**: We updated a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS, and unpublished sources for randomized controlled trials that compared any corticosteroid to placebo or no corticosteroid in critically ill children and adults with sepsis.

- **Study selection**: Reviewers conducted duplicate screening of citations and data abstraction, using a modified Cochrane risk of bias tool for individual study risk of bias assessment.

- **Data extraction**: A parallel guideline committee provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. We assessed overall certainty in evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and performed all analyses using random-effect models. For subgroup analyses, we performed metaregression and considered a p-value of less than 0.05 as significant.

- **Data synthesis**: Forty-two randomized controlled trials including 10,194 patients proved eligible. Based on low certainty, corticosteroids may achieve a small reduction or no reduction in the relative risk of dying in the short-term (28–31 days) (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84–1.03; 1.8% absolute risk reduction; 95% CI, 4.1% reduction to 0.8% increase) and possibly achieve a small effect on long-term mortality (60 days to 1 year) based on moderate certainty (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00; 2.2% absolute risk reduction; 95% CI, 4.1%).

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111asfkm]. JPEN Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

The principles described regarding the risk of treatment for patients already subject to inflammation — especially infectious inflammation — also apply in medical oncology. Hypoalbuminemia often proves to be a strong independent risk factor for failure of chemotherapy and for mortality.

The strong connection between inflammation and plasma albumin levels generally makes the trend of these levels a suitable instrument to assess improvement or deterioration of the disease process. In a substantial number of patients with abdominal catastrophe, we closely followed up serum albumin levels, where damage control was achieved at the expense of open wounds, fistulas, or temporary stomata. This led to the observation that a rise of serum albumin of a few g/L over the course of a week was invariably associated with a negative fluid balance, body weight loss, and clinical improvement, whereas a drop in serum albumin levels was associated with opposite findings. This led to the practice of postponing surgical reintervention at least 6–12 weeks after damage control, when inflammatory activity had significantly subsided and the clinical condition improved, as reflected by the clinical state and increasing serum albumin levels [^100, 139].

### IPNA clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome [^1117JrU6]. Pediatric Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically concerning the management of subsequent relapses, the IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend administering a single daily dose of prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/m²/day (maximum of 60 mg) in patients experiencing a relapse of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome until complete remission is achieved. Remission is defined as a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≤ 20 mg/mmol (0.2 mg/mg) or a negative or trace dipstick result on ≥ 3 consecutive days. Subsequently, it is advised to decrease to alternate-day prednisone at 1.5 mg/kg per dose or 40 mg/m² per dose (maximum of 40 mg) for 4 weeks.

### High dose prednisolone lowers plasma glycated albumin levels compared to actual glycemic control: A retrospective observational study [^112Pe4Cb]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Glycated hemoglobin (A1c) and glycated albumin (GA) are often used as indicators of glycemic control. In this study, we determined whether prednisolone (PSL) administration lowers plasma GA.

- **Methods**: We investigated the factors affecting GA using multivariate analysis in 48 subjects with connective tissue diseases (CTDs).

- **Results**: Multiple regression analysis of GA showed that the dose of PSL [β = − 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) − 2.59 to − 0.14; p = 0.03], age (β = 0.06; 95% CI 0.03–0.09; p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (β = − 0.14; 95% CI − 0.28 to − 0.01; p = 0.042), and A1c (β = 1.4; 95% CI 0.38–2.42; p = 0.008) significantly correlated with GA (adjusted R² = 0.518). Moreover, GA levels adjusted for age, sex, BMI, plasma albumin (Alb), creatinine (Cre), and A1c in subjects taking ≥ 5 mg PSL were significantly lower than those in subjects taking < 5 mg PSL. Finally, the dose of PSL (as a continuous variable) was negatively correlated with GA adjusted for age, sex, BMI, Alb, Cre, and A1c.

- **Conclusion**: High dose (≥ 5 mg) PSL reduces GA concentration more than glycemia.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19: Equity-related analyses and update on evidence [^111A5D9M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. Nonetheless, the size of effect, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether and at which doses systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, to explore equity-related aspects in subgroup analyses, and to keep up at the time of writing with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 6 January 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids and the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care, different types, doses and timings (early versus late) of corticosteroids. We excluded corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
