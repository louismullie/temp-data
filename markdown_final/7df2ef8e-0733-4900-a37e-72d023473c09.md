## Question

Bulging lumbar disk

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a bulging lumbar disc, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and imaging-based classification to anchor terminology. Then, I should verify the natural history and prognosis to set expectations. Next, I will correlate symptoms and signs with imaging to avoid over-calling pathology. After that, I need to outline conservative management and when to escalate. Then, I should review interventional options and their evidence. Finally, I will examine surgical indications, timing, and special scenarios, and close with a practical algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't mislabel the pathology. A bulging disc reflects diffuse annular extension beyond the vertebral endplates involving more than 90 degrees of circumference, typically with the annulus intact and without focal nuclear extrusion, which distinguishes it from protrusion, extrusion, and sequestration; this morphology is common and often incidental in asymptomatic individuals, so I need to be cautious about attributing pain solely to a bulge on MRI [^114AeavR] [^115zXorD] [^114o16qg] [^1157gS7q].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history before jumping to treatment decisions. Spontaneous regression is far less likely for bulges than for extrusions or sequestrations, with reported regression around 13% for bulging compared with 70–96% for extrusions and sequestrations, and complete resolution is uncommon; this lower propensity for spontaneous change should temper expectations for conservative-only outcomes in pure bulge-dominant pathology [^112aLfGT] [^116G3yaz] [^114oiDrr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on MRI alone; I need to ensure clinical correlation. Many MRI abnormalities, including bulges, are prevalent in asymptomatic people, so I should prioritize history and examination that map to a plausible pain generator, look for dermatomal leg pain, neurologic deficits, and mechanical patterns, and reserve imaging for persistent symptoms, progressive deficits, or red flags; this helps avoid the common pitfall of treating the image rather than the patient [^115gx6pQ] [^116D8nb2] [^112AXPmo].

> I will now examine the initial conservative management pathway, since most patients improve without surgery. A 6-week trial of NSAIDs, activity as tolerated, and a structured physical therapy program emphasizing core stabilization and mechanical diagnosis and therapy principles is appropriate; I should confirm that symptoms are predominantly axial without progressive neurologic deficits before continuing conservatively, and I need to remember that epidural steroid injections can offer short-term relief but do not reliably change long-term surgery rates, so they are adjuncts rather than disease-modifying therapy [^114L4it6] [^116FwsaS] [^111FdEK3] [^1168ZE2i].

> Let me consider when to escalate beyond conservative care, and I should double-check the thresholds. If radicular symptoms persist beyond roughly 6–12 weeks, if pain and disability remain severe despite optimized nonoperative care, or if there is progressive neurologic deficit, then imaging and referral for surgical evaluation are reasonable; earlier surgical consultation may be appropriate in patients with severe leg-dominant pain and concordant imaging, recognizing that surgery tends to hasten recovery even if long-term outcomes often converge with nonoperative care in mixed herniation cohorts [^114mJ2o9] [^112owKTa] [^111jubsL].

> Next, I should review minimally invasive and percutaneous options, but wait, I need to check which are appropriate for bulges versus contained herniations. Mechanical disc decompression techniques like nucleoplasty or APLD are generally indicated for contained herniations with concordant radiculopathy after failed conservative therapy, not for diffuse bulges; in fact, APLD has been described as contraindicated or ineffective for diffuse annular bulging, so I must avoid overpromising these technologies in pure bulge presentations [^114eunKh] [^114wGJ3s] [^112qA5sr].

> I will now examine surgical indications and timing, and I should confirm that standard discectomy applies when there is nerve root compression. Lumbar discectomy is indicated when MRI demonstrates a herniation or focal bulge compressing a nerve root, symptoms match the expected distribution, leg pain predominates over back pain, and symptoms persist after an adequate trial of conservative therapy; urgent surgery is warranted for cauda equina syndrome or rapidly progressive motor deficits, and earlier surgery yields faster relief even if long-term outcomes may be similar in intent-to-treat analyses [^114mJ2o9] [^112owKTa] [^111jubsL].

> But wait, what if the "bulge" is actually contributing to spinal stenosis rather than isolated radiculopathy; I should verify how that changes risk and planning. In lumbar spinal stenosis, greater disc bulge extent quantified by extended area and bulge length independently predicts higher revision risk after decompression, suggesting that substantial ventral disc bulge may require a more aggressive decompression strategy or consideration of concomitant stabilization if instability is present, especially in younger or smoking patients [^117YQ6gm].

> Let me reconsider the role of fusion, because I need to ensure I'm not overusing it. For primary disc herniation with radiculopathy, routine fusion at the time of discectomy is not supported; fusion may be considered when there is radiographic instability, chronic mechanical back pain, severe degenerative changes, heavy manual labor demands, or recurrent herniation with instability, but evidence quality is limited and patient selection is key [^116LwMUt] [^114kg16R].

> I should confirm the diagnostic workup sequence to minimize unnecessary interventions. MRI is the noninvasive test of choice when clinical findings suggest radiculopathy or stenosis, with CT or CT myelography reserved for MRI contraindications or inconclusive studies; discography is invasive, controversial, and should be reserved for highly selected discogenic pain cases when a treatment pathway hinges on confirmation of the pain generator, ideally with concordant pain and negative control levels [^111oyoPe] [^117CcbbB] [^113BKz5G].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic modifiers that might shift the balance toward earlier surgery or more intensive rehabilitation. Smoking, depression, and comorbid joint problems are associated with worse outcomes regardless of treatment, while sequestered fragments, longer symptom duration, and higher baseline back pain burden may derive greater relative benefit from surgery; shared decision-making should incorporate these factors and patient preferences about recovery speed versus avoidance of surgery [^117H3Gip].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I need to ensure it aligns with evidence. Start with careful clinical correlation to distinguish axial from radicular pain and screen for red flags; if symptoms are mild to moderate and nonprogressive, pursue 6 weeks of conservative therapy; if symptoms persist or deficits progress, obtain MRI and refer for surgical consultation; consider percutaneous decompression only for contained herniations with concordant radiculopathy after failed conservative care; reserve discectomy for persistent, function-limiting radiculopathy with concordant compression, and escalate to fusion only when instability or specific indications are present; throughout, counsel on the lower likelihood of spontaneous regression with bulges compared with extrusions to set realistic expectations [^114mJ2o9] [^114eunKh] [^112aLfGT].

> In summary, I should emphasize that a bulging lumbar disc is a morphological descriptor with limited intrinsic prognostic value for spontaneous improvement; management hinges on correlating imaging with a clinically compatible pain syndrome, prioritizing conservative care, and intervening surgically when nerve root compression drives persistent, disabling radiculopathy, while avoiding procedures with poor evidence for diffuse bulges and tailoring decisions to patient-specific modifiers and preferences [^114AeavR] [^112owKTa] [^114mJ2o9].

Bulging lumbar discs are common and often **asymptomatic** [^114o16qg]; when symptomatic, they typically cause axial low back pain with or without radiculopathy [^1171vTV3]. Most patients improve with **conservative care** (NSAIDs, physical therapy, and activity) over 6–12 weeks [^114L4it6] [^116FwsaS]. MRI is the **preferred imaging** modality to confirm diagnosis and guide management [^111oyoPe]. Surgery is reserved for persistent radiculopathy, progressive neurologic deficits, or cauda equina syndrome [^114mJ2o9]. Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with low recurrence and good long-term outcomes when managed appropriately [^112owKTa] [^1176dpQz].

---

## Clinical presentation

Bulging lumbar discs may be **asymptomatic** or cause symptoms such as:

- **Axial low back pain**: Often dull, aching, and localized, sometimes radiating to the buttocks or thighs [^notfound].

- **Radiculopathy**: Nerve root compression causing radiating leg pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in a dermatomal distribution [^114mJ2o9].

- **Neurologic deficits**: Rare but may include motor weakness, sensory changes, or reflex abnormalities [^114mJ2o9].

- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Severe compression causing saddle anesthesia, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and lower extremity weakness; this is a surgical emergency [^114mJ2o9].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis relies on clinical correlation and imaging:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history and physical examination to identify symptom patterns, neurologic deficits, and red flags [^116D8nb2].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Gold standard for visualizing disc morphology, nerve root compression, and spinal canal narrowing [^111h9Fkz].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Useful when MRI is contraindicated or inconclusive [^111oyoPe].

- **Plain radiographs**: Limited utility but may show disc space narrowing or degenerative changes [^1171vTV3].

---

## Conservative management

Most bulging lumbar discs respond well to **conservative treatment**:

- **Medications**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, muscle relaxants, and short-term opioids for severe pain [^111FdEK3].

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility exercises, and posture training [^116nGsZp].

- **Activity modification**: Avoid heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, and repetitive motions [^notfound].

- **Epidural steroid injections**: Considered for persistent radicular pain after failed conservative therapy [^111FdEK3].

---

## Surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for:

- **Persistent radiculopathy**: Despite 6–12 weeks of conservative treatment [^111jubsL].

- **Progressive neurologic deficits**: Motor weakness or sensory loss [^116nGsZp].

- **Cauda equina syndrome**: Emergency surgical decompression required [^notfound].

Common surgical procedures include **microdiscectomy**, which removes the herniated portion of the disc, and **laminectomy**, which removes part of the vertebral bone to relieve pressure. Fusion is rarely indicated unless instability is present [^116LwMUt].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **generally favorable**. Most patients improve with conservative care, and recurrence rates are low (about 5–15%) [^112owKTa]. Long-term outcomes are good, though some patients may have residual mild pain or functional limitations [^1176dpQz].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **core strengthening**, ergonomic adjustments, weight management, and avoiding tobacco use. These measures reduce recurrence risk and promote spinal health.

---

Bulging lumbar discs are common and often manageable with conservative care; surgery is reserved for select cases, and most patients have **favorable outcomes** with appropriate treatment.

### Management of symptomatic lumbar degenerative disk disease [^1171vTV3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Symptomatic lumbar degenerative disk disease, or discogenic back pain, is difficult to treat. Patients often report transverse low back pain that radiates into the sacroiliac joints. Radicular or claudicatory symptoms are generally absent unless there is concomitant nerve compression. Physical examination findings are often unremarkable. Radiographic examination may reveal disk space narrowing, end-plate sclerosis, or vacuum phenomenon in the disk; magnetic resonance imaging is useful for revealing hydration of the disk, annular bulging, or lumbar spine end-plate (Modic) changes in the adjacent vertebral bodies. The use of diskography as a confirmatory study remains controversial. Recent prospective, randomized trials and meta-analyses of the literature have helped expand what is known about degenerative disk disease. In most patients with low back pain, symptoms resolve without surgical intervention; physical therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the cornerstones of nonsurgical treatment. Intradiskal electrothermal treatment has not been shown to be effective, and arthrodesis remains controversial for the treatment of discogenic back pain. Nucleus replacement and motion-sparing technology are too new to have demonstrated long-term data regarding their efficacy.

Indications and Contraindications

Lumbar discectomy, in both its minimally invasive and more traditional open forms, is a procedure which targets the removal of a portion of an intervertebral lumbar disc which is herniated through the disc annulus or causing the annulus to bulge, ultimately leading to pressure on the traversing and/or exiting nerve root at this level. In the traditional open procedure, a laminotomy is usually created at the more cranial level of the disc herniation. The thecal sac and traversing nerve root are then retracted medially, and the herniated or bulging disc fragment is removed under microscopic magnification. In the more minimally invasive techniques, bony removal is often limited, if necessary at all. Visualization is often provided by an endoscope in an effort to limit the opening needed to perform such a procedure.

Lumbar discectomy is indicated in the following situations:
Diagnostic testing (MRI, CT myelogram) which shows a herniated/bulging lumbar disc causing compression of the traversing nerve root, exiting nerve root or cauda equina
Significant pain, weakness, numbness or paresthesias in an expected distribution based on the compressed nerve root
Radiculopathy symptoms that are more significant than LBP symptoms
Symptoms have not improved with upwards of 6 weeks of conservative management (NSAIDs, oral steroids, epidural steroid injections, physical therapy, etc.)
Symptoms consistent with cauda equina syndrome (bilateral leg weakness, sensory disturbances in the genital and saddle region, loss of bowel/bladder control)

While multiple different interventions are possible with regard to lumbar discectomy, all of these procedures and devices have received approval from the FDA. Regarding contraindications to lumbar discectomy, the most significant is related to spinal instability. In patients with evidence of underlying instability, decompression alone can lead to worsening of this instability and further morbidity. Other contraindications which have been noted in the literature include calcified discs, painless weakness and pyogenic spondylodiscitis or other severe disc space infections. Specifically, endoscopic discectomy can be contraindicated in the setting of cauda equina syndrome and severe fibrotic adhesions. Also, regarding endoscopic discectomy, tubular discectomy and other percutaneous techniques, surgeon experience and level of training must be considered prior to proceeding.

### Disc bulging predicts poor outcomes of decompression surgery for lumbar spinal canal stenosis [^117YQ6gm]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS) is a prevalent degenerative musculoskeletal disorder in aging populations. While decompression surgery is a standard treatment, some patients require revision surgery. Disc bulging, a distinct component of the degenerative process separate from disc herniation, contributes to spinal stenosis. However, its impact on surgical outcomes for LSCS has never been examined. This study aimed to elucidate the influence of disc bulging on outcomes of decompressive surgery for LSCS, addressing a critical knowledge gap.

Methods

This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 517 consecutive patients involving 912 intervertebral levels who underwent decompression surgery for LSCS. We statistically evaluated the association between disc bulging and revision surgery. Two measures were utilized to assess disc bulging: the extended area of the disc (EAD), referring to the horizontal expansion of the disc, and the disc bulging length (DBL), which indicated the degree of disc intrusion into the spinal canal. Other conventional radiographical assessments and patient background characteristics were also evaluated.

Results

Revision surgery was required in 28 patients (5.4%) involving 31 intervertebral levels (3.4%). Patients requiring revision surgery were significantly younger and more likely to smoke. Both the EAD and DBL were significantly higher in the revision group compared to the no-revision group (P < .001 for both). We did not observe an association between other conventional radiographical assessments and revision surgery. Multivariable analysis revealed that the EAD and DBL were independently correlated with revision surgery.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that disc bulging, particularly as measured by EAD, is a significant predictor of revision surgery following decompression for LSCS. These findings highlight the importance of pre-operative assessment of disc bulging in predicting surgical outcomes and optimizing patient selection for decompressive procedures.

### Randomized controlled trials of the treatment of lumbar disk herniation: 1983–2007 [^116rw6mc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials are considered to provide the strongest data regarding the relative benefits of treatment alternatives for medical conditions. Uncertainty persists regarding the optimal treatment of patients with symptomatic lumbar disk herniation. Five randomized controlled trials were published between 1983 and 2007 that compared lumbar diskectomy with nonsurgical treatment. The studies enrolled more than 1,000 patients. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were generally similar, but there was substantial variation in the outcomes measurements used. In all studies, more than one third of patients assigned to nonsurgical care crossed over to have surgery. Crossover in the opposite direction ranged from 0% to almost 40%. As a result of the large number of crossovers, the estimated treatment effect size of diskectomy likely is underestimated. Valid inferences about the safety and effectiveness of continued nonsurgical care cannot be made. The use of frequentist statistical techniques threatens the validity of post hoc subgroup analysis. Large cohort studies and alternative statistical techniques may yield more accurate estimates of the effectiveness of lumbar diskectomy and aid in identifying patients who may benefit from early surgical intervention.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^114ZsUHR]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation (NASS) define how study quality informs recommendation wording and strength. Levels of evidence range from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus), and levels are assigned to studies prior to developing recommendations; recommendations are then graded based on the level of evidence. Grades of Recommendation pair evidence tiers with language: A uses Level I studies with consistent findings and the recommendation wording "is recommended"; B uses Level II or III studies with consistent findings and the wording "suggest"; C uses Level IV or V studies and indicates a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option"; I denotes insufficient or conflicting evidence and states that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against". The guideline notes that significant shortcomings in study execution can downgrade a study's potential level of evidence.

### How should we grade lumbar disc herniation and nerve root compression? A systematic review [^111h9Fkz]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

MRI is the gold standard for evaluating the relationship of disc material to soft tissue and neural structures. However, terminologies used to describe lumbar disc herniation and nerve root compression have always been a source of confusion. A clear understanding of lumbar disc terminology among clinicians, radiologists, and researchers is vital for patient care and future research.

Questions/Purposes

Through a systematic review of the literature, the purpose of this article is to describe lumbar disc terminology and comment on the reliability of various nomenclature systems and their application to clinical practice.

Methods

PubMed was used for our literature search using the following MeSH headings: "Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Intervertebral Disc Displacement" and "Lumbar Vertebrae" and terms "nomenclature" or "grading" or "classification". Ten papers evaluating lumbar disc herniation/nerve root compression using different grading criteria and providing information regarding intraobserver and interobserver agreement were identified.

Results

To date, the Combined Task Force (CTF) and van Rijn classification systems are the most reliable methods for describing lumbar disc herniation and nerve root compression, respectively. van Rijn dichotomized nerve roots from "definitely no root compression, possibly no root compression, indeterminate root compression, possible root compression, and definite root compression" into no root compression (first three categories) and root compression (last two categories). The CTF classification defines lumbar discs as normal, focal protrusion, broad-based protrusion, or extrusion. The CTF classification system excludes "disc bulges", which is a source of confusion and disagreement among many practitioners. This potentially accounts for its improved reliability compared with other proposed nomenclature systems.

Conclusions

The main issue in the management of patients with lumbar disc disease and nerve root compression is correlation of imaging findings with clinical presentation and symptomatology to guide treatment and intervention. Although it appears that the most commonly supported nomenclatures have strong interobserver reliability, the classification term "disc bulges" is a source of confusion and disagreement among many practitioners. Additional research should focus on the clinical application of the various nomenclatures.

Lumbar disc herniation — epidural procedures and natural history: Epidural procedures are suited in managing chronic lumbar disc herniation with a natural history of radicular pain showing a favorable prognosis. Disc regression or resorption have been shown to be most favorable in disc sequestration (96%), disc extrusion (70%), and disc protrusion (40%); however, it was only 13% in disc bulging. In nonoperative treatment of disc extrusion, 30% of patients showed good to excellent outcomes and 92% achieved return to work status.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114wGJ3s]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy (APLD) — Revel et al. study appraisal and exclusion: Among study patients, 69 were treated with APLD with a reported success rate of 43%. The planned sample size of 80 patients in each group was not met, and follow-up was described as one year but was only 6 months. Discography findings and protocol allowances raised concerns, including 39% epidural leakage; migration up to 5 mm with 71% in this category and it appears that 29% migrated beyond 5 mm; bilateral lower extremity pain in 8% and large volume herniations in 14%. Discs with diffuse annular bulging were not specified for exclusion even though APLD is stated as not effective and therefore contraindicated. Additional issues included 16% severely degenerated discs, 9% with marked disc space narrowing, and 2 technical failures when the probe could not be introduced. There was no requirement that leg pain exceed back pain, and 21% had severe back pain. Because only 6 month follow-up results were available, the study was excluded.

### The probability of spontaneous regression of lumbar herniated disc: a systematic review [^112aLfGT]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the probability of spontaneous disc regression among each type of lumbar herniated disc, using a systematic review.

Data Sources

Medline, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched using key words for relevant original articles published before March 2014. Articles were limited to those published in English and human studies.

Review Methods

Articles had to: (1) include patients with lumbar disc herniation treated conservatively; (2) have at least two imaging evaluations of the lumbar spine; and (3) exclude patients with prior lumbar surgery, spinal infections, tumors, spondylolisthesis, or spinal stenosis. Two reviewers independently extracted study details and findings. Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Furthermore, if the classification of herniation matched the recommended classification of the combined Task Forces, the data were used for combined analysis of the probability of disc regression of each type. Nine studies were applicable for probability calculation.

Results

The rate of spontaneous regression was found to be 96% for disc sequestration, 70% for disc extrusion, 41% for disc protrusion, and 13% for disc bulging. The rate of complete resolution of disc herniation was 43% for sequestrated discs and 15% for extruded discs.

Conclusions

Spontaneous regression of herniated disc tissue can occur, and can completely resolve after conservative treatment. Patients with disc extrusion and sequestration had a significantly higher possibility of having spontaneous regression than did those with bulging or protruding discs. Disc sequestration had a significantly higher rate of complete regression than did disc extrusion.

### What are long-term predictors of outcomes for lumbar disc herniation? A randomized and observational study [^117H3Gip]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although previous studies have illustrated improvements in surgical cohorts for patients with intervertebral disc herniation, there are limited data on predictors of long-term outcomes comparing surgical and nonsurgical outcomes.

Questions/Purposes

We assessed outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment for patients with intervertebral disc herniation and symptomatic radiculopathy at 8 years from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial. We specifically examined subgroups to determine whether certain populations had a better long-term outcome with surgery or nonoperative treatment.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks associated with nerve root irritation or neurologic deficit on examination and a confirmed disc herniation on cross-sectional imaging were enrolled at 13 different clinical sites. Patients consenting to participate in the randomized cohort were assigned to surgical or nonoperative treatment using variable permuted block randomization stratified by site. Those who declined randomization entered the observational cohort group based on treatment preference but were otherwise treated and followed identically to the randomized cohort. Of those in the randomized cohort, 309 of 501 (62%) provided 8-year data and in the observational group 469 of 743 (63%). Patients were treated with either surgical discectomy or usual nonoperative care. By 8 years, only 148 of 245 (60%) of those randomized to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 122 of 256 (48%) of those randomized to nonoperative treatment had undergone surgery. The primary outcome measures were SF-36 bodily pain, SF-36 physical function, and Oswestry Disability Index collected at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. Further analysis studied the following factors to determine if any were predictive of long-term outcomes: sex, herniation location, depression, smoking, work status, other joint problems, herniation level, herniation type, and duration of symptoms.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort at 8 years showed no difference between surgical and nonoperative treatment for the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures of sciatica bothersomeness, leg pain, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement showed greater improvement in the group randomized to surgery despite high levels of crossover. The as-treated analysis of the combined randomized and observational cohorts, adjusted for potential confounders, showed advantages for surgery for all primary outcome measures; however, this has the potential for confounding from other unrecognized variables. Smokers and patients with depression or comorbid joint problems had worse functional outcomes overall (with surgery and nonoperative care) but similar surgical treatment effects. Patients with sequestered fragments, symptom duration greater than 6 months, those with higher levels of low back pain, or who were neither working nor disabled at baseline showed greater surgical treatment effects.

Conclusions

The intent-to-treat analysis, which is complicated by high rates of crossover, showed no difference over 8 years for primary outcomes of overall pain, physical function, and back-related disability but did show small advantages for secondary outcomes of sciatica bothersomeness, satisfaction with symptoms, and self-rated improvement. Subgroup analyses identified those groups with sequestered fragments on MRI, higher levels of baseline back pain accompanying radiculopathy, a longer duration of symptoms, and those who were neither working nor disabled at baseline with a greater relative advantage from surgery at 8 years.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^111j9pMj]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment

Conservative treatment is considered a first-line treatment for the majority of patients with degenerative spine disease, unless the disease presents with acute neurological symptoms such as myelopathy or cauda equine syndrome. When medical therapy fails, imaging and spinal surgery are considered as the next step of management. Depending on the prevalent degenerative pattern, different surgical approaches can be utilised. Patients with symptomatic disc herniations can benefit from microdiscectomy. If a degenerative process results in destabilisation and abnormal spinal motion, different types of surgical fusion can be used to stabilise the spine. Interbody fusion implants are widely used to restore disc height and support the anterior column. Spondylotic changes usually do not require surgery (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24
Surgical treatment options for degenerative changes. (a) Herniations. Herniations are often associated with pain and neurological symptoms and most commonly occur on the lumbar spine. Treatment options include conservative treatment if the herniation does not compress the nerves and surgical removal of the herniation if neural compression exists. (b) Spondylosis. Chronic longstanding disc degeneration results in slowly progressive mild-to-moderate disc space narrowing and gradual osteophyte formation without apparent disc displacement. Spondylosis is considered an adaptive reaction to stabilise motion in the presence of instability or a compensatory mechanism to limit the range of motion and prevent further degeneration. Altered disc biomechanics and narrowed intervertebral disc space subsequently lead to facet joint degeneration. This is probably the most favourable type of degeneration as it is essentially asymptomatic, may be seen at all levels of the spine and typically does not require treatment. (c) Disc collapse. Disc collapse leads to annular folding, anterior bulging of the flaval ligaments and posterior bulging of the posterior longitudinal ligament, with consequential narrowing of the central spinal canal. The decreasing disc height of the involved spinal segment leads to increased stiffness and may cause vertical degeneration of the adjacent vertebral segments. (d) Progressive structural failure of the disc to maintain the integrity of the functional spinal unit leads to segmental instability. This may progress to degenerative spondylolysthesis and require spinal instrumentation

Natural history of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — evidence review and consensus: Because of limitations in available evidence, the group could not definitively answer the natural history question; they reviewed 65 articles from multiple databases for studies published between January 1966 and March 2011. In the absence of reliable evidence, the work group's opinion is that the majority of patients will improve independent of treatment, disc herniations will often shrink or regress over time, and many, but not all, papers show clinical improvement with decreased herniation size.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) pathoanatomy — ventral compression can be caused by medial bulging or protrusion of intervertebral disks, and lateral stenosis can result from lateral prolapse, stenosis of the neuroforamen, or hypertrophy of the facet joints. Hypertrophic facet joints can narrow the neuroforamen and produce lateral stenosis. Osteolysis and disk prolapse are distinct from LSS but can frequently exacerbate preexisting lumbar stenosis.

### SPORT lumbar intervertebral disk herniation and back pain: does treatment, location, or morphology matter? [^115z7VVE]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Diskectomy candidates with at least 6 weeks of sciatica and confirmatory imaging were enrolled in a randomized or observational cohort.

Objective

This study sought to determine: (1) whether diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and (2) whether herniation location and morphology affected back pain outcomes.

Summary Of Background Data

Previous studies have reported that lumbar diskectomy is less successful for relief of back pain than leg pain and patients with central disc herniations or protrusions have worse outcomes.

Methods

Patients underwent diskectomy or received "usual" nonoperative care. Data from the randomized cohort and observational cohort were combined in an as-treated analysis. Low back pain was recorded on a 0 to 6 point scale, and changes in low back pain were compared between the surgical and nonoperative treatment groups. The effects of herniation location and morphology on back pain outcomes were determined.

Results

The combined analysis included 1191 patients with 775 undergoing surgery within 2 years, whereas 416 remained nonoperative. Overall, leg pain improved more than back pain in both treatment groups. Back pain improved in both surgical and nonoperative patients, but surgical patients improved significantly more (treatment effect favoring surgery -0.9 at 3 months, -0.5 at 2 years, P < 0.001). Patients who underwent surgery were more likely to report no back pain than nonoperative patients at each follow-up period (28.0% vs. 12.0% at 3 months, P < 0.001, 25.5% vs. 17.6% at 2 years, P = 0.009). At baseline, central herniations were associated with more severe back pain than more lateral herniations (4.3 vs. 3.9, P = 0.012). Patients with central herniations and protrusionshad a beneficial treatment effect from surgery similar to the overall surgical group.

Conclusion

Diskectomy resulted in greater improvement in back pain than nonoperative treatment, and this difference was maintained at 2 years for all herniation locations and morphologies.

### Conservative treatment for giant lumbar disc herniation: clinical study in 409 cases [^111EmHNp]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There have been several recent reports of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) resorption; however, large sample studies are lacking, and the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon is unclear.

Objectives

To explore the feasibility and clinical outcomes of conservative treatment for giant LDH and to analyze the factors affecting the resorption of giant LDH.

Study Design

Observational study and original research.

Setting

This work was performed at a University Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Methods

From January 2008 to December 2019, 409 patients with giant LDH who initially underwent nonsurgical treatment in our hospital were followed for 1–12 years to analyze the rate of surgical intervention, calculate the rate of resorption of protrusions, and the rate of excellent clinical outcomes.

Results

Eighty-nine of the 409 patients (21.76%) underwent surgery, while the remaining 320 patients (78.24%) constituted the non-surgical treatment group. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score in the 320 patients changed from 10.22 ± 3.84 points to 24.88 ± 5.69 points after treatment, and the rate of excellent outcomes was 84.06%. Among the 320 patients in the non-surgical treatment group, the protrusion percentage decreased from 70.08 ± 30.95% to 31.67 ± 24.42%. One-hundred and eighty-nine patients (59.06%) had > 30% resorption of protrusions, and 81 patients (25.31%) had a significant resorption of protrusions of > 50%. Among 189 patients with resorption, the shortest resorption interval was 1 month, and the longest was 8 years, with 77 patients (40.74%) showing resorption within 6 months, 51 (26.98%) within 6–12 months, and 61 patients (32.28%) after 12 months.

Limitation

The main limitations are that all patients were from the same site, and there was a lack of multicenter randomized controlled trials with which to compare data.

Conclusions

Patients with giant LDH are less likely to develop progressive nerve injury and cauda equina syndrome if their clinical symptoms improve after treatment. As long as there is no progressive nerve injury or cauda equina syndrome, conservative treatment is preferred for giant disc herniation. Resorption is more likely with greater disc protrusions in the spinal canal. A ring enhancement bull's eye sign) around a protruding disc on enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is an important indicator of straightforward resorption.

### Lumbar disc herniations: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^113R4Ftw]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar disc herniation is among the most common causes of lower-back pain and sciatica. The cause(s) of lumbar disc herniation and the relation of lumbar disc herniation to back pain and sciatica have not been fully elucidated, but most likely comprise a complex combination of mechanical and biologic processes. Furthermore, the natural history of lumbar disc herniation seems generally to be favorable, leaving the optimum treatment for lumbar disc herniation a debate in the literature. Various nonoperative and operative treatment strategies have been tried with varying degrees of success. Treatment often involves patient education, physical therapy, alternative medicine options, and pharmaco-therapy. If these fail, surgical intervention is usually recommended. A literature search was conducted to evaluate the currently known effectiveness of traditional and novel non-operative and surgical techniques for the treatment lumbar disc herniation and to determine if there are substantive new advantages in these newer contemporary treatments or combinations thereof. A structured approach to treatment of a patient who may have a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is presented, based on analysis of the current literature. No one method of nonoperative or operative treatment would seem definitively to be superior to another. Appropriate multidisciplinary treatment including behavioral analysis and support may offer the hope of improved outcomes for patients with lumbar disc herniation.

Lateral Recess

The lateral recess (aka the subarticular zone) is the outermost region of the spinal canal that is bordered laterally by the pedicle, posteriorly by the superior articular facet and LF, and anteriorly by the vertebral body, endplate and disc margin. This region is considered stenotic when AP measurement is < 4 mm. Nerve root compression in the lateral recess is also another important qualitative parameter in the radiological assessment for lateral recess stenosis. Due to the close proximity within the canal, stenosis in this region can lead to symptoms of radiculopathy due to nerve root compression with or without NC and can have a bilateral or unilateral presentation.

Foraminal

The neuroforamen is formed by the interpedicular osseous opening in which each spinal nerve root exits the dural sac passing through the lateral recess. The anterior anatomic boundaries of the intervertebral foramen include the adjacent superior-inferior vertebral pedicles, posteroinferior margin of the superior vertebral body, the intervertebral disc, and the posterosuperior margin of the inferior vertebral body, and the posterior anatomic boundaries include the LF and the superior and inferior articular facets. This region has three anatomical zones: internal, intraforaminal and extraforaminal. Degenerative changes such as hypertrophy and bone spurs from facet joints and bulging or herniated discs often contribute to foraminal stenosis. The neuroforamen are considered stenotic based on reduced perineural fat and/or reduced foraminal dimensions on MRI. A height less than 15 mm and a posterior disc height of 4 mm or less are associated with significant nerve root compression. Lumbar foraminal stenosis has a reported prevalence of 8% to 11%. Symptoms of pure foraminal stenosis typically are due to neural compression or neural irritation from an inflammatory cascade with a dermatomal distribution. Although no clinical finding is specific enough to suggest foraminal stenosis, patients often present with radicular leg pain and limited lumbar range of motion, particularly with extension. Low back pain, particularly in the buttock region, is often associated with foraminal stenosis.

Multistructural

Multistructural narrowing involving the central, lateral recess, and neuroforamen is the most frequently encountered LSS in those > 60 years old. The narrowing typically has a trefoil or cloverleaf appearance on axial cross-sections, in which all three regions of the spinal canal are narrowed. Symptoms are a combination of the above with nonspecific physical examination findings.

Disc displacement

Displacement of disc material beyond the limits of the intervertebral disc space may be diffuse (bulging) or focal herniation (protrusion, extrusion and extrusion with sequestration) (Fig. 9). On the axial plane, it may be anterior or posterior. Herniation can be classified as: central, paracentral, foraminal or extraforaminal. The herniation may migrate superiorly or inferiorly (Fig. 10).

Diffuse disc migration is the circumferential displacement of the annulus fibrosus.
Disc bulging. This occurs when intradiscal pressure remains high and the annulus fibrosus is intact and the height of the disc preserved. A rapid increase in intradiscal pressure in the setting of bulging may lead to the development of annular fissures and eventually result in herniation. Bulging is very often seen in asymptomatic individuals (Fig. 11 a, b).
Annular bulging (folding). Degeneration of the nucleous pulposus eventually leads to a marked drop in intradiscal pressure resulting in disc space narrowing or collapse with the vertebral bodies moving closer to one another. Increased vertical loading on the annulus fibrosus causes it to bulge or fold radially outward. Annular bulging (folding) may be symptomatic as severe disc space narrowing also results in decreased size of the intervertebral foraminae, which is further exacerbated by bulging annulus fibrosus (Fig. 11 c). Annular bulging (folding) has never been identified as a separate entity; however, it is an important finding from the clinical point of view, since the surgical treatment aims to restore the intervertebral disc space rather than microdiscectomy.

### Contemporary management of symptomatic lumbar disc herniations [^116nGsZp]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Lumbar disc herniations are common clinical entities that may cause lumbar-related symptoms. The spectrum of treatment options is geared toward a patient's clinical presentation and ranges from nothing to surgical intervention. Many lumbar disc herniations cause no significant symptoms. In studies of asymptomatic individuals who have never experienced lumbar-related symptoms, 30% have been reported to have major abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging. The mainstay of treatment of patients with symptomatic disc herniations is accepted to be nonoperative (as long as there are no acute or progressive neurologic deficits); this includes medications, physical therapy, and potentially lumbar injection. For patients with symptomatic disc herniations who fail to respond appropriately to conservative measures, surgical intervention may be considered. For this population, lumbar discectomy is considered to be a good option.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is characterized by pain or abnormal sensations in the lower back, legs, buttocks, thighs and feet. These sensations are aggravated by walking (neurogenic claudication) and relieved by forward flexion, sitting, or recumbency. LSS can be congenital or more commonly primarily caused by degenerative changes which decrease the total area of the spinal canal, lateral recesses or neural foramina in the lumbar spine, and can compress nerve roots and leading to lumbar or sacral radiculopathy.LSS can present in isolation, with or without associated disk bulging or herniation, and can be associated with degenerative disc disease, facet hypertrophy, spondylolisthesis or scoliosis. Surgical treatment for LSS aims to decompress nerve structures and can be combined with spinal fusion to provide increased stability for the decompressed segment and prevent the recurrence of stenosis. Although surgical decompression seems effective for LSS, surgical decompressions are not without serious risks and complications including post-surgical transfusions, dural tears, and recurrent stenosis requiring reoperation.

### Acute lumbar disk pain: navigating evaluation and treatment choices [^114L4it6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute lumbar disk herniations are the most common cause of sciatica. After excluding emergent causes, such as cauda equina syndrome, epidural abscess, fracture, or malignancy, a six-week trial of conservative management is indicated. Patients should be advised to stay active. If symptoms persist after six weeks, or if there is worsening neurologic function, imaging and invasive procedures may be considered. Most patients with lumbar disk herniations improve over six weeks. Because there is no difference in outcomes between surgical and conservative treatment after two years, patient preference and the severity of the disability from the pain should be considered when choosing treatment modalities. If a disk herniation is identified that correlates with physical findings, surgical diskectomy may improve symptoms more quickly than continued conservative management. Epidural steroid injections can also provide short-term relief.

Case Report

A 62-year-old woman sought medical help in our department for severe low-back pain of 3 years' duration with accompanied numbness of the right leg. Initially, the patient had no obvious cause of low-back pain and did not go to the hospital for treatment. Application of an analgesic plaster achieved poor curative effect. Subsequently, the back pain gradually worsened, and numbness of the right leg developed at the same time and progressed over the course of 3 years. She visited our department for treatment on March 9 t, 2018. She complained that if she sat for more than 2 hours or walked more than 300 m, she experienced low-back pain accompanied by numbness at the front side of the right thigh and lateral calf, and relief of symptoms when she was lying down or bending forward. However, these symptoms seriously affected her daily life and activities.

The patient was subjected to a straight leg–raising test, and the result showed that the right side was positive at 70° and the left side negative. There was no obvious tenderness at the patient's waist. Patient evaluation was performed using the VAS and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores before and after treatment. In the results Before treatment, scores of VAS of 6 points and JOA of 10 points were obtained. Based on these findings, she was recommended to undergo lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assist in diagnosis. In MRI results (Figure 1), lumbar curvature was normal and anterior and posterior margins of multiple vertebral bodies rough and sharp. On the T 2 -weighted image scan, presence of multiple signals of the intervertebral disk, bulging of the intervertebral disk at L2/3, L3/4, and L4/5, protrusion of the intervertebral disk at L5/S1, dural sac compression at corresponding levels, LFH at L2/3 L3/4, and L4/5, and LSS were observed.

### Surgical vs nonoperative treatment for lumbar disk herniation: the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT): a randomized trial [^112owKTa]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Lumbar diskectomy is the most common surgical procedure performed for back and leg symptoms in US patients, but the efficacy of the procedure relative to nonoperative care remains controversial.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of surgery for lumbar intervertebral disk herniation.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, a randomized clinical trial enrolling patients between March 2000 and November 2004 from 13 multidisciplinary spine clinics in 11 US states. Patients were 501 surgical candidates (mean age, 42 years; 42% women) with imaging-confirmed lumbar intervertebral disk herniation and persistent signs and symptoms of radiculopathy for at least 6 weeks.

Interventions

Standard open diskectomy vs nonoperative treatment individualized to the patient.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes were changes from baseline for the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey bodily pain and physical function scales and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons MODEMS version) at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years from enrollment. Secondary outcomes included sciatica severity as measured by the Sciatica Bothersomeness Index, satisfaction with symptoms, self-reported improvement, and employment status.

Results

Adherence to assigned treatment was limited: 50% of patients assigned to surgery received surgery within 3 months of enrollment, while 30% of those assigned to nonoperative treatment received surgery in the same period. Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated substantial improvements for all primary and secondary outcomes in both treatment groups. Between-group differences in improvements were consistently in favor of surgery for all periods but were small and not statistically significant for the primary outcomes.

Conclusions

Patients in both the surgery and the nonoperative treatment groups improved substantially over a 2-year period. Because of the large numbers of patients who crossed over in both directions, conclusions about the superiority or equivalence of the treatments are not warranted based on the intent-to-treat analysis.

Case Presentation

A 64-year-old woman presented with a history of progressive right-sided low back pain over 1 month with slow improvement with over-the-counter analgesics. She noted the pain to be intermittent, radiating down her right lower extremity, without any associated weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence. She was initially evaluated with orthopedic surgery with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine, which showed evidence of degenerative disk changes and bulging disks, with a concerning potential metastatic lesion at L2. She was recommended to establish care with medical oncology and subsequently underwent 18 F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Positron emission tomography /computed tomography revealed oligometastatic disease with a hypermetabolic primary lung nodule and osseous metastatic disease seen encroaching the spinal cord/thecal sac at the level of L2. Pathologic confirmation of her metastatic disease, obtained via percutaneous bone biopsy of the lumbar osseous disease, revealed a lung adenocarcinoma with no actionable mutations.

In realizing and refining this algorithm, we utilized a modified Delphi methodology whereby a panel of 11 experts in this area were engaged to form a consensus around diagnostic components and characteristics, the full spectrum of treatment options as well as the temporal sequence of interventions with the objective of maximizing clinical benefit and efficiency of care. The algorithm development process was administrated and coordinated by one panel member who aggregated panel member responses. The progression was iterative, commencing with the establishment of the clinical definition of lumbar discogenic pain in June, 2023, followed by an in-person gathering of the expert panel in December, 2023 to further refine key clinical examination features and prioritize the range of interventions. Final input was solicited and collated from the panel members at pain society conferences in July and October, 2024.

Our proposed algorithm recommends a systematic rule set of diagnostic and treatment decisions for lumbar discogenic pain based on unambiguous alternatives and clear stopping rules. A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm which progresses logically in a temporal fashion (Figure 1). Actions and events are segregated into physical examination assessments, diagnostic procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Diagnostic and clinical evaluation queries are represented in the algorithm as diamonds, with corresponding symptom severity grading and treatment options shown as rectangles.

Lumbar disc herniations are common causes of lower back pain, neurological dysfunction, and buttock/leg pain. Herniation refers to the displacement of the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc through the annulus fibrosus, thereby causing pressure on the neural elements. The sequalae of lumbar disc herniations range in severity from mild low back and buttock pain to severe cases of inability to ambulate and cauda equina syndrome. Diagnosis is achieved with a thorough history and physical examination along with advanced imaging. Treatment plans are dictated by corresponding patient symptoms and examination findings with their imaging. Most patients can experience relief with nonsurgical measures. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, surgery may be appropriate.

Treatment

Given that many people with intervertebral lumbar disc herniation have a high likelihood of recovery spontaneously without surgical interventions, and the fact that some people are not good surgical candidates, there are many other methods that are used to manage pain from this condition. The areas of treatment can be divided into conservative management and invasive treatments. When starting conservative management, most people begin with a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. Pharmacological interventions include acetaminophen, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, tramadol, corticosteroids, and even short courses of opioids for moderate-to-severe pain, in accordance with the World Health Organization's stepladder approach to managing chronic pain. Pharmacological strategies are mainly aimed at symptom control until pain abates. Non-pharmacological strategies include physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, or therapies such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation. The majority of people improve with conservative treatments exclusively or in conjunction with a multimodal analgesic regimen as mentioned previously.,

If conservative treatment does not provide symptom relief, more invasive treatments are generally considered. Epidural glucocorticoid injections have long been touted as the first step in invasive interventional management of symptomatic intervertebral herniated discs. Whether by a lumbar interlaminar, caudal, or transforaminal approach, epidural injections have been shown to reduce pain scores and disability mainly in the short term (usually at 2 weeks) as well as delay the need for surgical intervention for as long as 13–28 months. Patients may experience relief for a period of time but may require additional repeat injections following pain recurrence. Whereas the efficacy of steroids in epidural injections is controversial, a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials of epidural injections for the treatment of radicular low back pain confirmed that epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids resulted in significant improvement in pain and functionality, as well as decreased opioid consumption. However, epidural injections have not been shown to decrease the need for eventual subsequent surgery in patients with chronic pain secondary to herniated intervertebral disc. Are there any other treatment options for patients who fail both conservative and interventional procedures before undergoing surgical procedures (discectomy, disc arthroplasty, spinal fusion, etc.) in the management of symptomatic lumbar radicular low back pain (Figure 3)?

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^113spKd6]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is renewed interest in the intervertebral disc as a target for treatments aimed at ameliorating lumbar discogenic pain by restoring and preserving the natural structure and function of this component of the vertebral motion segment.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi methodology involving a panel of 11 experts, we developed a simple, understandable clinical algorithm to serve as a foundation for objective decision making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar discogenic pain throughout the entire continuum of care. A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm. Clinical activities in this algorithm were divided into examination procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Corresponding treatment options were designated based on published degenerative disc disease (DDD)-specific clinical practice guidelines and/or meta-analyses.

Results

This algorithm recommends a systematic rule set for discogenic pain diagnostic and treatment options. Initially, the presence of lumbar discogenic pain is confirmed via assessment of a series of clinical signs including axial midline back pain (≥ 4 of 10), pain with flexion, sitting intolerance, positive pain provocation with sustained hip flexion, and absence of motor/sensory/reflex changes. Radiographic severity of DDD is graded by modified Pfirrmann grade (1 to 8). Treatment options are stratified by DDD severity to include conservative management (grades 1 and 2), minimally-invasive intradiscal therapies (grades 3 to 7), and more invasive surgical procedures (grade 8). Recognizing that the management program for patients with lumbar discogenic pain can be highly personalized, the treatment options recommended by this algorithm should be considered general guidance.

Conclusion

The proposed algorithm offers an easy-to-use clinical tool for identifying, evaluating and treating patients with lumbar discogenic pain. The successful implementation of this algorithm involves an important interplay between advanced practice providers, interventional pain physicians and spine surgeons.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — diagnosis and imaging emphasizes core test accuracy concepts and appropriate use of imaging relative to clinical assessment. With tests that have a high sensitivity, a negative test effectively rules out the disease, and with tests that have a high specificity, a positive test effectively rules in the disease; additionally, the performance of a test depends on positive and negative predictive value, which depends directly on the prevalence of disease in the tested population. One of the purposes of a history and physical examination is to increase the prevalence of disease in patients seen for advanced diagnostic imaging/testing or offered surgery, and the review attempted to identify those symptoms or findings which have a high likelihood ratio for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Cross-sectional imaging exams have a low intrinsic specificity with significant pathologic findings in asymptomatic populations, so results of any cross-sectional examination need to be closely correlated with the clinical examination. Direct visualization of intrinsic neurologic processes and neural impingement is noted as important in determining the etiology of radicular symptoms. Although the gold standard in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation is surgery, when assessing the validity of subjective complaints or physical examination findings, use of cross-sectional imaging as a gold standard may be considered an acceptable substitute, though the validity of surgery as a gold standard can be questioned as findings at surgery can be subjective. Additional sufficiently-powered observational studies of history/physical examination findings and diagnostic tests are needed to determine their value in influencing treatment assignment and outcome in patients with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

Spinal stenosis — definition, prevalence, types, mechanisms, and presentation — is defined as narrowing of the spinal canal resulting in symptoms and signs from neural and vascular compression, with varying degrees shown to be present in 27.2% of the elderly population. Congenital or acquired spinal stenosis may be central, foraminal, or both, and disc bulging, protrusion, and extrusion with osteophytes, facet arthritic changes, and hypertrophy of the ligamenta flava can narrow the canal and compress dural sac contents. Foraminal stenosis is largely secondary to degenerative facet disease, potentially with a significant disc component, producing compression or distortion of the exiting nerve root. In central stenosis, symptoms are secondary to direct compression of the cauda equina, altered arterial flow, venous congestion producing increased epidural pressure, and nerve root excitation by local inflammation. Clinical presentation varies from focal radiculopathy to neurogenic claudication with buttocks or leg pain when walking that disappears with sitting or lumbar flexion; foraminal stenosis presents with radicular pain, and combined central and foraminal stenoses generally present with neurogenic claudication as well as radicular pain. In addition to congenital and acquired causes, acute trauma may also produce central and/or foraminal stenoses due to retropulsion of the vertebral body middle column into the canal, with or without a significant epidural hematoma, and distortion of the neural foramina.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 8: lumbar fusion for disc herniation and radiculopathy [^116LwMUt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients suffering from a lumbar herniated disc will typically present with signs and symptoms consistent with radiculopathy. They may also have low-back pain, however, and the source of this pain is less certain, as it may be from the degenerative process that led to the herniation. The surgical alternative of choice remains a lumbar discectomy, but fusions have been performed for both primary and recurrent disc herniations. In the original guidelines, the inclusion of a fusion for routine discectomies was not recommended. This recommendation continues to be supported by more recent evidence. Based on low-level evidence, the incorporation of a lumbar fusion may be considered an option when a herniation is associated with evidence of spinal instability, chronic low-back pain, and/or severe degenerative changes, or if the patient participates in heavy manual labor. For recurrent disc herniations, there is low-level evidence to support the inclusion of lumbar fusion for patients with evidence of instability or chronic low-back pain.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine: recommendations for acquisition and image evaluation from the BACPAC spine imaging working group [^115gx6pQ]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality often used to depict spinal structural abnormalities that may cause low back pain (LBP). With its high soft tissue contrast, MRI allows assessment of multiple structures including intervertebral discs, nerve roots, contents of the central spinal canal, ligaments and facet joints. While MRI is superb at identifying tissue-specific pathology along the spine, the clinical relevance of these findings is often uncertain. Thus, diagnostic MRI for LBP is only recommended in certain patients. The American College of Physicians' guidelines for diagnostic imaging suggest immediate imaging when there are major risks (such as suspicion of cancer, spinal infection, cauda equina syndrome, or presence of severe neurological deficits), but advise deferral of imaging pending a trial of treatment in cases where there are weaker risk factors. Notably, only in a minority of patients can LBP be attributed to a specific pathology (e.g. vertebral fracture or disc herniation with nerve compression), while the great majority of patients are assigned a diagnosis of non-specific LBP (i.e. pain for which the distinct patho-anatomical basis cannot be determined).

Some lumbar MRI findings that are common in patients with LBP are also common in asymptomatic subjects, which makes it difficult to define a causal relationship in individual patients and has led to questions about the diagnostic value of such findings. However, some lumbar MRI findings are more prevalent in patients with LBP than in asymptomatic subjects. Those include bone marrow (BM) lesions located at the vertebral endplates, disc bulges and herniation, and spondylolysis. Such lumbar MRI findings could potentially function as biomarkers that can distinguish patients whose pain is due to a primary nociceptive process in the spine from patients with central modulating mechanisms that can be influenced by a number of psychosocial factors as well as central sensitization (i.e. increased responsiveness of nociceptors to either normal or sub-threshold afferent input, resulting in amplified pain).

Percutaneous disc decompression and surgical context — lumbar disc prolapse, protrusion, and extrusion account for less than 5% of all low back problems yet are the most common causes of nerve root pain and surgical interventions, and most patients are expected to recover with conservative management while the typical rationale for traditional surgery is an effort to provide more rapid relief of pain and disability. The primary rationale for surgery in disc prolapse with radicular pain is to relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material. The primary modality remains open discectomy or microdiscectomy, with alternative techniques including automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy (APLD), percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression, mechanical disc decompression with Dekompresor®, and nucleoplasty. Herniated discs are of 2 basic types — contained and non-contained — with contained discs defined by displaced material held within the outer annulus, and non-contained discs having localized displacement beyond the intervertebral space and a breach in the outer annulus. Mechanical disc decompression has the ability to avoid many of the major complications related to FBSS, yet despite multiple reviews there appears to be a significant paucity of high quality literature even though APLD and percutaneous lumbar laser discectomy were introduced several decades ago.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^117WVCEo]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP) and radiating leg pain (sciatica). The prevalence of sciatica vary from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in specific working populations. Most cases of sciatica caused by acute LDH show favorable outcomes and resolve within 2 weeks to 3 months. However, in some cases, LDH becomes a chronic condition of lifelong experience with LBP.

Conservative treatment should be the first-line therapy for sciatica; nonetheless, the best method of conservative treatment remains unclear, with guidelines differing in their recommendations. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that non-pharmacological treatments, such as superficial heat treatment, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation, should be selected for patients with LBP with or without sciatica. Among these various non-pharmacological treatments, there are many differences between guidelines for acupuncture and manual therapy. Korea guidelinesrecommend acupuncture and spinal manual therapy with high grade level of evidence. It suggested that acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and spinal manual therapy are helpful in improving pain and overall symptoms in patients with LDH. However, the United Kingdom (UK) guidelinesrecommend manual therapy only alongside an exercise program and against acupuncture. The Danish guidelinesalso state that acupuncture has low-quality evidence.

On the other hand, harms and serious adverse events for these non-pharmacological therapies have not been reported. In an RCT study on manual therapy for the neck, adverse events related to the musculoskeletal system and nervous system were observed in 5 patients (9.3%) in the intervention group, but all were mild or moderate side effects. In a systemic review of acupuncture treatment for a LDH patient, adverse events were reported in two trials, one reported no adverse events, and one reported local haematoma.

The recommendations for invasive treatment also vary widely depending on guidelines. Some recent guidelines, do not recommend epidural injections or facet joint injections, whereas the UK guidelinesrecommend epidural injections for patients with severe sciatica. The United States (US) guidelinesalso strongly recommend epidural injections for the management of sciatica or LDH. It suggested that transforaminal epidural steroid injections provide short-term (2–4 weeks) pain relief in LDH patients. Epidural injection is associated with serious adverse events such as plegia, spinal cord injury, dural hemorrhage, paralysis, stroke, and dural punctures, although the incidence rate is low.

In an effort to address this uncertainty in care, this article describes the management paradigm known as Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy and its usefulness in decision-making for patients with lumbar radiculopathies, and reviews the relevant literature.

Intervertebral disc changes

Furthermore, location and morphology of disc herniation is classified according to shape characteristics, including bulge, protrusion, and extrusion. Specifically, bulge is defined as annular tissue that projects beyond the margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies, affecting more than 90° of circumference. A disc protrusion is a focal herniation of disc material beyond the margins of the adjacent vertebral bodies (over less than 90° of circumference and with a base that is wider than the dome). In addition, a disc extrusion is a focal herniation of disc nuclear material through an annular defect (remaining in continuity with the disc and with a base narrower than the dome). Additionally, the absence or presence of an annular fissure and its location is taken into consideration, which is commonly characterized by a zone of high signal on T2-weighted images at the lateral edges of the annulus (Table 5). Example cases for degenerative disc disease are provided by Figures 3 and 4.

### Transdural approach for calcified central disc herniations of the upper lumbar spine. technical note [^116A8MFp]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Disc herniations of the upper lumbar spine (L1–2 and L2–3) have a frequency of 1 to 2% of all disc herniations. During posterior discectomy after laminectomy, significant manipulation of the exiting nerve root is unavoidable because of the narrow lamina and the difficulty in mobilizing the nerve root. The authors adopted a transdural approach in patients with calcified central disc herniation at the L1–2 level to reduce the risk of nerve root injury. Four patients suffering from radiating pain together with back pain were treated using the transdural approach. Preoperative neuroimaging studies revealed severe central disc herniation with calcification at the L1–2 level. After laminectomy or laminotomy, the incised dura mater was tacked, and the cauda equina rootlets were gently retracted. An intentional durotomy was performed over its maximal bulging of the ventral dura. After meticulous dissection of dense adhesions between the disc herniation and the dural sac, adequate decompression with removal of calcified disc fragments and osteophytes was accomplished. Clinical symptoms improved in all patients. Postoperative permanent cerebrospinal fluid leakage and pseudomeningocele were not observed, and no patient had a progressive lumbar deformity at an average follow-up of 53 months. Transient mild motor weakness and sensory change were observed in two patients postoperatively; however, these symptoms resolved completely within 1 week. The posterior transdural approach offers an alternative in central calcified upper lumbar disc herniation when root retraction is dangerous.

### Surgical treatment and outcomes of lumbar radiculopathy [^113DavSM]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lumbar disk herniation is a significant cause of lumbar radiculopathy and results in billions of dollars in health care expenditure. Herniated lumbar disks cause mechanical and chemical irritation of the nerve roots leading to complaints of sciatica. Surgeons have several surgical options when approaching herniated disks, including various microsurgical procedures. The 3 most prominent studies to date on surgical and nonsurgical management of herniated disks agree on the efficacy of surgery over medical management in the short term but have some discrepancies when looking at long-term results. Cauda equina syndrome is a variation of lumbar disk herniation in which patients experience a combination of saddle anesthesia, abnormal lower extremity reflexes, and neurogenic bowel or bladder symptoms.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^111jubsL]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Peul et al prospective comparison — early surgery versus prolonged conservative care showed no significant overall disability difference at 52 weeks (p = 0.13) but faster leg-pain relief (p < 0.001) and faster perceived recovery with early surgery (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.72 to 2.22; p < 0.001); the one-year probability of perceived recovery was 95% in both groups. High crossover (11% early surgery, 39% conservative) led to Level III classification; early surgery (6–12 weeks) provides faster recovery and better pain relief, with no long-term outcome differences.

### Observer variation in MRI evaluation of patients suspected of lumbar disk herniation [^115bV9uC]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to assess observer variation in MRI evaluation in patients suspected of lumbar disk herniation.

Subjects and Methods

Two experienced neuroradiologists independently evaluated 59 consecutive patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. Per patient, three levels (L3-L4 through L5-S1) and the accompanying roots were evaluated on both sides. For each segment, the presence of a bulging disk or a herniation and compression of the root was reported. Images were interpreted twice: once before and once after disclosure of clinical information. Interobserver agreement was expressed as unweighted kappa values.

Results

Without clinical information, interobserver agreement for the presence of herniation or bulging disk was moderate (full agreement, 84%; kappa = 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–0.72). Of a total of 352 segments evaluated, there was disagreement on 58 segments (17%): bulging disk versus no defect in 26 (7.4%), bulging disk versus herniation in five (1.4%), and hernia versus no defect in 27 (7.7%). With clinical information, twice as many bulging disks were reported but no new herniations were detected. Agreement slightly decreased, but not significantly (full agreement, 77%; kappa = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49–0.69; p = 0.12).

Conclusion

On average, more than 50% of interobserver variation in MRI evaluation of patients with lumbosacral radicular pain is caused by disagreement on bulging disks. Knowledge of clinical information does not influence the detection of herniations but lowers the threshold for reporting bulging disks.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^114Ry7X4]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The recent issuance of specific International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for lumbosacral discogenic pain associated with degenerative disc disease by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) underscores the importance of developing a clinical algorithm to enhance our ability to precisely diagnose and effectively treat patients suffering from discogenic low back pain. Recognition of discogenic pain as a unique source of back pain represents the culmination of decades of extensive basic science and clinical research on the degeneration of the intervertebral disc and its role in precipitating widespread degenerative changes across the entire spinal motion segment.

As our understanding of the sources and anatomical structures that contribute to chronic low back pain has evolved, estimates of the prevalence of patients suffering from pain emanating principally from the anterior column of the spine has expanded to include as many as 70% of the cases of low back pain. Indeed, anterior column pain has been differentiated further to involve not only the intervertebral disc but additionally the vertebral endplates. Due to their anatomical intimacy, it is recognized that there exists substantial pathoetiological interdependence of these structures in pain generation.

Using an approach that integrates expertise in musculoskeletal imaging, interventional pain management, and spine surgery, we developed a pragmatic discogenic pain clinical algorithm to improve diagnostic efficiency and maximize clinical benefit. Successful implementation of this algorithm is optimized by utilizing a team approach to back pain management that can effectively address and personalize the myriad diagnostic and treatment options available to the patient throughout their continuum of care.

SPINAL FUNCTIONAL UNITS
DISCO-SOMATIC UNITS. (α) DISC ALTERATIONS: it is advisable to report any: (i) pathological changes of SI and height of intervertebral disc — indicating T2 signal hypointensity, due to dehydration-; any intradiscal gas accumulation (so called vacuum phenomenon, resulting in fluid or T2 hyperintense signal within the disk), or/and annulus fibrous fissures. (ii) morphological changes i.e. the displacement of disc material beyond the space of intervertebral disc-delimited cranially and caudally by vertebral bodies and at periphery by apophysis — is defined as: (x) diffuse displacement-bulging (Fig. 1 a), when the disc material extends beyond confines of vertebral endplates for more than 25% or more than 90° of the circumference on the axial plane (> 25%/90°). It may have a symmetrical or asymmetrical extension. Fig. 1 a Bulging disc. Wide bulging disc with foraminal extension, more evident on the right. A bulging disc is considered when the extension is more than 25% (> 90°) of the whole disc circumference. Yellow lines show the division in quarters of the disc circumference, red ones the contour of the displaced disc and the angle. b Example of disc protrusion. A disc protrusion (in red, the contour of the displaced disc and the angle) is considered when the displacement is less than 25% (< 90°) of the whole disc circumference (in yellow lines the subdivision in quarters of the disc) and the distance between the borders of the displacement (blue line) is less than the distance between the edges of the base of the displacement at the disc space of origin (green line). c Example of disc herniation (Extrusion). A herniated disc is considered when the displacement (in red, the contour and the angle) is less than 25% (< 90°) of the whole disc circumference (in yellow lines the subdivision in quarters of the disc) and the distance between the borders of the displacement (blue line) is greater than the distance between the edges of the base of the displacement at the disc space of origin (green line) (xx) focal displacement, when it is localized for less than 25% or less than of 90° of the circumference on the axial plane (< 25%/90°). Based on their morphological appearance, it can be divided into these subtypes: disc protrusion and disc herniation. Disc protrusion (Fig. 1 b): when the distance between the margins of the disc material dislocated outside the original discal space is less or equal than the distance between the edges of the base of the displaced disc material in all the planes of acquisition (where the base is measured at the disc space origin). Disc herniation (disc extrusion) (Fig. 1 c): when, in at least one plane, the distance between the margins of the disc material dislocated outside the original discal space is greater than the distance between the edges of the base of the displaced disc material at the disc space origin.

### Radiographic evaluation of indirect decompression of mini-open anterior retroperitoneal lumbar interbody fusion: oblique lateral interbody fusion for degenerated lumbar spondylolisthesis [^115Zr3Yi]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Extreme lateral interbody fusion provides minimally invasive treatment of spinal deformity, but complications including nerve and psoas muscle injury have been noted. To avoid nerve injury, mini-open anterior retroperitoneal lumbar interbody fusion methods using an approach between the aorta and psoas, such as oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) have been applied. OLIF with percutaneous pedicle screws without posterior decompression can indirectly decompress the spinal canal in lumbar degenerated spondylolisthesis. In the current study, we examined the radiographic and clinical efficacy of OLIF for lumbar degenerated spondylolisthesis.

Methods

We assessed 20 patients with lumbar degenerated spondylolisthesis who underwent OLIF and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation without posterior laminectomy. MR and CT images and clinical symptoms were evaluated before and 6 months after surgery. Cross sections of the spinal canal were evaluated with MRI, and disk height, cross-sectional areas of intervertebral foramina, and degree of upper vertebral slip were evaluated with CT. Clinical symptoms including low back pain, leg pain, and lower extremity numbness were evaluated using a visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index before and 6 months after surgery.

Results

After surgery, significant increases in axial and sagittal spinal canal diameter (12 and 32%), spinal canal area (19%), disk height (61%), and intervertebral foramen areas (21% on the right side, 39% on the left), and significant decrease of upper vertebral slip (-9%) were found (P < 0.05). Low back pain, leg pain, and lower extremity numbness were significantly reduced compared with before surgery (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Significant improvements in disk height and spinal canal area were found after surgery. Bulging of disks was reduced through correction, and stretching the yellow ligament may have decompressed the spinal canal. Lumbar anterolateral fusion without laminectomy may be useful for lumbar spondylolisthesis with back and leg symptoms.

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^112qaGEN]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the application of clinical methodology and decision-making thoroughly tested by duly controlled peer-reviewed studies. With the exponentially increasing number of publications, EBM aims to shift the traditional paradigm of making decisions based purely on the judgment of the physician or the experience of senior doctors to the use of results obtained from systematic and unbiased research in a patient-centered diagnosis and treatment model with the highest available evidence. The definition of EBM has evolved, but the most widely accepted definition was from Sackett et al. in 1996 and revised in 2000. In summary, it stated that clinicians should use the best, unbiased, clinically sound, and up-to-date data available on a patient basis in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery are the pioneers of spine surgery throughout the world. Neurosurgeons have utilized EBM and clinical guidelines to make sound decisions for the last three decades. However, the increasing number of guidelines have questioned the validity of these recommendations as they may stray away from the rigorous process outlined by The Institute of Medicine (IOM). Orthopedic Surgery also recognized the importance of EBM in the early 2000s, and journal sections reserved for "Evidence-Based Orthopedics" emerged. The classical paradigm of trying non-operative treatment first and operative treatment, if the first step fails, has shifted towards surgical treatment vs. other treatment options.

Evidence-Based Spine Surgery (EBSS) has also emerged parallel to the development of EBM. The North American Spine Society (NASS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) frequently publish guidelines with evidence-based suggestions to provide the highest evidence-based decisions in spinal pathologies. For example, EBSS supported by randomized controlled trials has shown discectomy for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation (LDH), decompression of spinal stenosis, and decompression with fusion of degenerative spondylolisthesis offer clinical benefit in relieving lower back and radicular pain compared to conservative treatment. However, pursuing EBSS as the sole deciding factor for diagnosing and treating spinal pathologies is unrealistic. Most of the publications on spine surgery are case-controlled retrospective cohorts or case series. Thus, the number of high-quality evidence parallel to spine surgery development is lacking. Considering the value of EBM and the probability of further implementation into decision-making, this study sheds light on the reception and application of EBM by spinal surgeons and the use of evidence-based modalities in their clinical practice.

### Patient information: lumbar spinal stenosis… [^115QsBLy]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Walter KL, O'Toole JE. Lumbar Spinal Stenosis. JAMA. 2022; 328:

310. doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.6137 Lumbar spinal stenosis involves narrowing of the spinal canal, which extends through the center of the spinal vertebrae, in the lower back area. Lumbar spinal stenosis may cause pressure on the nerve roots that branch out from the spinal cord, which can result in pain, tingling, numbness, muscle fatigue, and, if severe, weakness in the legs. Lumbar spinal stenosis typically results from degenerative changes in the spine associated with aging, including formation of bony spurs, thickening of spinal ligaments, and degeneration of the disks between the vertebrae. These processes can result in loss of space between the vertebral bones and bulging of the disk into the spinal canal. Other spinal conditions may worsen lumbar spinal stenosis, such as displacement of a vertebra over an adjacent vertebra and degenerative curvature of the spine.

Common symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis are pain and achiness extending from the lower back to the buttocks and often to one or both legs. Sometimes the pain is accompanied by numbness or tingling in the lower legs or feet. Pain due to lumbar spinal stenosis typically increases with standing or walking and is relieved with sitting or leaning forward. Due to gradual worsening of pain over time, some patients may develop severe limitations in activity. Initial treatment of spinal stenosis typically includes activity modification with decreased periods of standing or walking, oral medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, if tolerated, and physical therapy. Epidural steroid injections into the affected area of the back may produce modest pain relief, but the benefit generally lasts less than 3 weeks, and there is a small risk of serious side effects such as infection or bleeding.

Surgical procedures can be performed for lumbar spinal stenosis to remove some of the bone, ligament, or disk tissue that is pressing on lumbar nerve roots. Surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis typically reduces pain and improves overall function in carefully selected patients whose symptoms fail to improve with nonsurgical treatment. Any patient with spinal stenosis who develops loss of bowel or bladder function or has rapidly progressive leg weakness should undergo urgent evaluation for surgery.

### Avoid lumbar spine imaging in the emergency department… [^112AXPmo]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Low back pain without trauma is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department. Most of the time, such pain is caused by conditions such as a muscle strain or a bulging disc that cannot be identified on an X-ray or CT scan. When a patient has symptoms or physical findings of a serious or progressive neurological condition, or is suspected of having a serious underlying condition such as cancer or a spinal infection, imaging may be appropriate and may include plain X-rays or advanced imaging. Diagnostic imaging does not accurately identify the cause of most low back pain and does not improve the time to recovery. The vast majority of cases of back pain in the emergency department are related to muscle strain or inflammation. As a result, routine imaging of the low back should be avoided in order to reduce ionizing radiation exposure and unnecessary cost.
