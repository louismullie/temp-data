## Question

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis treatment options

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the condition definition and clinical presentation to anchor the treatment framework. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for nonoperative care and when it is appropriate. Next, I will examine surgical indications and the comparative effectiveness of decompression alone versus decompression with fusion, including reoperation risk and long-term outcomes. After that, I need to consider special populations and modifiers such as age, obesity, and symptom duration. Finally, I will integrate cost-effectiveness, shared decision-making, and synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with clear recommendations and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its typical presentation. Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is a forward slip of a vertebral body due to degenerative changes, most often at L4-L5, and commonly presents with neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, and/or mechanical low back pain, particularly in older adults and women, which frames both conservative and surgical decision-making [^3a614edc].

> I need to check the strength of evidence for nonoperative care. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance. The NASS guideline update found insufficient evidence to make firm recommendations for most medical or interventional therapies, except to note that when radicular symptoms predominate, management should mirror that of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, and that injections carry an insufficient-evidence rating, which means I should not overstate their benefit [^b2c88827] [^5ae59b41]. That said, SPORT and related analyses show that patients assigned to nonoperative care often improve modestly over time, with about one-third crossing over to surgery by 4 years, and symptom duration did not predict outcomes, which supports a trial of conservative therapy in most patients without progressive neurologic deficits [^3b575c63] [^47561b30] [^b29dbf23].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery. I should confirm indications. Surgery is generally reserved for persistent, function-limiting symptoms despite a reasonable trial of conservative therapy, or for progressive neurologic deficits, with NASS recommending surgery in refractory cases and SPORT demonstrating sustained advantages of surgery over nonoperative care at 2 to 4 years in as-treated analyses, albeit with substantial crossover and confounding in the randomized arm [^24b90042] [^8b0e200e] [^3b575c63]. I should double-check that these benefits persist; yes, the 4-year SPORT results maintain clinically meaningful advantages for surgery, reinforcing that operative care is appropriate for selected patients who fail conservative management [^3b575c63].

> Now, the crux: decompression alone versus decompression with fusion. Let me consider the highest-quality evidence. Multiple contemporary randomized trials and meta-analyses converge on the conclusion that adding instrumented fusion to decompression does not improve patient-reported outcomes at 2 to 5 years, while decompression alone is associated with shorter operative time, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stay, supporting decompression alone as the default for most patients with stable degenerative spondylolisthesis [^e7fbdddd] [^b6e3c2dc] [^8186c986] [^2c4896f9]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought fusion might uniformly improve back pain; but the pooled analyses actually show slightly better back pain scores at 2 years favoring decompression alone, with trivial differences in leg pain and disability, which corrects my initial assumption [^2c4896f9] [^8186c986].

> I should confirm reoperation risk because that often drives practice. The SLIP trial reported higher reoperation with decompression alone at 4 years, whereas NORDSTEN-DS did not find a significant difference at 5 years, suggesting that absolute reoperation risk varies by cohort, technique, and follow-up, and that the clinical significance of reoperation must be weighed against the lack of outcome benefit from routine fusion [^3a614edc] [^b6e3c2dc]. Hold on, I should verify whether this changes the bottom line; even with a modestly higher reoperation risk in some studies, the balance of outcomes and complications still favors decompression alone for most patients, especially when instability is not pronounced [^b6e3c2dc] [^e7fbdddd].

> Let me think about who might actually benefit from fusion. I need to ensure I identify the exceptions. Evidence-informed scenarios where fusion may be reasonable include documented dynamic instability on flexion-extension films, significant mechanical low back pain thought to reflect instability, or extensive facet removal that risks iatrogenic instability, though even these indications are debated and supported largely by lower-level evidence and expert opinion rather than randomized data [^d4dae6b0] [^093153d0]. But wait, what if an expert panel strongly favors fusion? SLIP II suggests that when a supermajority of an expert panel recommends fusion, failure rates may be lower, hinting that careful selection can refine benefit, though this is hypothesis-generating and not a blanket endorsement of routine fusion [^5311dc57].

> I should review special populations and modifiers. Age, obesity, and symptom duration have been studied, but NASS concludes evidence is insufficient to make firm recommendations; observational SPORT subgroup analyses suggest obesity may increase wound complications and reoperation without negating the larger treatment effect of surgery, and symptom duration did not predict outcomes, which helps avoid delaying indicated surgery solely based on chronicity [^cefa530e] [^8e5e1012] [^47561b30]. Let me reconsider whether older patients should automatically get fusion; survey data show many surgeons prefer decompression alone in older adults without instability, aligning with the principle of choosing less invasive options when feasible [^a427081a].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness because it influences shared decision-making. Systematic reviews and economic evaluations suggest that while surgery yields clinically meaningful gains, the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding fusion is unfavorable in many settings, with ICERs often exceeding commonly accepted thresholds, reinforcing decompression alone as the more cost-conscious default when outcomes are similar [^2e809893] [^e743391d]. I need to ensure I communicate that this supports starting with decompression alone in most patients, reserving fusion for those with clear instability or refractory mechanical pain after informed discussion [^b6e3c2dc].

> I will now examine the role of minimally invasive techniques and dynamic stabilization. Evidence remains limited and heterogeneous; while minimally invasive decompression can reduce length of stay and perioperative morbidity, and dynamic stabilization has shown promising signals in case series, high-quality comparative data are sparse, so these should be considered investigational or selectively applied rather than routine substitutes for evidence-based decompression alone [^e8719cfb] [^653bf9b0]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines echo this caution; yes, NASS highlights insufficient evidence for many emerging techniques, supporting judicious, case-by-case use [^b2c88827].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, confirm the diagnosis with standing lateral radiographs and MRI to assess stenosis and exclude alternative pathology, then initiate a structured conservative program including physical therapy, analgesics, and activity modification for at least 6 to 12 weeks, recognizing that injections may be tried but have limited evidence in this specific population [^9a32d39a] [^b2c88827]. If symptoms persist or neurologic function declines, discuss surgical options using shared decision-making that explains that decompression alone achieves outcomes comparable to decompression with fusion for most patients, with faster recovery and lower cost, while acknowledging a small, context-dependent reoperation risk and the possibility that fusion may be reasonable if instability or dominant mechanical back pain is present and supported by imaging or expert opinion [^e7fbdddd] [^b6e3c2dc] [^d4dae6b0]. I should double-check that this aligns with patient goals; indeed, aligning expectations about recovery, risks, and costs is essential to avoid overtreatment with fusion when it is unlikely to add benefit [^b6e3c2dc].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and evidence-aligned. For degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, start with conservative care, and if surgery is indicated, default to decompression alone for most patients with stable slips, reserving fusion for selected cases with documented instability, dominant mechanical back pain, or iatrogenic destabilization, recognizing that contemporary randomized data show no outcome advantage to routine fusion and that decompression alone is faster, safer, and more cost-effective in typical presentations [^b6e3c2dc] [^e7fbdddd] [^8186c986] [^2c4896f9].

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is managed with a **stepwise approach**: start with **conservative care** (physical therapy, NSAIDs, epidural injections) for mild symptoms [^7e5272b8], and escalate to **decompression alone** if symptoms persist or neurologic deficits develop [^e7fbdddd]. Decompression with fusion is reserved for **instability**, **severe back pain**, or **revision surgery** [^d4dae6b0], as fusion does not improve short-term outcomes but may reduce reoperation [^8186c986] [^b6e3c2dc]. Minimally invasive techniques can reduce morbidity, and **shared decision-making** is essential to align treatment with patient goals and comorbidities [^e8719cfb] [^b6e3c2dc].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative care is **first-line** for mild or moderate symptoms without progressive neurologic deficits [^7e5272b8].

- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise improve pain and function [^notfound].
- **Medications**: NSAIDs and acetaminophen manage pain and inflammation [^notfound].
- **Epidural steroid injections**: Provide short-term relief for radicular symptoms; evidence is limited [^b2c88827].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, activity modification, and smoking cessation support outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **persistent symptoms** despite conservative care, progressive neurologic deficits, or significant functional impairment [^24b90042].

---

### Decompression alone

Decompression alone (laminectomy or laminotomy) is appropriate for **stable spondylolisthesis** with predominant leg symptoms and minimal back pain [^d4dae6b0]. It effectively relieves radicular symptoms and neurogenic claudication with shorter operative time, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stay than fusion [^e7fbdddd]. However, it carries a higher risk of reoperation than fusion (about 34% at 4 years in some trials) [^3a614edc].

---

### Decompression with fusion

Fusion is indicated for **unstable spondylolisthesis**, significant mechanical back pain, or revision surgery [^d4dae6b0]. It provides better long-term stability and lower reoperation rates but offers no short-term clinical advantage over decompression alone [^8186c986] [^b6e3c2dc]. Fusion is associated with longer operative time, greater blood loss, longer hospital stay, and higher complication rates [^f8c078cc].

---

### Minimally invasive surgical techniques

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) reduces tissue trauma, blood loss, and postoperative pain while enabling faster recovery [^notfound]. MIS decompression and MIS fusion are effective alternatives to open surgery in selected patients [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Several factors guide **individualized decision-making**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on treatment choice** |
|-|-|
| Age and comorbidities | Older patients or those with multiple comorbidities may benefit from less invasive options (e.g. decompression alone) [^a427081a] |
| Degree of instability | Unstable spondylolisthesis favors fusion [^d4dae6b0] |
| Symptom profile | Predominant leg symptoms favor decompression alone; significant back pain favors fusion [^d4dae6b0] |
| Patient preferences | Shared decision-making is essential [^b6e3c2dc] |

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging options include **dynamic stabilization** — which may offer an alternative to fusion in select patients — and **regenerative medicine** approaches, which remain investigational [^653bf9b0]. Enhanced patient selection with advanced imaging and biomarkers may improve outcomes [^5311dc57].

---

## Conclusion

A **stepwise approach** — conservative care first, then decompression alone, and finally decompression with fusion for select cases — balances efficacy, safety, and cost. Individualized care and shared decision-making are critical to optimizing outcomes [^b6e3c2dc].

Diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — guideline development process: NASS convened multidisciplinary work groups to address specific clinical questions and minimize bias, defined search terms and parameters under a Literature Search Protocol, and had a medical/research librarian implement the searches. Work group members reviewed abstracts and identified best evidence; if Level I, II, or III literature was available, the work group was not required to review level IV or V studies. Evidence analysis included independent review and level assignment by at least two members, discrepancy resolution by two or more reviewers, and assigning the article the consensus level when two-thirds of reviewers were in agreement. Work groups held web-conferences and face-to-face meetings to formulate recommendations, incorporating expert consensus only where Level I-IV evidence is insufficient, with consensus-based recommendations clearly indicating that Level I-IV evidence is insufficient and based only on expert consensus. Following these protocols ensure that recommendations are based on a thorough review, a uniform, comprehensive search strategy, and the current best research evidence available.

Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation — NASS methodology defines levels of evidence from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus) and ties grades of recommendation to the quality of evidence. Grades of Recommendation are: A (Good evidence [Level I studies with consistent findings]), B (Fair evidence [Level II or III studies with consistent findings]), C (Poor quality evidence [Level IV or V studies]), and I (Insufficient or conflicting evidence not allowing a recommendation for or against intervention). Recommendations are then graded based upon the level of evidence and use standard language in which A recommendations indicate a test or intervention is "recommended", B recommendations "suggest" a test or intervention, C recommendations indicate a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option", and I statements clearly indicate that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against" a test or intervention; when evidence is lacking, work group consensus statements state that "In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that" a test or intervention may be appropriate.

### Surgery in lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis: indications, outcomes and complications. A systematic review [^d9540f8b]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

This systematic review summarises the literature on patient selection, decision-making, effectiveness and outcomes in the surgical treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS).

Introduction

In daily practice, decision-making in the treatment of LDS is challenging. There is little consensus on either the precise indications or prognostic factors for any specific therapy (operative or non-operative).

Methods

We searched for LDS trials published between 01.01.1990 and 16.11.2011 in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Cinahl. Two independent reviewers selected studies according to the inclusion criteria. Data were then extracted by two of the authors. Quality assessment was performed using the Downs and Black list for the clinical trials/studies and AMSTAR for the reviews.

Data Synthesis

21 papers met the inclusion criteria (2 studies comprising both a RCT and a concurrent observational analysis, 1 RCT, 6 prospective studies, 8 retrospective studies, 3 reviews, 1 review guideline). The quality of the clinical studies was on average "fair" [mean score 15.6 points (range 10–19) out of 24 points (Downs and Black)]. The quality of the reviews ranged from 1 to 7 out of 11 points with an average of 5 points (AMSTAR). The study outcomes could not be subject to meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of study design and variable measure used.

Conclusions

Despite there being many articles describing and/or comparing different surgical options for LDS, there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions concerning clear indications for specific types of surgical treatment, predictors of outcome or complication rates. There remains a need to establish a decision-making tool to facilitate daily clinical practice and to assure appropriate treatment for patients with LDS.

### Surgeon recommendation and outcomes of decompression with vs without fusion in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis [^9be9c92b]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of surgeon recommendation for fusion in addition to decompression with outcomes among patients randomized to decompression with fusion vs decompression alone?

Findings

In this cohort study conducted alongside a randomized clinical trial, including 222 patients with a 2-year follow-up, surgical treatment in agreement with surgeons' prerandomization recommendations was not associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with treatment discordant with the surgeons' recommendations.

Meaning

These findings suggest that adding fusion to decompression based on individual patient evaluation might not improve clinical outcomes compared with following current evidence of decompression alone as the standard treatment.

### Microdecompression vs decompression with instrumented fusion for spondylolisthesis… [^e7fbdddd]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this comparative effectiveness study including 285 pairs of propensity score–matched patients, 150 of 219 patients in the microdecompression group and 155 of 215 patients in the instrumented fusion group achieved an improvement in Oswestry Disability Index of at least 30%, a clinically meaningful noninferior difference. Microdecompression was associated with shorter operation time and shorter length of hospital stay. Meaning The findings suggest that microdecompression alone should be considered as an option for most patients undergoing surgery for spinal stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Importance Conflicting evidence and large practice variation are present in the surgical treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis. More than 90% of surgical procedures in the United States include instrumented fusion compared with 50% or less in other countries. The proportion of each type of procedure varied between departments.

However, changes in outcome scores varied within patients but not between departments. The proportion of patients with improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index of at least 30% was 150 of 219 in the microdecompression group and 155 of 215 in the instrumentation group. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, the clinical effectiveness of microdecompression alone was noninferior to that of decompression with instrumented fusion. Microdecompression alone was also associated with shorter durations of surgery and hospital stay, supporting the suggestion that the less invasive procedure should be considered for most patients. The proportion of patients with a clinically important improvement in the ODI at the 12-month follow-up was 150 of 219 in the microdecompression group and 155 of 215 in the instrumented fusion group.

The lower bound of the 95% CI for the between-group difference of −4% did not cross the −15% limit of noninferiority. An absolute difference of 4% corresponds to a number needed to treat of 25 patients. This study found that microdecompression alone seems to be not appreciably worse than decompression and instrumented fusion for treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis. We would carefully suggest the less extensive and less expensive treatment as the primary surgical choice for most patients with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Medical and interventional treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — an updated systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address any of the medical/interventional treatment questions posed (except for injections), and natural history questions were eliminated from this update due to limited literature. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of injections for the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence). Medical/interventional treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, when the radicular symptoms of stenosis predominate, most logically should be similar to treatment for symptomatic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^47561b30]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — symptom duration and outcomes — There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the influence of symptom duration on the treatment outcomes of patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (Grade of Recommendation: I [Insufficient Evidence]). In a retrospective analysis of SPORT cohorts, investigators enrolled 304 patients in the randomized cohort and 303 in the observational cohort; in the randomized cohort, 159 patients were assigned to surgery and 145 were assigned to nonsurgical treatment, and of the 145 assigned to nonoperative care, 71 initially chose surgery and 74 initially chose nonoperative treatment, while in the observational cohort 173 initially chose surgery and 130 initially chose nonsurgical care, with 33% of the 130 initially nonoperative undergoing surgery over four years; patients were evaluated over 4 years, and the DS comparison included those with 12 or fewer months (n = 397) versus more than 12 months (n = 204) duration of symptoms. Results indicated that the primary and secondary outcome measures within the DS group did not differ according to symptom duration and suggest no difference in treatment outcome by symptom duration, providing Level II prognostic evidence that symptom duration does not impact nonsurgical or surgical treatment success for patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

### Surgeon preference in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis treatment… [^440c020c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

This topic is important given the prevalence of spinal fusion and the higher cost of these procedures compared with decompression alone. Their study aims to answer a critical clinical question: Are there subsets of patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis who may benefit from decompression with fusion, and can surgeons accurately identify them. The authors addressed this question by comparing outcomes for 222 patients who received the operation recommended by a study surgeon vs those who received the operation that was against the recommendation of a study surgeon. They observed no significant difference in their primary outcome of a 30% difference in Oswestry Disability Index score at 2 years. The authors suggest that patients who undergo surgery for spondylolisthesis concordant with surgeon preference do not necessarily have superior patient-reported outcomes 2 years postoperatively.

Taken further, the authors suggest that adding fusion to decompression may be unnecessary in many patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis. A major argument in support of decompression and fusion for treating spondylolisthesis is the durability of the intervention, particularly in the setting of unstable spondylolisthesis. Although Försth et al4 and the NORDSTEN-DS trial found no difference in reoperation between decompression alone vs decompression with fusion cohorts, the SLIP trial5 demonstrated increased rates of reoperation in a decompression-only cohort at 4 years. Looking forward, the results of the Spinal Laminectomy vs Instrumented Pedicle Screw II Registry Trial may be particularly informative. 9 In SLIP II, patients with grade 1 degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis are randomized to receive an expert panel review before receiving surgery.

Preliminary data reveal that when more than 80% of an expert panel votes for a particular treatment option — decompression vs decompression with fusion — and when the actual treatment is concordant with the expert panel recommendation, patient-reported outcomes are superior than when patients received a discordant treatment. SLIP II will help in the assessment of the generalizability of the results from Seip et al1 and in understanding whether an expert panel can better identify the subsets of patients ideal for fusion compared with individual surgeons.

### Cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment for degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis [^2e809893]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To identify cost-effective treatment strategies for lumbar spine degenerative diseases.

Summary Of Background Data

There is a paucity of literature assisting physicians and society regarding the cost-efficiency of management of lumbar spine conditions. Limited articles on selective operative and nonoperative therapies have been published for a variety of lumbar conditions.

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration data base, University of York, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (National Health Services Economic Evaluation Database and health technology assessment), and the Tufts CEA Registry was conducted through December 16, 2013. Three specific questions were addressed for adult patients: (1) What is the evidence that surgery is cost-effective compared with nonsurgical management for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis or stenosis? (2) What is the evidence that fusion is cost-effective compared with no fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis or stenosis? and (3) What is the evidence that instrumentation is cost-effective compared with none for degenerative spondylolisthesis? The Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument was used to provide an initial basis for critical appraisal of included economic studies. Articles were further refined with individual review based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Results

Initial search resulted in 122 potentially relevant citations, 115 of which were excluded at title and abstract levels and 3 at full-text reviews, leaving 5 for analysis. No non-English language text met inclusion/exclusion criteria. All studies illustrated a clinical benefit of surgical treatment as measured by quality-adjusted life year (0.11–8.05). Surgical treatments had a greater financial cost than nonoperative care ($5883-$26,035). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio calculations noted operative treatment over nonoperative treatment for spondylolisthesis ($59,487-$115,600) per quality-adjusted life year. However, cost for patients without spondylolisthesis varied greatly from nonoperative treat dominating to $77,600 per quality-adjusted life year favoring surgery. Because the articles had heterogeneous methods and patient population, conclusion differed greatly on cost assessment.

Conclusion

Limited quality data exist on cost-effective treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal conditions, despite more recent interest related to this topic. It is important that future research efforts focus on constructing higher quality trials in this area to help determine the most cost-effective care.

### Decompression alone or decompression and fusion in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^3a614edc]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, in which one vertebral body slips forward relative to the vertebral body below with an intact neural arch, is common in people aged over 60 years. This condition is associated with leg and back pain as well as functional limitations. It disproportionately affects women, especially black women, with a male to female ratio of about 1:6. Spondylolisthesis commonly occurs at the L4-L5 level, and rarely exceeds 30% of the vertebral body width. Due to the aging global population, degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is an important cause of disability. Surgical therapy is recommended for patients who fail conservative treatment.

Surgical options include decompression alone or decompression with fusion. In the United States, fusion rates more than doubled from 2005 to 2014, with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis accounting for majority of fusion rates. Moreover, hospitalization costs for lumbar internal fixation and fusion were estimated at $13 billion in 2011, higher than any other surgical procedure in the U.S. The need for fusion surgery remains controversial.

Two meta-analyses have reported conflicting outcomes with regards to decompression alone or with fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. In 2020, real-world evidence suggested that decompression alone is non-inferior to decompression with instrumented fusion. However, during a 4-year follow-up, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that reoperation occurred frequently in the decompression alone group (34%), relative to the fusion group (14%). Therefore, we evaluated whether clinical outcomes from decompression alone are comparable to decompression with fusion outcomes in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

### Surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis [^8b0e200e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Management of degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis is controversial. Surgery is widely used, but its effectiveness in comparison with that of nonsurgical treatment has not been demonstrated in controlled trials.

Methods

Surgical candidates from 13 centers in 11 U.S. states who had at least 12 weeks of symptoms and image-confirmed degenerative spondylolisthesis were offered enrollment in a randomized cohort or an observational cohort. Treatment was standard decompressive laminectomy (with or without fusion) or usual nonsurgical care. The primary outcome measures were the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) bodily pain and physical function scores (100-point scales, with higher scores indicating less severe symptoms) and the modified Oswestry Disability Index (100-point scale, with lower scores indicating less severe symptoms) at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.

Results

We enrolled 304 patients in the randomized cohort and 303 in the observational cohort. The baseline characteristics of the two cohorts were similar. The one-year crossover rates were high in the randomized cohort (approximately 40% in each direction) but moderate in the observational cohort (17% crossover to surgery and 3% crossover to nonsurgical care). The intention-to-treat analysis for the randomized cohort showed no statistically significant effects for the primary outcomes. The as-treated analysis for both cohorts combined showed a significant advantage for surgery at 3 months that increased at 1 year and diminished only slightly at 2 years. The treatment effects at 2 years were 18.1 for bodily pain (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.5 to 21.7), 18.3 for physical function (95% CI, 14.6 to 21.9), and -16.7 for the Oswestry Disability Index (95% CI, -19.5 to -13.9). There was little evidence of harm from either treatment.

Conclusions

In nonrandomized as-treated comparisons with careful control for potentially confounding baseline factors, patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis treated surgically showed substantially greater improvement in pain and function during a period of 2 years than patients treated nonsurgically.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — SPORT 2-year outcomes: In the randomized cohort, 159 were assigned to surgery and 145 to nonsurgical treatment, while in the observational cohort 173 initially chose surgery and 130 chose nonsurgical care, with approximately 40% crossovers in each direction in the nonrandomized cohort and 17% to surgery and 3% to non-surgical care in the observational cohort. In the randomized cohort, only 6% received decompression only, 21% fusion without instrumentation, and 73% fusion with instrumentation. At 2 years, treatment effects for the nonsurgical group were 1.5 for SF-36 bodily pain (95% confidence interval [CI] −4.2 to 7.3; P = 0.52), 1.9 for physical function (95% CI, −3.7 to 7.5; P = 0.71), and 2.2 for the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (95% CI, −2.3 to 6.8; P = 0.68), while for the surgical group they were 18.1 for SF-36 bodily pain (95% CI, 14.5 to 21.7), 18.3 for physical function (95% CI, 14.6 to 21.9), and −16.7 for the ODI (95% CI, −19.5 to −13.9). The authors suggest that patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis treated surgically showed substantially greater improvement in pain and function after 2 years compared to those treated nonoperatively.

Introduction

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the application of clinical methodology and decision-making thoroughly tested by duly controlled peer-reviewed studies. With the exponentially increasing number of publications, EBM aims to shift the traditional paradigm of making decisions based purely on the judgment of the physician or the experience of senior doctors to the use of results obtained from systematic and unbiased research in a patient-centered diagnosis and treatment model with the highest available evidence. The definition of EBM has evolved, but the most widely accepted definition was from Sackett et al. in 1996 and revised in 2000. In summary, it stated that clinicians should use the best, unbiased, clinically sound, and up-to-date data available on a patient basis in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery are the pioneers of spine surgery throughout the world. Neurosurgeons have utilized EBM and clinical guidelines to make sound decisions for the last three decades. However, the increasing number of guidelines have questioned the validity of these recommendations as they may stray away from the rigorous process outlined by The Institute of Medicine (IOM). Orthopedic Surgery also recognized the importance of EBM in the early 2000s, and journal sections reserved for "Evidence-Based Orthopedics" emerged. The classical paradigm of trying non-operative treatment first and operative treatment, if the first step fails, has shifted towards surgical treatment vs. other treatment options.

Evidence-Based Spine Surgery (EBSS) has also emerged parallel to the development of EBM. The North American Spine Society (NASS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) frequently publish guidelines with evidence-based suggestions to provide the highest evidence-based decisions in spinal pathologies. For example, EBSS supported by randomized controlled trials has shown discectomy for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation (LDH), decompression of spinal stenosis, and decompression with fusion of degenerative spondylolisthesis offer clinical benefit in relieving lower back and radicular pain compared to conservative treatment. However, pursuing EBSS as the sole deciding factor for diagnosing and treating spinal pathologies is unrealistic. Most of the publications on spine surgery are case-controlled retrospective cohorts or case series. Thus, the number of high-quality evidence parallel to spine surgery development is lacking. Considering the value of EBM and the probability of further implementation into decision-making, this study sheds light on the reception and application of EBM by spinal surgeons and the use of evidence-based modalities in their clinical practice.

### Diagnosis and conservative management of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^7e5272b8]. European Spine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is a disorder that causes the slip of one vertebral body over the one below due to degenerative changes in the spine. Lumbar DS is a major cause of spinal canal stenosis and is often related to low back and leg pain. We reviewed the symptoms, prognosis and conservative treatments for symptoms associated with DS. PubMed and MEDLINE databases (1950–2007) were searched for the key words "spondylolisthesis", "pseudospondylolisthesis", "degenerative spondylolisthesis", "spinal stenosis", "lumbar spine", "antherolisthesis", "posterolisthesis", "low back pain", and "lumbar instability". All relevant articles in English were reviewed. Pertinent secondary references were also retrieved. The prognosis of patients with DS is favorable, however, those who suffer from neurological symptoms such as intermittent claudication or vesicorectal disorder, will most probably experience neurological deterioration if they are not operated upon. Nonoperative treatment should be the initial course of action in most cases of DS, with or without neurologic symptoms. Treatment options include use of analgesics and NSAIDs to control pain; epidural steroid injections, and physical methods such as bracing and flexion strengthening exercises. An up-to-date knowledge on diagnosis and prevention of lumbar DS can assist in determination of future research goals. Additional studies are required to establish treatment protocols for the conservative treatment of DS.

This article reviews the assessment and management of degenerative spondylolisthesis and lumbar stenosis. It discusses nonoperative management modalities and operative management and indications. It also discusses complications and reviews the current body of literature for clinical outcomes with surgical management. There remains conflicting evidence on whether isolated decompression versus decompression and fusion is superior. Minimally invasive techniques show early promise at reducing some of the potential complications with open decompression. As health care costs increase, cost considerations become more important and should be included as a factor in decision making.

Conclusions

Our findings provide clinicians and healthcare policy makers with a comprehensive assessment and high-quality evidence on the safety and efficacy of simple decompression as a superior option for patients with stable DS. This conclusion might be especially useful for patients in higher age groups who are likely to be better served by the lower morbidity associated with decompression alone.

### Surgical compared with nonoperative treatment for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis. four-year results in the spine patient outcomes research trial (SPORT) randomized and observational cohorts [^3b575c63]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The management of degenerative spondylolisthesis associated with spinal stenosis remains controversial. Surgery is widely used and has recently been shown to be more effective than nonoperative treatment when the results were followed over two years. Questions remain regarding the long-term effects of surgical treatment compared with those of nonoperative treatment.

Methods

Surgical candidates from thirteen centers with symptoms of at least twelve weeks' duration as well as confirmatory imaging showing degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis were offered enrollment in a randomized cohort or observational cohort. Treatment consisted of standard decompressive laminectomy (with or without fusion) or usual nonoperative care. Primary outcome measures were the Short Form-36 (SF-36) bodily pain and physical function scores and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at six weeks, three months, six months, and yearly up to four years.

Results

In the randomized cohort (304 patients enrolled), 66% of those randomized to receive surgery received it by four years whereas 54% of those randomized to receive nonoperative care received surgery by four years. In the observational cohort (303 patients enrolled), 97% of those who chose surgery received it whereas 33% of those who chose nonoperative care eventually received surgery. The intent-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort, which was limited by nonadherence to the assigned treatment, showed no significant differences in treatment outcomes between the operative and nonoperative groups at three or four years. An as-treated analysis combining the randomized and observational cohorts that adjusted for potential confounders demonstrated that the clinically relevant advantages of surgery that had been previously reported through two years were maintained at four years, with treatment effects of 15.3 (95% confidence interval, 11 to 19.7) for bodily pain, 18.9 (95% confidence interval, 14.8 to 23) for physical function, and -14.3 (95% confidence interval, -17.5 to -11.1) for the Oswestry Disability Index. Early advantages (at two years) of surgical treatment in terms of the secondary measures of bothersomeness of back and leg symptoms, overall satisfaction with current symptoms, and self-rated progress were also maintained at four years.

Conclusions

Compared with patients who are treated nonoperatively, patients in whom degenerative spondylolisthesis and associated spinal stenosis are treated surgically maintain substantially greater pain relief and improvement in function for four years.

Search strategy and selection criteria

The search strategy was modelled based on the North American Spine Society, Diagnosis and Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis, modified by information specialists and validated by clinical experts and an evidence synthesis expert. A three-step search strategy was used to identify both published and unpublished studies. A limited search was run in MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid), using the keywords and index terms 'lumbar spondylolisthesis' and 'fusion'. The analysis of the text words in the title and abstract and the index terms used to describe articles followed.

In May 2022, an information specialist conducted a comprehensive search including MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Emcare (Ovid), Cochrane Library, CINAHL (EBSCO) and Scopus. Sources of grey literature included ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and registers of clinical trials: ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (see online supplemental appendix A). The reference lists of relevant publications were screened for additional eligible studies. We did not apply time, study design, language, geographical or other restrictions. We imported the retrieved records into Endnote V.X9.2 (Clarivate Analytics, Pennsylvania). We removed the duplicates according to the method described by Bramer et al. Search strategies were downloaded/manually copied from each database or register and saved in a Microsoft Word document.

Two reviewers (LK and DT) independently screened the titles and abstracts and the full texts of the potentially eligible records. We resolved any conflicts by discussion and with a third reviewer (RKa). We recorded and reported the reasons for excluding records at full-text screening (online supplemental appendix C). We contacted the authors for any missing information.

We included RCTs comparing isolated decompression (any surgical technique) with decompression with fusion in adult participants with DS with at least 12 months of follow-up. Only trials with instrumented spinal fusion with pedicle screw fixation were included. Excluded were cases with isthmic spondylolisthesis, degenerative scoliosis, spinal stenosis with other causes or those with previous spinal surgery. Primary outcomes were the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), back pain and leg pain. Secondary outcomes were reoperation rate, complication rate, length of hospital stay, duration of surgery, blood loss during surgery and quality of life (QoL). No institutional review board approval was required for this meta-analysis because the study included previously published data.

### Decompression alone versus decompression with instrumented fusion in the treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^8186c986]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of adding instrumented spinal fusion to decompression to treat degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS).

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis.

Data sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception to May 2022.

Eligibility criteria for study selection

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing decompression with instrumented fusion to decompression alone in patients with DS. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We provide the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessment of the certainty of evidence (COE).

Results

We identified 4514 records and included four trials with 523 participants. At a 2-year follow-up, adding fusion to decompression likely results in trivial difference in the Oswestry Disability Index (range 0–100, with higher values indicating greater impairment) with mean difference (MD) 0.86 (95% CI −4.53 to 6.26; moderate COE). Similar results were observed for back and leg pain measured on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher values indicating more severe pain. There was a slightly increased improvement in back pain (2-year follow-up) in the group without fusion shown by MD −5·92 points (95% CI −11.00 to −0.84; moderate COE). There was a trivial difference in leg pain between the groups, slightly favouring the one without fusion, with MD −1.25 points (95% CI −6.71 to 4.21; moderate COE). Our findings at 2-year follow-up suggest that omitting fusion may increase the reoperation rate slightly (OR 1.23; 0.70 to 2.17; low COE).

Conclusions

Evidence suggests no benefits of adding instrumented fusion to decompression for treating DS. Isolated decompression seems sufficient for most patients. Further RCTs assessing spondylolisthesis stability are needed to determine which patients would benefit from fusion.

### Surgical management of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis [^06cc7724]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is a common cause of low back pain, radiculopathy, and/or neurogenic claudication. Treatment begins with a trial of nonsurgical methods, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and epidural corticosteroid injections. Surgical treatment with decompression and fusion is recommended for patients who do not respond to this initial regimen. Although much has been published in the past two decades on the surgical management of DS, the optimal method remains controversial. Interbody fusion may improve arthrodesis rates and can be performed via numerous surgical approaches. Minimally invasive techniques continue to be developed. Particular attention to surgical management of DS in the elderly is warranted given the increasing numbers of elderly persons. Healthcare utilization in the future must take into account evidence-based medicine that establishes clinically effective practices while simultaneously being cost effective.

Diverging reoperation rates could partially be explained by differences in treatment traditions and radiological assessment. If a patient operated on without additional fusion complains of persisting back pain, the threshold for offering reoperation with fusion could be low. A surgical alternative is less apparent when the patient is primarily operated with fusion. The rationale might be that the back pain is caused by spondylolisthesis so-called instability.

In this trial, non-inferiority for decompression alone was maintained over five years and the reduction in back pain was similar between the groups, even though a high number of participants had radiological and clinical signs of instability. A secondary exploratory Nordsten-DS study on treatment effect modifiers did not find that participants with more typical preoperative signs of instability and back pain benefited from an additional fusion. The high prevalence of non-specific low back pain in the general population and the scarcity of evidence for a causal relationship between back pain and degenerative spondylolisthesis are valid arguments for not routinely offering subsequent fusion surgery for persistent back pain.

Decompression without fusion is a faster, less invasive, safer, and more cost-effective treatment for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Despite the two year results from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses recommending decompression alone as primary treatment for these patients, only a few countries have reported a change in surgical practice. In the US, the fusion rate for degenerative spondylolisthesis continued to increase from 67% in 2016 to 90.4% in 2019. To ensure implementation of evidence from follow-ups longer than two years, the results from the present trial need to be acknowledged by patients and healthcare providers as well as by decision and policy makers. Selective use of information supporting fusion surgery will lead to patients receiving more extensive and risky surgery than is necessary.

For successful shared decision making, clinicians should thoroughly inform patients about the pros and cons of alternative surgical and non-surgical treatments and communicate corresponding realistic prognoses for reaching pain and functional goals. Unfortunately, very little is known about patients' goals regarding spine surgery. A recent studyshowed that patients' preoperative expectations may be higher than the commonly reported outcomes of spinal surgery. Future investigations should assess patients' functional and pain goals before surgery relative to their perceived benefits after surgery.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^7ff9a678]. The Spine Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Natural history of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — prior consensus stated that the majority of patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis and an absence of neurologic deficits will do well with conservative care, that patients who present with sensory changes, muscle weakness or cauda equina syndrome are more likely to develop progressive functional decline without surgery, that progression of slip correlates with jobs that require repetitive anterior flexion of the spine, and that slip progression is less likely to occur when the disc has lost over 80% of its native height and intervertebral osteophytes have formed while progression of clinical symptoms does not correlate with progression of the slip; the current guideline reports this topic is not addressed due to limited literature and that natural history questions have been eliminated from this guideline.

### Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: trends in management [^93b17b54]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis is common in elderly patients. When symptomatic, the resultant neurogenic claudication often leads to a diminished quality of life. A nonsurgical approach is an appropriate first step. Maximizing the chance of a solid arthrodesis improves the possibility of a successful long-term outcome. Treatment of this pathology has evolved over the past twenty years with the publication of numerous prospective randomized trials assessing the influence of fusion and instrumentation following decompression. Current prospective trials have evaluated the use of bone morphogenetic proteins as a substitute for autogenous bone graft. Recently, soft-tissue stabilization devices have been advocated as an alternative to fusion. Clinicians should critically evaluate these newer technologies and exercise caution regarding their use until controlled long-term trials are completed.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 9: lumbar fusion for stenosis with spondylolisthesis [^093153d0]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with stenosis associated with a spondylolisthesis will often describe signs and symptoms consistent with neurogenic claudication, radiculopathy, and/or low-back pain. The primary objective of surgery, when deemed appropriate, is to decompress the neural elements. As a result of the decompression, the inherent instability associated with the spondylolisthesis may progress and lead to further misalignment that results in pain or recurrence of neurological complaints. Under these circumstances, lumbar fusion is considered appropriate to stabilize the spine and prevent delayed deterioration. Since publication of the original guidelines there have been a significant number of studies published that continue to support the utility of lumbar fusion for patients presenting with stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Several recently published trials, including the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, are among the largest prospective randomized investigations of this issue. Despite limitations of study design or execution, these trials have consistently demonstrated superior outcomes when patients undergo surgery, with the majority undergoing some type of lumbar fusion procedure. There is insufficient evidence, however, to recommend a standard approach to achieve a solid arthrodesis. When formulating the most appropriate surgical strategy, it is recommended that an individualized approach be adopted, one that takes into consideration the patient's unique anatomical constraints and desires, as well as surgeon's experience.

### Decompression alone versus decompression with instrumented fusion in the treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^f2aad934]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is a widespread spinal pathology with prevalence reaching 25%–43% in women and 19%–31% in men over 65 years. Ventral shift of the cranial vertebra compared with the more caudal vertebra is caused by arthritis of the facet joints, malfunction of the stabilising ligaments and disc degeneration. All these changes contribute to the compromise of the canal and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). DS is one of the most common causes of progressive lower back or leg pain (neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy). It is a common indication for spinal surgery in adults, generally leading to better results than conservative therapy.

The least invasive, safest and least costly procedure to treat DS is non-destabilising decompression of the spinal canal with resection of hypertrophic facet joints and ligamentum flavum. There is an ongoing debate on whether fusion of the altered lumbar segment should be added to decompression to decrease the risk of further progression of the pathology. Although some reviews have found greater efficacy of fusion in the treatment of DS, other studies have not unequivocally demonstrated the advantage of fusion. However, DS represents the most common indication for elective spinal fusion with a highly increasing tendency and high hospital costs.

In February 2022, we searched Epistemonikos, MEDLINE (via Ovid) and PROSPERO for any ongoing or completed reviews. We found seven completed systematic reviewsand four registered reviews (all completed and retrieved, see online supplemental appendix E). Since then, another systematic review has been published. However, most searched only for English-language studies, included studies with outdated and no longer used fusion techniques and inappropriatelycombined the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and pseudo-RCTs or observational studies in meta-analyses. None provided the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment of certainty of evidence (COE).

Therefore, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to compare decompression alone and decompression with instrumented fusion in treating DS across relevant outcomes and prespecified subgroups of patients.

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 7: lumbar fusion for intractable low-back pain without stenosis or spondylolisthesis [^3741953a]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Establishing an appropriate treatment strategy for patients presenting with low-back pain, in the absence of stenosis or spondylolisthesis, remains a controversial subject. Inherent to this situation is often an inability to adequately identify the source of low-back pain to justify various treatment recommendations, such as lumbar fusion. The current evidence does not identify a single best treatment alternative for these patients. Based on a number of prospective, randomized trials, comparable outcomes, for patients presenting with 1- or 2-level degenerative disc disease, have been demonstrated following either lumbar fusion or a comprehensive rehabilitation program with a cognitive element. Limited access to such comprehensive rehabilitative programs may prove problematic when pursuing this alternative. For patients whose pain is refractory to conservative care, lumbar fusion is recommended. Limitations of these studies preclude the ability to present the most robust recommendation in support of lumbar fusion. A number of lesser-quality studies, primarily case series, also support the use of lumbar fusion in this patient population.

### Decompression alone versus decompression with instrumented fusion in the treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^0eeb9d61]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis were designed and carried out by a national panel of experts in spine surgery and evidence synthesis experts. Information specialists specialising in evidence synthesis searching devised the search strategies and conducted the search in nine databases in May 2022 to capture all available published and unpublished data from RCTs. We aimed to include only the highest level evidence focusing on properly randomised trials and solid definitions of DS and fusion technique (pedicle screw fixation). Despite all these efforts, another limitation of this review is the inclusion of only four trials with just over 500 participants. Due to many difficulties associated with conducting neurosurgical RCTs, the trials are scarce; however, two are currently registered (NCT02348645 and DRKS00000237).

After careful examination of our meta-analysis using the GRADE approach, the certainty in the evidence on the safety and efficacy of isolated decompression was rated as low to moderate. Thus, future research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Therefore, conclusions of our study should be considered strong enough to influence the clinical practice. Our national guideline development group has formulated a conditional recommendation based on these findings which will be published subsequently. The main limitation of this review is, therefore, the inability to provide more specific findings on who might benefit from adding fusion to decompression, as discussed above, and this decision needs to be based on observational data and clinical expertise in each individual case, until further data are published by Austevoll et al.

### Surgery for degenerative lumbar spondylosis [^ba7a02ef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical investigations and interventions account for large health care utilisation and costs, but the scientific evidence for most procedures is still limited.

Objectives

Degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine are variously described as lumbar spondylosis or degenerative disc disease (which we regarded as one entity) and may be associated with back pain and associated leg symptoms, instability, spinal stenosis and/or degenerative spondylolisthesis. The objective of this review was to assess current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of surgical interventions for degenerative lumbar spondylosis.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Spine and ISSLS abstracts, with citation tracking from the retrieved articles. We also corresponded with experts. All data found up to 31 March 2005 are included.

Selection Criteria

Randomised (RCTs) or quasi-randomised trials of surgical treatment of lumbar spondylosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published papers. Additional information was sought from the authors if necessary.

Main Results

Thirty-one published RCTs of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis were identified. The trials varied in quality: only the more recent trials used appropriate methods of randomization, blinding and independent assessment of outcome. Most of the earlier published results were of technical surgical outcomes with some crude ratings of clinical outcome. More of the recent trials also reported patient-centered outcomes of pain or disability, but there is still very little information on occupational outcomes. There was a particular lack of long term outcomes beyond two to three years. Seven heterogeneous trials on spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis and nerve compression permitted limited conclusions. Two new trials on the effectiveness of fusion showed conflicting results. One showed that fusion gave better clinical outcomes than conventional physiotherapy, while the other showed that fusion was no better than a modern exercise and rehabilitation programme. Eight trials showed that instrumented fusion produced a higher fusion rate (though that needs to be qualified by the difficulty of assessing fusion in the presence of metal-work), but any improvement in clinical outcomes is probably marginal, while there is other evidence that it may be associated with higher complication rates. Three trials with conflicting results did not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior, posterior or circumferential fusion. Preliminary results of two small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy showed conflicting results. Preliminary data from three trials of disc arthroplasty did not permit any firm conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice. Surgeons should be encouraged to perform further RCTs in this field.

### Lumbar spondylolisthesis: modern registries and the development of artificial intelligence [^55702b84]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVEThere are a wide variety of comparative treatment options in neurosurgery that do not lend themselves to traditional randomized controlled trials. The object of this article was to examine how clinical registries might be used to generate new evidence to support a particular treatment option when comparable options exist. Lumbar spondylolisthesis is used as an example.METHODSThe authors reviewed the literature examining the comparative effectiveness of decompression alone versus decompression with fusion for lumbar stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Modern data acquisition for the creation of registries was also reviewed with an eye toward how artificial intelligence for the treatment of lumbar spondylolisthesis might be explored.RESULTSCurrent randomized controlled trials differ on the importance of adding fusion when performing decompression for lumbar spondylolisthesis. Standardized approaches to extracting data from the electronic medical record as well as the ability to capture radiographic imaging and incorporate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) will ultimately lead to the development of modern, structured, data-filled registries that will lay the foundation for machine learning.CONCLUSIONSThere is a growing realization that patient experience, satisfaction, and outcomes are essential to improving the overall quality of spine care. There is a need to use practical, validated PRO tools in the quest to optimize outcomes within spine care. Registries will be designed to contain robust clinical data in which predictive analytics can be generated to develop and guide data-driven personalized spine care.

### Rationale for the surgical treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis [^a427081a]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

A questionnaire survey.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of patient age, dynamic instability, and/or low back pain on the treatment of patients with a degenerative spondylolisthesis, and if the operative approach is affected by surgeon specialty, location, or practice model.

Summary Of Background Data

The classic treatment for patients with symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis is decompression and fusion; however in a select group of patients, an isolated decompression may be reasonable.

Methods

A survey was sent to surgeon members of the Lumbar Spine Research Society and AOSpine requesting information regarding their preferred treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis for a number of different clinical scenarios. Determinants included patient age, the presence of instability, symptoms of low back pain, surgeon's location, surgeon's specialty, and practice model.

Results

A total of 223 spine surgeons completed the survey. Age of the patient, the presence of instability, and low back pain all significantly (P < 0.0001) affected the recommended treatment, which were independent of surgeon factors. Older patients were significantly less likely to be offered an interbody fusion and more likely to be recommended for an isolated decompression (P < 0.0001), and the presence of dynamic instability made an interbody fusion more likely than an isolated decompression (P < 0.0001). Of those who responded, 53.2% of surgeons reported they would recommend an isolated decompression for a properly selected patient with a degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Conclusion

The most common operative treatment for a degenerative spondylolisthesis is a decompression and fusion; however, the results of this survey demonstrate that surgeons consider degenerative spondylolisthesis a heterogeneous condition that requires an individualized surgical plan. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effect of variables such as age, the presence of low back pain, and the presence of dynamic instability on patient reported outcomes from various surgical options.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach (Murat et al): A prospective case series of 84 patients reported patients had a mean age of 62 years old and had not improved after at least 6 months of conservative treatment, with follow-up for a minimum of 24 months. Spinal canal size increased from 50.6 to 102.8 (p < 0.001), good to excellent results were obtained in 64 cases, and complications included 4 patients with accidental durotomy, one patient with a wound infection, and one patient requiring secondary fusion; the authors state this provides Level IV therapeutic evidence that bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach is a safe and effective treatment option for degenerative spondylolisthesis patients whose symptoms did not improve after at least 6 months of conservative treatment.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — retrospective comparative study (Matsudaira et al) assessed three treatments at minimum 2-year follow-up using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score and radiography; of 55 patients, 20 had laminectomy plus posterolateral fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation (Group 1), 19 had laminectomy alone (Group 2), and 16 received medical/interventional treatment (Group 3), with one patient in each surgical group lost to follow-up. Symptom alleviation was noted in the fusion and laminectomy groups but not in the medical/interventional group, no statistically significant difference in clinical improvement was found between fusion and laminectomy, percent slip increased significantly in groups 2 and 3, and spondylolisthesis was stabilized in Group 1. The authors concluded that decompression with preservation of the posterior elements can be useful for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis from Grade I degenerative spondylolisthesis, and this paper offers Level III therapeutic evidence that fusion with instrumentation and laminectomy alone yield improved outcomes versus medical/interventional treatment alone.

### Degenerative spondylolisthesis: review of current trends and controversies [^0e7fe849]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

A literature-based review.

Objectives

To review management and controversies and to present authors recommendations.

Summary Of Background Data

There is considerable controversy regarding indication for surgery, role for decompression alone, and decompression with fusion with or without instrumentation.

Methods

Review of English language medical literature.

Results

The condition may stabilize itself with the collapse of the disc spaces and osteophytes but may continue to progress in nearly a third of the cases. It may cause predominantly back pain due to segmental instability, or radicular pain/neurogenic claudication secondary to root entrapment or spinal stenosis. When conservative treatment fails, the mainstay of surgical treatment is decompressive laminectomy and fusion, with or without instrumentation.

Conclusions

Decompression primarily relieves radicular symptoms and neurogenic claudication whereas fusion primarily relieves back pain by elimination of instability. The goals for instrumentation are to promote fusion and to correct deformity. Fusion has a better long-term outcome than decompression alone. There is evidence that instrumentation improves fusion rate but does not improve clinical outcome in a relatively short-term follow-up. However, outcome of pseudarthrosis cases deteriorates over time and solid fusion produces better long-term outcome. The benefit of instrumentation comes with a price of higher postoperative morbidity and complication rate. Bone morphogenetic proteins are being tried to increase the rate of fusion, without increasing the complication rate, but the cost is prohibitive. More recently, dynamic stabilization with instrumentation but without fusion has been introduced as an alternative treatment. The current trends of surgical treatment and controversies are discussed.

Future directions for research on interspinous devices — The work group recommends the undertaking of large multicenter registry database studies with long term follow up comparing the outcomes of surgical treatment with interspinous spacers to medical/interventional treatment in the management of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis patients. The work group recommends that the failure analysis of interspinous spacers in the treatment of single level degenerative spondylolisthesis should include a group treated with decompression with or without fusion in addition to medical management as patients have benefited from this therapy. The work group recommends that future analysis of interspinous spaces should include longer term outcome analysis to investigate whether complication rates fall within acceptable limits.

Data extraction

Two reviewers (LK and DT) independently extracted data on the characteristics of the eligible studies using our data extraction form: author, publication year, title, country, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample sizes per protocol, at randomisation/allocation and interventions received, characteristics of the interventions, length of follow-up and baseline data of the samples, which included age, sex, severity and type of spondylolisthesis. We then extracted data on outcome measurements (see above), preferring a 2-year follow-up. All steps of the review process were discussed and validated by the national panel of experts in spine surgery consisting of six neurosurgeons and six orthopaedic surgeons.

Quality assessment

Two reviewers (LK and DT) separately assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or with a third reviewer (MK). The results are shown in online supplemental appendix B using the robvis toolto visualise the risk of bias.

Data analysis

We undertook statistical pooling for all outcomes where at least two study results were available via Cochrane RevMan software (Review Manager (RevMan) (Computer program), V.5.4, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020), if appropriate. We pooled data with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (only relevant for ODI, pain and reoperation rate). If the 2-year follow-up data were unavailable, we chose data for a longer follow-up of up to 5 years. If the CI or SE were available, we calculated the SD using the software tools. We transformed the values for pain measured on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10 to a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100. We used the VAS scale throughout the review.

We presented the summary estimate as an OR with 95% CI using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects model for the dichotomous data. We estimated the OR using intention-to-treat data, if available. The dichotomous data included the complication and reoperation rate.

We presented the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for the continuous data using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects model. The continuous data included the outcomes of ODI, leg pain, back pain, blood loss during surgery, duration of the surgery and length of hospitalisation.

We planned subgroup analyses for categories of DS (specifically, according to stability); however, data were unavailable to allow statistical pooling.

Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) — nonoperative and surgical cohorts and outcomes over 4 years: Investigators enrolled 304 patients in the randomized cohort and 303 in the observational cohort, and pre-enrollment nonoperative care included physical therapy (68%), epidural injections (55%), chiropractic care (25%), anti-inflammatory medications (63%) and opioid analgesics (30%). In the randomized cohort, 159 patients were assigned to surgery and 145 were assigned to nonsurgical treatment, and of the 145 patients assigned to receive nonoperative care, 54% underwent surgery by 4 years. In the observational cohort, 173 initially chose surgery and 130 initially chose nonsurgical care, and of the 130 patients who initially chose nonoperative treatment, 33% underwent surgery by 4 years. Patients were evaluated over 4 years using the SF-36 for bodily pain and physical function scores and the modified Oswestry Disability Index, results indicated that patients enrolled in the nonoperative treatment group experienced modest improvement from baseline over a period of four years; in patients with neurogenic claudication, the SF-36 score improved 12.9 points, SF-36 physical function score improved 8.3 points, and the Oswestry Disability Index decreased 7.4 points. Additionally, a post hoc analysis suggested that symptom duration does not impact nonoperative or surgical treatment success for patients with this disease.

### Surgeons agree to disagree on surgical options for degenerative conditions of the cervical and lumbar spine [^a0e373c7]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

This is a survey study designed to evaluate agreement among spine surgeons regarding treatment options for six clinical scenarios involving degenerative conditions of the cervical and lumbar spine.

Objectives

The purpose was to evaluate whether or not surgeons agree on which cases require operative intervention and what type of surgery should be performed.

Summary Of Background Data

Agreement between spine surgeons on when to operate and what procedure to perform is a subject that has received increasing attention. This is an important question in the field of spine surgery, where "gold standards" that are based on large clinical trials are relatively sparse.

Methods

Six clinical vignettes were presented to 19 members of the Degenerative Spine Study Group. Each vignette was accompanied by a series of radiographs and/or magnetic resonance imagings, followed by treatment options in multiple-choice format. Two months later, the same vignettes were sent out with identical instructions except that they were now told they were treating a close family member.

Results

More than 76% of surgeons agreed on whether or not to recommend surgical intervention for the following four cases: lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis with stenosis, cervical herniated nucleus pulposus, lumbar spondylosis, and lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus. Two scenarios had approximately 50% surgeon agreement: cervical stenosis and lumbar spondylolysis. However, despite good inter-rater agreement about who needed surgery, there was poor agreement regarding what procedure to perform if surgery was recommended. When repeating the survey in the setting of operating on a family member, only 17 (17.7%) of 96 recommendations were changed.

Conclusion

Spine surgeons in this survey generally agreed on when to operate but failed to agree on what type of procedures to perform.

NASS clinical guideline — diagnostic imaging for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: The lateral radiograph is the most appropriate, noninvasive test for detecting degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (Grade of Recommendation: B (Suggested)), and in the absence of reliable evidence the work group's opinion is that the lateral radiograph should be obtained in the standing position whenever possible (Work Group Consensus Statement). The most appropriate, noninvasive test for imaging stenosis accompanying degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is MRI (Work Group Consensus Statement). Facet joint effusion greater than 1.5mm on supine MRI may be suggestive of the presence of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, and further evaluation should be considered, including using plain standing radiographs (Grade of Recommendation: B). There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the utility of upright seated MRI in diagnosis and for or against the use of axial loaded MRI to evaluate dural sac cross sectional area (Grade of Recommendation: I (Insufficient Evidence) for both). Plain myelography or CT myelography are useful to assess spinal stenosis in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, especially in those who have contraindications to MRI (Grade of Recommendation: B (Suggested)). In patients with associated spinal stenosis for whom MRI is either contraindicated or inconclusive, CT myelography is the most appropriate test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal or the presence of nerve root impingement (Work Group Consensus Statement). If MRI and CT myelography are contraindicated, inconclusive or inappropriate, CT is suggested as the most appropriate test to confirm the presence of anatomic narrowing of the spinal canal (Work Group Consensus Statement).

### Guideline update for the performance of fusion procedures for degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. part 10: lumbar fusion for stenosis without spondylolisthesis [^2d8b3fab]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar stenosis is one of the more common radiographic manifestations of the aging process, leading to narrowing of the spinal canal and foramen. When stenosis is clinically relevant, patients often describe activity-related low-back or lower-extremity pain, known as neurogenic claudication. For those patients who do not improve with conservative care, surgery is considered an appropriate treatment alternative. The primary objective of surgery is to reconstitute the spinal canal. The role of fusion, in the absence of a degenerative deformity, is uncertain. The previous guideline recommended against the inclusion of lumbar fusion in the absence of spinal instability or a likelihood of iatrogenic instability. Since the publication of the original guidelines, numerous studies have demonstrated the role of surgical decompression in this patient population; however, few have investigated the utility of fusion in patients without underlying instability. The majority of studies contain a heterogeneous cohort of subjects, often combining patients with and without spondylolisthesis who received various surgical interventions, limiting fusions to those patients with instability. It is difficult if not impossible, therefore, to formulate valid conclusions regarding the utility of fusion for patients with uncomplicated stenosis. Lower-level evidence exists, however, that does not demonstrate an added benefit of fusion for these patients; therefore, in the absence of deformity or instability, the inclusion of a fusion is not recommended.

Table 2
Characteristics of the included randomised controlled trials and baseline data

Three trialswith 461 participants suggested adding fusion to decompression likely results in little to no difference in ODI at 2-year follow-up with MD 0·86 (as measured on a scale of 0–100, with 100 indicating more severe impairment; 95% CI from −4·53 to 6·26; I² = 59%; moderate COE, figure 2), slightly favouring the group with fusion. Three trialswith 455 participants showed decompression without fusion likely reduces back pain slightly more compared with the group that underwent decompression with fusion, with MD −5·92 (scale 0–100, with higher numbers indicating more pain; 95% CI from −11·00 to −0·84; I² = 0%; moderate COE, figure 3) and results in little to no difference between the two groups in leg pain with MD −1·25 (95% CI from −6·71 to 4·21; I² = 0%; moderate COE, figure 4); however, slightly favouring the group without fusion.

SPORT 2007

The SPORT Trial of 2007 further advanced our understanding of the treatment for lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis, focusing on surgical versus non-surgical approaches. The study, spanning across 13 centers in the United States, enrolled 607 patients. Patients were offered the choice of standard decompressive laminectomy (with or without fusion) or usual non-surgical care. The primary outcome measures were the SF-36 bodily pain and physical function scores and the modified Oswestry Disability Index, assessed over a two-year period. Key findings includes the as-treated analysis across both cohorts showed significant advantages for surgery at 3 months, with this benefit persisting at 1 year and only slightly diminishing at 2 years. Treatment effects at 2 years were significant for bodily pain, physical function, and the Oswestry Disability Index. The study found minimal evidence of harm from either treatment. This trial highlighted the substantial improvement in pain and function over two years in patients treated surgically compared to those receiving non-surgical care, highlighting the importance of individualized treatment decisions in managing lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis.

SPORT 2008

The 2008 SPORT Trial, an extension of the 2006 and 2007 studies, further examined treatments for lumbar disc herniation with a focus on long-term outcomes over a four-year period. Conducted at 13 medical centers across the U.S. the trial included a total of 634 patients, with 278 in the randomized group and 356 in the observational group. The study continued to compare surgical intervention (standard open diskectomy) with nonoperative care. The results reinforced earlier findings that surgery provided more substantial improvements in pain and function compared to nonoperative care. However, both groups showed significant improvements over time. The extended follow-up of this trial provided valuable insights into the long-term benefits and potential limitations of each treatment option, emphasizing the importance of considering patient choice and long-term implications in the management of lumbar disc herniation.

### Treatment of instability and spondylolisthesis: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^63bfd78a]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Spondylolisthesis is a common cause of lower-back pain, radiculopathy, and neurogenic claudication among the adult population. Treatment should begin with nonoperative measures that may include physical therapy, aerobic exercise, epidural steroid injections, and homeopathic remedies. If these treatments fail, surgical intervention may provide the patient pain relief and improvement in neurologic symptoms. The use of instrumentation for posterolateral fusions as well as interbody fusion may improve clinical outcomes for those having surgical intervention. We discuss the current nonoperative modalities and surgical techniques treating degenerative spondylolisthesis.

### Decompression alone versus decompression with instrumented fusion in the treatment of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^d4dae6b0]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

According to the latest recommendations of The North American Spine Society from 2016 based on older observational data, simple decompression may be considered for symptomatic DS with low-grade (up to 20% anteroposterior caudal vertebral body) slip unresponsive to conservative treatment. The authors noted that in the case of preserving medial structures, it leads to equivalent results as instrumented decompression. Based on the available evidence, it was not possible to make recommendations for or against supplementing fusion in these patients or to predict the success of surgery in terms of age, comorbidities, duration of symptoms or body mass index. In 2020, Sharif et al published the consensus of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Spine Committee on indications for lumbar spine fusion in DS. They recommended isolated decompression for patients with spinal stenosis without signs of instability and predominant leg pain. Lumbar fusion may be added in patients with unstable symptomatic DS or spinal deformity and in those who undergo bilateral facetectomy of over 50%. Our results support that these recommendations in that fusion are generally no added benefit in DS. However, we could not analyse the outcome according to the level of vertebral slip or instability. Despite the consensus of the professional societies and our findings, the survey studies demonstrate a huge discrepancy among spine surgeons in the surgical management of DS. For instance, Spina et al found that 40% of surgeons would always perform fusion in stable DS. Schroeder et al reported that older patients would be more likely treated by isolated decompression. Conversely, instability or low back pain made a fusion more likely than an isolated decompression. At least 2.5% of surgeons in every circumstance recommend isolated decompression, and up to 53% of surgeons recommend this approach in older patients without considerable low back pain or instability. Despite these recommendations and responses, registry-based studies found that 96% of patients with DS in the USA underwent a fusion in 2011and 90.6% between 2005 and 2015. Analysis of data from multicentre studies from Canada (2015–2019)and France (2009–2013)showed that fusion was performed in 76% and 83% of DS cases, respectively. In the DS cohort of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT), only 7% of patients had instability. Leg pain as the predominant clinical symptom was present in 34% of patients, back pain in 26% and a combination in 40%. Assuming this cohort represents patients undergoing surgery for DS, one would expect over 4%–24%would be a candidate for simple decompression. The high proportion of fusion may be related to no clear evidence for its use, rapid increase in the global instrumentation industryand insurance status in countries with private insurance. John et al reported that private insurance patients had the highest incidence and the highest annual growth of spinal fusion in the USA.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — Turunen et al retrospective review: In a retrospective review assessing long-term clinical outcome (at least 10 years) after posterolateral fusion, a total of 106 patients were evaluated using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with degenerative spondylolisthesis (Group 1) showing the greatest improvements compared to other groups (47.0 vs. 26.4, p < 0.001 and 6.3 vs. 4.1, p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, 28 of 31 reported excellent or good long-term results, and the authors state this provides Level IV therapeutic evidence that posterolateral fusion provides satisfactory long term outcomes in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis — obesity (BMI > 30) and outcomes — There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation regarding the influence of obesity (BMI > 30) and its impact on treatment outcomes in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (Grade of Recommendation: I [Insufficient Evidence]). In a post hoc retrospective SPORT subgroup, there were 376 patients with a BMI of less than 30 (non-obese) and 225 patients with a BMI more than 30 (obese); obese patients had a significantly higher incidence of comorbidities (p < 0.001). Compared with nonobese patients, there was a trend toward increased wound infection in obese patients (5% vs. 1%, p = 0.051), and at 4 year follow-up there was a significantly higher rate of reoperation in the obese group (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.013). At 4 year follow-up, obese patients had Clinical Function scores that worsened from baseline by a mean of 3.5 compared to a mean improvement of 13.9 points in the nonobese group (p < 0.001). The treatment effect for the SF-36 Physical Function score was higher for the obese patient group compared to nonoperative obese patients (25.6 vs. 14, p = 0.004), suggesting that surgery has a significantly greater benefit over nonsurgical treatment in obese patients; Level II prognostic evidence indicates risk of infection and reoperation 4 years after surgical treatment is greater in obese patients compared to non-obese surgical patients.

### Lumbar stenosis with spondylolisthesis: current concepts of surgical treatment [^0dfdcc28]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

As degenerative changes progress in the aging population, more patients will present with degenerative spondylolisthesis. The clinical picture is usually of a woman older than 50 years of age with a degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis at L5 with symptoms of neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy. Imaging studies will reveal a central recess, a lateral recess or both, and/or neuroforaminal stenosis. When patients do not respond to nonoperative treatments, surgical intervention is indicated. Most studies have concluded that the addition of an arthrodesis improves the clinical outcome. A recent longterm study showed that a solid fusion and an adequate decompression is the procedure offering the best outcome. The current authors will review the pathogenesis, clinical picture, and treatment recommendations for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

### Decompression alone or decompression and fusion in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^f8c078cc]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Lumbar interbody fusion has attracted the attention of many spine surgeons to treat a range of spinal disorders since it was first described by Briggs and Milligan in 1944. Evidence for the use of fusion in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is insufficient. A small difference for back and leg pain was observed on the 3rd post-operative month. And these effects disappeared after 3 months. Fusion was associated with longer operative time, more intra-operative blood loss, longer hospital stay and more complications. Therefore, our findings do not support routine use of decompression with fusion in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

Hospital costs for elective lumbar degenerative fusion exceeded $10 billion in 2015, the highest total cost of any surgical procedure in the United States. Lumbar fusion surgery remains controversial for many indications. Previous RCT by Ghogawala et al in 2016and clinical guidelines, supported that spinal fusion may lead to better clinical outcomes than decompression alone for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Two previous well-designed RCTs, and a systematic reviewhave challenged the widespread use of fusion in the surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Whether fusion is needed is still a matter of debate. Many surgeons may consider slippage and dynamic instability at the level of spondylolisthesis to be better treated with fusion. Instability, or the degree of spondylolisthesis in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis may be aggravated by decompression alone. We incorporated recent RCTs, and real-world datain this study and found significant differences in clinical satisfaction rates between the two groups (OR, 0.57; [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.93]). However, findings from RCTs were inconsistent with that from cohort studies on clinical satisfaction. In our opinion, for patient-reported outcome measures such as clinical satisfaction, when the results are inconsistent, the results should be derived from RCTs. Therefore, the results tended to be that fusion had no effect on clinical satisfaction (derived from RCTs). And we conducted sensitivity analysis by eliminating low-quality and older studies, which was consistent with the results derived from RCTs. This result was consistent with one meta-analysisand previous RCTthat, relative to surgical decompression alone, decompression with fusion have no better clinical outcomes. However, another study suggested that fusion improves clinical satisfaction and reduces post-operative leg pain. The reason for this difference may be that they did not distinguish between comparative cohort studies and RCTs. In addition, more than two types of scoring systems were used to assess clinical satisfaction, so this conclusion should be cautiously interpreted. Although the fusion group exhibited better pain reduction in the short term, the difference was small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful. The results were consistent with latest RCTs.

### Surgeon recommendation and outcomes of decompression with vs without fusion in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis [^9dc6997e]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study alongside the NORDSTEN-DS trial of patients with degenerative single-level spondylolisthesis, surgical treatment in agreement with the surgeons' recommendations was not associated with improved patient-reported outcomes compared with treatment discordant with surgeons' recommendations. The results suggest that surgeons performing degenerative spondylolisthesis surgery could rely safely on evidence of operating with decompression alone, despite the conflict of expert opinion.

### Spinal stenosis: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^8d1fdcac]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar spinal stenosis is being diagnosed increasingly in older people as advanced imaging studies become more widely available and clinicians become more familiar with the presentation of this common condition. For symptomatic patients, the goal of treatment is pain relief and improved function, but there is little empiric evidence to support many of the common interventions used. The relative risks and benefits of various surgical and nonsurgical treatments are poorly understood, and the result has been wide variations in the evaluation and treatment of spinal stenosis across geographic regions. Current practice recommendations are based on expert opinion that incorporates available evidence into existing clinical and biologic paradigms. For most individuals, initial treatment should focus on patient education, medications to control pain, and exercise and physical treatments to regain or maintain activities of daily living. Surgical treatment most commonly is considered in patients not improving with nonsurgical care. Decompressive laminectomy is the standard surgical procedure for patients with spinal stenosis. The addition of fusion with or without instrumentation is considered when spinal stenosis is accompanied by degenerative spondylolisthesis or related to concerns about instability. We review the available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical interventions, and highlight comparative results wherever applicable.

### Use of an expert panel for symptomatic patients with grade I degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: a randomized clinical trial [^5311dc57]. Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The appropriate utilization of lumbar fusion when performing laminectomy for lumbar spondylolisthesis is uncertain. The objective was to determine whether the use of a surgical expert review panel recommending fusion might improve patient selection, possibly reducing surgical failures.

Methods

Randomized clinical trial of patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar stenosis with spondylolisthesis enrolled from 14 North American hospitals was conducted with patients randomized to receive an expert panel review of their case or not. Spinal expert review consisted of 10 to 15 surgeons' review of patient images and clinical data with voting on the appropriateness of fusion. Primary outcome was the percentage of patients who failed to improve their 1-year EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) score. Secondary analysis focused on whether a supermajority (> 80% consensus) of spinal experts recommending fusion might reduce operative failures. The trial (SLIP II) was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03570801).

Results

Between November 1, 2017, and June 30, 2022, 663 patients were randomized (mean age 65.6 years; [59.6%] female) and 523 of 574 patients (91%; who had surgery) were included in the 1-year analysis. Final follow-up was on March 5, 2024. Among the 523 patients, 270 underwent review and 253 had no review. The overall surgical failure rate (using EQ-5D) did not differ between the review groups, 16.7% vs 17.4% (no review: difference 0.7%; 95% CI, -8% to 6%; P = 0.92). However, with supermajority recommending fusion, the proportion of patients who failed to improve EQ-5D score after surgery was 8.4% (review group) vs 18.4% (nonreview group: difference 10%; 95% CI, 2%-18%; P = 0.03). Supermajority recommendation for fusion was associated with 0.296 vs 0.240 EQ-5D change in the nonreview group (difference 0.056, 95% CI, 0.002–0.108; P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Among patients with grade I degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, an expert panel review with a supermajority favoring fusion was associated with a greater improvement in health-related quality of life and fewer surgical failures.

### SLIP II registry: spinal laminectomy versus instrumented pedicle screw fusion (SLIPII) [^9835fbe9]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview The purpose of the project is to perform an RCT comparing patient satisfaction and outcome with or without the use of an expert panel. The purpose is also to create a registry to compare the effectiveness of decompression alone versus decompression with fusion for patients with degenerative grade I spondylolisthesis and symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Primary analysis will focus on the patients' improvement from baseline patient-reported outcome questionnaires. Aim: To conduct a randomized control trial comparing patient outcomes and satisfaction with or without expert panel review before making a final decision about surgery for grade I degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. A prospective, multi-center registry aimed at addressing important issues pertaining to outcomes from treatment for degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis will also be generated.

Background: Surgery may be offered to patients with symptomatic lumbar stenosis with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis who fail nonoperative treatment measures including physical therapy and epidural steroid injections. For patients with lumbar stenosis without spondylolisthesis, a decompression alone is typical, while those patients who do have degenerative spondylolisthesis and who also have significant mechanical back pain may be offered lumbar decompression with or without fusion. The Spinal Laminectomy versus Instrumented Pedicle Screw trial provides level I evidence for the efficacy of fusion to improve clinical outcomes and lower reoperation rates compared to a standard laminectomy and medial facetectomy over a four year time frame in patients with neurogenic claudication associated with stable single level spondylolisthesis.

Conversely, the Swedish study provides level II evidence that the addition of a variety of fusion techniques does not have significant benefit in the first two years following operation compared to a variety of decompression techniques in a heterogeneous population of patients with stenosis associated with spondylolisthesis. The patient populations treated, surgical techniques used, and outcome measures assessed differed between the two studies and when taken together, underline the need to new comparative effectiveness data for patients with this problem. For patients who are randomized to no expert panel review, they will discuss with their surgeon the best surgical option for them and proceed as they would in standard of care. Patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis and single level degenerative grade I spondylolisthesis will be treated either with decompression or decompression with fusion.

### Harmonized outcome measures for use in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis patient registries and clinical practice [^0434cfc7]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The development of new treatment approaches for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) has introduced many questions about comparative effectiveness and long-term outcomes. Patient registries collect robust, longitudinal data that could be combined or aggregated to form a national and potentially international research data infrastructure to address these and other research questions. However, linking data across registries is challenging because registries typically define and capture different outcome measures. Variation in outcome measures occurs in clinical practice and other types of research studies as well, limiting the utility of existing data sources for addressing new research questions. The purpose of this project was to develop a minimum set of patient- and clinician-relevant standardized outcome measures that are feasible for collection in DLS registries and clinical practice.

Methods

Nineteen DLS registries, observational studies, and quality improvement efforts were invited to participate and submit outcome measures. A stakeholder panel was organized that included representatives from medical specialty societies, health systems, government agencies, payers, industries, health information technology organizations, and patient advocacy groups. The panel categorized the measures using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Outcome Measures Framework (OMF), identified a minimum set of outcome measures, and developed standardized definitions through a consensus-based process.

Results

The panel identified and harmonized 57 outcome measures into a minimum set of 10 core outcome measure areas and 6 supplemental outcome measure areas. The measures are organized into the OMF categories of survival, clinical response, events of interest, patient-reported outcomes, and resource utilization.

Conclusions

This effort identified a minimum set of standardized measures that are relevant to patients and clinicians and appropriate for use in DLS registries, other research efforts, and clinical practice. Collection of these measures across registries and clinical practice is an important step for building research data infrastructure, creating learning healthcare systems, and improving patient management and outcomes in DLS.

### Decompression alone or decompression and fusion in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^60fe69ea]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This study had some strengths. First, this meta-analysis was performed by a professional team including a Cochrane member. Second, analyses were refined on a Patient, Intervention, Control, Outcomes, and Study design (PICOS principle). Third, our study incorporated RCTs and real-world data. However, there were some inevitable limitations in our study. First, not all of the included studies were RCTs. Real-world evidence was a useful addition. But the beliefs among surgeons may influence patient expectation and interpretation of results, so the real-world evidence may be more biased. In order to explore the bias, we conducted subgroup analyses based on study designs. Moreover, expertise of surgeons, surgical methods and inclusion/exclusion criteria in the studies included may be a potential source of heterogeneity. Then, instrumented and non-instrumented fusions were included in the fusion group. Instrumented fusions might be with higher complication rates than non-instrumented fusions which are often used to stabilize instability. In addition, the studies often use different definitions, different tools and different follow-up to measure outcomes like pain, complications that creates heterogeneity and biases. There is an urgent need to formulate a standard evaluation plan to measure outcomes.

This meta-analysis provides insights into evidence-based medicine currently approved by the Cochrane Collaboration. Our findings do not support routine applications of decompression with fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis. treatment strategies and indications for surgery [^926e9011]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Initially, all patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis should be treated conservatively. Rapid deterioration is unlikely. The majority of patients may either improve or remain stable over a long-term follow-up with nonoperative treatment. Surgery should be an elective decision by the patients who fail to improve after conservative treatment. Medical evaluation is mandatory in those elderly patients with frequent comorbidities. For central spinal stenosis, without significant grade I spondylolisthesis or deformity, decompression is the surgical treatment of choice. Iatrogenic instability must be avoided during decompression surgery by preserving the facet joint and the pars interarticularis. Limited decompression with laminotomy may be indicated for lateral canal stenosis. A limited decompression may avoid postoperative instability but is associated with more frequent neurologic sequelae. Postlaminectomy instability is uncommon, and too little decompression is a more frequent mistake than too much. Decompression is usually associated with good or excellent outcome in 80% of patients. Deterioration of initial post-operative improvement may occur over long-term follow-up. When spinal stenosis is associated with instability, degenerative spondylolisthesis, deformity, postoperative instability, or recurrent stenosis, fusion is often recommended. Instrumentation often improves the fusion rate but does not influence the clinical outcome. Generous decompression but selective fusion of the unstable segment only are preferable for degenerative spondylolisthesis and type I degenerative scoliosis with minimal rotation of the spine.

### Decompression alone or decompression with fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis: a randomized clinical trial with two-year MRI follow-up [^9ef920a5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

In this RCT of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, new stenosis on two-year MRI was less common after decompression alone than after decompression and fusion, even for patients with a preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis. Adding fusion seems to worsen the radiological outcome by increasing adjacent level stenosis more than it prevents same-level restenosis. Our results support decompression without fusion as the surgical treatment of choice for lumbar spinal stenosis, even for patients with a degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Take home message

- This randomized clinical trial provides the first published two-year MRI follow-up after surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis.

- Patients who had a fusion had a significantly higher rate of new stenosis on two-year MRI, even when a preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis was present.

- These findings provide support for the argument that decompression without fusion is the surgical treatment of choice for lumbar spinal stenosis, even for patients with a degenerative spondylolisthesis.

### Decompression alone or with fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (nordsten-DS): five year follow-up of a randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority trial [^b6e3c2dc]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) was published by Eric Loratang Kgomotso and colleagues in 2024 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: Low back pain and Spondylolisthesis. In the Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) study, the trial question was: is decompression surgery noninferior to decompression with additional instrumented fusion in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis? In the Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) study, the population was: 262 patients (180 female, 82 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–80 years with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis and a spondylolisthesis ≥ 3 mm at the stenotic level. The key exclusion criteria were age > 80 years; ASA Classification > 3; cauda equina syndrome; slip ≥ 3 mm in more than 1 level; isthmic defect in pars interarticularis; fracture or former fusion of the thoracolumbar region; previous surgery in the level of spondylolisthesis. In the Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 133 decompression alone (surgery with decompression preserving the posterior midline) n = 129 decompression and instrumented fusion (posterior decompression followed by implantation of pedicle screws with rods and bone grafting across the level of spondylolisthesis and optional use of an intervertebral fusion device). In the Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in ≥ 30% reduction in Oswestry disability index at 5 years (63% vs. 63%; AD 0.4%, 95% CI -11.2 to 11.9). In the Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean reduction in Oswestry disability index at 5 years (-17.8 points vs. -17.8 points; MD -0.02, 95% CI -3.85 to 3.8) No significant difference in reduction in mean Zurich Claudication Questionnaire symptom severity (-1.06 points vs. -0.99 points; MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.13) No significant difference in mean reduction in NRS leg pain (-3.52 points vs. -2.93 points; MD -0.59, 95% CI -1.36 to 0.18). In the Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events and subsequent lumbar surgery. In the Nordsten-DS (5-year follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–80 years with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis and a spondylolisthesis ≥ 3 mm at the stenotic level, decompression alone was noninferior to decompression and instrumented fusion with respect to ≥ 30% reduction in Oswestry disability index at 5 years.

### Predictors of postoperative complications after surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis [^fe058b1c]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis (LSSDS) is a relatively common adult degenerative spinal condition. LSSDS can result in a variety of symptoms, including axial back pain, radicular leg pain, and neurogenic claudicatory pain. It has been established that patients undergoing surgical treatment for LSSDS showed substantially greater improvement in pain and function over a period of 2 years than those treated nonsurgically. In addition, favorable 30-day outcomes for surgical treatment of LSSDS have been demonstrated across multiple studies. Despite these findings, debate over the optimal surgical intervention remains. A seminal 1995 article by Herkowitz and Sidhuconcluded that the addition of fusion to decompression is the near-consensus optimal surgical treatment for LSSDS. To this point, various studies demonstrated that patients undergoing decompression with concurrent arthrodesis had better relief of pain in the back and lower limbs, less chance of vertebral slip progression, less chance of recurrent stenosis, and better overall clinical outcomes. Given this body of evidence, the use of decompression with concomitant fusion has proliferated in the treatment of LSSDS, resulting in a reduction in the rate of decompression alone from 12% in 1999 to 4% in 2011. Despite these trends, a series of recent findings suggest that decompression alone may remain a viable alternative in the surgical treatment of LSSDS. In the Spinal Laminectomy versus Instrumented Pedicle Screw trial, grade I DS patients with stable spondylolisthesis undergoing decompression and fusion had a greater increase in Short Form Health Survey physical component scores after 2, 3, and 4 years, but no significant improvement in the Oswestry Disability Index score after 2 years compared with the decompression alone group. The primary aim of this study was to determine the predictors of 30-day postoperative complications for surgical treatment of LSSDS in patients undergoing decompression and fusion or decompression alone.
