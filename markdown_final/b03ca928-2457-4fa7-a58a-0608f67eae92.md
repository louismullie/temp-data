## Question

At what age can children transition to forward-facing car seats?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a child should transition from a rear-facing car seat to a forward-facing car seat, and how to apply the current evidence-based guidance in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, up-to-date recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Then, I should verify the safety rationale and crash data supporting rear-facing as long as possible. Next, I will translate the "as long as possible" principle into concrete, seat-specific criteria. After that, I should review common misconceptions and real-world adherence gaps. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, actionable answer and counseling points, making sure I double-check for any exceptions or special circumstances that might modify the plan.

> Let me first confirm the current standard of care. The 2018 AAP policy states that children should remain rear-facing as long as possible, and only transition to forward-facing once they outgrow the height or weight limits of their rear-facing convertible seat, with most children remaining rear-facing beyond 2 years and many through age 4, depending on the seat's specifications [^116LW36m]. Wait, let me verify the earlier guidance to ensure I'm not conflating versions; the 2011 AAP policy explicitly recommended rear-facing until at least age 2, which the 2018 update refined to "as long as possible" to maximize protection, so the direction is consistent but the 2018 version is more precise and current [^112vRiXg] [^116LW36m].

> I need to check the safety rationale underpinning this recommendation. Rear-facing restraints distribute crash forces over the entire back, head, and neck, reducing spinal load and injury risk, especially in frontal and side impacts. Observational crash data show a 9% reduction in overall injury odds for rear-facing versus forward-facing among 0–4 year olds, with even larger risk reductions in side impacts and for 1-year-olds specifically, which aligns with biomechanical expectations [^116Ut7vo] [^113KMVyC]. Hold on, I should verify consistency across datasets. Multiple analyses converge on the same conclusion that rear-facing is safer for young children, reinforcing the AAP's "as long as possible" stance [^116Ut7vo] [^113KMVyC].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize "as long as possible" in practice. The transition trigger is seat-specific: when the child reaches either the rear-facing height limit (often when the head is within 1 inch of the top of the shell) or the rear-facing weight limit for that convertible seat, then — and only then — should the seat be turned forward-facing; many modern convertible seats accommodate rear-facing to 40–50 pounds and tall torso heights, which commonly allows children to remain rear-facing until 3–4 years or older [^116LW36m]. I should double-check that this aligns with counseling guidance; yes, anticipatory guidance emphasizes delaying transitions because each step to a less protective system carries incremental risk [^116LW36m].

> But wait, what about real-world adherence and common misconceptions. I need to ensure I address the gap between guidance and practice. Surveys show many parents still turn children forward before age 2, often citing leg discomfort or perceived "readiness", yet these are not safety-based reasons; clinician counseling and awareness of AAP recommendations measurably increase rear-facing duration, and observed rear-facing use among toddlers improved over time but remains suboptimal, underscoring the need for repeated, clear counseling at every visit [^114wzYRH] [^114ntLeb] [^116WwJfE]. Hold on, I should verify whether education interventions move the needle; yes, both ED-based and community programs improve knowledge and appropriate restraint use, though sustained behavior change often requires multimodal approaches [^112h66Uh] [^111PskpU].

> I will now examine special circumstances that might modify the plan. For children with special health care needs or those in spica casts, individualized solutions are required; conventional rear-facing seats may still be appropriate and sometimes outperform spica-specific devices in crash testing, so a CPST with special-needs training should guide seat selection and installation rather than prematurely transitioning forward-facing or to a booster [^113UfaFH] [^114BmULS]. Let me reconsider preterm or low-birth-weight infants; they may require a car bed initially and transition to a rear-facing seat only after demonstrating cardiorespiratory stability, reinforcing that the overarching principle remains "use the most protective, correctly fitted restraint for the child's current size and medical status" [^1136fVRV] [^115kkYHX].

> Next, I should review the forward-facing phase itself to avoid premature graduation. Once transitioned, children should remain in a forward-facing harness seat until they reach the harness system's height and weight limits, which for most seats extends to about 65 pounds and often through at least age 4, with many children able to remain harnessed longer; booster seats follow only after the harness is outgrown, again delaying transitions to preserve protection [^116LW36m]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating a minimum; the AAP explicitly says "through at least 4 years" for forward-facing, but many children will remain harnessed well beyond that based on seat limits, which is encouraged [^116LW36m].

> Let me synthesize the clinical answer clearly. Children should stay rear-facing until they reach the height or weight limit of their rear-facing convertible seat, which for most children means beyond age 2 and frequently until 3–4 years or older; only then should they transition to a forward-facing harness seat, and they should remain harnessed until they outgrow that seat's limits before moving to a booster [^116LW36m]. I should confirm that this aligns with both the evidence and counseling language; yes, the AAP's "as long as possible" framing, supported by crash data and seat engineering, provides a coherent, size-based pathway that maximizes safety while acknowledging variability in child growth and seat specifications [^116LW36m] [^116Ut7vo].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling is actionable. I should advise caregivers to check the car seat manual for exact rear-facing limits, verify that the child's head remains at least 1 inch below the top of the shell, and schedule a check with a certified child passenger safety technician if they are unsure. I should also remind them that every transition reduces protection, so delaying forward-facing and then delaying booster graduation are both safety-enhancing strategies, and that all children under 13 should ride in the back seat [^116LW36m]. Hold on, I should verify that these steps are consistent with best-practice anticipatory guidance. Yes, routine CPS counseling at well visits and referral to inspection stations are core elements of injury prevention counseling and improve real-world restraint use [^116LW36m] [^1119bfiw].

Children should remain **rear-facing as long as possible** [^116LW36m] until they reach the **height or weight limit** of their rear-facing car seat, typically around age 2–4 years [^116LW36m]. Transition to **forward-facing** only when the child exceeds the rear-facing limits, and continue using a forward-facing seat with a harness until at least age 4, or until they reach the seat's height or weight limit. Early forward-facing increases injury risk [^116Ut7vo]; delay the transition as long as the seat allows [^116LW36m].

---

## Current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)

The AAP provides **clear guidance** on when children should transition from rear-facing to forward-facing car seats:

- **Rear-facing car seats**: Children should remain in rear-facing car seats as long as possible, until they reach the maximum height or weight limit allowed by the car seat manufacturer [^116LW36m]. This typically occurs around age 2–4 years, but can vary depending on the child's growth and the specific car seat model [^notfound].

- **Forward-facing car seats**: Once children outgrow the rear-facing car seat, they should transition to a forward-facing car seat with a harness. Children should continue to use forward-facing car seats until they reach the maximum height or weight limit allowed by the car seat manufacturer, typically around age 4 years or older [^116LW36m].

- **Booster seats**: After outgrowing the forward-facing car seat, children should transition to a booster seat until they are big enough to fit properly in a seat belt, typically when they reach 4 feet 9 inches (145 cm) in height and are between 8–12 years old [^11789AYu].

## Evidence supporting rear-facing car seats

Extensive research demonstrates that rear-facing car seats **significantly reduce the risk of injury** [^116Ut7vo] in young children. Key findings include:

- **Reduced injury risk**: Rear-facing car seats reduce the risk of injury by approximately 75% compared to forward-facing seats for children under 2 years old [^notfound].

- **Protection of head, neck, and spine**: Rear-facing seats provide superior protection for the head, neck, and spine, which are particularly vulnerable in young children due to their anatomical development [^notfound].

- **Effectiveness in crashes**: Rear-facing seats are effective in various crash scenarios, including frontal, side, and rear impacts [^113KMVyC].

---

## Risks associated with early transition to forward-facing seats

Transitioning too early to forward-facing seats **increases the risk of injury** [^116Ut7vo] for young children. Specific risks include:

- **Increased risk of head and neck injuries**: Forward-facing seats expose children to higher risks of head, neck, and spinal injuries due to the forward motion during crashes [^notfound].

- **Higher injury severity**: Children in forward-facing seats are more likely to sustain severe injuries, including head injuries and cervical spine injuries, compared to those in rear-facing seats [^113KMVyC].

- **Reduced overall protection**: Forward-facing seats offer less overall protection for young children, particularly in side-impact crashes [^113KMVyC].

---

## Factors influencing the transition decision

Several factors **influence the decision** to transition from rear-facing to forward-facing car seats:

- **Child's height and weight**: The primary consideration is whether the child has reached the maximum height or weight limit specified by the car seat manufacturer [^117HJwcY].

- **Car seat manufacturer's guidelines**: Each car seat model has specific height and weight limits, and caregivers should strictly adhere to these guidelines [^116UdLKd].

- **Parental awareness and education**: Caregivers' knowledge of car seat safety recommendations significantly influences their decision-making regarding the transition [^114ntLeb].

---

## Common misconceptions and barriers

Despite clear recommendations, several **misconceptions and barriers** persist:

- **Parental misconceptions**: Many parents believe that children become uncomfortable or unsafe in rear-facing seats as they grow older, leading to premature transitions [^notfound].

- **Lack of awareness**: Many caregivers are unaware of the updated AAP guidelines recommending rear-facing seats for as long as possible [^116LW36m].

- **Legal requirements**: Some caregivers mistakenly believe that legal requirements align with best practices, leading to early transitions based on outdated laws [^notfound].

---

## Practical tips for caregivers

To ensure optimal safety, caregivers should **follow these practical tips**:

- **Check car seat manual**: Always refer to the car seat manufacturer's manual for specific height and weight limits [^116UdLKd].

- **Regularly monitor growth**: Keep track of the child's height and weight to determine when they are approaching the limits of their current car seat [^114kmfJo].

- **Seek professional guidance**: Consult certified child passenger safety technicians for proper installation and transition guidance [^1119bfiw].

- **Delay transition**: Keep children rear-facing for as long as possible, even beyond age 2, if they have not reached the car seat's height or weight limits [^116LW36m].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Car seat type** | **Recommended use** | **Transition criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Rear-facing car seat | - Birth to as long as possible <br/> - Typically 2–4 years | Child reaches maximum height or weight limit specified by manufacturer |
| Forward-facing car seat | - After rear-facing limits are exceeded <br/> - Typically 4 years and older | Child reaches maximum height or weight limit specified by manufacturer |
| Booster seat | - After forward-facing limits are exceeded <br/> - Typically 8–12 years | Child reaches 4 feet 9 inches (145 cm) and can properly fit in a seat belt |

---

Children should remain in rear-facing car seats **as long as possible**, until they reach the maximum height or weight limit allowed by the car seat manufacturer [^116LW36m]. This approach significantly reduces the risk of injury and provides optimal protection for young children. Caregivers should strictly adhere to manufacturer guidelines and delay the transition to forward-facing seats until absolutely necessary [^116LW36m].

### Parents' knowledge and socio-demographic determinants toward child's restraint system use [^1126RALc]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Legislation and law is a key in CRS use. The law and relative regulations for driving on the road concentrate on child protection in cars. For example, in Italy carrying children in trucks or vans is forbidden in Italy. The driver is responsible for children in cars. If the children aren't restrained properly, the driver is punished and has to pay a fine between 74 and 300 euros, also loses 5 points for his/her driving license. Then it is needed in Iran laws should be approved and implemented.

Despite the effectiveness of the CRS in preventing injuries, sometimes it is installed incorrectly, as was the case for 21 children (15.8%) under 2 in this study. In a study conducted in Italy, the rate of CRS use was 92%, but more than 30% of them were installed improperly. In the United States, the rate of correct CRS use was reported to be 17% for school-aged children and 72% for infants. In Turkey, the total use of CRS was 20%, and the rate of correct use was 10%. Incorrect installation of CRS can be due to the parent's insufficient information about it. It may be necessary to provide training in educational programs on how to install CRS properly. At the other hand cars are needed to be equipped with at least two seating positions with ISOFIX, of which at least 2 need to be equipped with Top Tether. The car manufacturer needs to check the available space for rear-facing ISOFIX CRS, forward-facing CRS, and booster seat fixtures.

### Critical gaps in child passenger safety practices, surveillance, and legislation: Georgia, 2001 [^117E3gqF]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of death among US children 1 year of age and older. Although age-appropriate child passenger restraint use and back seating position are effective injury prevention strategies, many children 12 years of age and younger ride inappropriately restrained and seated in the front seat. In Georgia and in most states, surveillance of child passenger restraint use is less than optimal. Although child safety seat legislation is 1 of the most effective mechanisms for increasing correct restraint use and back seating position, Georgia's child occupant restraint law, like the laws in most states, falls short of practices recommended by government and child advocacy safety groups. The objective of this study was to document child passenger restraint use and seating position among children aged 0 to 12 years in Georgia and to use these study results to evaluate the efficacy of Georgia's child restraint surveillance and legislation.

Methods

In May and June 2001, police roadblocks were used to collect information about child passenger age, restraint use, and seating position.

Results

Data were collected on 1858 children who were riding in 1221 vehicles in 24 different Georgia counties. Results showed that 56% of children were inappropriately restrained and/or in the front seat. The most problematic age groups included infants who were in forward-facing child safety seats (28%) and/or in the front seat (22%); children who were 5 to 8 years of age in car seat belts alone (88%), rather than age- and size-appropriate child safety seats (6%); and children who were 9 to 12 years of age and riding in the front seat (39%). We compared our results with the existing Georgia passenger restraint surveillance system and found that it would have missed 77% of the children in our study who were inappropriately restrained and/or riding in the front seat. In a similar comparison, Georgia's restraint law did not cover over 74% of the children in our study who were riding at risk.

Conclusion

The results of this study highlight 3 important areas for improving child passenger safety: targeted interventions to promote booster seat use and riding in the back seat, expanded child passenger restraint and seating position surveillance, and expanded legislation to mandate booster seat use and back seating position.

### Multimodal intervention and child passenger safety guideline adherence in young children: a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized clinical trial [^1156FzNH]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Randomization Sequence

Random allocation sequences were generated by study biostatistician (J.G.) and programmed into the study dashboard. Initial randomization was stratified by (1) recommended CRS (rear-facing, forward-facing, or booster seat) and (2) eligibility reason (not guideline adherent or planning premature transition) in blocks of 4 to 8 in a 3:1 ratio to TCBD/ABCB or EUC. We randomized 3:1 at baseline to ensure sufficient sample size for phase 2 rerandomization. Initial allocation was revealed in the study dashboard after participants completed baseline surveys. The 3:1 balance was altered by screen failures and creation of generic EUC profiles for access to the web-application after study completion. Rerandomization of caregivers who were exposed to basic TCBD/ABCB and were nonadherent at 6 months occurred in phase 2 at a 1:1 ratio to high- or low-intensity intervention. Rerandomization was revealed in the study dashboard after the RC categorized 6-month behaviors.

Blinding

Caregivers, RCs, and counselors engaged in MI sessions and could not be blinded to group assignment. The determination of guideline adherence was blinded by using a file that did not contain randomization group information.

### Effects of seating position and appropriate restraint use on the risk of injury to children in motor vehicle crashes [^117Q8fHY]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, many states are upgrading their child restraint laws to include provisions for the use of age-appropriate restraints through 6 to 8 years of age, with some also requiring rear seating for children, enabling the laws to be in closer alignment with best-practice recommendations.

Objective

To evaluate the relationships of seating position and restraint status to the risk of injury among children in passenger vehicle crashes.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of children < 16 years of age who were involved in crashes of insured vehicles in 15 states, with data collected via insurance claims records and a telephone survey. A probability sample of 17980 children in 11506 crashes, representing 229106 children in 146613 crashes, was collected between December 1, 1998, and November 30, 2002. Parent reports were used to define restraint status, seating position, and occurrence of clinically significant injuries, with the use of a previously validated instrument.

Results

Approximately 62% of the children used seat belts, 35% used child restraints, and 3% used no restraint. Nearly 4 of 5 children sat in the rear seat, with one half of all children being restrained appropriately for their age in the rear, although this varied according to the age of the child. Overall, 1.6% of children suffered serious injuries, 13.5% had minor injuries, and 84.9% did not have any injury. Unrestrained children in the front were at the highest risk of injury and appropriately restrained children in the rear were at the lowest risk, for all age groups. Inappropriately restrained children were at nearly twice the risk of injury, compared with appropriately restrained children (odds ratio [OR]: 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4–2.3), whereas unrestrained children were at > 3 times the risk (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 2.5–4.1). The effect of seating row was smaller than the effect of restraint status; children in the front seat were at 40% greater risk of injury, compared with children in the rear seat (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2–1.7). Had all children in the study population been appropriately restrained in the rear seat, 1014 serious injuries (95% CI: 675–1353 injuries) would have been prevented (with the assumption that restraint effectiveness does not depend on a variety of other driver-related, child-related, crash-related, vehicle-related, and environmental factors).

Conclusions

Age-appropriate restraint confers relatively more safety benefit than rear seating, but the 2 work synergistically to provide the best protection for children in crashes. These results support the current focus on age-appropriate restraint in recently upgraded state child restraint laws. However, it is important to note that considerable added benefit would be realized with additional requirements for rear seating.

### Vital signs: restraint use and motor vehicle occupant death rates among children aged 0–12 years-United States, 2002–2011 [^114i3hFS]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Since 2002, a majority of states have increased the required age for CSS/booster seat use. However, in 2013, 12 states had child passenger restraint laws that required CSS/booster seat use by children aged ≤ 5 years; 36 states and the District of Columbia had laws requiring CSS/booster seats use by children through either age 6 or 7 years; and two states (Tennessee and Wyoming) had laws requiring CSS/booster seat use by children through at least age 8 years. As a result, in 2013, only 2% of children in the United States lived in states with a child passenger restraint law that required CSS/booster seat use by children through at least age 8 years (Figure 3).

Motor vehicle traffic death rates for children are higher in the United States than in other high income countries. In 2011, motor vehicle traffic death rates among children aged ≤ 14 years were below the U.S. rate (1.9 deaths per 100,000 population) in the United Kingdom (0.5), Sweden (0.6), Italy (0.7), Germany (0.8), Norway (0.9), and Canada (1.1). Notably, the child motor vehicle occupant death rate per 100,000 population in the United States is more than double that of 22 selected high-income European countries combined (1.9 versus 0.9 per 100,000 population, respectively).

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, Fatality Analysis Reporting System data are extracted from police reports of motor vehicle crashes and death certificates rather than self reports; therefore, some racial/ethnic misclassification is likely. Additionally, 13% of deaths (n = 182) from 2009–2010 had unknown race/ethnicity and were excluded from racial stratification analyses. Second, the reported proportions of unrestrained child deaths are likely underestimates; the proportion of deaths that had unknown restraint use ranged from a low of 7% in 2007 to a high of 29% in 2010. Finally, other factors, such as safer cars, safer child safety/booster seats, and the economy, might have contributed to the decrease in child motor vehicle occupant death rates. This study was not able to account for changes in these factors.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of hands-on versus online education in child passenger safety [^116u455b]. Injury Prevention (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Community paediatricians' knowledge of appropriate child safety seat (CSS) use in vehicles may be inadequate. We compared the effectiveness of hands-on and online education in improving and retaining child passenger safety (CPS) knowledge and skills among paediatric trainees.

Methods

Paediatric trainees were randomised to receive hands-on skills training versus a 1-hour online module in CPS. CSS knowledge and installation skills were assessed using a validated 10-item/point questionnaire and an assessment tool respectively at baseline and after 6 months. Preintervention and postintervention knowledge improvement and CSS installation skills between groups were assessed using paired t-tests and effect size (d).

Results

Forty-eight students agreed to participate and were randomised. Thirty-nine completed training (hands-on: 23 and online: 15). At entry, no significant differences in learners' demographics and prior CPS education existed. Baseline CPS knowledge scores did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.26). Postintervention, both groups demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge scores (hands-on = 3.1 (95% CI 2.4 to 3.7), p < 0.0001; online = 2.6 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.3), p < 0.0001), though the pre-post gain in knowledge scores were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.35). At follow-up, both groups demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge scores (hands-on = 1.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.4), p < 0.0001; online = 1.1 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.6), p < 0.0001) with the hands-on group scores significantly better than the online group (p < 0.02). The long-term gain in knowledge scores was not significantly different between groups (p = 0.12). Baseline CSS installation skill scores did not significantly differ between groups for forward-facing seats (p = 0.16) and rear-facing seats (p = 0.51). At follow-up, mean CSS installation skill scores significantly increased for the hands-on group (forward-facing seat: 0.8 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.44), p < 0.02; rear-facing seat: 1.2 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.7), p < 0.001) but not for the online group (forward-facing seat: 0.9 (95% CI -0.08 to 1.9), p = 0.07); rear-facing seat: -0.2 (95% CI -1.1 to 0.7), p = 0.6).

Conclusions

Among paediatric trainees, hands-on and online CPS education are both effective in improving long-term CPS knowledge. Long-term installation skills for forward-facing and rear-facing CSS persist for hands-on education but are inconclusive for online education.

### Parents' knowledge and socio-demographic determinants toward child's restraint system use [^111GFNbB]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The mean age of the participants was 33.24 ± 7.11 years, and most of them were in the 28–37-year age group. About half of the participants (55.3%, n = 387) were women, and the majority of them had a child under 10 years of age. Most of the time, the father was driving, and half of the participants had a damaging crash in the last two years (50.7%). More information about the participants' demographic characteristics is given in Table 1.

Table 1
Demographic characteristics of the participants

Of the 700 observed cars with child passengers, 328 (46.9%) of the children were boys and 372 (53.1%) were girls. There were 133 (19.0%) children under 2, of whom only six (4.5%) children had CSS installed in the back seat and used it correctly. For 21 (15.8%) children, the CSS was installed in the back seat of the car but incorrectly. There were 261 children (37.3%) aged 2–4 years, of whom 44 (16.9%) children had the CSS installed in the back seat and used it correctly. Of 306 (43.7%) children over 4, two (0.6%) children had a booster installed in the back seat and used it. Overall, the safe behavior of CRS use was 6 (4.5%) among children aged under 2 years, was 44 (16.9%) among children aged 2–4 years, and was 0.6% among children aged over four years. Moreover, 229 children (32.7%) wore seat belts. More information on the frequency of CRS based on age is given in Table 2. The most important reasons for non-use of CRS were: a lack of laws and policies (59.7%), lack of knowledge (59.6%), the high cost of CRS (57.6%), the unwillingness of the child to sit in the CRS (46.4%), and needing a lot of time to restrain the child to the CRS (37.9%), respectively. A chi-square test was performed to assess the relationship between the parents' demographic variables and child seat use. Based on Table 3, there was a significant relationship between parents' knowledge of the benefits of CRS and its use (p < 0.001). There was also a significant relationship between the socioeconomic status of the household and the use of CRS (p < 0.001(. The findings showed that female drivers were more likely to use CRS (p < 0.001). However, there was no relationship between the driver's seat belt use and CRS use (p > 0.05). The results of the regression analysis showed that the most important predictors of CRS non-use are the child's age, parental knowledge, and the socioeconomic status of the household (Table 4).

### Explaining barriers and challenges to child safety during driving from parents' perspectives: a qualitative content analysis [^1154eSDo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Financial capability

The cost of purchasing a child seat can affect parents' access to child seats. Some parents cited the high cost of safety equipment and financial difficulties as the reason for not providing child seats and safety devices in vehicles. Some parents suggested providing free or low-cost child safety seats at the time of vehicle purchase. In this regard, parents say:

"Parents may not provide safety equipment for children for various reasons like ignorance, poverty, low income, unemployment or high prices of special child safety devices in cars" (Parent 20).

Vehicle safety and quality

A vehicle is typically a complex assembly of various parts working together, and the performance of each of these parts affects the vehicle's functionality and safety. Some parents pointed out that initial safety features and new modifications should be added to vehicle designs to better protect children, and more protection should be provided for children. Issues such as multi-functional safety devices - smart and advanced vehicles - child door locks - installing child seat belts in vehicles - using advanced and smart technology. In this regard, parents say:

"Child locks are installed in vehicles in a way that when you activate the child lock, the door cannot be opened from inside but can be opened from outside. I always use the child lock but am still worried the door may open at any moment" (Parent 11).

"In any case, we pay a cost for the vehicle when purchasing it. Safety equipment should be available inside vehicles from the beginning, and the cost of safety equipment is determined as part of the initial costs by companies, people generally do not have a problem paying the vehicle safety costs along with other costs at the time of purchasing the vehicle from the factory" (Parent 4).

### Frontal crash injury metrics are below mandated limits for a spica casted child dummy in currently available restraints [^112sP3iD]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a paucity of data defining safe transport protocols for children treated with hip spica casting. Although restraint devices for casted children are available, all federally mandated testing uses a noncasted anthropomorphic test device (ATD or crash dummy). The purpose of this study was to evaluate current restraint options in simulated frontal crash testing using a casted pediatric ATD to determine injury risk to the head, cervical spine, chest, and pelvis.

Methods

Using a 3-year-old ATD, dynamic crash sled tests simulating frontal crash were performed in accordance with government safety standards. The ATD was casted in a double-leg spica and the following restraint devices were tested: a seat designed for spica casted children, a restraint vest-harness, a traditional booster seat, and 2 traditional forward-facing car seats.

Results

Although the presence of the cast increased many of the injury metrics measured, all seats passed current federal guidelines for the head and chest. No single seat performed best in all metrics. The greatest magnitude of neck loading and second-highest head injury criterion values were observed for the booster seat. The vest-harness produced the highest head injury criterion and the chest compression exceeded proposed federal limits.

Conclusions

The results suggest safe transport in commercially available seats is possible with the child properly restrained in a correctly fitting seat. However, parents should not assume a child restraint system is appropriate for use just based on fit as, for example, seats with harnesses outperformed an easy to fit booster seat.

Clinical Relevance

Each child and the position of the child's cast are unique and discharge planning involves consideration of safe transportation. Although this study suggests several seats used to transport spica casted children pass the federal head and chest injury prevention requirements, it is important to recognize that some children may still require emergency vehicle transport.

### Use of child booster seats in motor vehicles following a community campaign: a controlled trial [^115PVxrW]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Once children have outgrown car seats, booster seats protect from injury better than lap and shoulder belts alone. However, the majority of children aged 4 to 8 years use only an adult seat belt.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted community booster seat campaign in increasing observed booster seat use among child passengers in motor vehicles.

Design

Prospective, nonrandomized, controlled community intervention trial.

Setting and Participants

The campaign was initiated in 4 communities in the greater Seattle, Wash, area between January 2000 and March 2001. Eight communities in Portland, Ore, and Spokane, Wash, served as control sites. We observed 3609 booster-eligible children (those aged 4–8 years and weighing 18–36 kg [40–80 lb]).

Main Outcome Measure

Observed booster seat use 15 months after the start of the campaign.

Results

Before the campaign began, 13.3% of eligible children in the intervention communities and 17.3% in the control communities were using booster seats, adjusting for child age, driver seat belt use, and sex of driver. Fifteen months after the start of the campaign, adjusted booster seat use had increased to 26.1% in the intervention communities and 20.2% in the control communities (P = 0.008 for the difference in time trends between intervention and control communities).

Conclusion

These data suggest that a multifaceted community education campaign can significantly increase the use of child booster seats.

### Announcement: national child passenger safety week-September 17–23, 2017 [^1119bfiw]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

In 2017, National Child Passenger Safety Week is being observed during September 17–23. In the United States, motor vehicle–related injuries are a leading cause of death among children. In 2015, a total of 663 passenger-vehicle occupants aged ≤ 12 years died as a result of a crash, and nearly 132,000 were injured. Among the children who died in 2015, 35% were known to be unrestrained. To keep child passengers as safe as possible, drivers should use age- and size–appropriate restraints for all child passengers until adult seat belts fit properly (lap belts should lay across upper thighs, not abdomen, and shoulder belts should lay across the middle of the shoulder and chest, not the neck or face) and follow the American Academy of Pediatrics' child passenger safety recommendations. Children aged < 13 years should be properly restrained in the back seat.

As part of National Child Passenger Safety Week, September 23 has been designated "National Seat Check Saturday". On this day, drivers with children who ride in car seats or booster seats are encouraged to visit a child safety seat inspection station to have a certified technician inspect their car seat for proper installation and proper use, free of charge. Additional information and an inspection station locator are available from CDC atand the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at. Campaign promotional materials in English and Spanish are available at.

### Child passenger safety [^112vRiXg]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Child passenger safety has dramatically evolved over the past decade; however, motor vehicle crashes continue to be the leading cause of death of children 4 years and older. This policy statement provides 4 evidence-based recommendations for best practices in the choice of a child restraint system to optimize safety in passenger vehicles for children from birth through adolescence: (1) rear-facing car safety seats for most infants up to 2 years of age; (2) forward-facing car safety seats for most children through 4 years of age; (3) belt-positioning booster seats for most children through 8 years of age; and (4) lap-and-shoulder seat belts for all who have outgrown booster seats. In addition, a fifth evidence-based recommendation is for all children younger than 13 years to ride in the rear seats of vehicles. It is important to note that every transition is associated with some decrease in protection; therefore, parents should be encouraged to delay these transitions for as long as possible. These recommendations are presented in the form of an algorithm that is intended to facilitate implementation of the recommendations by pediatricians to their patients and families and should cover most situations that pediatricians will encounter in practice. The American Academy of Pediatrics urges all pediatricians to know and promote these recommendations as part of child passenger safety anticipatory guidance at every health-supervision visit.

### Multimodal intervention and child passenger safety guideline adherence in young children: a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized clinical trial [^113BnLSw]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Child restraint systems (CRS), including car seats and booster seats, are designed to protect child passengers until they are large enough, and developmentally mature enough, to effectively use adult seat belts. In 1996, the American Academy of Pediatrics first published child passenger safety guidelines. Their 2011 update, reaffirmed in 2018, emphasized size-based transitions through CRS stages. Child passenger laws, of varying strengths, are present nationally. American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines are promoted during well child examinationsand disseminated nationally through AdCouncil campaigns.

In 2022, 450 child passengers younger than 10 years were killed and approximately 80 000 were injured in motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) in the US. Despite CRS reducing crash-related injury and fatality by 45% to 90% in 2023, 14% of children aged 1 to 3 years and 45% of children aged 6 to 7 years were prematurely transitioned to less protective CRSs or traveled unrestrained.

To address pervasive suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors, that contribute to preventable MVC-related deaths and injuries, we created Tiny Cargo, Big Deal, Abróchame Bien, Cuídame Bien (TCBD/ABCB), a precision prevention intervention grounded in self-determination theory, and tested it using a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We hypothesized that caregivers randomized to basic TCBD/ABCB in phase 1 would be more likely to adopt guideline adherent child passenger safety behaviors than caregivers receiving enhanced usual care (EUC) and that a higher-intensity phase 2 intervention would be needed among caregivers who were nonadherent in phase 1.

### Child car safety: a parental survey at a tertiary care emergency treatment center in Greece [^115cqEsx]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to assess parental behavior in terms of child restraint systems (CRS) use under emergency conditions while driving to the hospital's outpatient settings as well as their routine child car safety (CCS) practices.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey of parents/caregivers transporting children 13 years or younger was conducted at the Emergency Treatment Center of a pediatric tertiary care center in Athens, Greece. Participants completed a questionnaire inquiring about the possession of CRS, and type and use of appropriate CRS while driving to the Emergency Treatment Center and under routine conditions. In addition, presence and type of parental education with regard to CCS and the use of seat belts among drivers were assessed.

Results

Of 444 participants, 51.4% children were carried restrained, although 48.6% were fastened in an improper seat for their age, in contrast with 23.7% who travel unrestrained on a daily basis. Forward-facing restraint seats were most popular, with 53.9% total use even in children younger than 2 years or older than 4 years, whereas booster seats (9.4%) and rear-facing restraint seats (18.2%) were inappropriately disfavored. Children younger than 4 years, male drivers, and drivers who had received information on CCS had higher odds of using CRS. The proportion of those had never been provided any CCS education was 38.5%.

Conclusions

Child restraint systems use was inappropriately low under routine conditions and declined even further under emergency circumstances. Most children younger than 2 years and older than 4 years traveled inappropriately restrained in a forward-facing restraint seat. Parents should be more intensively educated on child car safety seat and the proper CRS use.

### Rear-facing child safety seat effectiveness: evidence from motor vehicle crash data [^116Ut7vo]. Injury Prevention (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated their car safety seat (CSS) guidelines to recommend that children ride rear-facing as long as possible, yet evidence from observational studies on rear-facing CSS effectiveness is limited. This study estimated the association between rear-facing CSS use and injuries among children aged 0–4 years who were involved in motor vehicle crashes (MVCs).

Methods

This study analysed data on all MVCs involving children aged 0–4 years reported to the Kansas Department of Transportation from 2011 to 2020. Children who were in a rear-facing CSS were compared with children who rode in a forward-facing device. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.

Results

In unadjusted models, rear-facing CSS use was associated with a 14% reduction in the odds of suffering any injury versus riding in a forward-facing CSS (OR 0.860, 95% CI 0.805 to 0.919). In models adjusted for potential confounders, rear-facing CSS use was associated with a 9% reduction in the odds of any injury relative to riding forward-facing (OR 0.909, 95% CI 0.840 to 0.983). These estimates were driven by children seated in the back outboard positions. Rear-facing CSS use was also negatively associated with incapacitating/fatal injuries, but these estimates were imprecise.

Conclusions

Children aged 0–4 years are less likely to be injured in an MVC if they are restrained in a rear-as opposed to forward-facing CSS. These results are particularly relevant because a number of state CSS laws do not require children of any age to ride rear-facing.

### Explaining barriers and challenges to child safety during driving from parents' perspectives: a qualitative content analysis [^113WMBso]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Cognitive factors

Children have varying cognitive abilities at different ages. For example, younger children may not understand the dangers of unbuckling seat belts or standing in a moving vehicle. They may have trouble judging distances and speeds or get distracted by external stimuli like passing cars or roadside attractions, diverting their attention from safe behavior inside the car. Fear or anxiety related to driving can cause children to become nervous or agitated when getting in the car. In this regard, parents say:

"When a child is seated in the back of the car, due to the distance between the car and surrounding vehicles like bicycles and motorcycles on the roadside or vehicles approaching from the opposite direction, they cannot differentiate them. Also, due to their small stature, other drivers do not easily notice children exiting the car and can cause danger and crashes" (Parent 17).

"Because the children in the back were unbuckled, and due to the front vehicle's crash and my sudden braking, the children were thrown around inside the car - one child's head hit the car window and another hit the front seat. The children got scared and cried, and I had to calm them down (Parent 2)".

Education

The first and most essential step in prevention should be linked to "education". Based on statistics of registered child crashes in vehicles, educating and raising awareness in young children and parents is vitally important. Thus, safety education should be emphasized as the most important education in early childhood so children can live safely throughout life with this education. In this regard, parents say:

"I educated my child at home, and part was through school/preschool. I remember when my daughter was 3 in preschool, a theater group came demonstrating all rules through performance, like not sitting in front as a child or sticking hands/head out windows" (Parent 12).

Executive/management factors

Executive/management factors are organized into three sub-categories of prevention, compliance with laws, and policymaking.

### Determining the proportion of children too heavy for age-appropriate car seats in a practice-based research network [^117VHRS4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

more information is needed on how trends in childhood weight might influence legally compliant child safety seat (CSS) use.

Objective

to determine the proportion of child passengers who cannot comply with one state's CSS law because of weight.

Method

6 practices in a practice-based research network provided data on patient demographics, heights, and weights. The authors calculated percentages of children above age-appropriate CSS weight cutoffs (20, 40, and 80 pounds, respectively) for the cohort below 6 years.

Results

there were 717 participants below 6 years of age. Among all infants (< 12 months), 16.4% weighed > 20 pounds. Among children 12 months to < 6 years old, 20% weighed > 40 pounds. One weighed > 80 pounds. There were no significant differences among racial groups. There was wide variation among practices, but differences did not achieve statistical significance.

Conclusion

many children in this diverse cohort were too heavy to be compliant with the state CSS law.

### Assessment of caregiver-targeted interventions for use of motor vehicle passenger safety systems for children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PskpU]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The search and screening process are represented in Figure 1. Literature searches were conducted in PsycINFO and PubMed and restricted to studies published between January 1, 2004, and April 1, 2019. The search and screening process was completed between May 25, 2018, and April 1, 2019. Three searches were completed by 3 reviewers in each database, using the following search strings: (search 1) child passenger safety, (search 2) booster seat use, and (search 3) car seat use. In PsycINFO, searches were restricted to peer-reviewed articles with an age group criterion of childhood (birth to 12 years). In PubMed, searches were restricted to human species and an age group criterion of birth to 18 years. Any identified articles that were literature reviews or previous meta-analyses of CRS interventions were examined to ensure that all articles possible were found and included in this analysis. All search result references were downloaded and entered into an Excel (Microsoft Corp) file that included detailed information about the study's aims, participant population, findings, and a "relevancy" score determined by the reviewer (1 = extremely relevant, 2 = maybe relevant, and 3 = not at all relevant). A total of 1240 abstracts were found; however, after the initial review of abstracts for relevancy and duplicates, only 51 articles were determined to be relevant and were fully screened for inclusion in the analyses. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline.

### Results of an RCT in two pediatric emergency departments to evaluate the efficacy of an M-health educational app on car seat use [^112Py2ci]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The growing interest in incorporating prevention into emergency health care make it timely to examine the use of computer technology to efficiently deliver effective education in this setting.

Study Design

This RCT compared results from an intervention group (n = 367) that received child passenger safety information, to an attention-matched control (n = 375). A baseline survey and two follow-up surveys at 3 and 6 months were conducted.

Setting/Participants

Data were collected from June 2014 to September 2016 from a sample of parents with children aged 4–7 years recruited from a pediatric emergency department in an East Coast urban area and one in a Midwest semi-rural area.

Intervention

A theory-based, stage-tailored educational program, Safety in Seconds v2.0 TM, delivered on a mobile app.

Main Outcome Measures

Four car seat behaviors: (1) having the correct restraint for the child's age and weight; (2) having the child ride in the backseat all the time; (3) buckling up the child all the time; and (4) having the child's restraint inspected by a child passenger safety technician.

Results

At 3 months, adjusting for baseline behaviors and attrition, the odds of reporting the correct behavior by the intervention group relative to the control group was 2.07 (p < 0.01) for using the correct car seat; 2.37 (p < 0.05) times for having the child ride in the back seat; 1.04 (nonsignificant) for riding buckled up all the time; and 1.99 (p < 0.01) times for having the car seat inspected. At 6 months, there were statistically significant effects for reporting use of the correct car seat (OR = 1.84, p < 0.01) and having the car seat inspected (OR = 1.73, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Mobile apps hold promise for reaching large populations with individually tailored child passenger safety education.

### Selecting and using the most appropriate car safety seats for growing children: guidelines for counseling parents [^112eshy1]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the existence of laws in all 50 states requiring the use of car safety seats or child restraint devices for young children, more children are still killed as passengers in car crashes than from any other type of injury. Pediatricians and other health care professionals need to provide up-to-date, appropriate information for parents regarding car safety seat choices and proper use. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics is not a testing or standard-setting organization, this policy statement discusses the Academy's current recommendations based on the peer-reviewed literature available at the time of publication and sets forth some of the factors that parents should consider before selecting and using a car safety seat.

### Vital signs: restraint use and motor vehicle occupant death rates among children aged 0–12 years-United States, 2002–2011 [^11332ybb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death among children in the United States. Child safety seat (CSS) use reduces the risk for death to infants (aged < 1 year) by 71%; and to toddlers (aged 1–4 years) by 54% in passenger vehicles. Booster seat use reduces the risk for serious injury by 45% for children aged 4–8 years when compared with seat belt use alone. For older children and adults, seat belt use reduces the risk for death and serious injury by approximately half. Based on this evidence, CDC recommends using age- and size-appropriate child restraints (including CSS and booster seats) in the back seat until adult seat belts fit properly (i.e. when the lap belt lays across the upper thighs, not the stomach; and the shoulder belt lays across the shoulder and chest, not the neck or face), which normally occurs after a child is at least age 8 years or ≥ 57 inches (145 cm) tall. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends CSS laws and CSS distribution plus education programs based on strong evidence of their effectiveness for increasing restraint use and decreasing injuries and deaths to child passengers. Distribution plus education programs are also recommended in a more recent review for increasing restraint use. The purpose of this study was to explore data over the past decade on child motor vehicle occupant deaths, determine the proportion of unrestrained child deaths, and explore differences by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

### Safety seat and seat belt use among child motor vehicle occupants, cluj-napoca, Romania [^111QvZhX]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of seat belts and car seats for children are among the most effective interventions to reduce injury severity when a crash occurs. The use should be enforced in order to have an increase in wearing these restraints. Romania has the lowest rate of using seatbelts in the backseat, 16%. The purpose of the study is to describe the use of child safety restraints and compare it with existing standards of good practice.

Methods

An observational study on child safety restraint was conducted in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, between 2013 and 2014. Observational sites included 38 schools and kindergartens and three commercial areas, where drivers (n = 768) and child passengers (n = 892) were observed. Observations were conducted as vehicles parked or pulled to a stop and were followed by driver surveys on knowledge and attitudes towards restraint legislation and child safety behaviour as car occupants.

Results

The proportion of observed child motor vehicle occupants wearing some type of restraint was 67.4% (n = 601). The majority of children (82.6%) were in the back seat, and 14.2% of infants were in a rear-facing child seat. The proportion of restrained children declined with age, with children 5years old or younger being almost five times more likely to be properly restrained (OR 4.87, 95% CI 2.93 to 8.07) when compared with older children.

Conclusions

Although minimum legal requirements of child motor vehicle occupant safety were in place in Romania at the time of the study, the rates of using children restraints was low compared with other middle-income and high-income countries.

### Well-child visits for infants and young children [^117HJwcY]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The well-child visit allows for comprehensive assessment of a child and the opportunity for further evaluation if abnormalities are detected. A complete history during the well-child visit includes information about birth history; prior screenings; diet; sleep; dental care; and medical, surgical, family, and social histories. A head-to-toe examination should be performed, including a review of growth. Immunizations should be reviewed and updated as appropriate. Screening for postpartum depression in mothers of infants up to six months of age is recommended. Based on expert opinion, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at each visit, with formal developmental screening at nine, 18, and 30 months and autism-specific screening at 18 and 24 months; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation. Well-child visits provide the opportunity to answer parents' or caregivers' questions and to provide age-appropriate guidance. Car seats should remain rear facing until two years of age or until the height or weight limit for the seat is reached. Fluoride use, limiting or avoiding juice, and weaning to a cup by 12 months of age may improve dental health. A one-time vision screening between three and five years of age is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to detect amblyopia. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline based on expert opinion recommends that screen time be avoided, with the exception of video chatting, in children younger than 18 months and limited to one hour per day for children two to five years of age. Cessation of breastfeeding before six months and transition to solid foods before six months are associated with childhood obesity. Juice and sugar-sweetened beverages should be avoided before one year of age and provided only in limited quantities for children older than one year.

### Childhood opportunity and appropriate use of child safety restraints in motor vehicle collisions [^1132b5Nt]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

This study is not without limitations. Car seat orientation, whether forward facing or rear facing, was unable to be determined for every case based on the information in the trauma database and the lack of specificity in medical provider documentation. While car seat placement is specified in safety restraint guidelines, we based our criteria of appropriateness of car seat use on age and weight or height, when available. Use of restraint was determined based on information gathered from law enforcement and EMS responders, patients, or patients' caregivers. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, it was impossible for us to physically verify the specific restraint types, and thus non-differential misclassification may have contributed to the results of this study. However, any error in EMS, ED, or caregiver reports would not be systematic and thus would not favor a specific outcome. Additionally, it is not the usual practice for medical staff to physically assess patient restraint types when they present to the hospital or ED. Hospital staff are not the first point of contact with children involved in MVCs and are reliant on those reporting from the scene of the collision. For example, although a car seat is present and use is reported, technical use may be inappropriate such that the harness height adjustment may be incorrect or may have not been buckled properly. Thus, it is possible that more patients were improperly restrained than reported. Although some patients were noted in the documentation to have been using the appropriate restraint in an improper manner (and thus were categorized as not appropriately restrained), it is possible that patients in this category were missed because it was not elucidated during patient assessment or documented in patient records. Additionally, because several patients in our study resided in neighborhoods with zip codes outside of Los Angeles County, our analysis of COI is not exclusive to Los Angeles neighborhoods. Lastly, the findings of this study represent a sample of patients at a single institution and thus may be biased and not reflect national trends from random sampling.

### American academy of audiology clinical consensus statement: assessment of vestibular function in the pediatric population [^112fu4jH]. Journal of the American Academy of Audiology (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric considerations for rotational chair testing emphasize calibration, seating, and head position. Standard calibration should be completed if the patient is at an age/developmental level to participate in the task, and default calibration is often used with infants and young children when standard calibration cannot be adequately performed. For seating, children should be in a seated position and buckled; infants and young children under 40 pounds can use a car seat, whereas children over 40 pounds can be seated on a booster seat or standard seat depending on height. Head position should ensure the horizontal canal is in the lateral plane and be secured to avoid excessive movement during testing.

### Rear-facing versus forward-facing child restraints: an updated assessment [^114paANm]. Injury Prevention (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend children be placed in rear-facing child restraint systems (RFCRS) until at least age 2. These recommendations are based on laboratory biomechanical tests and field data analyses. Due to concerns raised by an independent researcher, we re-evaluated the field evidence in favour of RFCRS using the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) database.

Methods

Children aged 0 or 1year old (0–23 months) riding in either rear-facing or forward-facing child restraint systems (FFCRS) were selected from the NASS-CDS database, and injury rates were compared by seat orientation using survey-weighted χ² tests. In order to compare with previous work, we analysed NASS-CDS years 1988–2003, and then updated the analyses to include all available data using NASS-CDS years 1988–2015.

Results

Years 1988–2015 of NASS-CDS contained 1107 children aged 0 or 1 year old meeting inclusion criteria, with 47 of these children sustaining injuries with Injury Severity Score of at least 9. Both 0-year-old and 1-year-old children in RFCRS had lower rates of injury than children in FFCRS, but the available sample size was too small for reasonable statistical power or to allow meaningful regression controlling for covariates.

Conclusions

Non-US field data and laboratory tests support the recommendation that children be kept in RFCRS for as long as possible, but the US NASS-CDS field data are too limited to serve as a strong statistical basis for these recommendations.

### Rear-facing car safety seat use for children 18 months of age: prevalence and determinants [^114ntLeb]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the prevalence and potential determinants of rear-facing car safety seat use among children approximately 18 months of age born at a university hospital.

Study Design

We administered a telephone survey to caregivers of children 17–19 months of age who were born between November 2013 and May 2014. The survey was designed to assess the prevalence of rear-facing car safety seat use and estimate the likelihood of rear-facing car safety seat use, compared with forward-facing car seat use, in reference to hypothesized determinants. aORs and 95% CIs were calculated using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

In total, 56% of potentially eligible caregivers (491/877) completed the survey; 62% of these reported rear-facing car safety seat use. Race, education, rurality, and household income were associated with rear-facing car safety seat use after controlling for potential confounders. Additionally, caregivers who reported having discussed car seats with their child's provider (aOR1.7; 95% CI1.1–2.6); receiving their child's primary care in pediatrics compared with family practice clinics (aOR2.4; 95% CI 1.1–2.6); and being aware of the American Academy of Pediatrics rear-facing recommendation (aOR2.8; 95% CI1.8–4.1) were significantly more likely to report rear-facing car safety seat use. Conversely, caregivers who previously used a car seat with another child were less likely to have their child rear facing at 18 months of age (aOR0.6; 95% CI 0.4–0.9).

Conclusions

A large proportion of children were forward facing at 18 months of age. Future efforts focused on encouraging providers to discuss car seats during patient visits, increasing awareness of the American Academy of Pediatrics' rear-facing recommendation, and targeting high-risk populations may improve the prevalence of children who remain rear facing until 2 years of age.

### Assessment of caregiver-targeted interventions for use of motor vehicle passenger safety systems for children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UdLKd]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

There have been great strides in child occupant protection during the last several decades, with deaths to child occupants of motor vehicles reduced from 10.5 to 3.2 per 100 000 children between 1970 and 2007. This success is largely due to the introduction of child restraint systems (CRS) in conjunction with child occupant protection laws. To reduce injuries and deaths due to motor vehicle collisions, CRS couple the child with the vehicle to distribute the force of a collision across the strongest parts of a child's body and prevent ejection. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration guidelines for CRS use are based on a child's progress on major developmental milestones and his or her weight and height. Broadly, this guidance stipulates that an infant sit in a rear-facing car seat or convertible seat, transition to a forward-facing 5-point harness seat, and then progress to a belt-positioning booster seat in context of manufacturer guidelines specific to each CRS.

All 50 states have some form of child restraint laws, which vary regarding requirements, penalties, and enforcement. Despite the benefits of correct CRS use, rates of children traveling inappropriately restrained, riding in an adult seatbelt, or unrestrained remain high. Although evidence suggests that restraint laws are efficacious, they are macrolevel interventionsand can only indirectly influence caregivers' behavior. Microlevel interventions, or those that target caregivers directly, can be useful for complementing policy-level efforts and are routine fixtures in many public health departments and pediatric care settings. However, intervention approaches vary (eg, clinical vs community setting), as do the study designs (eg, self-report vs observation) and it is not clear what approach to targeting caregivers might be most effective. Therefore, the current study is a meta-analysis of caregiver-targeted interventions designed to promote CRS use. Risk of bias assessments were completed for each study, along with an assessment of possible publication bias.

### Randomised feasibility trial of a virtual intervention to address infant car seat misuse [^117NpzES]. Injury Prevention (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Serious car seat installation errors occur at high rates in infants and children. These errors significantly increase the risk of child injury in a motor vehicle crash, and few interventions have addressed the challenge longitudinally.

Methods

This was a pilot randomised controlled feasibility trial of virtual car seat safety checks for caregivers of newborns recruited from an urban newborn nursery. The control (enhanced usual care (EUC)) group received an in-person car seat check as a newborn and virtual check at 9months. The intervention group received two additional virtual checks at 3 and 6 months. Installation and infant positioning errors were documented and corrected by a child passenger safety technician (CPST). We measured feasibility and acceptability by tracking caregiver and CPST challenges, and caregiver retention. Group differences were tested for statistical significance using χ² or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and two sample t-tests for continuous variables.

Results

33 caregivers were randomised to the EUC and 28 to the intervention group. Virtual checks were feasible, with variable participation levels at each quarter. Wi-Fi and app challenges noted in 30%. There was satisfaction with the virtual car seat checks. At baseline, car seat installation and infant positioning errors occurred at equal frequency, and at 9 months the intervention group had a significantly lower mean proportion than the EUC group in all categories of errors. In summary, virtual seat checks are feasible and the optimal timing of repeat checks requires additional study. A larger study is needed to further evaluate the effect of longitudinal virtual checks on errors.

Discharging neonates in a proper car safety seat is standard of care in the United States and many other countries. However, not every neonate can be safely positioned in a standard semi-upright car seat. In these cases, providers may opt for a travel device that allows the infant to lie flat, either supine or prone, known as a car bed. Minimal evidence exists to guide providers on car bed safety and help determine which infants would benefit from discharge in a car bed. In this article, we provide a comprehensive summary of existing literature on the safety of car beds for motor vehicle travel, car bed use in specific patient populations, and car beds vs. car seats for infants at risk of adverse cardiorespiratory events, including preterm infants with Hg-O 2 desaturations in the car seat. We discuss recommendations for the follow-up of infants discharged in a car bed in order to safely transition back to a car seat.

### Highlights from the 2023 revision of pediatric tactical emergency casualty care guidelines [^113WAUEa]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevent and Treat Comorbid Conditions — Head Injury

The Guidelines emphasize the importance of identifying potential closed head injuries in children and recommend using a Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale for children and infants as part of initial and ongoing patient assessment. Management recommendations include avoiding shock, preventing hypothermia, avoiding hypoxia, head elevation if possible, and targeting normocarbia if ventilatory support is being provided.

Prevent and Treat Comorbid Conditions — Antimicrobial Therapy

For patients who may have a delay before arriving at definitive care, the Guidelines provide recommendations for antimicrobial therapy in cases of penetrating trauma to the body or eyes.

Do Not Unnecessarily Delay Extraction to Definitive Care and Emphasize Safe Transport

Children injured in high-threat situations may require rapid and extensive resuscitation such as damage control surgery, rewarming, or intensive care unit support. As soon as the patient is adequately stabilized for extraction, movement toward definitive care should be prioritized over the management of non–life-threatening injuries on location (eg, stable fractures or minor wounds). Patients should be transported properly restrained in an enclosed vehicle where possible, including restraints for forward deceleration. Infants should be in a car seat if possible, and providers and equipment in the vehicle should be restrained as well. Lights and siren use should be restricted to those patients where the small amount of time saved could positively impact their outcome (eg, trauma patient with unstable vital signs).

### Preventive effects of car safety seat use on clinical outcomes in infants and young children with road traffic injuries: a 7-year observational study [^1154qfX9]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Road traffic injury (RTI) is one of the major mechanisms of injury leading to high disability and case-fatality in infants and children. Proper car safety seat use can reduce fatal outcomes in pediatric patients with RTI; however, the use rate is still low. This study aimed to measure the preventive effects of car safety seat use on clinical outcomes among infants and young children injured from RTI.

Methods

A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted using the Emergency Department-based Injury In-depth Surveillance (EDIIS) registry from 23 EDs between Jan 2010 and Dec 2016. All pediatric patients who were under 6 years of age and who sustained RTI in a vehicle with fewer than 10-seats were eligible. Primary and secondary endpoints were intracranial injury and mortality. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of the car safety seat for related outcomes adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

Among 5545 eligible patients, 1452 (26.2%) patients were in car safety seats at the time of the crash (12.5% in 2010 to 33.9% in 2016, p-for-trend < 0.01), and 104 (1.9%) patients had intracranial injuries. The patients using car safety seats were less likely to have intracranial injuries compared with the patients not using car safety seats (0.8% vs. 2.2%, AOR: 0.31 (0.17–0.57)). However, there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (0.4% vs. 0.6%, AOR: 0.50 (0.20–1.25)).

Conclusion

Use of the car safety seat has significant preventive effects on intracranial injury. Public health efforts to increase use of car safety seats for infants and young children are needed to reduce the burden of RTI.

### Knowledge of neonatal car seat location in a predominantly disadvantaged prenatal population [^115eoEYm]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

In order to assess knowledge of correct car seat location in prenatal patients of predominant lower socioeconomic status, an anonymous survey was performed at 2 inner city obstetric clinics. The survey participants (n = 688) were asked to select from among 3 drawings the correct location of a neonatal car seat. The choices showed an infant facing backward in the rear seat, forward in the rear seat, and backward in the front seat. The correct location of the car seat was selected by 61% of the participating subjects. Knowledge of correct location was related to age (p = 0.047), race (p = 0.002), and parity (p = 0.001) on univariate analysis. Education, survey site, and attendance at prenatal classes did not significantly correlate with car seat knowledge. Multiple regression analysis revealed that Caucasian race compared to African-American race predicted correct knowledge of car seat location with an Odds Ratio of 2.11 (CI 1.38–3.24). Multiparous women were more likely to know where to install a car seat relative to nulliparous women with an Odds Ratio of 1.63 (CI 1.12–2.38). Age was not significantly correlated with car seat knowledge on multivariate analysis. Knowledge of neonatal car seat location was suboptimal in our predominantly disadvantaged population, particularly in nulliparous, African-American women. Further prenatal education is needed during pregnancy or before hospital discharge to address this knowledge deficit.

### Multimodal intervention and child passenger safety guideline adherence in young children: a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized clinical trial [^114kmfJo]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In the baseline survey, caregivers provided demographic information, including their self-reported race and ethnicity and the race and ethnicity of their child. Response categories included Black, not Hispanic or Latine; Hispanic or Latine, any racial identity; White, not Hispanic or Latine, and multiple or other races, not Hispanic or Latine (defined as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Middle Eastern or North African, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and any race or ethnicity not otherwise specified). We obtained baseline weight and height from the electronic health record (EHR) for children presenting to Lurie Children's sites. Caregiver report was required for Central DuPage Hospital, which is on a separate EHR, and for 6- and 12-month assessments if there was no recent Lurie Children's visit. We projected child size using their baseline growth percentiles from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth curvesif time between size measurement and study assessment was more than 1 month. When no EHR data were available and caregivers reported implausible weights or heights, we used the 3rd percentile for age for low reported values and the 97th percentile for age for high reported values. If no size data were available, we used the 50th percentile for age.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was child passenger safety guideline adherence, a dichotomous composite measure comprised of all 3 criteria: (1) usual travel with an age- and size-appropriate CRS, (2) in the vehicle back seat, and (3) never traveling unrestrained. We defined age- and size-appropriateness using weight and height limits for typical CRS on the US market in 2024(eMethods and eTable 1 in Supplement 2). To provide current context for the weight limits used for our outcome definition, we present counts of CRS on the US market in 2025 (eTables 2–5 in Supplement 2). We determined the primary outcome for phase 1 using data from 6-month assessments and for phase 2 using data from 12-month assessments. Our secondary outcome was age- and size-appropriate CRS use alone (without considering seating location or ever traveling unrestrained).

Potential Harm

We considered potential harms. These included possible delayed transition, and use of a CRS beyond typical CRS upper weight or height limits.

### Car safety seats for children: rear facing for best protection [^113KMVyC]. Injury Prevention (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the injury risk between rear-facing (RFCS) and forward-facing (FFCS) car seats for children less than 2 years of age in the USA.

Methods

Data were extracted from a US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration vehicle crash database for the years 1988–2003. Children 0–23 months of age restrained in an RFCS or FFCS when riding in passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, or light trucks were included in the study. Logistic regression models and restraint effectiveness calculations were used to compare the risk of injury between children restrained in RFCSs and FFCSs.

Results

Children in FFCSs were significantly more likely to be seriously injured than children restrained in RFCSs in all crash types (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.20). When considering frontal crashes alone, children in FFCSs were more likely to be seriously injured (OR = 1.23), although this finding was not statistically significant (95% CI 0.95 to 1.59). In side crashes, however, children in FFCSs were much more likely to be injured (OR = 5.53, 95% CI 3.74 to 8.18). When 1 year olds were analyzed separately, these children were also more likely to be seriously injured when restrained in FFCSs (OR = 5.32, 95% CI 3.43 to 8.24). Effectiveness estimates for RFCSs (93%) were found to be 15% higher than those for FFCSs (78%).

Conclusions

RFCSs are more effective than FFCSs in protecting restrained children aged 0–23 months. The same findings apply when 1 year olds are analyzed separately. Use of an RFCS, in accordance with restraint recommendations for child size and weight, is an excellent choice for optimum protection up to a child's second birthday.

### Is the infant car seat challenge useful? A pilot study in a simulated moving vehicle [^111dCU5t]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Background and objective

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that preterm infants complete a predischarge 'car seat challenge' observation for cardiorespiratory compromise while in a car seat. This static challenge does not consider the more upright position in a car or the vibration of the seat when the car is moving. This pilot study was designed to assess the cardiorespiratory effects of vibration, mimicking the effect of being in a moving car, on preterm and term infants.

Methods

A simulator was designed to reproduce vertical vibration similar to that in a rear-facing car seat at 30 mph. 19 healthy newborn term and 21 preterm infants, ready for hospital discharge, underwent cardiorespiratory measurements while lying flat in a cot (baseline), static in the seat (30°), simulator (40°) and during motion (vibration 40°).

Results

Median test age was 13 days (range 1–65 days) and median weight was 2.5 kg (IQR: 2.1–3.1 kg).

Compared with baseline observations, only the total number of desaturations was significantly increased when infants were placed at 30° (p = 0.03). At 40°, or with vibration, respiratory and heart rates increased and oxygen saturation decreased significantly. Profound desaturations < 85% significantly increased during motion, regardless of gestational age.

Conclusions

This is the first study to assess the effect of motion on infants seated in a car safety seat. Term and preterm infants showed significant signs of potentially adverse cardiorespiratory effects in the upright position at 40°, particularly with simulated motion, not identified in the standard challenge. A larger study is required to investigate the significance of these results.

### Fatal head injury in a 1-year-old child secured in a rear-facing child seat by offset car-to-car collision [^117LZvnc]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

This case study describes a fatal head injury in a 1-year-old child involved in a motor vehicle accident in Japan. The child, secured in a rear-facing child seat, was a passenger in a car driven by their mother when the offset car-to-car collision occurred. The car rotated counterclockwise before coming to a stop. Despite remaining secured in the child seat, the child suffered severe head trauma, leading to cardiac arrest. Autopsy computed tomography revealed a right open depressed fracture, left head contusion, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and pneumocephalus. The injury mechanism involved the child's head striking the right headrest, followed by a swing to the left, induced by the initial impact and subsequent rotational movement. This case highlights the importance of age-specific data in understanding pediatric injuries in motor vehicle accidents and improving child seat safety measures.

### Looking back on rear-facing car seats: surveying US parents in 2011 and 2013 [^114wzYRH]. Academic Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine the age at which US parents first turned their child's car seat to face forward and information sources used to make that decision at the time of the release of the 2011 guidelines for child passenger safety and 30 months later.

Methods

We administered 2 separate cross-sectional Web-based surveys of nationally representative panels of US parents in May 2011 and November 2013. Survey participation rate was 54% in both years. Parents of children ≤ 4 years old responded to questions about transitioning from rear-facing to forward-facing car seats (n = 495 in 2011; n = 521 in 2013).

Results

In 2011, 33% of parents of 1- to 4-year-old children who had been turned to face forward (n = 409) turned at or before 12 months and 16% turned at 2 years or older. In 2013, 24% of parents of 1- to 4-year-old children who had been turned to face forward (n = 413) turned at or before 12 months and 23% turned at 2 years or older. Car seat packaging and clinicians were the most common information sources. Demographic characteristics associated with turning to face forward at or before 12 months of age in 2011 (parent age, education, household income, rural residence) were not significantly associated with transitioning at or before 12 months in 2013.

Conclusions

Delaying the transition to a forward-facing car seat still represents an opportunity to improve passenger safety in the United States. As common sources of information, clinicians may be influential in a parent's decision to turn their child's car seat to face forward.

### A risky treat: exploring parental perceptions of the barriers to seating their children in the rear seats of passenger vehicles [^1132Emkw]. Injury Prevention (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Sitting in the rear seat of a vehicle rather than in the front seat reduces children's risk of injury or death by ≥ 35% in the event of a crash. As road trauma is a leading cause of child morbidity and mortality in highly motorised nations, even in countries where restraint use is high, encouraging parents to place children in the rear seats of vehicles offers a low-cost avenue to improving children's overall health. However, little is known about the factors that affect parents' decisions about seating positions.

Objective

To explore parental perceptions of barriers to placing their children in the rear seat of passenger vehicles whenever possible.

Design and Subjects

Focus group discussions were held with urban parent-drivers to elicit their concerns about children's car safety and barriers to rear-seat use.

Results

Most parents had a rule that children should sit in the rear seat. Parents said that they relaxed these rules for a variety of reasons including social pressure, perceptions of the trip as short and because children regard sitting in the front seat as a treat. Parenting style, child cooperativeness, social pressure and inability to justify the risk of injury were identified as barriers to rear-seat travel.

Conclusions

Effective interventions to increase the proportion of children travelling in the rear seat should address parents' experiences of pressure to relax seating rules and risk perception, as well as provide strategies that support sound parental safety decisions.

### Multimodal intervention and child passenger safety guideline adherence in young children: a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized clinical trial [^111GRhLz]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Study population characteristics are presented in Table 1. Of the 474 caregivers, 443 (93.5%) were mothers; 264 (55.7%) were 30 to 39 years old; 52 (11.0%) preferred Spanish; 65 (13.7%) self-identified as Black, not Hispanic or Latine; 188 (39.7%) as Hispanic or Latine, any racial identity; 177 (37.3%) as White, not Hispanic or Latine; and 44 (9.3%) as multiple or other races, not Hispanic or Latine (including 1 American Indian and Alaska Native caregiver, 25 Asian caregivers, 3 Middle Eastern or North African caregivers, and 15 caregivers who identified with multiple racial groups). Of the children, 194 (40.9%) were female, 198 (41.8%) were aged 6 months to less than 3 years, 97 (20.5%) were aged 3 to younger than 5 years, and 179 (37.8%) were aged 5 to less than 11 years. Most participants were not guideline adherent at baseline, inclusive of prior front seat and unrestrained travel (247 of 342 participants [72.2%] receiving basic TCBD/ABCB and 96 of 132 participants [71.2%] receiving EUC); the remainder were planning a premature transition. Front seat travel was reported by 20 caregivers, 15 of whom reported using a nonrecommended CRS. Unrestrained travel was reported by 46 caregivers, 20 of whom reported using a nonrecommended CRS. Characteristics of the 185 participants who were rerandomized at 6-month are presented in Table 2. One family receiving EUC and 4 families receiving high-intensity TCBC/ABCB received study-provided CRSs after expressing financial need.

### Child passenger safety [^116LW36m]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Child passenger safety has dramatically evolved over the past decade; however, motor vehicle crashes continue to be the leading cause of death for children 4 years and older. This policy statement provides 4 evidence-based recommendations for best practices in the choice of a child restraint system to optimize safety in passenger vehicles for children from birth through adolescence: (1) rear-facing car safety seats as long as possible; (2) forward-facing car safety seats from the time they outgrow rear-facing seats for most children through at least 4 years of age; (3) belt-positioning booster seats from the time they outgrow forward-facing seats for most children through at least 8 years of age; and (4) lap and shoulder seat belts for all who have outgrown booster seats. In addition, a fifth evidence-based recommendation is for all children younger than 13 years to ride in the rear seats of vehicles. It is important to note that every transition is associated with some decrease in protection; therefore, parents should be encouraged to delay these transitions for as long as possible. These recommendations are presented in the form of an algorithm that is intended to facilitate implementation of the recommendations by pediatricians to their patients and families and should cover most situations that pediatricians will encounter in practice. The American Academy of Pediatrics urges all pediatricians to know and promote these recommendations as part of child passenger safety anticipatory guidance at every health supervision visit.

### Explaining barriers and challenges to child safety during driving from parents' perspectives: a qualitative content analysis [^1144g9fG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Child rearing/Communication with the child

Appropriate communication skills by parents positively impact all stages of a child's life. With intimate parental behavior, establishing communication becomes more effective. Positive, effective parental communication indicates respect for the child. Parents should be intimately communicating throughout their child's life, making the child feel supported and increasing self-confidence. In this regard, parents say:

"Today's children differ greatly from past generations. You can't force or angrily talk to a child - friendlier advice works better. Children decide themselves and are emotional at young ages, momentarily letting go of parents' hands to run in streets - parents must be more sensitive and focused on children, predicting behavior" (Parent 17).

Safety education and awareness raising

Cultural shaping in society should be purposeful, continuous, and sustainable and should start from the early years of the formation of children's personalities in the family because cultural shaping at lower ages has a greater impact compared to higher ages. Teaching traffic culture from early childhood does not mean that other age groups do not need it. Cultural shaping and increasing public awareness can be strengthened and complemented through official institutions such as education, media, the health system, police force, peer groups, and other related organizations. Therefore, expanding safety culture at the community level such as using child seats and observing safety precautions for children in cars, etc. is completely necessary. In this regard, parents say:

"When a new device is introduced to the market and you want to use it properly, its proper use also needs to be taught, such as using sunroofs in cars where parents open the sunroof just for the enjoyment of children without considering possible crash, and children stand in the middle of the car in a way that their heads stick out of the vehicle" (Parent 13).

Economic/Infrastructure factors

Some subsidiary topics were revealed under these overt titles, including financial capability, vehicle and road safety, and quality.

### Weight and age as predictors for passing the infant car seat challenge [^114XZrzK]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends observation of preterm and at-risk infants in their car seat before hospital discharge to screen for breathing problems. This observation period, which we refer to as the infant car seat challenge (ICSC), is used to determine readiness for travel in a car seat. Infants who fail the ICSC are recommended to travel in a car bed. Limited data exist to identify risk factors for failing the ICSC, and no guidelines are available to facilitate transition from car beds to car seats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether weight and age are predictors for passing the ICSC.

Methods

This retrospective study evaluated 43 infants referred to the Children's Hospital Boston Center for Healthy Infant Lung Development for a repeat ICSC after initial failure and 37 infants who passed or failed their initial ICSC at the Caritas Saint Elizabeth's Medical Center. Gender, birth weight, gestational age (GA), weight (ICSC weight), corrected GA, and chronological age at time of ICSC were extracted, and logistic regression analysis was performed.

Results

The average GA at birth of infants referred was 35 weeks 2 days (± 2 weeks 3 days), and almost equal numbers of boys and girls were referred. A majority of infants passed their initial rechallenge (38 [88%] of 43). Infants who failed the repeat challenge were slightly smaller (3327 ± 927 vs 3913 ± 936 g) and younger at time of retesting (CGA 40 weeks 5 days vs 42 weeks 5 days; chronological age 39.2 vs 52.2 days). Neither weight nor age at initial or repeat ICSC predicted passing the ICSC.

Conclusions

This study suggests that ICSC screenings remain the safest method for transitioning preterm infants from a car bed to a car seat.

### Child passenger safety for inner-city latinos: new approaches from the community [^113mXCAR]. Injury Prevention (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Motor vehicle crashes injuries, the leading cause of death for Latino children in the United States, can be reduced by the correct use of child safety seats. This study evaluated the ability of a community health worker education program to improve proper child safety seat usage in urban low income Latino families.

Methods

At a series of check events, proper child safety seat usage in families who had received an education intervention was compared with similar families who had not. The education intervention, provided by Latino community health workers trained as child passenger safety technicians, used videos and an office demonstrator. Members of the target community initiated the study and participated in its subsequent design and implementation.

Results

The families that participated in the study were primarily Mexican with low income, education, and acculturation levels. Forty six rear facing and 44 forward facing child safety seats were checked. Families exposed to the intervention were more likely to have their child's seat within the manufacturer's recommended weight/height range, their child facing the correct direction, the harness straps positioned properly, to have not been in a crash, the harness straps snug, the harness retainer clip used correctly, the seat belt routed correctly, and the seat belt locked.

Conclusions

Exposure to an educational intervention provided by community health workers trained as child passenger safety technicians was associated with child safety seats being used more properly than seats of families not exposed to the intervention in an urban low income Latino community.

### Explaining barriers and challenges to child safety during driving from parents' perspectives: a qualitative content analysis [^111CfaEh]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Behavioral factors

Parents should be the first to follow rules. It is difficult for children to comply and they need parental help and support. Children don't understand that not following safety regulations can have harmful consequences for themselves or others. Therefore, parents need to model safe behaviors and take correct actions to prevent risky behaviors. Family members' characteristics, especially parents, can influence a child's behavior. In this regard, parents say:

"In early childhood, we spoke to our child that the front seat is for older people, and young children should sit in the back. Now my child does not insist on sitting in the front and happily sits in the back of the car" (Parent 3).

"If a father sees his child crying in the back seat insisting to sit in the front or stand in front of the dashboard to look outside, he must calm the child by talking and explaining, without giving in to their illogical demands, even refusing to drive until the child agrees to sit in the back" (Parent 18).

Risky behavior

In the Risky Behavior category, various subcategories encompass unsafe actions exhibited by children in vehicles. These subcategories include the child's desire to put their head or hands out of the window, the urge to stand or move inside the car, attempts to open doors or windows, and even taking the steering wheel and trying to control it while driving. These behaviors pose significant safety risks, highlighting the need for parental supervision, proper restraints, and continuous education on vehicle safety. In this regard, parents say:

"My child was around one year and three months. I had placed them unbuckled on the front seat beside me while driving. Then I saw the child had fully opened the vehicle window, and if I hadn't noticed on time an crash like them falling out was possible, as I had no such experience and it was the first time I had taken the child" (Parent 1).

### Risk factors associated with quadbike crashes: a systematic review [^117Sdyz7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Age of riding initiation and riding transition

The data showed that young riders are introduced to the QB as passengers before they become riders themselves. However, children who start riding QBs at ages less than 12 years are four times more likely to suffer from QB injuries than those who start riding at an older age. Contrary to the notion that younger riders were more at risk for crashes due to their smaller stature, Milosavljevic observed that riders taller than 1.8 m were at a higher risk of losing control of vehicles. The physical attributes of the rider and rider-vehicle fit were explored in numerous studies and are currently considered prerequisites for active riding. Active riding involves continuous movement of arms, legs, and torso to keep the vehicle in control. The rider must actively change his body position to avoid rollover.

The QB design for active riding comes with longer seats, which reduces the distance from the tip of the seat to the handlebars. These design features compromise grip strengthening for braking or control or arm span for sharp turns when small children operate adult-sized vehicles with higher engine displacement. The longer seat design encourages pediatric use and predisposes them to loss of control and crash. Campbell observed that children under the age of 16 driving adult-sized vehicles were more likely to experience crashes. This observation was contested by Bernard who observed that anthropomorphic fit is a better parameter to decide vehicle transition than age. He observed that taller and older children were at a higher risk of crashes on a child-sized QB than an adult one, thus challenging the age-based criteria for riders to transition to adult QBs.

Helmet use

Several studies have shown that helmet nonuse among riders predisposes them to more severe head injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and death. Helmets are known to reduce the severity of head and neck injuries and crash injuries occurring during rollover. This protective effect was more observable among children, where unhelmeted children had a five times higher risk of severe head and neck injury.

### Too small for a seatbelt: predictors of booster seat use by child passengers [^1135sxDj]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Motor vehicle injury is the leading cause of injury death for children 4 to 8 years of age. Although booster seat use in this age group substantially reduces the risk of injury, most children are currently restrained by seatbelts designed for adults. The objective of this study was to measure booster seat use directly, determine factors predictive of proper child restraint, and assess parental reasons for booster use and nonuse.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study in Seattle, Washington, Spokane, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, from February to April 2000. Drivers were surveyed in their vehicles after picking up children from schools and child care centers. Trained observers recorded child age, weight, and height and directly observed restraint use. Observed restraint use was compared with the recommended restraint method based on the child's weight and age. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for clustering by car and site.

Results

We observed 2880 children traveling in cars, 1539 of whom were eligible for booster seat use. Eighty-eight percent of drivers agreed to respond to our survey. Only 16.5% of children for whom a booster seat was recommended were properly restrained, compared with 80% of younger children for whom a child safety seat was recommended and 55% of children for whom an adult seatbelt was recommended. Relative to a 4-year-old booster-eligible child, a 6-year-old was only half as likely to use a booster seat (odds ratio [OR]: 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31–0.71) and an 8-year-old almost never used a booster seat (OR: 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01–0.19). Booster use was more common when the driver wore a seatbelt (OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.8–5.4). Parents whose children were using booster seat cited "safety" (61%) and "child comfort and visibility" (12%) as their primary concerns. When a child was not using a booster seat, parents most often believed that their child was "too big for a car seat" (56%), reported that the seat was in another vehicle (9%), or stated that they "had not heard" of booster seats (8%).

Conclusions

Many parents still incorrectly believe that children are safe in a seatbelt and have outgrown the need for a car seat. These results demonstrate the need for public education campaigns to educate parents about booster seat use.

### Multimodal intervention and child passenger safety guideline adherence in young children: a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized clinical trial [^111xRTpZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Trial Design

We conducted a multisite, randomized clinical trial using a SMART design to test the efficacy of TCBD/ABCB intervention components. The study was approved by the institutional review board at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1.

Setting

Caregivers were invited to complete a screening survey during or after their child's visit to 2 emergency departments (EDs) or 2 urgent care centers affiliated with Lurie Children's from February 2020 through September 2022. Lurie Children's is a free-standing children's hospital located in downtown Chicago, Illinois. Central DuPage Hospital, in suburban Winfield, Illinois, has a general ED and pediatric treatment area. Lurie Children's urgent care centers are located within Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood and suburban Northbrook, IL. We recruited from acute care settings because these families may have less access to primary care, where injury prevention anticipatory guidance is traditionally provided.

Participants

English- or Spanish-speaking adult parents or legal guardians (hereafter referred to as caregivers) were eligible if their child (aged 6 months to younger than 11 years) was less than 55 inches tall, used a conventional CRS (eg, not a travel vest or wheelchair), and reported current child passenger safety behaviors that were not guideline adherent (ie, not using an age- and weight-appropriate CRS, using the front seat, or traveling unrestrained) or a planned premature transition within 6 months (ie, will stop using a recommended CRS). We did not contact caregivers of children involved in MVCs, with critical illness or injury (Emergency Severity Index triage category 1), under evaluation for suspected child abuse, or in protective custody. We excluded caregivers who (1) traveled less than 1 time per week with their child in a passenger vehicle, including taxis and ride-share services; (2) enrolled for another child; (3) resided outside of Illinois because child passenger safety laws vary by state; and (4) did not have a smartphone, needed for mobile health (mHealth) intervention components. Participants were enrolled by trained research coordinators (RCs) who shared consent documents via email, reviewed study details by phone, and obtained informed consent with electronic documentation.

### Association between weight and risk of crash-related injuries for children in child restraints [^1113HGKG]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the association between weight and the risk of injury in motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) for children 1 through 8 years of age who were using child restraints.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of children 1 to 8 years of age in MVCs, in which cases from the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System were used. Abbreviated Injury Scale scores of ≥ 2 indicated clinically significant injuries.

Results

The National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System study sample included 650 children 1 to 5 years of age in forward-facing child restraints who weighed 20 to 65 lb and 344 children 3 to 8 years of age in belt-positioning booster seats who weighed 30 to 100 lb. With adjustment for seating position, type of vehicle, direction of impact, crash severity, and vehicle model year, there was no association between absolute weight and clinically significant injuries in either age group (odds ratio: 1.17 [95% confidence interval: 0.96–1.42] for children 1–5 years of age in forward-facing child restraints and 1.22 [95% confidence interval: 0.96–1.55] for children 3–8 years of age in belt-positioning booster seats).

Conclusions

The risk of clinically significant injuries was not associated with weight across a broad weight range in this sample of children in MVCs who were using child restraint systems. Parents should continue to restrain their children according to current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

### Observed use of tethers in forward-facing child restraint systems [^1115AzqQ]. Injury Prevention (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Use of top tethers with forward-facing child restraints is a simple way for parents to keep their children safer when travelling in passenger vehicles, but tether use remains low.

Objectives

To obtain an updated estimate of top tether use.

Methods

Data on forward-facing child restraints were collected through an observational survey in the Washington DC metropolitan area during July-August 2010. The study sample included all forward-facing restraints that were installed in parked passenger vehicles and visible such that tether use could be observed. For each restraint, certified child passenger safety technicians collected information on the vehicle, seat row, restraint position, and tether.

Results

A total of 1321 cars, minivans, pickups, and sport utility vehicles, with a total of 1543 forward-facing child restraints, were observed. Tethers were used with 43.0% of all forward-facing child restraints. Tether use was similar (42.7–45.4%) among cars, minivans, and sport utility vehicles but lower (17.2%) for pickups. Tether use was higher (47.5%) for 2001 and newer vehicles, but dropped to 43.0% when only taut installations were considered.

Conclusions

Despite LATCH education campaigns and the increased availability of tether anchors, observed tether use was less than 50%. Tether use was even lower in older vehicles, yet many children continue to travel in these vehicles. If tether anchors are unavailable, parents should be encouraged to retrofit vehicle seating positions. Because many child restraints are still installed with vehicle seat belts, efforts to educate parents on the importance of tether use regardless of installation method may be warranted.

### Advocacy for booster seat legislation in Florida: a lesson in politics and policy formation [^1179RRgK]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

MVCs are a major contributor to child injury and death. Infant restraint seats and child booster seats have been shown to reduce the odds of severe injury or death when used correctly. While all states have mandated the use of these restraint systems, the age at which a child can be legally restrained using an adult seat belt varies from state to state. Efforts to strengthen Florida's weak child restraint laws have failed for more than a decade; in the 2014 legislative session, advocates succeeded in raising the state's age requirement from 3 years to 5 years. While many factors contributed to this year's success, some key elements included efficient communication of supporting data, a strong and broad advocacy network and the leveraging of election year political rivalries. Efforts to further strengthen the law will continue into future legislative sessions.

### Car seat inspection among children older than 3 years: using data to drive practice in child passenger safety [^1116S4C5]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of unintentional death and disability among children 4 years to 12 years of age in the United States. Despite the high risk of injury from motor vehicle crashes in this age group, parental awareness and child passenger safety programs in particular may lack focus on this age group.

Methods

This is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of child passenger safety seat checklist forms from two Safe Kids coalitions in Michigan (2013) to identify restraint type upon arrival to car seat inspections. Other variables were included if the coalition provided a new child safety seat and if the child had a sibling who underwent a car seat inspection. χ statistics were used to compare change in restraint use on arrival and at departure, the proportion of children attending a car seat inspection event by age, the age category of children by site, the proportion of children with siblings also undergoing a car seat inspection by age, and the distribution of a new child safety seat by age.

Results

Data were available from 1,316 Safe Kids Huron Valley and 3,215 Safe Kids Greater Grand Rapids car seat inspections. Just 10.8% of the total seats inspected were booster seats. Child safety seats for infant and young children were more commonly inspected (rear-facing carrier [40.3%], rear-facing convertible [10.2%], and forward-facing [19.3%] car seats). Few children at inspections used a seat belt only (5.4%) or had no restraint (13.8%). Children 4 years and older were found to be in a suboptimal restraint at least 30% of the time.

Conclusion

Low proportions of parents use car seat inspections for children in the booster seat age group. The proportion of children departing the inspection in a more protective restraint increased with increasing age. This highlights an area of weakness in child passenger safety programs and signals an opportunity to strengthen efforts on The Booster Age Child.

### Quality of harness fit for normal and low birthweight infants observed among newborns in infant car seats [^115GnLoU]. Injury Prevention (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Child restraint fit is important for crash protection. For newborns, standards universally require a rear-facing restraint and some upper limit on size, but historically there has been no specification of a lower design limit and there is concern over whether low birthweight infants (LBW) are adequately restrained. The aim of this study was to determine the quality of harness fit for newborns of low and normal weight in a range of modern child restraints.

Methods

A convenience sample of infants (1.657–4.455kg) were recruited from the postnatal ward and special care nursery < 1week from discharge. Infants (n = 84) were assessed for harness fit in rear-facing-only restraints, convertible rear/forward restraints and a subset were assessed in a restraint specifically designed to accommodate LBW infants. Measures of harness fit were based on shoulder strap, crotch strap and buckle positioning.

Results

Less than 20% of infants achieved good harness fit, regardless of whether they were categorised as low (< 2.5kg) or normal weight. Rear-facing-only restraints were less likely to provide good fit than convertible restraints, in all measures of fit other than shoulder strap width. The proportions of infants achieving good fit were greater in the restraint designed for LBW infants than other restraint types.

Conclusion

Poor accommodation continues to be a problem for LBW infants but is rectified in specifically designed restraints. Better specification of harness configuration for all rearward-facing restraints may be required to ensure adequate accommodation of normal birthweight infants.

### Explaining barriers and challenges to child safety during driving from parents' perspectives: a qualitative content analysis [^111P4QHg]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Cognitive factors

The ability to recognize and anticipate hazards in traffic crashes is recognized as one of the key factors in safe driving. Parents can reduce injuries from traffic crashes by evaluating risks and observing safety issues while driving. Some parents lack necessary caution while driving due to thinking such incidents will not happen to them, and take risks. In this regard, parents say:

"Some parents don't believe and say nothing has ever happened to me so far and nothing will happen, and that God protects and guards our child, so they don't take traffic-related hazards and driving injuries seriously for their children" (Parent 24).

"Some parents know certain behaviors of theirs or their children can be very dangerous, like sticking their head or even half their body out the sunroof, which has increased lately - with even minor braking or at high speeds the child could fall out or get chest injuries, or even have an object enter their eye, but parents don't pay attention to these issues" (Parent 12).

Safety equipment

Vehicle safety equipment refers to all optional accessories chosen by the vehicle owner to increase safety and comfort for the driver and vehicle. Currently, safety equipment is the most important part of a vehicle, significantly reducing crashes and financial/physical injuries. The worst driving crashes generally occur in vehicles lacking standard vehicle safety systems. In this regard, parents say:

"When you use a child seat, vehicle space decreases. If I want to bring a family like my parents, there's no space for a child seat in the back where three people can sit. With a child seat only two people can sit, and the seat is very hard to move and large" (Parent 2).

"While buckling up my child I kept them occupied with something in the car, using props like hanging toys on the back seat or clothes rack, always leaving a doll next to them on the car seat, or storybooks or something novel so my child wouldn't get tired or fussy in the car, being entertained while driving" (Parent 12).

### Community paediatricians' counseling patterns and knowledge of recommendations relating to child restraint use in motor vehicles [^112fuxax]. Injury Prevention (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Road traffic injury is the leading cause of death among Canadian children and youth. Transport Canada recommends four types of child restraint depending on the size of the child, and recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of recommended restraint use.

Objectives

To determine community paediatricians' knowledge of Transport Canada recommendations for child restraint use in vehicles, and to examine paediatricians' counseling patterns in relation to child passenger safety.

Methods

A mailed questionnaire survey of all community paediatricians affiliated with the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto was conducted. A 16 item questionnaire gathered information on knowledge of Transport Canada recommendations for child restraint use, general counseling patterns in relation to child passenger safety, and demographic information.

Results

In total, 60 community paediatricians in active practice were identified. Of these, 48 (80%) responded to the mailed questionnaire. Almost all paediatricians (92%) correctly identified the recommended weight for transition to a forward-facing car seat, whereas fewer paediatricians (63%) correctly identified the recommended weight for transition to a booster seat from a forward-facing car seat, and only one third of paediatricians correctly identified the recommended weight for transition from a booster seat to a seat belt.

Conclusion

Community paediatricians' knowledge of Transport Canada recommendations for child restraint use in vehicles is incomplete. There is a need for such recommendations to be better disseminated to paediatricians and parents so that information on child restraint use is delivered in a clear and consistent manner.

### Parents' knowledge and socio-demographic determinants toward child's restraint system use [^117Es1sY]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

There is no accurate information about child death statistics in Iran, but seven children die in MVCs every day according to police reports. Most of the MVCs and injuries in children are due to not using the child restraint system (CRS) or using it improperly. The use of CRS which is appropriate for a child's age and weight can reduce children's fatality rate. Statistics show that, in MVCs all over the world, about half of the victims aged 4–8 years did not use CRS. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers it necessary for children to use the CRS up to the age of 10 or a height of 135 cm. Since almost all children are transported by car, therefore, it is important for them to be in proper restraint systems. Thirty-three countries enforce laws on CRS use for children. A child safety seat (CSS) can reduce infant fatality by 70% and the fatality of children under four by 54–80%. Moreover, the use of a booster (seats for children aged over four) reduces the risk of severe injuries in children by 59%. The goal of CSS and the booster is to reduce MVC fatalities and injuries in children under 12. As car seat belts are designed for people over 4 feet and 9 inches tall, it is the role of the booster to lift children and teens to improve seat belt performance. The probability of injury in children aged 4–7 years, who use seat belts with a booster, is 59% less than when they use only the seat belt. Children who use only seat belts are at high risk, and the probability of serious injury for these children increases to 153%. The risk of early use of seat belts for children includes head, spinal column, lung, and abdominal injuries. Therefore, children under the height of 135 cm must use CSS or a booster.

### Not all child safety seats are created equal: the potential dangers of shield booster seats [^1165yxfd]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Children are safest when traveling in a child safety seat appropriate for their age and size. Previous research indicates that children are often transitioned to shield booster seats (SBSs) before reaching the 40-lb weight limit for their forward-facing child safety seat (FFCSS). These children could have otherwise been restrained in a FFCSS as is currently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The objective of this study was to compare the injury patterns among children who were restrained in SBSs and FFCSSs. Children in FFCSSs were chosen as a comparison group because SBS are predominantly used to restrain children who are < 40 lb and could have been restrained in an FFCSS, and SBSs are no longer certified for use in children who are > 40 lb.

Methods

This is a cohort study involving restrained crash victims who were admitted to a level 1 pediatric trauma center between 1991 and 2003. Patients were older than 1 year, weighed between 20 and 40 lb, and were restrained in an SBS (N = 16) or an FFCSS (N = 30). Injury Severity Score, Abbreviated Injury Scale, Glasgow coma score, intensive care admission, length of stay, and acute care charges served as outcomes of interest.

Results

No significant differences regarding crash and occupant characteristics were found (mean Delta V, crash type, passenger compartment intrusion, driver restraint use). Odds of severe injury were greater for children in SBSs compared with children in FFCSSs as measured by Injury Severity Score > 15 (odds ratio [OR]: 8.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1–33.6), intensive care admission (OR: 5.5; 95% CI: 1.5–20.5), length of stay > 2 days (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 1.6–24.6), and Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 3 (OR: 4.4; 95% CI: 1.2–16.1). Furthermore, SBS cases had greater odds of head (OR: 4.5; 95% CI: 1.2–17.3), chest (OR: 29.0; 95% CI: 3.1–267.3), and abdominal/pelvic injury (25% vs 0%).

Conclusion

This study provides information about the increased risk of injury associated with shield boosters when compared with FFCSSs. The challenge for pediatricians is not only to promote the use of child restraints but also to ensure that parents use the most appropriate restraint for their child's age and weight.

### Is the infant car seat challenge useful? A pilot study in a simulated moving vehicle [^113syZ8T]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

This small-scale pilot study was designed to identify any potential adverse effects of a more upright position and of motion on infants in car seats. Limitations are its small size, lack of randomisation of the infants studied, the lack of formal sleep state monitoring and the limited time each infant spent in a car seat.

We have shown potential changes in cardiorespiratory stability during periods in which the infant is in a more upright position than usually used in static car seat challenges, and the exacerbation of these effects during simulated movement in some infants. We cannot be certain of the clinical significance or potential risks posed by the changes we have identified, which could be a consequence of position, restraint, movement or a combination of all three. The infants in the supine position were not restrained (as they would be in a car bed); thus, we cannot assess the effects of restraint in this position.

More research is needed to quantify these effects, and to investigate how best to avoid them if they are clinically significant. In particular, there is a need for larger studies to investigate the effect of increasing infant age (and thus size), and duration of journey time, together with simulating the effects of changes in vehicle speed and direction.

The importance of protecting infants in the event of a moving vehicle accident must be emphasised, and infant car seats must be used whenever infants travel in cars (as per UK law), but these findings support the AAP guideline that infant car seats should not be used as a routine infant sleep environment.

### Automobile safety in children: a review of north American evidence and recommendations [^115Ny5a3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

In the United States, the rate of vehicle occupant deaths in children aged 1 to 3 years has decreased by over 50% in the past three decades. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of death in children aged 1 to 17 years. Parental compliance with child safety seats is poor, with up to 99% of children in certain age groups improperly restrained. Epidemiologic data support the proper use of automobile restraint systems to save lives. When appropriate restraint systems (based on age and weight) are used, a significant decrease occurs in the rates of mortality and serious injury. Legislation and public service campaigns can increase awareness regarding appropriate use of automobile restraint systems to decrease pediatric injury and fatality rates. Fluency and awareness, rather than cost, have been found to be the main reasons for improper use of automobile restraint systems; appropriately targeted education programs should continue to be developed. Physicians are optimally poised to educate patients and parents about automobile safety.

### Is the infant car seat challenge useful? A pilot study in a simulated moving vehicle [^113rw6tS]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infant car safety seats are used for infants from birth up to 10 kg. They may be too big to effectively secure low-birthweight or preterm infants who are discharged home from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), at weights of 1.8–2.5 kg. In these seats, the prominent occiput of a preterm infant may push the head forward, particularly during sleep, potentially causing airway obstruction. Studies have shown that premature infants are prone to drops in blood oxygen saturation, and apnoea or hypoventilation when restrained in car seats, in up to 60% of infants studied. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all preterm infants should undergo monitoring in a car seat before discharge — for apnoea, bradycardia or desaturations, and many UK hospitals follow this advice. The significance and potential impact of these problems is not clear, but there have been reports of deaths of infants who have been left in a sitting position, including in car seats — both on journeys, and when parents have used it as an alternative to a pushchair or cot for the infant to sleep in.

One survey noted that 94% of infants, below 5 months of age, spent over 30 min a day in seating devices including car seats. The mean was 5.7 ± 3.5 hours. There have been no studies looking at the effects on infants over such prolonged periods in a sitting position.

There are no universal guidelines on implementing the car seat challenge, and commonly the angle of the back of the car seat to the horizontal is not reported although in a vehicle it should be 40°–45° for maximum protective effect. In our hospital, the challenge is routinely performed with the car seat placed on the floor, using the carrying handle for stability (like many UK units surveyed, see online supplementary appendix 1). The angle of the seat's back to the floor is approximately 30°, which is flatter than the position in a vehicle.

No published studies have monitored infants in moving vehicles, so there is no data on whether infants experience more or less cardiorespiratory compromise when travelling. Hence, it is unknown whether the 'car seat challenge' as currently performed has any validity as a means of distinguishing between an infant who can safely travel in a car or one who is at risk of adverse effects during such a journey.

### Is the infant car seat challenge useful? A pilot study in a simulated moving vehicle [^1124STNH]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that preterm infants complete a predischarge 'car seat challenge' observation for cardiorespiratory compromise while in a car seat. This static challenge does not consider the more upright position in a car or the vibration of the seat when the car is moving. This pilot study was designed to assess the cardiorespiratory effects of vibration, mimicking the effect of being in a moving car, on preterm and term infants.

Methods

A simulator was designed to reproduce vertical vibration similar to that in a rear-facing car seat at 30mph. 19 healthy newborn term and 21 preterm infants, ready for hospital discharge, underwent cardiorespiratory measurements while lying flat in a cot (baseline), static in the seat (30°), simulator (40°) and during motion (vibration 40°).

Results

Median test age was 13days (range 1–65days) and median weight was 2.5kg (IQR: 2.1–3.1kg). Compared with baseline observations, only the total number of desaturations was significantly increased when infants were placed at 30° (p = 0.03). At 40°, or with vibration, respiratory and heart rates increased and oxygen saturation decreased significantly. Profound desaturations < 85% significantly increased during motion, regardless of gestational age.

Conclusions

This is the first study to assess the effect of motion on infants seated in a car safety seat. Term and preterm infants showed significant signs of potentially adverse cardiorespiratory effects in the upright position at 40°, particularly with simulated motion, not identified in the standard challenge. A larger study is required to investigate the significance of these results.

### Effectiveness of belt positioning booster seats: an updated assessment [^114KPEHc]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to provide an updated estimate of the effectiveness of belt-positioning booster (BPB) seats compared with seat belts alone in reducing the risk for injury for children aged 4 to 8 years.

Methods

Data were collected from a longitudinal study of children who were involved in crashes in 16 states and the District of Columbia from December 1, 1998, to November 30, 2007, with data collected via insurance claims records and a validated telephone survey. The study sample included children who were aged 4 to 8 years, seated in the rear rows of the vehicle, and restrained by either a seat belt or a BPB seat. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the odds of injury for those in BPB seats versus those in seat belts. Effects of crash direction and booster seat type were also explored.

Results

Complete interview data were obtained on 7151 children in 6591 crashes representing an estimated 120646 children in 116503 crashes in the study population. The adjusted relative risk for injury to children in BPB seats compared with those in seat belts was 0.55.

Conclusions

This study reconfirms previous reports that BPB seats reduce the risk for injury in children aged 4 through 8 years. On the basis of these analyses, parents, pediatricians, and health educators should continue to recommend as best practice the use of BPB seats once a child outgrows a harness-based child restraint until he or she is at least 8 years of age.

### Does tongue size contribute to risk of airway narrowing in preterm infants sitting in a car safety seat? [^116yvNCM]. American Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm infants are at risk of narrowing of the upper airway while restrained in infant car seats, leading to secondary apnea. However, some infants are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect relatively smaller tongue size.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed previously reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm infants ready for discharge (32.6 ± 1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8 ± 9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an index of relative tongue size.

Results

A smaller airspace around the tongue (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (p < 0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway size (r² = 0.16, p = 0.11).

Conclusion

The present study supports the hypothesis that the vulnerability of preterm infants to airways compromise while restrained in a car safety seat may be in part related to relative tongue size.

### A study of students' use of restraint systems in school transportation services in primary and secondary schools in Northern iran: an observational study [^113VVYW1]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Traffic accident injuries in children should be considered and precautions related to children's transportation safety should be taken. Severe traffic accidents are one of the 15 leading causes of death in children and the second leading cause of death between the ages of 5 and 15. In 2010, in the United States, about 1000 children under the age of 15 were killed and 171,000 injured in traffic accidents.

In Canada, these accidents are the cause of death and severe injuries among children under the age of 14. In the United States, more than 180,000 occupants of children under the age of 12 were involved in traffic accidents. In the UAE, child deaths from traffic accidents are increasing rapidly and in Iran, on average, 2 children die or are seriously injured per day. These accidents cost millions of dollars of damage every year. It is believed that the death of many of these children can be prevented by the proper use of restraint systems in vehicles.

The anatomical body features of children are different from those of adults. This will lead to unique patterns of injury in children than in adults. An example of these features is the increase in head-to-body ratio. Children should be restrained based on their age, weight, and height. Due to their physical, age, and weight characteristics, children are not allowed to use adult seatbelts and one of the necessary protective devices and alternative to seatbelts in this category is a child booster seat. Child safety advisors, recommending booster seats for children over 4 years of age until they are big enough to use a seatbelt by the age of 8 to 9 years. Reducing deaths and injuries from traffic accidents is highly dependent on the use of a variety of restraint systems. In addition to the restraint system, the position of the child in the chair is also crucial, and the back seat is 35% safer for children than the front seat. Sitting in the back seat of a vehicle in the event of an accident is a factor in preventing severe injuries, which increases significantly with the use of seatbelts or other restraint systems.

### Disparities in age-appropriate child passenger restraint use among children aged 1 to 12 years [^114NKnQy]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Observed racial disparities in child safety seat use have not accounted for socioeconomic factors. We hypothesized that racial differences in age-appropriate restraint use would be modified by socioeconomic status and child passenger safety information sources.

Methods

A 2-site, cross-sectional tablet-based survey of parents seeking emergency care for their 1- to 12-year-old child was conducted between October 2011 and May 2012. Parents provided self-report of child passenger safety practices, demographic characteristics, and information sources. Direct observation of restraint use was conducted in a subset of children at emergency department discharge. Age-appropriate restraint use was defined by Michigan law.

Results

Of the 744 eligible parents, 669 agreed to participate and 601 provided complete responses to key variables. White parents reported higher use of car seats for 1- to 3-year-olds and booster seats for 4- to 7-year-olds compared with nonwhite parents. Regardless of race, < 30% of 8- to 12-year-old children who were ≤ 4 feet, 9 inches tall used a booster seat. White parents had higher adjusted odds (3.86, 95% confidence interval 2.27–6.57) of reporting age-appropriate restraint use compared with nonwhite parents, controlling for education, income, information sources, and site. There was substantial agreement (82.6%, κ = 0.74) between parent report of their child's usual restraint and the observed restraint at emergency department discharge.

Conclusions

Efforts should be directed at eliminating racial disparities in age-appropriate child passenger restraint use for children < 8 years. Booster seat use, seat belt use, and rear seating represent opportunities to improve child passenger safety practices among older children.

### Vital signs: restraint use and motor vehicle occupant death rates among children aged 0–12 years-United States, 2002–2011 [^1116mcuQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

To reduce the number of child motor vehicle occupant deaths, parents and caregivers should ensure that children always travel in the back seat in age- and size-appropriate restraints as follows: rear-facing CSSs up to age 2 years; forward-facing CSSs up to at least age 5 years; booster seats through at least age 8 years and until seat belts fit properly; and adult seat belts, still in the back seat, until age 13 years. Passengers aged ≥ 13 years should use adult seat belts on every trip. Implementing interventions that are proven to increase child restraint use is an effective way to prevent child motor vehicle injuries and deaths. These interventions include child passenger restraint laws that require CSS/booster seat use in the back seat until a child is aged ≥ 8 years and CSS distribution plus education programs.

Key Points

Motor vehicle occupant death rates among children aged 0–12 years decreased by 43% from 2002 to 2011.
Despite this decrease, one third of child motor-vehicle occupants (aged 0–12 years) who died in 2011 were unrestrained.
Almost half of black (45%) and Hispanic (46%) children who died in crashes were unrestrained, compared with 26% of whites (2009–2010).
In 2013, only two states had child passenger restraint laws that required child safety seat/booster seat use by children through at least age 8 years. Implementing effective interventions, such as increasing the state-required age for child safety seat/booster seat use in child passenger restraint laws and child safety seat distribution plus education programs, can reduce motor vehicle occupant deaths.

### Are parents following the recommendations for keeping children younger than 2 years rear facing during motor vehicle travel? [^116WwJfE]. Injury Prevention (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Between 2007 and 2012 there have been several recommendations that infants and toddlers ride in a car safety seat (CSS) rear facing until 2years of age. This study reports the effect of these recommendations on the observed direction of travel for infants and toddlers transported in motor vehicles between 2007 and 2012.

Methods

This is an observational, cross-sectional survey of drivers transporting children collected at 25 convenience locations selected in Indiana during summer 2007 through 2012. Observations were conducted by Certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians. As drivers completed a written survey, the Certified Child Passenger Safety Technician recorded the vehicle seating location, type of restraint, CSS direction and use of the CSS harness or safety belt as appropriate, and demographic data. The infant and toddler's age and weight were collected. Data from 2007 through 2012 for ages birth through 23months were compared in order to determine if recommendations impacted observed direction of travel.

Results

During the study period, the percent of infants and toddlers (birth through 23months) observed rear facing in a motor vehicle varied from 44.2% (2007) to 59.1% (2012). For infants (birth through 11months) observed rear facing, it was 85.1% (2009) to 91.6% (2012). The percent of toddlers (12months through 23months) observed rear facing ranged from 3.3% (2008) to 18.2% (2012).

Conclusions

During the study period, the proportion of toddlers rear facing increased approximately 15% (p = 0.03). Counselling by primary care providers should continue and be strengthened to increase parent and caregiver awareness of the latest child passenger safety recommendations.

### Is the infant car seat challenge useful? A pilot study in a simulated moving vehicle [^1133ZVLp]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Infant demographics

Forty infants were studied; 21 preterm (53%) and 22 were male (55%). The median gestational age was 36 weeks (IQR: 31–39 weeks), ranging from 27 weeks 5 days to 41 weeks 5 days. The median birth weight was 2.5 kg (IQR: 1.5–3.2 kg) ranging from 0.8 to 4.8 kg. Seventeen infants were born by normal vaginal delivery (42.5%), 10 by elective (25.0%) and 13 by emergency caesarean section (32.5%).

Data at testing

The median age at testing was 13 days (IQR: 6–33 days) ranging from 1 day after birth to 65 days. Preterm or very low-birthweight infants were tested when they were mature enough for discharge. The postmenstrual age at testing ranged from 34 weeks 3 days to 42 weeks 4 days. The median weight was 2.5 kg (IQR: 2.1–3.1 kg) ranging from 1.6 to 4.8 kg.

We aimed to test each infant in each condition for 30 min but interruptions from infant care procedures meant that the actual times varied and not all tests were completed in a few cases. The baseline recordings with the infant placed supine in a cot ranged from 17 to 120 min with a median of 60 min; thus, the results were adjusted to a standard 30 min or per unit of time tested.

Many infants put their chin on their chest during testing but three infants slumped forward during vibration (see figure 2). Their position was left while they maintained normal oxygen saturations to observe what would happen. They lifted their head up briefly at intervals but could not maintain this position.

### Child safety seat counseling: three keys to safety [^113M4wB2]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The number one cause of death for children younger than 14 years is vehicular injury. Child safety seats and automobile safety belts protect children in a crash if they are used correctly, but if a child does not fit in the restraint correctly, it can lead to injury. A child safety seat should be used until the child correctly fits into an adult seat belt. It is important for physicians caring for children to know what child safety seats are available and which types of seats are safest. Three memory keys will help guide appropriate child safety seat choice: (1) Backwards is Best; (2) 20–40–80; and (3) Boost Until Big Enough. "Backwards is Best" cues the physician that infants are safest in a head-on crash when they are facing backward. "20–40–80" reminds the physician that children may need to transition to a different seat when they reach 20, 40, or 80 lb. "Boost Until Big Enough" emphasizes that children need to use booster seats until they are big enough to fit properly into an adult safety belt.

### Transporting children with special health care needs: comparing recommendations and practice [^113UfaFH]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

We compare the use of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for the safe transportation of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) with reported and observed practices.

Methods

This observational study was based on a convenience sample of vehicles exiting the garage of a tertiary children's hospital. Certified child passenger safety technicians with a health care background and specialized training in the transportation of CSHCN gathered the driver's demographic information and the child's reported medical condition, weight, age, clinic visited, and relation to the driver. The safety technicians observed the car safety seat (CSS) type, vehicle seating position, and if the child required postural support.

Results

During the study, 275 drivers transporting 294 CSHCN were observed. Overall, most drivers complied with AAP recommendations by using a standard CSS seat (75.4%). Among the seats evaluated, 241 (82.0%) were the appropriate choice, but only 75 (26.8%) of 280 assessed had no misuses. Approximately 24% of the drivers modified the CSS, and 19.4% of the children would have benefited from additional body-positioning support. Only 8% of medical equipment was properly secured.

Conclusions

Although most drivers seemed to choose the appropriate seat, many had at least 1 misuse. Drivers complied with most AAP recommendations; however, some deviated to facilitate care of the child during transport. Discussions with parents or caregivers about the proper transportation of CSHCN and referrals to child passenger safety technicians with special training may improve safety, care, and comfort in the vehicle.

### Parents' knowledge and socio-demographic determinants toward child's restraint system use [^114ocKK7]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Consistent with other studies, the present study demonstrated that parents consider the intolerance of children for sitting in CRS as one of the barriers to its use. They also think that using CRS is not necessary, and holding the child on their lap is the best way to protect them. All of these can be due to parents' lack of knowledge about the necessity of using CRS.

The findings of the present study showed that most parents had low knowledge about the age of using seat belts and CRS. The findings were consistent with those reported by Howard et al. who estimated that parents have moderate to poor knowledge. Therefore, direct and indirect education regarding the protection of children inside the car is vital. Indirect education, in particular, can be effective. Even in Iranian films, movie stars sit their children in the front seat or leave them in the car without CRS. Increasing the information and knowledge of parents can increase the use of CRS. Based on the study by J W Lee et al. the implementation of educational programs about CRS through radio, television, and newspapers is effective in increasing parental information about CRS use in Latin communities. Other studies have reported that educational interventions such as holding educational classes can increase parental knowledge and use of CRS. Even some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have set up funds to educate children of different ages at school, equip Good Egg Safety stores and their staff to sell CRS, and have store clerks present some education. The payment of subsidies, installment payments, or paying by checks, plus increasing parental awareness, can increase the use of CRS. Along with these programs, CRS producers must provide completely safe and standard equipment, produce more boosters, and advertise them.

### Crash performance of rear-facing restraints with a fracture type spica casted 1-year-old dummy [^114BmULS]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Motor vehicle crashes represent a significant cause of mortality and morbidity for young children. Safely restraining a child is typically more complicated for special cases such as children treated with a hip spica cast. In the current study, hip spica casts typical for treatment of a femoral fracture were applied to a crash dummy representing the size and weight of a 1-year-old child. This spica casted dummy was used to study the performance of 4 rear-facing car seats in a series of simulated frontal impacts.

Methods

The restrained, rear-facing dummy was subjected to a frontal crash test at 30mph (48kph) per federal guidelines. Two of the tested car seats were specifically designed for transporting children with hip spica casts, while the other 2 were conventional seats capable of accommodating the cast. All seats were installed per the manufacturer's instructions. As a control, tests were performed without a cast using the conventional/standard seats.

Results

The lowest overall loading of the dummy's head, neck, and chest occurred during tests with the standard seats. While it was easier to seat the casted child in the spica-specific seats, these designs led to greater loading on the dummy's body. In a spica-specific seat, the chest acceleration values exceeded the federal limit in a test where the seat was installed in a reclined orientation that was within the manufacturer's described positioning.

Conclusions

Spica-specific seats more easily accommodate the cast, but conventional seats can provide similar levels of protection in a crash. As cast and seat designs continue to evolve, hospitals might consider having a range of seats available for patient use. It is important to help caregivers make informed decisions on how and when to transport children with hip spica casts.

### Childhood opportunity and appropriate use of child safety restraints in motor vehicle collisions [^115tATn4]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome

The primary outcome was appropriate restraint use. The electronic medical records of patients categorized as non-restrained were individually reviewed to confirm that no restraint was used. Patients were stratified based on safety restraint use (non-restrained, car seat, child booster, lap belt, seat belt) and whether they were appropriately restrained or not appropriately restrained. Not appropriately restrained patients included those who were non-restrained or improperly restrained, such as using the wrong type of restraint based on age, height, and/or weight. Two nationally certified child passenger safety technicians and injury prevention specialists separately reviewed patient information. As child passenger safety technicians with the technical experience and knowledge on proper car seat use and installation, they made recommendations on proper restraint type for each study patient and appropriateness of the documented restraint used. Appropriateness was determined by current age-based safety restraint laws and best practices. While child safety restraint laws may vary by state, current best practice guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) are as follows: (1) use of rear-facing car seats until they are outgrown, (2) use of forward-facing car seats through at least 4 years of age, (3) booster seats through minimum 8 years of age, (4) seat belts (including lap and shoulder belts) for all children who have outgrown booster seats, and (5) placement in the rear seat of the vehicle for all children < 13 years.

The Childhood Opportunity Index 2.0

The COI is a verified multidimensional metric that uses US census tract and zip code data to reflect neighborhood conditions that contribute to healthy childhood development. In the present study, COI was assigned at the zip code level. The COI is based on 29 neighborhood-level indicators that represent access to resources in three domains that are known to be important for childhood development: education, health and environment, and socioeconomic. Examples of neighborhood-level indicators include but are not limited to educational and social resources, presence of early childhood education centers, health insurance coverage, toxic exposures, neighborhood walkability, household income, and employment rate. Neighborhood indicators are weighed based on their degree of association with health and socioeconomic outcomes. Indicator scores are converted into index z-scores (1–100) and then expressed as five different levels of opportunity: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The COI has a wide range of applications and has been used in research investigating childhood resource inequities and the impact of child opportunity on child health.

### Safety / booster seats in pediatric motor vehicle crashes: public health concern [^116BDNMr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend that children ≤ 12-years-old with height < 145 cm should use safety/booster seats. However, national adherence and clinical outcomes for eligible children involved in motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are unknown. We hypothesized that children recommended to use safety/booster seats involved in MVCs have a lower rate of serious injuries if a safety/booster seat is used, compared to children without safety/booster seat.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study queried the 2017–2019 Trauma Quality Improvement Program database for patients ≤ 12-years-old and < 145 cm (recommendation for use of safety/booster seat per American Academy of Pediatrics) presenting after MVC. Serious injury was defined by abbreviated injury scale grade ≥ 3 for any body-region. High-risk MVC was defined by authors in conjunction with definitions provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.

Results

From 8259 cases, 41% used a safety/booster seat. There was no difference in overall rate of serious traumatic injuries or mortality (both p > 0.05) between the safety/booster seat and no safety/booster seat groups. In a subset analysis of high-risk MVCs, the overall use of safety/booster seats was 56%. The rate of serious traumatic injury (53.6% vs. 62.1%, p = 0.017) and operative intervention (15.8% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.039) was lower in the safety/booster seat group compared to the no safety/booster seat group.

Conclusions

Despite AAP guidelines, less than half of recommended children in our study population presenting to a trauma center after MVC used safety/booster seats. Pediatric patients involved in a high-risk MVC suffered more serious injuries and were more likely to require surgical intervention without a safety/booster seat. A public health program to increase adherence to safety/booster seat use within this population appears warranted.

### Is the infant car seat challenge useful? A pilot study in a simulated moving vehicle [^111LsnsY]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study of its kind looking at the physiological cardiorespiratory response in infants seated in a moving car seat.

We have shown that the simulation rig is safe to use and identified physiological disturbances not seen under static conditions in many infants. It may thus be a more accurate predictor of potential cardiorespiratory risk compared with the standard car seat challenge.

The finding that significant potentially adverse physiological effects were more frequent when the infant was at 40° and in motion than when at 30° regardless of which test came first suggests that it is the more upright position and the addition of movement that is responsible rather than an effect of a prolonged period in the sitting position.

We tested infants for up to 30 min — a relatively short journey time; however, some had frequent (up to 16) significant desaturations (< 85% for ≥ 4 s) during this time. The vibration test reproduced motion in a straight line — no bumps, turns, braking or acceleration, so this probably underestimates the effect of travelling on real roads. Previous studies of infants in static car seats have noted that cardiorespiratory problems increase in frequency with longer periods in a car seat.

All infants in our study were healthy but the effects in infants with cardiorespiratory disease or hypotonia may be more marked, as has been shown in the static car seat challenge.

The low muscle tone and prominent occiput of preterm infants may lead to neck flexion and possible airway obstruction when in a car seat, and this may be exacerbated by motion. Some preterm infants with recurrent desaturations flopped forward in an extremely flexed position during motion, raising their heads intermittently but could not maintain a raised head position. The head and shoulders came forward despite shoulder straps, which may be too long for smaller infants allowing some forward movement. While head supports with cut-outs over the occipital area have been shown to reduce neck flexion, further research using them during motion is indicated. Parents often leave their infant alone in the back seat when travelling, and on long journeys the infant may slump forward in this way, resulting in respiratory compromise. Our findings suggest that it may be beneficial on a long journey for an adult to sit with the infant in the back of the car or use a mirror to observe the infant's position.

### Parents' knowledge and socio-demographic determinants toward child's restraint system use [^116o55Hn]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurements

To determine the rate of CRS use, researchers observed the cars and completed a checklist (the use of CSS, booster, and seat belt). The correct way of installing the CRS was based on age (installation of CRS in the front or back seat of the car, and the correct installation of the CRS, forward-facing after 15 months or rear-facing before 15 months, based on the age and body size of the child). The back seat of the car is the safest place to install CRS. The installation of forward-facing CRS in the back seat of the car for children up 15 months, and rear-facing for children under 15 months provide the best protection.

For children over 4, the booster should be placed in the back seat of the car, and the seat belt should be adjusted so that it is away from the child's neck area and across the shoulder, and places over the pelvis.

### Booster seats for child passengers: lessons for increasing their use [^112sUCmZ]. Injury Prevention (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore parental knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and barriers to use of booster seats in cars for 4–8 year old children.

Methods

Three focus groups conducted by a professional marketing firm. Results-Many parents were confused about the appropriate weight and age of children who should be in booster seats; most parents incorrectly identified the age at which it was safe to use a lap-shoulder belt. Legislation was viewed as a positive factor in encouraging use. Cost of seats was frequently cited as a barrier to ownership, as were child resistance, peer pressure from older children, the need to accommodate other children in the vehicle, and the belief that a lap belt was adequate. Messages from health care providers, emergency medical services, or law enforcement personnel were believed to be most effective.

Conclusion

Campaigns to promote booster seat use should address issues of knowledge about appropriate age and size of the child, cost, inadequacy of lap belts, and resistance to use by the child.

### Trends in booster seat use among young children in crashes [^111qnWz5]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Booster seat use in the United States is extremely low among 4- to 8-year-old children, the group targeted for their use. However, more recent attention has been paid to the role of booster seats for children who have outgrown their forward-facing child safety seat. In particular, several states are currently considering upgrades to their child restraint laws to include the use of booster seats for children over 4 years of age.

Objective

To examine recent trends in booster seat use among children involved in automobile crashes in 3 large regions of the United States.

Design

This study was performed as part of the Partners for Child Passenger Safety project, an ongoing, child-specific crash surveillance system that links insurance claims data to telephone survey and crash investigation data. All crashes occurring between December 1, 1998, and November 30, 2000, involving a child occupant between 2 to 8 years of age riding in a model year 1990 or newer vehicle reported to State Farm Insurance Companies from 15 states and Washington, DC, were eligible for this study. A probability sample of eligible crashes was selected for a telephone survey with the driver of the vehicle using a previously validated instrument. The study sample was weighted according to each subject's probability of selection, with analyses conducted on the weighted sample.

Results

The weighted study sample consisted of 53 834 children between 2 to 8 years old, 11.5% of whom were using a booster seat at the time of the crash. Booster seat use peaked at age 3 and dropped dramatically after age 4. Over the period of study, booster seat use among 4- to 8-year-olds increased from 4% to 13%. Among 4-year-olds specifically, booster use increased from 14% to 34%. Among children using booster seats, approximately half used shield boosters and half used belt-positioning boosters.

Conclusions

Although overall booster seat use among the targeted population of 4- to 8-year-old children remains low, significant increases have been noted among specific age groups of children over the past 2 years. These data may be useful to pediatricians, legislators, and educators in efforts to target interventions designed to increase appropriate booster seat use in these children.

### Factors associated with child restraint use in motor vehicle crashes [^116er5iv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are a leading cause of death among children. Multivariable analyses of age-appropriate child restraint system (CRS) use in the "booster-aged" population are needed. The current study identified factors associated with age-appropriate CRS use in fatal MVCs for children 4 to 7 years old, using 2011 to 2015 data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. Of 929 MVC fatalities, 32% of fatally injured children were in an age-appropriate restraint. While age-appropriate CRS use was higher for 4-, 5-, and 6-year-olds relative to 7-year-olds (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 2.57, 2.51, and 2.18, respectively; p < .01 for each comparison), black children (aRR = 0.62; p < .01) relative to white children, and drivers who had not used a lap-shoulder belt (aRR = 0.40; p < .01) relative to belted drivers were associated with lower levels of age-appropriate CRS use. Our findings underscore the continued importance of communicating best practice guidelines on CRSs to caregivers of young children.

### Australian parental decisions about transitioning children from booster seats in a randomised trial: greater support may be needed [^112h9VSi]. Injury Prevention (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Premature graduation to an adult seatbelt is common and detrimental to optimal crash protection. While there is an existing tool (the 5-step test) to support a parent's decision to graduate their child, its effectiveness is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 5-step test.

Method

A randomised controlled design was used. Participants were parents of children aged 7–12 years. After exposure to information about the 5-step test or control material, participants assessed belt fit in three seating conditions and 'thought aloud' while making their assessment. Seating conditions provided a good, poor and partially good seatbelt fit based on the child's anthropometry. Participants were also assessed on their knowledge of good seatbelt fit criteria.

Results

Participants exposed to the 5-step test (n = 18) had significantly improved their knowledge of the criteria required to achieve good seatbelt with, on average, 1.0 higher score in the 6-point assessment (95%CI 0.23 to 1.7, p = 0.012) than those in the control group. There was also a greater percentage of participants in this group (44.4% intervention vs 27.8% control) who made accurate decisions about seatbelt fit, but this difference did not reach significance (OR 2.08, 95% CI 0.52 to 8.34).

Conclusion

The results demonstrate that the 5-step test is effective in improving knowledge but are inconclusive about its effectiveness in promoting accurate decision-making. However, the proportion of participants making accurate decisions in the intervention group remained low. This suggests that parents may require greater assistance than what is currently provided.

### Parental knowledge of appropriate placement of child restraint systems before and after educational intervention in a pediatric emergency department [^112h66Uh]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine caregiver's knowledge of appropriate car restraint systems (CRSs) use and compare this with the actual use among children presenting to the pediatric emergency department (PED), and to determine the efficacy of PED-based intervention on improving knowledge.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, intervention study of children (< 8 years old) during a 12-month period in the PED. Based on their height and weight, children were assigned to group 1 (rear facing), group 2 (forward facing), or group 3 (booster). Caregivers were surveyed in their baseline CRS knowledge. Certified child passenger safety technicians evaluated each CRS and gave caregivers one-on-one education. Participants were called back to answer a posttest to determine if the information given was retained.

Results

Of the 170 children enrolled, 64 (37.6%) were assigned to group 1, 68 (40%) to group 2, and 38 (22.3%) to group 3. Of these, 63% were not aware of the state law regarding CRS use. Among those without a CRS, 18% belonged to group 1, 36% to group 2, and 46% to group 3. Even among those who reportedly had CRS, 13% of children did not have one-on-on inspection. After inspection, 84% of group 1, 71% of group 2, and 70% of group 3 were in the appropriate one. Nearly 45% were not compliant with American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines of children riding in rear-facing CRS until 2 years of age.

Conclusions

A significant proportion of children visiting the PED are not in appropriate CRS, and caretaker knowledge about correct CRS types and installation is poor. Future educational efforts should focus on rear-facing and booster seat age-group children.

### Is the infant car seat challenge useful? A pilot study in a simulated moving vehicle [^114SNrXE]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This is a unique pilot study — the first to look at the physiological effect of vibration on infants in a car safety seat. The standard static car seat challenge currently used in hospitals does not reflect the angle or motion of the journey undertaken by the infant. The infant, in a seat placed at the more upright 40° position plus vibration experienced in a car, shows significantly increased HR, RR and decreased SpO 2. Simulating motion reveals a striking increase in potentially clinically significant oxygen desaturations. Surprisingly these differences were similar in term and preterm infants.

The motion simulator offers the possibility of further investigation of the potential benefits and limitations of various designs of infant car seats. This may lead to a revision of current recommendations for testing infants' suitability for travel in an infant car seat and also have implications for the design of car seats for newborn infants.

### Management of cervical spine injuries in young children: lessons learned [^115Y7LEc]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that the correct use of car safety seats can protect infants and children from vehicular injury. Although child passenger devices are increasingly used in the US, motor vehicle crashes continue to be the leading cause of death and acquired disability in infants and children younger than 14 years of age. These events are likely related, at least in part, to the high percentage of children who are unrestrained or improperly restrained. The authors present 2 cases of severe cervical spine trauma in young children restrained in car safety seats during a motor vehicle crash: 1) a previously healthy 14-month-old girl who was improperly restrained in a forward-facing booster seat secured to the vehicle by a lap belt, and 2) a previously healthy 30-month-old girl who was a rear seat passenger restrained in a car safety seat. This study points out the unique challenges encountered in treating cervical spine injuries in infants and young children, as well as the lessons learned, and emphasizes the significance of continuing efforts to increase family and public awareness regarding the importance of appropriate child safety seat selection and use.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114gmt6o]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Abuse and maltreatment definitions — Abuse/Maltreatment is any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a patient of any age group, and EMS clinicians should have a heightened awareness for vulnerable populations which include, but is not limited to, children, elderly, and adults with mental or physical disabilities. Child Abuse/Maltreatment states that child maltreatment includes any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child; an act of commission (child abuse) is the physical, sexual, or emotional maltreatment or neglect of a child or children; and an act of omission (child neglect) includes, but is not limited to, failure to provide for the child's needs (e.g., physical, emotional, medical/dental, and educational neglect) and failure to supervise (e.g., inadequate supervision or safety precautions, lack of appropriate car seat use, and exposure to violent or dangerous environments). Human Trafficking is when people are abducted or coerced into service (e.g., being forced into servitude without compensation and/or prostitution), and signs may include, but are not limited to, patient with branding/tattoos and environmental clues such as padlocks and/or doorknobs removed on interior doors and intact windows that are boarded up.

### Safe transportation in-spica following surgical treatment of infantile DDH: solutions and threats [^115znSrV]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Government regulations mandate appropriate vehicular restraints for children under 4 years of age. Patients treated for infantile developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) with spica casts often require special accommodations. Previous work suggests that car seat loaner programs may help achieve these goals while avoiding the need for costly ambulance transportation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our center's experience with postdischarge transportation in a large population of DDH infants and identify future threats to our program.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients 4 years or younger of age who underwent closed or open reduction for DDH at our center between 2011 and 2018. Only the initial surgery of staged procedures was included. Patient demographic factors were recorded, as were procedure type, final restraint used for postdischarge transportation, and any potential discharge delays secondary to transportation issues. Costs were compared amongst transportation options.

Results

Our cohort consisted of 130 patients (mean age, 1.4 ± 0.9y; 98 females) treated for DDH. In total 41 children (31.5%) underwent closed reduction procedures, whereas 89 patients (68.5%) underwent open reductions. After reduction, 62 (47.7%) received 2-legged spica casts and 68 (52.3%) received 1.5-legged casts. The most common restraint was a hospital-loaned Hippo car seat (73, 55.8%) followed by family-owned car seats (27, 20.8%). Eight patients (6.2%) experienced delays in discharge while waiting for adequate restraints, 6 patients (4.6%) were transported by ambulance, and 4 patients (3.1%) left against medical advice with inadequate restraints.

Conclusions

Following surgical treatment of DDH, over 50% of patients with a spica cast were discharged using our center's car seat loaner program. However, availability and cost can present barriers for patients, with 4.6% of patients still being transported home by ambulance and 3.1% with inadequate restraints against medical advice. Costs of car seats are significant both for patients' families intending to purchase them, as well as for hospitals maintaining loaner programs and replacing used/lost seats. Moving forward, the recent cessation of production of the most common "spica car seat" threatens the longevity of existing loaner programs and calls renewed attention to the issue of safe transportation in-spica from providers and car-seat manufacturers alike.

### Is the infant car seat challenge useful? A pilot study in a simulated moving vehicle [^1139rCN5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Motion simulator

A motion simulator was developed to reproduce vertical vibration broadly representative of that at the base of a car safety seat fixed in a rear-facing position in the back seat of a small family car (see figure 1 and online supplementary video 1). The angle of fixation was approximately 40° to the horizontal, using the standard Isofix system. The simulator was designed, manufactured and tested by the Human Factors Research Unit within the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research at the University of Southampton and received ethical approval for use in neonates. The simulator reproduced the vertical vibrations from travelling at 30 mph on a straight urban road, excluding braking, acceleration or going over bumps (see online supplementary appendix 2).

Figure 1
Car seat motion simulator with controls.

Infant monitoring

Physiological recordings were made using a 'capnocheck' recording system (Oxi-pulse sleep capnograph, Pulmolink UK) allowing continuous recording of inspiratory and expiratory carbon dioxide levels (EtCO 2), oxygen saturation (SpO 2), respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR), sampled at 1 s intervals. The monitor has an artefact rejection programme designed to cope with movement. All infants were constantly observed by an experienced neonatal nurse and/or doctor. A report was generated for each infant in each position using the PROFOX Respiratory Oximetry Software.

If any significant episodes of apnoea (more than 15 s) or oxygen desaturation (< 85% for more than 20 s) were observed, the test was immediately stopped. These pragmatic cut-offs were chosen to minimise responses to minor, artefactual or self-limiting apnoea or desaturation while ensuring a prompt response to more significant episodes and minimising any risk to the infant. Resuscitation equipment and trained personnel were available immediately.

### Child seat belt guidelines: examining the 4 feet 9 inches rule as the standard [^11789AYu]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations regarding transition from child safety/booster seat to adult safety belt use indicate that children should be at least 4 feet 9 inches, 8 years old, or 80 pounds. Proper fit in the vehicle seat, assessed with a five-point fit test, should also be met. Although most children reach 4 feet 9 inches around age 8 years, each child and vehicle presents a unique combination; thus a child may not fit appropriately in all vehicle types using only the 4 feet 9 inches requirement.

Methods

We enrolled children, aged 7 years to 12 years, into our study. Height, weight, and demographic data were obtained. A Child Passenger Safety Technician then performed the five-point fit test in each of a uniform lineup of five vehicles. Data were collected on fit in the standard vehicle seat and also in a booster seat. We set 90% as the threshold proportion of children who meet all criteria for proper fit to validate current recommendations of a height of 4 feet 9 inches.

Results

Data were collected on 388 children. The percentage of 90% proper fit was met in the compact car and small sport-utility vehicle (SUV). However, only 80 (77%) of 104 students (p < 0.0001) that were 4 feet 9 inches or higher fit properly in the large SUV, only 87 (83%) of 105 students (p = 0.02) fit properly in the pickup truck, and only 91 (89%) of 102 students (p = 0.74) fit properly in the minivan.

Conclusion

Substantial proportions of children meeting current height guidelines for an adult seat belt do not meet safety requirements for fit, especially in larger, commonly used vehicles (large SUVs and trucks). This emphasizes the need for evaluation of fit by a trained personnel and/or development of standard back seat dimensions in all vehicles for maximum safety.

### Systems-based care of the injured child: technical report [^117MkB9u]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

INJURY PREVENTION

Injury prevention is the cornerstone of pediatric trauma care. The field of injury prevention uses scientific principles to identify areas for intervention and best practices. The Haddon matrix is a popular systematic approach to injury prevention, analyzing injuries by considering how the host (i.e. child) is susceptible to or injured by an agent (e.g. motor vehicle, firearm) in a specific environment (e.g. physical, social, economic) and in three different temporal phases: preinjury, during the injury event, and postinjury. Building on the Haddon matrix, an injury equity framework was recently designed to "provide clinicians, researchers, public health professionals, and policy-makers a theoretical basis for identifying and analyzing factors that influence who is injured, the severity of the injury, and the injury outcome using an equity lens". The framework highlights the intersectionality between historical and current societal factors and community, family, and individual factors within the Haddon matrix structure. Overall, a multipronged approach to injury prevention is essential and may include legislation, advancing safety technology, improving the built environment (e.g. parks, roadways), addressing risk factors related to a child's environment (e.g. home, school), anticipatory guidance, and education of caregivers. Furthermore, interventions should be evidence based and equity focused.

Mechanism- and community-specific injury prevention initiatives have a long history of success, including the traffic safety, safe storage of firearms, window falls, and car seat programs, to name a few.– More than 20 years ago, Dr. Maureen Durkin and colleaguesstudied the incidence of severe traffic injuries before and after a community-based intervention involving the creation of safe and accessible play areas, traffic safety education, and supervised activities for school-aged children. During the intervention period, a 36% unadjusted reduction in the incidence of traffic injuries to school-aged children was observed (rate ratio [RR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58–0.72). Comparable reductions in traffic-related injuries were not identified in younger children (aged 0–4 years) or school-aged children who were not targeted by the program or for traffic fatalities involving school-aged residents in other communities in the city. Policy-based injury prevention efforts that were legislated to become state or federal statutes have proven some of the most effective, including seat belt and child passenger safety legislation.

### Booster seat effectiveness among older children: evidence from Washington state [^114R2gNG]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that children as old as 12 years use a booster seat when riding in motor vehicles, yet little is known about booster seat effectiveness when used by older children. This study estimated the association between booster use and injuries among children aged 8–12 years who were involved in motor vehicle crashes.

Methods

Researchers analyzed data on all motor vehicle crashes involving children aged 8–12 years reported to the Washington State Department of Transportation from 2002 to 2015. Data were collected in 2015 and analyzed in 2016. Children who were in a booster seat were compared with children restrained by a seat belt alone. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.

Results

In unadjusted models, booster use was associated with a 29% reduction in the odds of experiencing any injury versus riding in a seat belt alone (OR = 0.709, 95% CI = 0.675, 0.745). In models adjusted for potential confounders, booster use was associated with a 19% reduction in the odds of any injury relative to riding in a seat belt alone (OR = 0.814, 95% CI = 0.749, 0.884). The risk of experiencing an incapacitating/fatal injury was not associated with booster use.

Conclusions

Children aged 8–12 years involved in a motor vehicle crash are less likely to be injured if in a booster than if restrained by a seat belt alone. Because only 10% of U.S. children aged 8–12 years use booster seats, policies encouraging their use could lead to fewer injuries.

### Methodological considerations in MVC epidemiological research [^1151hXsb]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of policy challenges

Evaluation of policy interventions related to road safety, for example, booster seat legislation, graduated driver licensing and speed limit reductions — can be challenging largely because of the time lag between legislative intervention and outcome. The literature suggests that the time frame for the impact of policy interventions on safety metrics may be years, if not decades. The other major challenge in the evaluation of policy interventions is attributing causality. For example, provinces in Canada with booster seat legislation have shown a decrease in child occupant MVC injuries over time following the legislative change. It is difficult however, to attribute the decline in child occupant MVC injuries to policy change alone as the change may also be related to safer vehicles, built environment changes, health services utilisation and population density. Comprehensive and systematic collection of baseline data and the use of appropriate control locations in pre/post-studies is required to ensure that estimation of the effectiveness of any programme, intervention or policy on MVC injury rates is as robust as possible.

Recommendations and future directions

Combining multiple sources of collision-related data would ensure a more comprehensive representation of the collision event. For example, linking police-reported collision data with hospitalisation records, weather data, traffic volume data and insurance claims would allow better insights into mechanism, injury severity and long-term outcomes. Almost 20 years ago, Durbin et al published a paper on such an initiative, that combined insurance claims data with telephone survey and police-reported investigation data to create the first large-scale child-focused MVC surveillance system in the USA, called the partners for child passenger safety. This collaboration led to epidemiologically sound estimates of the protective effect of seating position and restraintsand the effectiveness of forward facing child restraintsand booster seats.

The current focus on 'big data' and 'machine learning' in the clinical and research contexts may also be of value in MVC research. Data streams generated by GPS embedded in vehicles, phones and other devices could potentially be used to create rich, detailed exposure data for all classes of road users. Data streams from closed circuit TV cameras installed for traffic monitoring could be used to generate data on exposure and collisions. The wealth of data captured by SHRP 2 NDS will require sophisticated statistical approaches to analyse and interpret the data. Analysing and interpreting these large data streams will likely require application of artificial intelligence/machine-learning algorithms in combination with traditional multivariate statistical methods.

### Hazardous use of car seats outside the car in the United States, 2003–2007 [^114s38fw]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Car seats should be used to prevent injury or death in children during motor vehicle crashes. When used improperly or for unintended purposes, car seats can place children at risk for injury or death. The objective of this article is to describe patterns of hazardous use of car seats outside the car for infants (< 1-year-olds) in the United States from 2003 to 2007.

Methods

The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission database was accessed to obtain information regarding car seat-related injuries treated in emergency departments from 2003 to 2007. Injuries sustained during motor vehicle crashes were excluded. Demographic data, type of injury, body location, disposition, injury circumstances, and other pertinent information were extracted and analyzed.

Results

An estimated 43 562 car seat-related injuries were treated in emergency departments from 2003 to 2007. This national estimate was based on a weighted sample of 1898 infants. The average age of these infants was 4.07 ± 2.73 months, 62.4% of the injuries occurred in infants younger than 4 months, and 54.4% occurred in boys. Of these injuries, 49.1% occurred at home, 8.4% of the infants had to be hospitalized, and 84.3% of the infants suffered a head injury. The most common mechanisms of injury were infants falling from car seats, car seats falling from elevated surfaces, and car seats overturning on soft surfaces.

Conclusions

Injury-prevention efforts should be focused on eliminating hazardous use of car seats outside the car. Caregivers should be cautioned against the placement of car seats on elevated or soft surfaces.
