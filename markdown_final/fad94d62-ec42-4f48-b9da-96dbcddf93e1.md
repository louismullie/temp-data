## Question

What are the treatment options for mycosis fungoides?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for mycosis fungoides. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about disease context and staging because TNMB drives therapy and prognosis. Then, I should verify treatment goals for early versus advanced stages. Next, I will review first-line skin-directed options for IA–IIA disease, followed by systemic options for IIB–IV disease and Sézary syndrome. I will then examine radiotherapy roles, transplant considerations, response criteria and monitoring, and finally integrate investigational agents and a concise decision algorithm, ensuring each step is evidence-linked and stage-adapted [^111ihEjg] [^112G3CWj] [^111FNcVG].

> Let me first confirm the disease context and staging framework. Mycosis fungoides is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, with a typically indolent natural history that progresses through patch, plaque, and tumor phases, and treatment is fundamentally stage adapted using the TNMB system, which distinguishes skin burden, nodal, visceral, and blood involvement and thereby separates early-stage IA–IIA disease from advanced-stage IIB–IV disease, necessitating different therapeutic strategies [^111ihEjg] [^1145ALkw] [^1143K93i]. Hold on, I should verify the threshold for "advanced": yes, tumor-stage cutaneous disease is stage IIB and marks the pivot to systemic therapy paradigms, not IA–IIA, which remains skin-directed in most cases [^111ihEjg].

> Next, I should review treatment philosophy and goals. For early-stage IA–IIA disease, goals prioritize symptom control, quality of life, and minimizing toxicity, where watchful waiting can be reasonable if stable and asymptomatic, whereas for advanced-stage IIB–IV disease the emphasis shifts to disease control, delaying progression, and maintaining quality of life through sequential systemic options in a multidisciplinary setting that includes dermatology, dermatopathology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology [^112GLcKv] [^116PJsTf] [^111FNcVG]. Wait, let me verify that systemic therapy does not improve survival in early-stage disease; guideline consensus supports conservative, stage-adapted approaches without early systemic escalation in IA–IIA patients [^112GLcKv].

> I will now examine first-line skin-directed therapies for IA–IIA MF. High-potency topical corticosteroids are appropriate for patches and thin plaques, phototherapy with NB-UVB for patch or very thin plaque disease and PUVA for thicker plaques or skin of color are foundational, and topical alkylators such as mechlorethamine gel are FDA-approved for stage IA/IB after prior skin-directed therapy, while carmustine and topical retinoids such as bexarotene gel are options for refractory lesions; localized radiotherapy at curative doses can be offered for unilesional disease, and low-dose localized RT can palliate isolated symptomatic sites [^112dw6kf] [^112pLtYc] [^1113KsZ8] [^111ihEjg]. I should double-check the PUVA data in early disease; retrospective bath-PUVA series report high complete response rates in IA/IB MF, supporting its role when available, though randomized data are limited [^112uoD9d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding systemic therapies too early. In early-stage MF, prospective comparative data and guideline syntheses indicate that skin-directed therapy achieves superior overall response rates and that early use of systemic agents or chemotherapy does not improve survival, with chemotherapy responses typically short-lived, reinforcing SDT as the standard in IA–IIA unless refractory or intolerant [^113rEDuw] [^112GLcKv] [^1175Kzwk]. Wait, let me verify the durability issue; multiple guidance documents caution that cytotoxic responses in CTCL are brief and best reserved for refractory or more advanced disease, aligning practice toward sequential, lower-toxicity options first [^1175Kzwk] [^113gvf3w].

> For advanced-stage disease, I will now review key systemic options. Brentuximab vedotin is FDA-approved in previously treated CD30-positive CTCL; ALCANZA showed significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with methotrexate or bexarotene, with meaningful ORR4 in MF including tumor-stage disease, and exploratory analyses suggest benefit across a range of CD30 expression, although testing variability must be acknowledged [^116hWByC]. Mogamulizumab, a CCR4-directed antibody, is FDA-approved after at least one prior systemic therapy in MF and Sézary syndrome and is notably active in blood involvement, making it particularly relevant for SS and erythrodermic disease [^115Yua98]. Wait, I should confirm histone deacetylase inhibitors; romidepsin demonstrates approximately 38% overall response with median response duration exceeding one year in advanced disease, and dose-attenuated maintenance can maintain durable remissions in a subset [^112aFh1a].

> Let me consider other systemic backbones and traditional agents. Oral bexarotene and interferon-alpha are widely used immunomodulatory options often employed early in systemic sequencing for IIB–IV disease, while low-dose methotrexate is an FDA-labeled option for MF and available in oral liquid and tablet formulations, supporting flexibility in dosing across the disease spectrum; denileukin diftitox has historical activity in CD25-expressing CTCL, though access and formulation have varied over time [^1133RGYK] [^1124m14o] [^116JJh5f] [^116S8VDe]. I need to ensure chemotherapy is framed properly; single-agent regimens such as gemcitabine or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin are considered for refractory or advanced cases, but multi-agent chemotherapy should be reserved for stage IV with nodal or visceral involvement or widespread tumor-stage unresponsive to other approaches due to limited durability and toxicity [^1175Kzwk] [^113gvf3w].

> Now, I should review radiation therapy integration across stages. MF is radiosensitive, and for localized lesions, curative-intent local RT at 20–24 Gy is recommended in unilesional MF, while for symptom relief or limited tumor foci, palliative doses of at least 8 Gy are appropriate; in extensive cutaneous involvement, total skin electron beam therapy is effective, with low-dose 10–12 Gy schedules offering lower toxicity and retreatment feasibility and higher-dose 30–36 Gy used selectively [^111ihEjg] [^1146JLNH] [^114RiQUd]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify that RT remains adjunctive even in advanced disease; indeed, TSEBT can be combined with systemic maintenance in stage IIB–IV for improved control while preserving quality of life, consistent with conservative, stage-adapted strategy [^114RiQUd] [^112GLcKv].

> I will now examine Sézary syndrome-specific management. First-line therapy commonly includes extracorporeal photopheresis alone or in combination with interferon-alpha or retinoids, given the leukemic compartment, while mogamulizumab provides targeted activity against CCR4-positive Sézary cells, and low-dose subcutaneous alemtuzumab has shown high response rates with fewer infectious complications than conventional dosing, though infectious risk mandates vigilant prophylaxis and monitoring [^1165J6XT] [^115Yua98] [^112yGeLf]. Hold on, I should verify second-line guidance; ESMO includes low-dose alemtuzumab and single-agent chemotherapy in selected refractory SS, but careful selection is critical due to toxicity and limited durability [^111iEwce].

> Next, I should address allogeneic transplantation. For appropriate candidates with high-risk features such as N3 nodal involvement or visceral disease, referral for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation can be considered as consolidation, ideally after achieving cytoreduction with systemic therapy, recognizing the potential for graft-versus-lymphoma effect and non-relapse mortality tradeoffs, and exercising caution with recent exposure to mogamulizumab or PD-1 inhibitors due to increased risk of graft-versus-host disease [^1142XQac] [^116boaZU]. Wait, let me reconsider timing; earlier-phase transplant after fewer prior lines may reduce relapse and improve survival in selected series, but patient selection and conditioning intensity remain individualized [^112buFse].

> I need to ensure standardized assessment and monitoring are incorporated. Baseline and serial evaluations should follow ISCL/USCLC/EORTC consensus, documenting skin, nodes, blood, and viscera with uniform response criteria, and clinicians should remain vigilant for large-cell transformation, which carries prognostic implications and may recalibrate treatment urgency and modality [^112G3CWj] [^1143K93i]. Let me double-check imaging triggers; cross-sectional imaging is typically reserved for advanced-stage disease or when symptoms, exam, or labs suggest extracutaneous spread, aligning with stage-adapted practice [^111ihEjg].

> I will now integrate emerging and investigational approaches. PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have produced durable responses in small series and case reports, including post-transplant settings and in combination with palliative RT, but their role remains evolving and must be balanced with transplant-related GvHD considerations and the paucity of randomized data, underscoring the importance of clinical trial enrollment whenever feasible [^113jGg86] [^1139pSG9] [^116boaZU]. But wait, what if checkpoint inhibition is considered prior to allo-HCT; I should confirm timing and washout policies within institutional protocols to mitigate post-transplant immune toxicities [^116boaZU].

> Let me summarize a practical, stage-adapted decision pathway. For IA–IIA disease, prioritize skin-directed therapy such as topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, topical alkylators or retinoids, and local RT for focal lesions, reserving systemic agents for refractory or intolerant disease; for IIB tumor-stage disease, consider brentuximab vedotin particularly with CD30 expression, oral bexarotene or interferon-alpha, low-dose TSEBT, and localized RT to symptomatic tumors; for erythrodermic MF and Sézary syndrome, employ ECP combinations, mogamulizumab, and consider low-dose alemtuzumab in carefully selected patients; for stage IV or visceral/nodal involvement, use single-agent chemotherapy or targeted agents, reserve multi-agent chemotherapy for select refractory stage IV cases, and consider referral for allogeneic transplant in eligible high-risk patients [^112GLcKv] [^116hWByC] [^1165J6XT] [^113gvf3w] [^1142XQac]. I should confirm that clinical trials are recommended across stages due to limited durability of standard therapies; guidelines and contemporary reviews consistently emphasize trial participation to access novel targeted and immune approaches [^111FNcVG].

> Finally, I need to ensure supportive care and quality-of-life measures are embedded. Pruritus control, infection prophylaxis when immunosuppressive regimens are used, management of skin barrier dysfunction, and coordinated multidisciplinary follow-up are essential, with the recognition that stable disease may be an acceptable outcome in limited-stage patients if toxicity is minimized and symptoms improve, consistent with a conservative, risk-adapted philosophy [^111FNcVG] [^112GLcKv]. Hold on, I should verify one last point: while responses to many agents are not complete or durable, careful sequencing and recycling in select cases can maintain control over years, aligning expectations with the chronic, relapsing nature of CTCL [^111FNcVG].

Given the promising response rates observed with brentuximab vedotin (BV) in phase II studies, a randomized phase III clinical trial (ALCANZA) comparing BV with an investigator's choice (methotrexate or bexarotene) was performed. The trial demonstrated a significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) (> 12 months vs. 3.5 months) for patients randomized to BV, leading to its FDA approval in previously treated cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Among mycosis fungoides (MF) patients with limited-stage disease treated with BV, a response lasting at least 4 months (ORR4) was observed in 40%, whereas an ORR4 of 63% was observed among patients with tumor-stage (stage IIB) disease. Consistent with prior experience in "CD30 high" lymphomas, an ORR4 of 89% was observed among patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with disease confined to the skin.

More recently, with a median follow-up of 46 months, the final ALCANZA data confirm the benefit associated with BV. Among MF patients, the median PFS in BV-treated patients was 16.1 months, compared with 3.5 months in those treated with either methotrexate or bexarotene. Not surprisingly, one year following treatment, 34.5% of BV patients required treatment with an alternative systemic agent, whereas 86.6% of methotrexate or bexarotene-treated patients required an alternative therapy. The benefit associated with BV was observed independently of CD30 expression or the presence of large cell transformation. Standard immunohistochemistry may underestimate the extent of CD30 expression, and significant intra-patient variability in CD30 expression over time and across disease sites is noted.

Phototherapy is an important treatment modality that may be used alone or in combination with topical therapies in patients with limited-stage disease. It includes narrowband UVB (NBUVB, 311 nm) and 8-methoxypsoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). NBUVB is used in both patch and plaque stage mycosis fungoides (MF). PUVA is the modality of choice in skin of color. Phototherapy is widely available and has demonstrated efficacy in many retrospective and prospective studies, and a comprehensive consensus statement on the use of phototherapy was recently published.

MF and Sézary syndrome (SS) are radiosensitive. Thus, radiation therapy with curative intent may be considered in patients with localized, unilesional MF. For those with more widespread disease, palliative local radiation or low-dose total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) are effective.

Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). High credibility.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS), the major forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, have unique characteristics that distinguish them from other types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Clinical trials in MF/SS have suffered from a lack of standardization in evaluation, staging, assessment, endpoints, and response criteria. Recently defined criteria for the diagnosis of early MF, guidelines for initial evaluation, and revised staging and classification criteria for MF and SS now offer the potential for uniform staging of patients enrolled in clinical trials for MF/SS.

This article presents consensus recommendations for the general conduct of clinical trials of patients with MF/SS, as well as methods for standardized assessment of potential disease manifestations in skin, lymph nodes, blood, and visceral organs, and definition of endpoints and response criteria. These guidelines should facilitate collaboration among investigators and collation of data from sponsor-generated or investigator-initiated clinical trials involving patients with MF or SS.

### Defining early mycosis fungoides [^115iKgU2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This editorial review summarizes the results of five meetings sponsored by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma at which the clinicopathologic and ancillary features of early mycosis fungoides were critically examined. Based on this analysis, an algorithm was developed for the diagnosis of early mycosis fungoides involving a holistic integration of clinical, histopathologic, immunopathologic, and molecular biological characteristics. A novel aspect of this algorithm is that it relies on multiple types of criteria rather than just one, for example, histopathology. Before its finalization, the proposed diagnostic algorithm will require validation and possibly further refinement at multiple centers during the next several years. It is anticipated that a more standardized approach to the diagnosis of early mycosis fungoides will have a beneficial impact on the epidemiology, prognostication, treatment, and analysis of clinical trials pertaining to this most common type of cutaneous lymphoma.

- **Single-agent chemotherapy**: Options include gemcitabine or PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin.
- **Multi-agent chemotherapy**: Utilize a combination of chemotherapeutic agents.
- **Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT)**: Consider allo-SCT as a therapeutic option.

### Successful treatment of patch type mycosis fungoides with tacrolimus ointment 0.1% [^113Yzvgk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders caused by clonally-derived, skin-invasive T cells. A variety of skin-directed and systemic therapies are available to treat mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (MF/SS), with therapeutic choices guided by the stage of the disease.

A 29-year-old man presented at our clinic with pruritic, erythematous macules located on the sternum and the lower back. Histological findings and immunohistochemistry studies showed patch stage MF. The patient was treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.1% twice daily for one month, achieving complete remission. Three months after the first episode, a relapse was successfully treated with the same therapeutic regimen.

Tacrolimus is an immunomodulatory macrolide that reduces the stimulatory capacity toward T cells and is therefore worth investigating as a treatment for CTCL. Topical tacrolimus has been related to unknown effects with a risk for secondary malignancies, including CTCL. Additionally, black box warnings have been proposed by the FDA for topical calcineurin inhibitors. Nevertheless, our results in treating early-stage MF are in agreement with other unpublished data that have observed its efficacy. To our knowledge, there is no other case of patch type mycosis fungoides treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.1% in the medical literature.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^115vgzmk]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

The genetic and molecular pathogenesis of both cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL) and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) has been informed by next-generation sequencing efforts, many of which have been recently reviewed elsewhere. Alterations involving lymphocyte-specific signaling pathways (including antigen- and cytokine-receptor dependent), epigenetic and chromatin remodeling proteins, and cell cycle regulators are recurrently involved and have therapeutic implications. Disruption of the skin barrier and the skin microbiome are clinically and therapeutically relevant considerations, at least in CTCL, while localized (within the lymphoma microenvironment) and systemic (the "macroenvironment") immune dysregulation has a pathogenic role in both CBCL and CTCL.

### Pegylated interferon combined with low-dose total skin electron beam therapy for advanced stage mycosis fungoides: Two case reports and literature review [^112HEgae]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective option in mycosis fungoides (MF). Low-dose radiation regimens have demonstrated adequate disease control with a reasonable toxicity profile. The treatment approach for patients with early-stage MF is associated with long-term remission. However, advanced-stage MF is generally palliative except on some rare occasions following bone marrow transplantation. Nevertheless, the responses in advanced stages are usually brief. Recent reports suggest that low-dose total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) combined with maintenance treatments may improve clinical outcomes and prolong response durations.

Interferons (IFNs) are natural polypeptides orchestrated by eukaryotic cells after stimulation by various factors and exert cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects. The common types of IFNs are produced by recombinant DNA technology. Although randomized trials evaluating the use of IFNs in MF are lacking, investigators have demonstrated their effectiveness in different clinical scenarios and disease stages. Regarding the mechanism of action, IFN alpha ameliorates several immune defects and activates CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. Additionally, IFNs can augment cytotoxicity by releasing danger signals. Conceptually, the consideration of combination therapy of advanced-stage MF patients is reasonable. This publication reports the effectiveness and tolerability of low-dose TSEBT and pegylated IFN alpha-2a combination therapy in 2 cases with advanced-stage MF.

### British Association of Dermatologists and U.K. Cutaneous Lymphoma Group guidelines for the management of primary cutaneous lymphomas 2018 [^116fhs2b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2019 guidelines address the medical management of mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome, with a particular focus on advanced-stage disease. These guidelines emphasize the need to recognize the unpredictable clinical course in patients with stage IIB mycosis fungoides.

- **Management options**: Some patients develop only small and infrequent skin tumors that respond well to localized radiotherapy and other skin-directed therapy options for persistent patches and plaques. Other patients may develop extensive bulky skin tumors, leading to a rapidly progressive disease that requires total skin electron beam therapy and systemic chemotherapy.

### Primary cutaneous lymphomas: ESMO clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^112pLtYc]. Annals of Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome, specifically with respect to the management of early-stage disease and skin-directed therapy, the ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend considering NB-UVB for patients with patches or very thin plaques. Prefer PUVA therapy for patients with thicker plaques.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^113rEDuw]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of limited-stage**: As the majority of CTCL patients present with patch/plaque stage MF and have an excellent prognosis, the initial goal of therapy is to improve symptoms and quality of life while avoiding treatment‐related toxicity. For many patients, this may involve either expectant management (i.e. "watch and wait") or skin‐directed therapies. Systemic therapies do not increase response rates or survival in these patients.

	- An international prospective study compared skin‐directed therapies (topical steroids, ultraviolet B, psoralen and ultraviolet A, topical nitrogen mustard, topical carmustine, and local radiotherapy) to systemic therapy (oral retinoids, oral bexarotene, methotrexate, interferon, and extracorporeal photochemotherapy) in early‐stage MF. Patients receiving skin‐directed therapy had a superior overall response rate.

	- The limited efficacy associated with chemotherapy has been highlighted in retrospective studies in which the median time to next treatment following single or multiagent chemotherapy was ≤ 4 months. Therefore, patients with limited‐stage disease who require therapy are best approached with skin‐directed therapies, usually under the direction of a dermatologist and/or radiation oncologist. Excellent reviews and treatment guidelines are available.

### Systemic treatment options for advanced-stage mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome [^114tBSSr]. Current Oncology Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Globally, the most common subtypes of CTCL are mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. CTCL can confer significant morbidity and even mortality in advanced disease. Here we review potential and future treatments for advanced-stage CTCL.

Heterogeneity of treatment choice has been demonstrated both in US and non-US centers. Systemic treatment choice is currently guided by prognostic features, incorporating stage, immunophenotypic and molecular findings, and patient-specific factors such as age and comorbidities. Randomized controlled studies are uncommon, and the literature is composed predominantly of retrospective, cohort, and early-phase studies. International consensus guidelines are available; however, the lack of comparative trials means that there is no clear algorithmic approach to treatment. This review reports on the systemic treatment options in use for advanced CTCL and on possible future therapies, acknowledging that an algorithmic approach is not yet forthcoming to guide treatment prioritization.

### Mycosis fungoides diagnosed after exposure to risankizumab for psoriasis [^1131gtvu]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Biologics are increasingly used to treat inflammatory dermatoses, yet concerns have been raised about their long-term safety. There is an established link between tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and several reports describe worsening CTCL after exposure to other cytokine blockers. We present a patient who was diagnosed with mycosis fungoides (MF) after treatment with risankizumab, an IL-23 inhibitor, for psoriasis.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^111wHvMz]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

The definitive diagnosis of mycosis fungoides (MF), particularly in the patch/plaque stage, is challenging, as many clinical and pathologic features are non-specific and overlap with reactive processes. Many patients have experienced symptoms attributed to eczema, psoriasis, or parapsoriasis for years prior to obtaining a definitive diagnosis. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis in retrospective series is 3–4 years, but may exceed four decades. During this time, patients may be misdiagnosed with, and in some cases treated for, other conditions, particularly atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

Given the importance of clinicopathological correlation in diagnosing MF and the variable association of specific histopathologic findings with the diagnosis, biopsy reports are often "suggestive of" rather than definitive. This uncertainty implied in biopsy reports and the apparent lack of a more definitive histopathologic diagnosis can be a source of frustration for clinicians less familiar with the challenges of rendering a pathologic diagnosis of MF.

Furthermore, treatment with skin-directed therapies at the time of biopsy, including topical corticosteroids, may diminish or eliminate neoplastic T-cells and other critical histopathologic findings for 2–4 weeks, further complicating the diagnostic challenge. Drug reactions, chronic spongiotic dermatitis, connective tissue diseases, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, and pigmented purpuric dermatoses are just a few conditions that add to the complexity of diagnosing MF.

### Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas other than mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Part II: Prognosis and management [^115vYGDC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) other than mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) encompass a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas with variable clinical courses, prognoses, and management approaches. Given the morphologic and histologic overlap among the CTCL subtypes and other T-cell lymphomas with cutaneous manifestations, thorough evaluation with clinicopathologic correlation and exclusion of systemic involvement are essential prior to initiating therapy. Staging and treatment recommendations vary depending on the subtype, clinical behavior, and treatment response. Generally, for subtypes in which staging is recommended, the Ann Arbor or tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging specific to CTCL other than MF or SS are used. For many subtypes, there is no standard treatment at the time of writing. Available recommended treatments range widely, from no active or minimal intervention with skin-directed therapy to aggressive systemic therapies that include multi-agent chemotherapy with consideration for hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Emerging targeted therapies, such as brentuximab, a chimeric antibody targeting CD30, show promise in altering the disease course of non-MF/SS CTCLs.

### Complete response of refractory mycosis fungoides to treatment of pancreatic cancer with combination gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel: A possible new regimen for the treatment of advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [^111dyf1S]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In general, single-agent chemotherapies are preferred in the treatment of advanced mycosis fungoides to limit toxicity. Commonly used single agents include pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, pralatrexate, and purine analogues (e.g. fludarabine). Unfortunately, the response to chemotherapy is generally short-lived, and there is no evidence that early aggressive treatment of mycosis fungoides is superior to more conservative management.

Gemcitabine has been shown to be an effective treatment for advanced mycosis fungoides. In 2000, 44 previously treated patients with mycosis fungoides (n = 30) or cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (n = 14) were administered three 28-day cycles of gemcitabine. Five patients (11.5%) achieved a complete response, and 26 (59%) achieved partial response, with median durations of 15 and 10 months, respectively. In an open-label trial performed in 2006, 25 patients with mycosis fungoides or CD30+ anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma received a minimum of 6 cycles, with an overall response rate of 68% (complete response = 2). Stages ranged from Ib to IVb. In a 2010 study, 19 patients with pretreated mycosis fungoides (all T3–4, N0, M0) received 3 to 6 cycles of gemcitabine monotherapy, and 48% responded (complete response = 3). Of the complete-response patients, one relapsed after 10 months, and the other two were disease-free at publication in 2010, with ongoing remission periods of 18 and 120 months, respectively. In general, single-agent gemcitabine is relatively well-tolerated, although more common adverse effects have been reported.

### Pembrolizumab and palliative radiotherapy in 2 cases of refractory mycosis fungoides [^113jGg86]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, with stage-dependent treatment and prognosis. Early-stage disease may be managed by skin-directed therapies, whereas the treatment strategy for advanced stages ranges from vitamin A derivatives, immunomodulatory agents, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). However, the treatment options for refractory advanced-stage MF remain limited, especially after the failure of stem cell transplantation. Recurrence occurs in 45% of cases after AHSCT, resulting in a dismal prognosis. For these patients, the development of newer therapies is crucial.

As immunotherapeutic oncologic agents are emerging, their role in the treatment of MF is yet to be defined. A recent publication described a positive outcome in patients with advanced MF and Sézary syndrome after treatment with the programmed cell death (PD)-1 antibody pembrolizumab. Additionally, radiation therapy is a pillar in the treatment of MF. Recent literature on the positive effects of immunotherapy in combination with radiation therapy in non-small cell lung cancer and malignant melanoma prompted us to explore this treatment option for advanced MF.

Herein, we describe two patients with advanced MF who relapsed after AHSCT and were treated with subsequent pembrolizumab and radiation therapy, resulting in positive outcomes.

### Acral erosive mycosis fungoides: Successful treatment with localised radiotherapy [^113DB8aB]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Mycosis fungoides encompasses a wide range of variants with differing clinical and histopathological findings, clinical courses, and methods of treatment. Two patients were referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center for the evaluation of treatment-refractory palmoplantar dermatoses suggestive of a rare variant of mycosis fungoides, specifically mycosis fungoides palmaris et plantaris (MFPP). Both patients eventually developed progressive and ulcerative cutaneous disease extending beyond acral regions, which showed a remarkable response to local radiation therapy. Although most documented cases of MFPP show an indolent course, one must be aware of the possibility of the development of severe cutaneous disease in patients initially presenting with palmoplantar involvement. Local radiotherapy is a safe and effective palliative treatment option for MFPP and cutaneous disease refractory to systemic treatment.

### Successful treatment of tumor stage mycosis fungoides with total skin helical tomotherapy [^11116d4S]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) is a treatment option for mycosis fungoides (MF). In Japan, it has been rarely performed due to the time required for each treatment, the physical burden on patients, and difficulties in providing uniform dosimetry. In recent years, helical tomotherapy, an intensity-modulated radiation therapy that applies helical computed tomography technology, has been used to treat cancer. Total skin helical tomotherapy (TSHT) has been suggested as a promising alternative to TSEBT for patients with MF, although there are few reports from Japan.

We used TSHT to treat a 28-year-old Japanese woman with tumor-stage MF. She achieved complete remission with TSHT (12 Gy in six fractions over 6 days) and remained in remission for 32 months without additional treatment. Treatment-related grade 4 myelosuppression was observed but resolved with blood transfusions and subcutaneous injections of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Other adverse events were tolerable. Although careful attention should be paid to myelosuppression, TSHT might be a useful treatment option for MF.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^116S8VDe]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Denileukin diftitox‐Cxdl (E7777) components of the trimeric IL‐2 receptor complex, comprised of an alpha chain (CD25) required for high‐affinity binding, a beta chain (CD122), and a common gamma chain (CD132), are expressed by clonal T cells in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Targeting the IL‐2 receptor with the monoclonal antibody daclizumab was safe and partially effective in adult T‐cell leukemia/lymphoma. In hopes of improving upon these results, denileukin diftitox (Dd) was developed to target the IL‐2 receptor. Denileukin diftitox is a fusion protein comprised of human IL‐2 fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin, which has high affinity for the IL‐2 receptor and is internalized upon receptor binding, leading to liberation of the toxin and the induction of apoptosis.

Phase I/II studies demonstrated objective responses in approximately one‐third of patients, leading to a phase III study that randomized 71 patients with CD25 positive (i.e. ≥ 20% T cells positive by immunohistochemistry) CTCL, most with advanced‐stage disease, to either 9 or 18 μg/kg/day of Dd given intravenously on five consecutive days every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles. An objective response, 20% partial and 10% complete, was observed in 30% of patients, while an additional 32% of patients had stable disease. The median time to response was 6 weeks, with 95% of responding patients demonstrating evidence of response by week 9. The median duration of response was 7 months (range 2.7–46.1 months). Among responders, significant improvements in self‐reported quality of life were observed. Results of a large phase III study are awaited for further evaluation.

### Combination of low-dose total skin electron beam therapy and subsequent localized skin electron beam therapy as a therapeutic option for advanced-stage mycosis fungoides [^113s6H3R]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Electron beam therapy (EBT) is an established treatment for mycosis fungoides (MF), but evidence for the use of EBT in advanced cutaneous conditions is limited, and optimal scheduling of the regimen for such conditions remains unclear. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman diagnosed with MF, presenting widespread cutaneous lesions, including multiple large tumors in the craniofacial area. Low-dose total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) followed by localized skin electron beam therapy (LSEBT) achieved striking improvements in eruptions. Oral etretinate was also administered during therapy.

Our experience suggests that combined TSEBT and LSEBT may be worth considering when a patient presents with both widespread lesions and prominent tumors, even when the tumors are extremely large.

### Mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome: An update [^1156rVN7]. Current Oncology Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Mycosis fungoides (MF), and the associated leukemic variant Sezary syndrome (SS), are the most common group of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. MF/SS is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of mature, skin-homing, clonal, malignant T lymphocytes that initially presents in the skin as patches, plaques, tumors, or generalized erythema (erythroderma) and can involve the lymph nodes and peripheral blood. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the origin of the malignant T cell in MF/SS and the pathophysiology and immunology of the disease. This recent work has made a great impact on diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment. In this review, we survey the MF/SS published literature over the past year and highlight some of the important advances.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^112buFse]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

The available experience with high‐dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, largely confined to case series, suggests that responses following treatment are transient. In contrast, the durable remissions observed following allogeneic transplantation may be explained by the graft versus lymphoma immune response. A retrospective analysis of 60 patients with advanced‐stage MF/SS who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation was recently reported. In this series, patients had received a median of four prior therapies before undergoing either reduced‐conditioning (73%) or myeloablative (27%) conditioning prior to related (75%) or matched‐unrelated donor (25%) transplantation. Non‐relapse mortality at one year was 14% for patients receiving reduced‐intensity conditioning or HLA identical/related donor stem cells and 38%–40% for those undergoing myeloablative conditioning or receiving match‐unrelated donor grafts. Transplantation during an early phase of the disease (defined as first or second remission or relapse following three or fewer systemic therapies) was associated with lower relapse rates (25% vs. 44% at one year) and a statistically insignificant increase in three-year overall survival (68% vs. 46%). Given the differences in non‐relapse mortality, both reduced‐intensity conditioning and use of matched‐related donors were associated with superior overall survival (63% at three years). Seventeen out of 26 patients who relapsed received donor‐lymphocyte infusions. Of these, 47% achieved a complete remission, thus providing evidence of efficacy in select patients.

### Water bath radiation for extensive, extremity-based cutaneous disease of mycosis fungoides [^115sHJ56]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

We report an effective treatment case of megavoltage photon radiation for extensive, extremity-based mycosis fungoides with a water bath as a tissue compensator. This method is easier when providing a uniform dose distribution in a large and irregular target and is less sensitive to the treatment setup compared with conventional approaches such as electron beam therapy and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Furthermore, this technique can be easily used in any clinic if a water tank of appropriate size is available.

The multidisciplinary team, including the radiation oncologist and the physicists, discussed various radiation therapy modalities and compared their advantages and disadvantages to efficiently treat the disease in the left lower arm and right upper extremity, including hands and digits. Electron beam therapy is often used for patients with mycosis fungoides involving extremities, and this patient also received en face electron therapy on his right posterior thigh; however, it was considered less optimal in this case because the patient had multiple semicontiguous, circumferential patches. Electron therapy in this case could be used by abutting multiple electron fields but would cause hot and cold spots in the junctions. The curved surface exacerbates this problem. As a next option, HDR brachytherapy was considered for this case. The main disadvantage was that interdigital spaces would need to be treated with a custom plaque applicator. Finally, the option of photon external beam radiation therapy using two opposed lateral beams was suggested with a water bath for tissue compensation.

Blood (2007). Low credibility.

The ISCL/EORTC recommends revisions to the Mycosis Fungoides Cooperative Group classification and staging system for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). These revisions aim to incorporate advances related to tumor cell biology and diagnostic techniques as they pertain to mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) since the 1979 publication of the original guidelines. The purpose is to clarify certain variables that currently impede effective interinstitution and interinvestigator communication and/or the development of standardized clinical trials in MF and SS, and to provide a platform for tracking other variables of potential prognostic significance.

Moreover, given the difference in prognosis and clinical characteristics of the non-MF/non-SS subtypes of cutaneous lymphoma, this revision pertains specifically to MF and SS. The evidence supporting the revisions, as well as recommendations for evaluation and staging procedures based on these revisions, is discussed.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^111FNcVG]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Quality of life (QOL) and supportive care considerations are critically important in treatment selection and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) management. Consequently, patients benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, with input provided by an experienced dermatopathologist, dermatologist, and both medical and radiation oncologists. Treatments are frequently provided in an escalated and serial fashion. In appropriately selected patients, treatments are occasionally recycled. While most responses with currently available agents are not complete or durable, stable disease, particularly in patients with limited‐stage disease, may be associated with improved QOL.

Improved understanding of disease pathogenesis, including appreciation of both the genetic landscape and the tumor microenvironment's role in CTCL, has identified novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. Many of these are the subject of ongoing clinical trials. Consequently, clinical trial participation will continue to play an increasingly important role in the multidisciplinary management of CTCL patients and is strongly encouraged.

### Special considerations in the treatment of mycosis fungoides [^115zBNt1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Mycosis fungoides is the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Although patients typically present to physicians at an early stage with an indolent course, mycosis fungoides can display a varied presentation. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has developed guidelines for the treatment and staging of mycosis fungoides. Despite their comprehensiveness, these guidelines do not provide specific treatment regimens for lesions located in difficult areas or those unresponsive to the recommended therapies.

Suggestions based on practices and decisions from the multidisciplinary cutaneous lymphoma clinic at Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, are presented here. Lesions in areas such as the face and intertriginous zones pose significant treatment challenges because first-line therapies are often inappropriate, and these locations increase the possibility of side effects. Furthermore, lesions located in the bathing suit distribution often do not respond to first-line therapies for reasons that remain undetermined. Finally, erythroderma secondary to mycosis fungoides is well-described but challenging to treat, with varying methods of control resulting in controversy.

This article highlights difficult clinical scenarios and reviews the recommended treatment as provided by the NCCN guidelines, while offering alternative therapies for lesions that are either difficult to treat due to their location or are resistant to the recommended therapy. Suggestions are provided for apparent gaps in treatment strategies.

### Review of the treatment of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome: a stage-based approach [^1148gqcF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Non-Hodgkin's Disease were recently revised to include recommendations for treating mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. These uncommon lymphomas require specialized evaluation and utilize a unique TNMB staging system. Unlike other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, staging overwhelmingly determines prognosis and defines radically different treatment approaches.

For patients with early-stage disease, initial treatment with skin-directed therapies is preferred, and many patients never require systemic therapy. In cases of refractory or advanced-stage disease, biologic therapies are often the first choices, whereas chemotherapies are reserved for later in the disease course. Many milder therapies may be repeated multiple times during the disease course, with maintenance and tapering strategies being common. Additionally, this article discusses the emerging role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

### How we treat advanced stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma - mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome [^113MhXDN]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) constitute a rare subset of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (MF/SS) being the most common subtype of cutaneous TCLs (CTCLs). Considered an incurable but treatable disease, MF/SS management presents several challenges, including diagnostic delays, debilitating effects on patients' quality of life, the need for several lines of therapies, multidisciplinary care, and cumulative drug toxicities limiting the duration of use. This review intends to provide an overview of the recent advances in our understanding of the biology of CTCL and how these are being leveraged to provide additional treatment options for the management of advanced and refractory disease. In addition, a discussion of the different modalities of treatment is summarized to further outline the importance of multidisciplinary care and early referral to CTCL centers.

### Mycosis fungoides palmaris et plantaris successfully treated with radiotherapy: Case report and mini-review of the published work [^114BzBne]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Mycosis fungoides palmaris et plantaris (MFPP) is a rare variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma limited to the palms and soles, which is not widely recognized due to its uncommon occurrence. We report a 73-year-old Japanese man who presented with an erosion on the left dorsal hand, a reddish tumor on the right palm, and hyperkeratotic erythematous plaques on the right sole. A skin biopsy revealed histological features of mycosis fungoides (MF) with invasion into the deeper layers of the skin, though there was no visceral or lymph node invasion. We diagnosed this case as MFPP.

- **Treatment and outcome**: External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was administered to treat the hand lesions. Combination treatment with topical steroids and topical psoralen plus ultraviolet light therapy was attempted for the lesion on the right sole but proved ineffective. Consequently, sequential EBRT was performed, resulting in complete remission of all lesions. This is the first report of MFPP with a locally advanced tumor for which the efficacy of radiotherapy is detailed.

MFPP lesions occur on the dorsal aspect of the hand or foot. We propose a classification of MFPP as hand and foot MF. The pathogenesis of MFPP remains unclear, and further accumulation of data is needed.

- **Treatment**:

	- **CBCL**: As no randomized controlled trials are available, treatment recommendations for CBCL are largely based on small retrospective studies and institutional experience. The EORTC and ISCL have published consensus treatment recommendations that are consistent with NCCN guidelines. In most cases, optimal patient management requires a multidisciplinary approach, including dermatology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology.

	- **PCFCL**: For patients with solitary lesions, low-dose radiation therapy is safe and highly effective, with a complete remission rate approaching 100%. Radiation does not appear inferior to multiagent chemotherapy among patients with multiple lesions that can be included in multiple radiation fields. In a large North American series, the rate of local control for indolent CBCL with radiation alone was 98%. In the same series, a local recurrence requiring radiation therapy was observed in 25% of patients who had undergone surgical excision alone. Reserving radiation until disease recurrence did not appear to compromise disease-specific or overall survival. Therefore, complete excision alone, deferring radiation until disease recurrence, is also reasonable. Intralesional (e.g. corticosteroids or rituximab) or topical therapies including corticosteroids, nitrogen mustard, and bexarotene may also be considered. While radiation therapy is generally recommended for patients with a solitary lesion, radiation therapy or observation (i.e. "watch and wait") are reasonable options for those patients with multiple lesions.

### Efficacy of bath-psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy for mycosis fungoides - retrospective analysis of 62 cases [^112uoD9d]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Photochemotherapy with psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) is widely used for refractory skin diseases. Bathwater delivery of 8‐methoxypsoralen (8‐MOPS) with subsequent UVA irradiation (bath‐PUVA) or oral administration of 8‐MOPS with UVA is used to treat mycosis fungoides. We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients with mycosis fungoides (8 stage IA, 30 stage IB, 5 stage IIB, 18 stage IIIA, and 1 stage IVA2) treated with bath‐PUVA at the Dermatology Clinic of Nagoya City University Hospital from November 2004 to December 2013.

A complete response was achieved in 37 (59.7%) patients, a partial response in 16 (25.8%), and stable disease in 6 (9.7%). Progressive disease was observed in 3 (4.8%) patients. Almost all patients in stage IA/IB achieved a complete response. Of the 5 stage IIB patients, 2 achieved a partial response, 1 achieved stable disease, and 2 had progressive disease. The serum concentrations of soluble interleukin‐2 receptor and lactate dehydrogenase decreased significantly following treatment with bath‐PUVA (p < 0.001).

We examined the risk factors of patients whose stage progressed despite PUVA treatment. A multivariate Cox regression analysis of risk factors associated with stage progression yielded a hazard ratio of 28.5 for stage IIB. Treatment with bath‐PUVA is highly effective in the early stages of mycosis fungoides, and partially effective in advanced stages.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^112aFh1a]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Romidepsin, administered as a 4-hour intravenous infusion (14 mg/m²) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks, was evaluated in two phase II studies. The largest study included 96 patients, most with advanced-stage disease. The overall response rate was 38% for patients with advanced-stage disease, with a median duration of response exceeding 1 year. A toxicity profile similar to that described for vorinostat was observed. Intensive cardiac monitoring in a subset of these patients failed to demonstrate any clinically significant cardiotoxicity. A subset of MF/SS patients, after induction with romidepsin at the standard dose, may anticipate a durable remission with attenuated "maintenance" dosing every 2 or 4 weeks. For example, among 38 MF/SS patients, 17 achieved a durable (> 6-month) remission, 9 of whom were maintained with an attenuated, dose-sparing schedule. Among the patients achieving a durable remission, the median duration of treatment was 15 months (range: 7–34 months).

Additional HDAC inhibitors, including potent pan-HDAC inhibitors, appear to have activity in CTCL. Further studies are needed to fully define the mechanisms of resistance to HDAC inhibition in CTCL, enabling the development of rational therapeutic combinations incorporating HDAC inhibitors in CTCL.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^1143K93i]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Primary cutaneous lymphomas are a rare and heterogeneous group of extranodal lymphomas that require the integration of clinical and histopathologic data for classification and treatment.

- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis and disease classification are based on histopathologic review and immunohistochemical staining of an appropriate skin biopsy. Pathologic review and appropriate clinical and staging evaluations are necessary to distinguish primary cutaneous and systemic lymphomas.

- **Risk-stratification**: Disease histopathology remains the most important prognostic determinant in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, whereas staging remains an important prognostic determinant in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.

- **Risk-adapted therapy**: Patients with primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) and primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) with solitary or relatively few skin lesions may be effectively managed with local radiation therapy. While single-agent rituximab may be employed for patients with more widespread skin involvement, multiagent chemotherapy is rarely appropriate. In contrast, the management of patients with primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCDLBCL, LT) is comparable to the management of patients with systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Clinical staging forms the basis for a "risk-adapted", multidisciplinary approach to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) treatment. For patients with disease limited to the skin, disease-specific and overall survival is measured in years, if not decades, and skin-directed therapies are preferred. In contrast, patients with advanced-stage disease, including cutaneous tumors or significant nodal, visceral, or blood involvement, are approached with systemic therapies in an escalating fashion.

### Mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, and cutaneous B-cell lymphomas: 2025 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^114KAew1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) require a multidisciplinary approach, as various combinations of skin-directed therapies, biologic-response modifiers, and ultimately the sequential use of systemic agents are frequently employed in their management. For limited-stage disease, multi-agent chemotherapy is not appropriate. Instead, a "risk-adapted" and stage-based approach, consistent with the NCCN guidelines, is generally preferred. This approach incorporates biologic-response modifiers (e.g. bexarotene and interferon-alpha), histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g. romidepsin), or monoclonal antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates (e.g. mogamulizumab, brentuximab vedotin). Therapeutic decisions are individualized, based on a patient's age, performance status, extent of disease burden, rate of disease progression, and previous therapies.

Despite widely disparate prescribing patterns globally, differences in survival have not been observed. The tissue compartment(s) involved (i.e. skin, blood, lymph node, and/or viscera) and those in most urgent need of treatment are important factors in therapeutic decision-making, as many agents are not equally effective across tissue compartments. For example, in patients with tumor-stage disease but without blood, nodal, or visceral involvement (stage IIB), the overall response rate observed with brentuximab vedotin was 40%, compared to response rates ≤ 15% in patients with more advanced (> stage IIB) disease. In contrast, the overall response rates observed with mogamulizumab in the

### Mycosis fungoides: a review [^113npjRf]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common subtype of cutaneous lymphoma, characterized by the infiltration of malignant T-cell clones into the skin. It accounts for approximately 60% of all cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) diagnoses. MF has three distinct stages: patch, plaque, and tumor, presenting most commonly on the buttocks, trunk, and breast. The presentation often mimics common inflammatory dermatoses such as eczema and psoriasis. Despite numerous theories, the etiology of MF remains mostly unknown. Since its first description in 1806, diagnosis has remained a challenge and requires careful clinicopathological correlation.

Patients may require multiple skin biopsies, especially in the patch stage, to identify the characteristic epidermotropic infiltrates of small to medium-sized lymphocytes. First-line management involves skin-directed therapies (SDT) such as topical corticosteroids and phototherapy. If this is unsuccessful, systemic medications such as interferon alpha, oral bexarotene, methotrexate, and novel antibody therapies are trialed. MF can also respond to localized radiotherapy, total skin electron beam therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Despite being primarily a cutaneous lymphoma, MF can progress to involve other organs. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of mycosis fungoides.

### Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome [^115DzJb2]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are the most common of the cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, which are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that affect the skin as a primary site. Although the aetiologies of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are unknown, important insights have been gained into the immunological and genetic perturbations associated with these diseases. Unlike some B-cell lymphomas, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas as a group are rarely, if ever, curable and hence require chronic-disease management.

New approaches to treatments are being investigated, including biological and cytotoxic drugs, phototherapy, and monoclonal antibodies directed towards novel molecular targets. New molecular technologies, such as complementary-DNA microarray, have the potential to increase diagnostic accuracy and provide important prognostic information. Treatments can be combined to greatly improve clinical outcomes without substantially increasing toxic effects in advanced disease, which is otherwise difficult to treat.

Although present treatment strategies are generally not curative, there is hope that experimental treatments, particularly immunotherapy, might eventually reverse or suppress the abnormalities of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome to the point at which they become non-life-threatening, chronic diseases.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most prevalent form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Advanced-stage MF has a poor prognosis and requires systemic therapies. Pralatrexate, a folic acid analog metabolic inhibitor, has been approved in the U.S. A. since 2009 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), but it was only launched in Japan in 2017. In patients with advanced-stage CTCL, U.S. studies with pralatrexate have shown clinical response rates of up to 58%; however, outcomes in Japanese patients have not yet been reported. This study describes the clinical outcomes of two Japanese patients with relapsed/refractory MF who were treated with pralatrexate.

### Skin directed therapy for mycosis fungoides: A review [^117UQvsj]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a rare neoplasm of epidermotropic CD4+ lymphocytes and represents a majority of all cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Early-stage MF is limited to cutaneous patches and plaques that can be treated with topical modalities, yielding high response rates. More aggressive systemic treatment of early disease does not alter survival or cure the disease and could accelerate progression by causing immunosuppression. Topical corticosteroids, mechlorethamine, and carmustine have been the mainstays of early treatment of MF for more than 30 years.

More recently, topical formulations of retinoids, novel rexinoids, methotrexate, immunomodulators, and photodynamic compounds have been investigated for their potential roles in treating early MF. The future of topical treatments for MF is promising both as primary and adjunctive therapy.

### The changing therapeutic landscape, burden of disease, and unmet needs in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [^116qjQPq]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) have a chronic, relapsing course. The most common subtypes are mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. The disease causes visible skin alterations and can also result in alopecia, pruritus, and pain, significantly impacting patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms and prevent disease progression.

However, treatment recommendations often rest on low levels of evidence due to the scarcity of well-designed randomized clinical trials and comprehensive treatment guidelines. Additionally, approved drugs vary considerably across different countries and regions. Currently, available treatments rarely lead to durable remissions and tend to lose effectiveness over time, necessitating frequent therapy changes for patients.

Skin-directed therapies (SDTs) serve as first-line treatments for early-stage CTCL. Systemic therapies may be necessary for early-stage disease unresponsive to SDT or advanced-stage disease. Patients, however, may suffer significant side effects or may not be able to tolerate these treatments. Thus, there is an unmet need for effective therapies with favorable safety profiles for both early- and late-stage CTCL.

This review discusses treatment guidelines, investigational and approved treatments, the impact of CTCL on patients' HRQoL, and strategies for managing pruritus.

Alemtuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, an antigen widely expressed by B‐cells, T‐cells, and monocytes. In a phase II study involving 22 patients with advanced‐stage MF/SS, overall and complete response rates of 55% and 32%, respectively, were observed, with a median time to treatment failure of 1 year. Given the significant risk of infectious complications, low‐dose subcutaneous alemtuzumab was investigated in 14 patients with SS, most of whom had relapsed/refractory disease. Most patients in this study received 3 mg of subcutaneous alemtuzumab on day 1, followed by a 10 mg dose on alternating days until the Sézary count was < 1000/mm³. With the exception of a single patient whose best response was stable disease, 9 out of 10 patients treated in this manner achieved a response, 3 of which were complete. For most patients, the time to treatment failure exceeded 12 months. Notably, infectious complications were not observed in patients treated with the lowest dose (i.e. 10 mg) of alemtuzumab. Similar results, with no infectious complications, were reported in a small cohort of patients treated with modified, low‐dose subcutaneous alemtuzumab for 6 weeks. In addition to hematologic toxicity, conventionally dosed alemtuzumab in advanced‐stage MF/SS is associated with a high incidence of infectious complications. Overall, infectious complications have been observed in two‐thirds of treated patients, most of which are bacterial, including sepsis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation is the most common viral infection reported.

### Integrating novel agents into the treatment of advanced mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome [^112YuGGu]. Blood (2023). High credibility.

Agents targeting the unique biology of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome are quickly being incorporated into clinical management. With these new therapies, we are now capable of inducing more durable responses and even complete remissions in advanced disease, outcomes which were exceedingly rare with prior therapies. Yet, even this new generation of therapies typically produce objective responses in only a minority of patients. As our therapeutic options increase, we are now challenged with selecting treatments from a growing list of options. To gain the full benefit of these novel agents, we must develop strategies to match treatments for the patients most likely to benefit from them.

- **Approaches to treatment selection based on clinical features**: We consider both the clinical features and the future of molecular biomarker-guided therapy for patients with this heterogeneous disease.
