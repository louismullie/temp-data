## Question

what is a differential diagnosis for sacral wound

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis of a sacral wound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely etiologies and how to stage pressure injuries. Then, I should verify infectious complications, including osteomyelitis and when to biopsy. Next, I will consider traumatic and bony mimics, followed by neoplastic and inflammatory causes. After that, I need to check for vascular, neurologic, and systemic contributors. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and outline a practical diagnostic and management algorithm with contingencies for special populations and red flags.

> Let me first confirm the foundational diagnosis: pressure injury is the leading cause of sacral wounds, especially in immobilized, elderly, or neurologically impaired patients, and I should stage it using the NPIAP/EPUAP framework from Stage 1 to 4, unstageable, or suspected deep tissue injury, while remembering that sacral and heel sites predominate and that most hospital-acquired ulcers are Stage 1–2, though sacral ulcers in frail patients often progress to full thickness [^117DLDYr] [^112yfnL2] [^112v76dZ].

> Wait, let me verify the infection status before labeling it "just a pressure ulcer". I should look for delayed healing, edematous or pale granulation, friable bleeding, malodor, pocketing, breakdown with bony exposure, and pain out of proportion, because these features suggest chronic wound infection and mandate tissue biopsy or validated quantitative swab after debridement rather than surface swabs, and I must not miss polymicrobial flora typical of sacral wounds near the fecal stream [^114mvKwH] [^111EsMCf] [^111rAfq3].

> Hold on, I should verify the risk of osteomyelitis when bone is exposed or healing stalls despite adequate offloading and debridement; imaging and inflammatory markers are unreliable in this context, so deep bone biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard, and antibiotics without planned surgical closure are not supported; if osteomyelitis is confirmed and closure is planned, culture-directed therapy is reasonable, with some experts accepting shorter courses for limited cortical disease, but routine prolonged antibiotics without closure should be avoided [^113Abc82] [^112mJgXJ] [^115ASfy6].

> I need to ensure I do not conflate colonization with infection; routine antibiotics for uninfected pressure ulcers are not recommended, and systemic therapy should be reserved for spreading cellulitis, systemic inflammatory response, or when osteomyelitis is confirmed in the context of a surgical plan, with empiric regimens covering gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobes when infection is evident or sepsis is a concern [^111rAfq3] [^115n4THo] [^113vS5vE].

> Next, I should review traumatic and bony etiologies that can mimic or complicate pressure wounds; sacral insufficiency fractures are common in older adults with osteoporosis and can present with severe focal pain and delayed healing over the sacrum, so a low threshold for CT or MRI is warranted, and I should remember that MRI may not reliably distinguish osteomyelitis from remodeling in chronic pressure ulcers, which reinforces the need for biopsy when infection is suspected [^111fV1ko] [^117TpgkV] [^113Abc82].

> But wait, what if the "wound" overlies a mass or bony destruction; I should consider sacral tumors such as chordoma, metastases, lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, or ependymoma, especially with neurologic deficits, night pain, or atypical imaging features, and I must avoid violating a cystic presacral lesion that could be an anterior sacral meningocele or hydatid cyst, instead using MRI and PET-CT strategically and planning image-guided biopsy when malignancy is suspected [^116bGEFG] [^116fcXek] [^116xpiTS].

> I will now examine inflammatory and autoimmune mimics; pyoderma gangrenosum can present with painful, undermined ulcers with violaceous borders and pathergy, and biopsy may show sterile neutrophilia, but I should double-check for atypical features and exclude infection and vasculitis before immunosuppression; vasculitides and vasculopathies can cause painful necrotic ulcers and require early histopathology and systemic workup [^112eFSnR] [^114GTNhc].

> Let me consider vascular and neurologic contributors; arterial insufficiency is less common in the sacrum but can impair healing and should be assessed with ankle-brachial indices when indicated, while neuropathy and spasticity alter pressure distribution and sensation, and spinal cord injury patients may have unique complications such as pseudomeningocele or autonomic dysreflexia that complicate wound care and surgical planning [^117Wbbba] [^114nQMQQ] [^113JxSMT].

> I should confirm systemic and local factors that impede healing; malnutrition with low protein and micronutrients, anemia, renal failure, diabetes, and fecal or urinary incontinence are prevalent in sacral wounds and must be optimized, and I need to remember rare but relevant associations such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth causing profound malabsorption and refractory pressure ulcers in spinal cord injury, which improved with selective digestive decontamination in case reports [^112v76dZ] [^115EBGKE] [^1178oodX].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and red flags; in pregnancy and postpartum, sacral stress fractures can masquerade as soft tissue pain, and in patients with Crohn's disease or recurrent perianal disease, I must consider fistulizing disease and atypical infections; any rapidly progressive necrotic perineal process should trigger concern for Fournier's gangrene and mandates emergent surgical debridement without delay [^113CdKbT] [^111ZtJ9H] [^114nQMQQ].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized differential while keeping pretest probabilities in mind: most likely is a pressure injury with or without infection, followed by osteomyelitis when bone is exposed or healing fails, then traumatic or insufficiency fractures, followed by neoplastic processes when imaging is atypical or systemic features are present, with inflammatory ulcers and vascular or neurologic mimics considered earlier when the clinical picture deviates from classic pressure injury behavior [^112yfnL2] [^113Abc82] [^116bGEFG].

> I should double-check the diagnostic algorithm: start with meticulous history and exam including onset, mobility, incontinence, pain, neurologic symptoms, and prior surgeries, then stage the ulcer and obtain tissue for culture and histology if infection is suspected or healing stalls, add CBC, inflammatory markers, albumin, and HbA1c, and use imaging selectively with plain films for suspected fracture, MRI for deep infection or tumor, and CT for bony detail; if osteomyelitis is suspected, plan for bone biopsy rather than relying on imaging alone [^111EsMCf] [^112mJgXJ] [^116B4AvK].

> Next, I should review management principles and ensure they align with evidence; offload pressure with high-specification support surfaces and frequent repositioning, perform serial debridement to remove necrosis and biofilm, choose dressings based on exudate and wound bed characteristics rather than brand, optimize nutrition with protein and micronutrient repletion, and reserve antibiotics for clinically infected wounds or confirmed osteomyelitis in the context of surgical closure plans, while considering reconstructive surgery for stage 3–4 ulcers that fail conservative care [^111rAfq3] [^112v76dZ] [^116g3UJZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "always obtain an MRI for suspected osteomyelitis", but I should correct that; MRI can overcall osteomyelitis in chronic pressure ulcers due to remodeling, so I must anchor the diagnosis with deep bone biopsy when feasible and avoid prolonged antibiotics without a surgical plan, balancing risks of progression if the patient is septic or unstable [^113Abc82] [^112mJgXJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety nets and follow-up; sacral wounds often evolve slowly and complications can be subtle, so scheduled reassessment of wound dimensions, granulation quality, and systemic status every 1–2 weeks, early involvement of wound care, infectious diseases, surgery, and rehabilitation teams, and education of caregivers for pressure redistribution and continence management are essential to reduce recurrence and morbidity [^112v76dZ] [^111rAfq3].

A sacral wound has a broad differential, but the most common etiologies are **pressure injuries** [^117DLDYr] and **infected pressure ulcers** [^111rAfq3] [^114mvKwH]. Other important causes include trauma, surgical site infection, malignancy, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, vascular insufficiency, neurologic disorders, and systemic diseases. A thorough **history, physical exam, and targeted imaging** [^113ASRJF] [^1126CL7o] are essential to distinguish these entities and guide management [^116bGEFG].

---

## Traumatic etiologies

- **Pressure injuries (decubitus ulcers)**: Most common sacral wounds [^notfound], especially in immobilized or neurologically impaired patients [^111rAfq3]; staged from I to IV based on depth and tissue involvement [^112yfnL2].

- **Traumatic wounds**: Acute or chronic injuries from falls, friction, or shear forces [^notfound]; often associated with underlying comorbidities or anticoagulation [^notfound].

- **Surgical site infections**: Wound dehiscence or infection after sacral surgery (e.g. sacrectomy, tumor resection) [^112JVmAe].

---

## Infectious etiologies

- **Bacterial infections**: Polymicrobial infections, including MRSA, Gram-negative rods, and anaerobes [^115n4THo]; often complicate pressure ulcers [^notfound].

- **Osteomyelitis**: Common in chronic pressure ulcers with exposed bone [^notfound]; requires bone biopsy for definitive diagnosis [^112mJgXJ].

- **Fungal infections**: Rare but possible, especially in immunocompromised patients [^notfound].

- **Parasitic infections**: Rarely, cutaneous amebiasis or hydatid cysts may present as sacral wounds in endemic areas [^notfound].

---

## Malignant etiologies

Malignant etiologies include **primary sacral tumors** such as chordoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and ependymoma [^111TZMdM] [^115VDBvh] [^114wmcsq], which can ulcerate through the skin. Metastatic lesions from breast, lung, prostate, or gastrointestinal primaries may also present as sacral wounds [^notfound].

---

## Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases

Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases include **pyoderma gangrenosum**, an inflammatory ulcerative disease often associated with systemic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis [^notfound]. Vasculitis may also cause ulceration due to vascular inflammation and tissue ischemia [^114GTNhc].

---

## Vascular insufficiency

Vascular insufficiency includes **arterial insufficiency**, in which poor arterial blood flow causes tissue ischemia and ulceration [^117Wbbba], and **venous insufficiency**, which is less common in the sacral region but can contribute to delayed healing.

---

## Neurologic disorders

Neurologic disorders include **neuropathic ulcers**, commonly associated with diabetes, spinal cord injury, or peripheral neuropathy, and **cauda equina syndrome**, in which sacral wounds may arise from neurological impairment and immobility [^115dXY9F].

---

## Systemic diseases

Systemic diseases include **diabetes mellitus**, which increases the risk of chronic, non-healing sacral wounds due to impaired wound healing and neuropathy, and **malnutrition**, which contributes to poor wound healing and increases susceptibility to infection [^1178oodX].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured diagnostic approach** is essential [^113ASRJF]:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess onset, duration, trauma, pressure exposure, systemic symptoms, and comorbidities [^113ASRJF].

- **Imaging**: MRI for suspected osteomyelitis, malignancy, or deep infection [^116B4AvK]; CT for bony detail; ultrasound for superficial abscesses [^114Rt6qd].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, wound cultures, and biopsy as indicated [^111EsMCf].

- **Multidisciplinary evaluation**: Involve wound care, infectious disease, surgery, and oncology as needed [^112v76dZ].

---

A sacral wound has a broad differential spanning pressure injuries, infections, trauma, malignancy, autoimmune disease, vascular insufficiency, neurologic disorders, and systemic diseases. A **comprehensive evaluation** — history, exam, imaging, and labs — is critical to identify the cause and guide therapy [^113ASRJF].

### Osteomyelitis complicating sacral pressure ulcers: whether or not to treat with antibiotic therapy [^113Abc82]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment of osteomyelitis in patients with stage IV sacral pressure ulcers is controversial. We conducted a systematic literature review and did not find evidence of benefit of antibacterial therapy in this setting without concomitant surgical debridement and wound coverage. Furthermore, many patients with chronically exposed bone do not have evidence of osteomyelitis when biopsied, and magnetic resonance imaging may not accurately distinguish osteomyelitis from bone remodeling. The goal of therapy should be local wound care and assessment for the potential of wound closure. If the wound can be closed and osteomyelitis is present on bone biopsy, appropriate antibiotic therapy is reasonable. We find no data to support antibiotic durations of > 6 weeks in this setting, and some authors recommend 2 weeks of therapy if the osteomyelitis is limited to cortical bone. If the wound will not be closed, we find no clear evidence supporting a role for antibiotic therapy.

### Persistent coccydynia – the importance of a differential diagnosis [^114BiA96]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors present the case of a sacral chordoma in which the diagnosis was delayed as the patient was diagnosed and treated as coccydynia. Persistent, severe coccydynia following minor trauma is common but the symptom can also be caused by significant underlying disease. The correct diagnosis was made in this patient but after significant delay. The presentation of this case involved multiple specialties and provides several learning points regarding the importance of thorough history taking and clinical examination. It highlights the importance of 'red flag' symptoms of low back pain which need to be fully investigated.

Sacral tumours encompass an extensive range of differential diagnosis. The clinical presentation is often non-specific, including neurological deficits and low back pain. Accurate diagnosis of sacral lesions is challenging and requires a comprehensive imaging strategy and robust knowledge on the imaging characteristics of different pathological processes. This review will provide an updated overview of the computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and integrated positron-emission tomography (PET)-CT features of some common and rare sacral tumours and their mimics. Several clinical scenarios with specific diagnostic considerations and treatment implications will be described.

### Integrated multimodality and multi-disciplinary team approach to pre-sacral lesions [^1126CL7o]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical and radiological features of presacral lesions. CT and MRI are the diagnostic modalities of choice and are complimentary in the assessment of presacral lesions. Imaging findings of presacral lesions on CT and MRI are described with the use of examples. Preoperative biopsy, surgical and non-surgical managements are outlined. While the general radiologist cannot be familiar with every rare presacral condition, characterisation of a presacral lesion based on anatomy, demographics and imaging features can guide us in making a sound differential.

The case

We accepted a transfer of a paraplegic female with spina bifida aged 34 years who presented to an outside hospital with left-sided sacropelvic and femoral osteomyelitis resulting from very large pressure ulcers (figure 1). Following initial debridement of the ulcers, she became acutely ill. Plastic surgery, orthopedics, and acute care surgery all recommended a palliative care consult. Her parents came to us for a second opinion. On arrival, we found the patient to be septic, obtunded, malnourished, and in renal failure. For acute management, she was intubated, resuscitated, and initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics. She was then taken to the operating room (OR) where her wound was thoroughly explored and debrided, and antibiotics were tailored to her cultures. She responded well to initial management, regained renal function, and was successfully weaned off the ventilator. As she was lucid, she was included in a conversation about possible wound management options.

### Sacral fractures: an updated and comprehensive review [^111fV1ko]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

Sacral fractures are often underdiagnosed but are relatively frequent in the setting of pelvic ring injury. Causes include traumatic insults and osteoporosis. Sacral fractures have become more frequent owing to the growth of the elderly population worldwide as osteoporosis is an age-related disease. Misdiagnosed and neglected sacral fractures can result in chronic back pain, spine deformity, and instability. Unfortunately, the wide range of classification systems hinders adequate communication among clinicians. Therefore, a complete understanding of the pathology, and communication within the interdisciplinary team, are necessary to ensure adequate treatment and satisfactory clinical outcomes. The aim of this manuscript is to present the current knowledge available regarding classification systems, clinical assessment, decision-making factors, and current treatment options.

### A retrospective chart review of chronic wound patients treated with topical oxygen therapy [^111FHJeK]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic wounds at all locations had some healing for > 50% of the wounds in this study with the exception of sacral wounds, which tended to be larger before initiating the therapy (Table 3, Row%). Wounds located on the foot and the toe had higher healing rates after TOT (63.4% and 60.1%, respectively) when compared to other sites (Table 3, Row% Some Healing +100% Healed; p -values < 0.0001 for all pairs). The impact of wound location on wound healing was analyzed between the groups (Table 3, Col%). Wounds located on the foot were more likely to experience 100% healing (47.41%) than wounds at other locations on the body, while sacral wounds were the least likely to experience 100% healing (Table 3, Col%, p < 0.0001).

Wound healing was impacted by patient-dependent variables, including patient diagnosis, patient age, and insurance type. Wounds from patients with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (ICD9 250) were the most likely to experience partial or complete healing (67.1%, n = 945) following TOT (Table 4, Row% Some Healing +100% Healing) when compared to other diagnoses (p ≤ 0.0001). Wounds from patients with a diagnosis of chronic ulcer of the skin (ICD9 707) had the lowest rate of wound healing with 50.1% after TOT (Table 4, Row%; p ≤ 0.0001). Wounds from patients with a diagnosis of chronic ulcer of the skin (ICD9 707) that experienced healing, tended to be from slightly older than patients whose wounds experienced some healing (median age 64 for no healing group, median age 60 for some healing group, and median age 61 for 100% healing group).

### Sacral zoster with a primary complaint of difficulty voiding [^115HnEy9]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Although a more complete workup by the urgent care physician might have helped avoid the adverse drug reaction, the patient's subsequent emergency department visit also did not bring him closer to a definitive diagnosis. It was only after later eruption of the unilateral vesicular rash that the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms became clear. These findings suggest that in the setting of acute urinary retention without any other clear diagnostic signs, sacral zoster may be an important consideration, even in the absence of the classic shingles rash.

### Sacral fractures: classification and management [^1168X8FR]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sacral fractures are a common component of pelvic fracture patterns and are an increasingly diagnosed injury both due to increased utilization of CT in trauma evaluation as well as an increasing rate of sacral fragility fractures as a result of an increase in general population age. Innovations in minimally invasive surgical techniques have also resulted in an increasing number of sacral fractures undergoing surgical management. It is vital that physicians practicing in an emergency setting are aware of the injury patterns and management of this increasingly injured and treated component of the bony pelvis. This article reviews the sacral anatomy as well as discusses the role of imaging and imaging appearance of sacral fractures. Sacral fracture patterns are described along with both historic and newer classification systems for sacral fractures and current management of sacral fracture.

### Successful treatment of sacral pressure injury with ACU-D1 [^111orxds]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pressure injuries, previously known as pressure ulcers, commonly affect elderly patients in the sacral area, resulting in a sacral pressure injury. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, including avoiding further pressure on the wounded area. In our case report, we encountered a patient with a stage 2 pressure injury that was resistant to a month of supportive treatment, with no improvement. After a trial of 10% ACU-D1, a proteasome inhibitor cream, the patient experienced relief in symptoms and complete re-epithelialization of the injury site within one month. With emerging research suggesting a role of inflammation and neutrophil activation in pressure injuries, we propose that further investigation into ACU-D1 for pressure injuries and other chronic wounds could benefit patients.

### Dressings and topical agents for preventing pressure ulcers [^112yfnL2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

A pressure ulcer is defined as localised damage to the skin, underlying tissue, or both, as a result of pressure or pressure in combination with shear (EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA 2019). A meta‐analysis identified that the pooled prevalence of pressure ulcers in over 1.36 million hospitalised adults was 12.8%, and the pooled incidence in over 680,000 hospitalised adults was 5.4 per 10,000 patients (Li 2020). Pressure ulcers are classified by increasing visible tissue loss into four stages (1 to 4), with two additional presentations: unstageable and suspected deep tissue injury (EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA 2019; Appendix 1). The most common anatomical sites for pressure ulcers to occur are the sacrum and the heels, and the majority are stage 1 or stage 2 in severity (Li 2020; Moore 2019a; Rogers 2021).

### Experience with wound complications after surgery for sacral tumors [^112JVmAe]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this article is to summarize our experience in treating sacral wound complications after sacrectomy. We focus, in particular, on factors associated with wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and wound dehiscence.

Methods

The definition of SSI devised by Horgan et al. was applied. Wound dehiscence was defined as a wound showing breakdown in the absence of clinical signs meeting the diagnostic standard for SSI. Between September 1997 and August 2009, 387 patients with a sacral tumor underwent sacrectomy performed by the same team of surgeons and were followed up for ≥ 12 months. Potential risk factors were evaluated for univariate associations with SSI and wound complications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects of several risk factors.

Results

Of the 387 wounds studied, 274 healed uneventfully, and 113 (29.2%) broke down because of infection or dehiscence. Fifty-one (13.2%) patients developed a postoperative SSI, and 62 (16.0%) patients developed wound dehiscence. Gram-negative bacteria grew in 45 cultures (91.8%) and included 38 cases of Escherichia coli. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, longer duration of surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing an SSI. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, age < 40 years, history of diabetes mellitus, maximum tumor diameter ≥ 10 cm, and instrumentation used were risk factors for wound complications.

Conclusions

The incidence of wound complications is not so high at a musculoskeletal tumor center with surgeons experienced in treating sacral tumors. Controlling for these risk factors when possible may improve clinical outcomes.

### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a cause of protracted wound healing and vitamin D deficiency in a spinal cord injured patient with a sacral pressure sore: a case report [^115EBGKE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Other diagnostic methods for SIBO are breath tests using hydrogen or hydrogen methane with lactulose or glucose. Breath tests have clinical utility for diagnosing SIBO because they are less invasive than obtaining proximal small bowel content. However, there are no standardized criteria for diagnosing SIBO using breath tests. We did not perform a breath test in our case study.

Despite no previous reports of an association between unhealed pressure sores and SIBO, nutritional status is known to be important for the healing of pressure sores. In our case, the sacral pressure sore, which was initially refractory, began to heal after starting treatment for SIBO. Among intrinsic factors related to the healing of pressure sores, blood levels of hemoglobin, albumin, and zinc are especially important. Our patient had anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and a low zinc concentration, which gradually improved after starting treatment for SIBO.

### Postpartum sacral stress fracture: a case report [^113CdKbT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Since their initial description, little knowledge has been added concerning the pathogenesis, patient population, clinical manifestations, diagnostic techniques, and treatment options of sacral stress fractures. Thus, they have remained an unexplored clinical entity and are likely a frequently underdiagnosed cause of low back or pelvic pain. This case and similar cases previously reported suggest that sacral stress fractures should be considered in the differential diagnosis of low-back pain, buttock pain, and abnormal gait during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Delays in the diagnosis might be very painful for the women affected.

### Landmarks for sacral debridement in sacral pressure sores [^116m5bRU]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most cases of sacral osteomyelitis arising in the setting of sacral pressure ulcers require minimal cortical debridement. When faced with advanced bony involvement, the surgeon is often unclear about how much can safely be resected. Unfamiliarity with sacral anatomy can lead to concerns of inadvertent entry into the dural space and compromise of future flap options.

Materials and Methods

A cadaveric study (n = 6), in which a wide posterior dissection of the sacrum, was performed. Relationships of the dural sac to bony landmarks of the posterior pelvis were noted.

Results

The termination of the dural sac was found in our study to occur at the junction of S2/S3 vertebral bodies, which was located at a mean distance of 0.38 ± 0.16 cm distal to the inferior-most extent of the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS). The mean thickness of the posterior table of sacrum at this level was 1.7 cm at the midline and 0.5 cm at the sacral foramina.

Conclusions

The PSIS is a reliable landmark for localizing the S2/S3 junction and the termination of the dural sac. Sacral debridement medial to the sacral foramina above the level of PSIS must be conservative whenever possible. If aggressive debridement is necessary above this level, the surgeon must be alert to the possibility of dural involvement.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^112mJgXJ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis With PJI

There is no established, accurate referent standard diagnostic test for PJI. Certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging studies for PJI (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2); however, given the limitations of individual tests, published algorithms are sometimes recommended to establish the diagnosis. Data are limited and inadequate to compare the relative accuracies of competing algorithms. Practically, the diagnosis is typically made from a combination of history, physical examination, imaging studies to assess alternate causes of pain and instability, inflammatory markers, synovial fluid analysis, and/or operative specimens. Molecular diagnostic testing is a promising approach, but data are mixed and inadequate to recommend for or against its use as of 2022.

Question 2: What Is the Appropriate Management for Osteomyelitis Underlying a Pressure Ulcer?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Observational studies indicate that imaging and inflammatory biomarkers are not diagnostically accurate for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer and we do not recommend their routine use for this purpose. Antibiotics have not been shown to be of benefit (and may be of harm) in the absence of surgical wound closure, but osteomyelitis may increase the risk of surgical flap failure. Therefore, it may be preferable to avoid the routine use of antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer unless deep bone biopsy confirms osteomyelitis and surgical wound closure is planned, or the patient has accompanying sepsis syndrome or local soft tissue infection. Irrespective of antibiotic use, a multimodal therapeutic approach includes nutritional optimization, wound debridement and care, pressure off-loading, and psychosocial management.

Question 3: When Should Empirical Therapy Be Administered in the Treatment of Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Some observational studies suggest that administration of antibiotics prior to bone biopsy or surgical management may modestly decrease yield of bone cultures for patients with osteomyelitis, including DFO and PJI. Thus, presuming other microbiological methods (eg, blood cultures) have not already established a microbial etiology, it is reasonable to consider deferring antimicrobial therapy initiation until bone and/or joint microbiological samples are obtained for clinically stable patients. However, other studies are not concordant, and histopathology results are unlikely to be affected by prior short-term antibiotics. Decisions regarding the delay of empirical therapy therefore balance potential harm due to the risk of progression of life-threatening infection (eg, sepsis) or impending spinal cord compression against the potential benefit of microbiological data.

Question 4: Are There Preferred Antibiotics With Which to Treat Osteomyelitis?

### Sacral ependymoma presents 20 years after initial posterior fossa lesion [^111TZMdM]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Prior to the biopsy confirmation, there were a range of differential diagnoses considered. These included an MPE, chordoma, metastasis from a primary malignancy located elsewhere, or less likely, a sarcoma or lymphoma. Ependymoma was felt to be the most likely and this was subsequently confirmed.

Recurrent ependymoma after more than 20 years are uncommonand the median time to first recurrence has been observed as 16 months. It is also rare for grade 1 ependymoma to be destructive of bony tissue. Drop metastases are widely described, but a 20-year interval was considered unlikely. The second tumour could possibly be a spontaneous tumour independent of the PFE.

### Sacral insufficiency fractures: an easily overlooked cause of back pain in the ED [^117TpgkV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Sacral insufficiency fractures are an important and treatable cause of severe back pain. Despite publication of several case reports since its original description in 1982, awareness of these injuries remains inadequate in emergency medicine. Most patients are elderly women presenting with intractable lower back pain. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is the most significant risk factor. Marked sacral tenderness is common. Neurologic impairment is rarely detectable. Routine radiography of the spine and pelvis is usually inconclusive. Computed tomography remains the diagnostic modality of choice. Treatment is usually conservative.

### Sacral fractures [^113WMFWr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Sacral fractures most commonly occur after pelvic ring injuries but occasionally in isolation. Although the true incidence of sacral fractures is unknown, an estimated 30% are identified late. Sequelae of inappropriately treated or untreated sacral fractures include persistent pain, decreased mobility, and neurologic compromise. Because these fractures often result from high-energy trauma, concomitant injuries should be suspected. A thorough physical examination, including a detailed neurologic assessment and radiographic evaluation, is necessary to determine treatment. Computed tomography of the pelvis/sacrum can provide significant information about fracture pattern. Surgical intervention, often as a combination of neural decompression and stabilization, is indicated in patients with neurologic deficits, significant soft-tissue compromise, and lumbosacral instability. Patient satisfaction with surgical intervention has not been definitively documented, although neurologic improvement with timely intervention has been noted.

### A 52-year-old man with a chronic nasal wound [^113dwqvg]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 52-year-old man who sought evaluation for a chronic nasal lesion that had eroded into his nasal septum. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

Infections developing in damaged skin

It is a heterogeneous group that includes soft tissue infections developing in damaged skin such as bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds or in pressure or vascular ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft tissue infections

Soft tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is always recommended for high-risk wounds. For patients with signs of sepsis, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic and anaerobic organisms is always required.

Patients with serious burn injury require immediate care. Significant burn injuries can predispose to infectious complications. Burn wound infections are one of the most important and potentially serious complications that occur in the acute period following injury. Accurate medications of the wound with early excision of the eschar can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive burn wound infection.

Although burn wound surfaces are sterile immediately following thermal injury, these wounds may be colonized with microorganisms. If the patient's host defenses and therapeutic measures (such as excision of necrotic tissue and wound medications) are inadequate, microorganisms can colonize viable tissue, and a burn wound infection can occur.

Burn wound infections usually are polymicrobial. They can be immediately colonized by gram-positive bacteria from the patient's endogenous skin flora or the external environment. However they can also be rapidly colonized by gram-negative bacteria, usually within a week of the burn injury.

Pressure ulcers are localized areas of tissue necrosis that tend to develop when soft tissue is compressed between a bony prominence and an external surface for a prolonged period of time. The damage may be relatively minor, or it may lead to massive destruction of deeper tissues. The majority of pressure ulcers develop in areas adjacent to the ischium, sacrum, and greater trochanter.

Combination of surgical and antimicrobial interventions may be required to manage infected decubitus ulcers. Surgical debridement is necessary to remove necrotic tissue. Antimicrobial therapy should be used for patients with severe pressure ulcer infections, including those with spreading cellulitis or patients with signs of sepsis. Because such infections usually are polymicrobial, therapeutic regimens should be directed against both gram-positive and gram-negative facultative organisms as well as anaerobic organisms.

In many cases a correct wound care management can largely prevent the appearance of these infections.

### Sacral fractures [^111avrke]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

Sacral fractures are uncommon lesions and most often the result of high-energy trauma. Depending on the fracture location, neurological injury may be present in over 50% of cases. In this article, the authors conducted a comprehensive literature review on the epidemiology of sacral fractures, relevant anatomy of the sacral and pelvic region, common sacral injuries and fractures, classification systems of sacral fractures, and current management strategies. Due to the complex nature of these injuries, surgical management remains a challenge for the attending surgeon. Few large-scale studies have addressed postoperative complications or long-term results, but current evidence suggests that although fusion rates are high, long-term morbidity, such as residual pain and neurological deficits, persists for many patients.

### Iliopsoas abscess presenting with sacral fracture and gluteal abscess: a clinical conundrum [^115mHmpP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Abscess of the iliopsoas muscle is a rare condition that requires a high degree of clinical suspicion for diagnosis. High mortality rates highlight the need for prompt recognition. We report the case of a 26-year-old man, with a history of intravenous drug use, who was referred from an outside facility with sacral fracture and gluteal abscess. Sacral trauma occurred 3 weeks before presentation, with progressive worsening of buttock pain. The patient was treated with irrigation and débridement of the gluteal abscess. Follow-up MRI revealed a communicating iliopsoas abscess that initially had been undiagnosed. After a prolonged hospital stay requiring additional irrigation and débridement procedures, the patient was discharged in a stable condition. Five-month follow-up has demonstrated no evidence of recurrence of infection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Staphylococcus aureus gluteal abscess with pelvic extension into the iliopsoas secondary to sacral trauma and intravenous drug use.

### A rare differential diagnosis in dysphagia: wound botulism [^116QuQ2U]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of wound botulism is increasing dramatically among intravenous drug users. Efficient intensive care and early treatment with antitoxin is essential to avoid lethal courses. The clinical picture of botulism is of descending, symmetric, flaccid paralysis. Early symptoms include cranial nerve palsies resulting in blurred vision and diplopia, difficulty in focusing, ptosis, facial weakness, dysphagia, dysphonia, and dysarthria. Because patients presenting with dysarthria and dysphagia will often be seen by an ear, nose and throat specialist initially, this rare but upcoming neurologic disease must be considered in the differential diagnoses.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113DCRdM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Pressure ulcers are localized areas of tissue necrosis that tend to develop when soft-tissue is compressed between a bony prominence and an external surface for a prolonged period of time. The damage may be relatively minor, or it may lead to massive destruction of deeper tissues. The majority of pressure ulcers develop in areas adjacent to the ischium, sacrum, and greater trochanter. Pressure ulcers represent a frequent problem especially in frail elderly patients with chronic co-morbidities. When infection occurs, it is typically polymicrobial and includes aerobes (S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp.) and anaerobes (Peptococcus spp. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens).

Combination of surgical and antibiotic interventions may be required to manage infected decubitus ulcers. Surgical debridement is necessary to remove necrotic tissue. Antibiotic therapy should be used for patients with severe pressure ulcer infections, including those with spreading cellulitis or patients with systemic signs of infection. Because such infections usually are polymicrobial, therapeutic regimens should be directed against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative facultative organisms as well as anaerobic organisms. In many cases of pressure ulcers, correct wound care management can largely prevent the occurrence of these infections.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^113FfQda]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) follow-up and adverse event monitoring — Clinicians and any clinical personnel engaged in follow-up should be aware that treatment options have different efficacy requirements and adverse event profiles, and patients should be informed and queried about dry mouth, constipation, fecal retention, and possible central nervous system effects, with queries particularly important in elderly or frail patients. Non-responders to anti-muscarinics or mirabegron should be tried on at least one other anti-muscarinic or mirabegron and/or dose modification attempted to determine if a better balance between efficacy and adverse events occurs, and if adverse events compromise quality of life, strategies to manage specific adverse events should be implemented before abandoning anti-muscarinic treatment. For peripheral tibial nerve stimulation and sacral neuromodulation, pre- and post-therapy measures are essential to assess efficacy, and before-and-after evaluation should include a baseline voiding diary, assessment of urgency, and a global response assessment, with adverse events and sacral neuromodulation wound complications evaluated. Patients treated with intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA should be followed for increased PVRs and the need for self-catheterization, and those who have undergone surgical treatments or have permanent or semi-permanent catheters should be followed regularly for symptom level, quality of life, and complications; patients using incontinence pads should be followed for appropriate skin care and skin integrity.

Case report

In January 2019, a 23-year-old Gambian patient presented to the outpatient clinic for migrants at the Department of Infectious Tropical Diseases and Microbiology of the IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital, Negrar, Verona, Italy.

He had arrived in Italy in March 2017, after spending 6 weeks in Libya. Soon after his arrival, he was admitted in a primary care hospital in Southern Italy due to pulmonary tuberculosis, anaemia and scabies; during the admission, he was diagnosed with an ischiatic ulcer with exposed bone and meningocele. He was treated for scabies and anaemia; treatment for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis was also started. The patient reported that the ischiatic ulcer appeared in the absence of any trauma or injury, approximately 2 years before, and progressively worsened. In May 2017, the patient moved to the Veneto region in Northern Italy. In December 2017, he presented to the plastic surgery department of our hospital, due to worsening of the ischiatic lesion. The patient underwent surgical curettage and vacuum-assisted closure therapy; the histological examination of the removed tissue documented dermal sclerosis with associated inflammatory granulation tissue and angiogenesis; the presence of dysplastic or neoplastic elements was excluded. Then, he was regularly followed up with surgical debridement and wound dressings. Tuberculosis treatment was successfully completed in January 2018, with no signs or symptoms of relapse over time.

When he presented to our clinic in January 2019, he reported progressive walking impairment, weakness and pain in the lower limbs bilaterally. The physical examination revealed painful mobilisation of the lower limbs, associated with hypoesthesia and paraesthesia on the left side. He did not report fever, weight loss or night sweats.

### Peristomal cutaneous amebiasis causing rapidly progressive necrotic wound of a left lower quadrant end colostomy [^113y61U6]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cutaneous amebiasis is a rare clinical entity caused by the invasive protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica that can be readily diagnosed with skin biopsy if suspected. It presents as a rapidly progressive and destructive ulceration with necrosis. A man in his 40s with metastatic rectal cancer who underwent palliative abdominal perineal resection with end colostomy in his left lower quadrant and on systemic chemotherapy developed progressive breakdown of his peristomal skin unresponsive to antibiotics that was then diagnosed to be cutaneous amebiasis. It is important to be aware of cutaneous amebiasis and include it in the differential diagnosis when peristomal wounds do not respond to treatment.

### Management of grade IV decubitus ulcer [^114ieHyg]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We present a case of a female in her 60s with the history of chronic renal failure who presented with a grade IV decubitus ulcer over the sacral region. The ulcer had progressed over several weeks due to prolonged immobility, poor nutritional status, and compromised skin integrity associated with uraemia. Wound debridement, antibiotic therapy, and pressure offloading were initiated alongside renal management. The complexity of care was heightened by impaired wound healing, anaemia, and fluid-electrolyte imbalances. Her dependence on caregiver for activities of daily living such as bathing, feeding, and mobility, impacted both physical and psychosocial well-being. The caregiver faced challenges like maintaining wound hygiene, ensuring adherence to treatment, and managing the emotional toll of progressive deterioration. This case highlights the intricate interplay between chronic disease and decubitus ulcer management, emphasising the need for a multidisciplinary approach that supports both patient and caregiver in improving functional outcomes and quality of life.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111ZtJ9H]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

An anorectal abscess is characterized by an infection in the soft tissue around the anus. However, depending on the different anatomical locations of the infectious process, the manifestations, and the treatment of anorectal abscesses vary widely. It is important to remember the anatomical classification of intersphincteric, perianal, ischiorectal, or supralevator abscesses. Anorectal abscesses are associated with anal fistulas in approximately a third of patients, and the classification of fistulae depends on their anatomical location as well. The clinical presentation is typically characterized by perianal pain, swelling, and fever, but deeper abscesses may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, and buttocks or with symptoms that mimic an intra-abdominal condition; discharge of pus could also be present and occasionally patients with anorectal abscesses will present with urinary retention. It is a common disease and constitutes a common presentation to emergency general surgeons; the most common age for presentation is 20–40 years, with men more commonly affected than women. The majority are idiopathic in nature, with the cryptoglandular hypothesis being most commonly accepted, but a proportion may present as part of another disease process, most commonly Crohn's disease. The differential diagnosis of anorectal abscesses is wide and comprises other significant diseases such as anal cancer and precancerous conditions, Crohn's disease, and tuberculosis. In fact, an anorectal abscess will develop in approximately one third of patients with Crohn's disease. Furthermore, it is important to make an early distinction from Fournier's gangrene/necrotizing fasciitis. The most common anatomical locations are perianal and ischio-rectal, with intersphincteric and supralevator being less common. The management of patients with known Crohn's disease goes beyond the aims of these guidelines, but it is mandatory to exclude the presence of undiagnosed underlying Crohn's disease in every patient presenting with an anorectal abscess, especially if recurrent. For this reason, a focused and detailed medical history is of utmost importance and complete physical examination should include a careful inspection of the perineum checking for surgical scars, anorectal deformities, other signs of perianal Crohn's disease, the presence of secondary cellulitis, or the presence of external opening of an anal fistula. A complete anorectal examination, including digital rectal examination, is usually feasible, but in some cases, sedation or anesthesia may be needed due to the intense pain. The patient's history and physical examination are usually enough to diagnose small and superficial abscesses, while deeper abscesses can be challenging to diagnose; in these cases, rectal examination usually reveals a tender, indurated area above the anorectal ring.

### A retrospective chart review of chronic wound patients treated with topical oxygen therapy [^115UxX2L]. Advances in Wound Care (2017). Low credibility.

Wound characteristics

Chronic wounds ranged in age from 1 month to over 1 year (Table 2). The foot was the most common wound location (46%) followed by the leg (20.7%), while the sacral region (2.2%) was the least represented site. Most of the wounds on the foot (50.5%) and toe (44.0%) were associated with patients having a diabetes mellitus diagnosis (ICD9 250). The majority of the sacral wounds (55.7%) were associated with patients having a diagnosis of chronic ulcer of the skin.

Table 2.
Wound characteristics

Initial wound size ranged in total area from 1 to 1,500 cm 2 with a median area of 6 cm 2. A total of 24.4% of the wounds had a wound starting size > 16 cm 2. Following TOT, this group of wounds (> 16 cm 2) contained only 16.2% of the wounds (Table 2), suggesting that many of the largest, chronic wounds experienced a healing benefit after TOT. The change in total wound area after TOT ranged from −2,717% to 100%. The large negative changes tended to be for wounds with a smaller initial size that did not heal (5% of wounds in this study). The majority of the wounds treated with TOT had a decrease in size after treatment (59.4% of all wounds in the study). At the end of treatment, the median wound size was 2 cm 2 with 27.5% of wounds being completely healed (identified by a physician or measurement).

Pressure ulcers

Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and pressure injuries, are localized areas of tissue necrosis developing when soft tissue is compressed between a bony prominence and an external surface for a prolonged period of time. They are an important problem in critically ill patients, older adults, and in persons with spinal cord injury and are one of the most common types of complex wound.

Pressure ulcers can offer an ideal environment for microbial colonization. This is especially true for those pressure ulcers that may be particularly exposed to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial contamination from fecal material. However, all wounds can be colonized by micro‐organisms without leading to adverse events.

Standard care for adults with pressure ulcers includes a correct prevention and management.

Prevention of pressure ulcer formation is directed at alleviating the risk factors for the individual patient, and is primarily focused on minimizing episodes of prolonged pressure either by placing appropriate padding at pressure points or by frequent patient repositioning.

Debridement of devitalized tissue and biofilm and abscess drainage are necessary in the treatment of pressure ulcers. In cases where there is a significant amount of necrotic tissue, performing the initial debridement in the operating room allows for a more definitive procedure. Subsequent debridements are then more easily managed at the bedside.

Dressings should be chosen depending on the wound being treated. None of the dressings has been shown to have any superiority, and the choice of dressing should depend on the type of wound being treated.

Any open pressure ulcer is superficially contaminated with environmental flora. However, it is important to prevent added contamination if the wound is near the fecal stream as in ischial or sacral pressure ulcers. Systemic antibiotics should be administered only when there is clinical evidence of infection.

Treatment
Prevention by pressure redistribution devices such as high‐specification foam mattresses or cushions, or both and by frequent patient repositioning
Debridement of devitalized tissue and biofilm and abscess drainage
Appropriate selection of dressings and topical agents
Routine use of systemic antibiotics is not currently recommended for the treatment of uninfected pressure ulcers. Systemic antibiotics should be administered only when there are systemic signs of inflammation (serious infection), spreading cellulitis (deep skin infection) or underlying osteomyelitis.

### Retrorectal developmental cysts in adults: clinical and radiologic-histopathologic review, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^111LiFmi]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Developmental cysts are the most common retrorectal cystic lesions in adults, occurring mostly in middle-aged women. They are classified as epidermoid cysts, dermoid cysts, enteric cysts (tailgut cysts and cystic rectal duplication), and neurenteric cysts according to their origin and histopathologic features. Although developmental cysts are often asymptomatic, patients may present with symptoms resulting from local mass effect (eg, constipation, rectal fullness, lower abdominal pain, dysuria), with a palpable retrorectal mass at digital rectal examination, or with a complication. Infection with fistulization, bleeding, and malignant degeneration are the major complications of developmental cysts. A well-defined, unilocular or multilocular, thin-walled cystic lesion is the main imaging feature. Uncommonly, a sacral bone defect and calcifications are associated with developmental cysts. The differential diagnosis includes cystic sacrococcygeal teratoma, anterior sacral meningocele, anal duct or gland cyst, necrotic rectal leiomyosarcoma, extraperitoneal adenomucinosis, cystic lymphangioma, pyogenic abscess, neurogenic cyst, and necrotic sacral chordoma. Complete surgical excision is indicated to establish the diagnosis and avoid complications.

Buttock stab wounds are a surprisingly common and increasing source of presentations to emergency departments. These injuries can have a significant impact on quality of life, and there are a number of often subtle, but significant, injuries that the radiologist must be alert to when interpreting computed tomography examinations in these patients. In this review, we will examine briefly the sociological reasons for the increase in these injuries, discuss appropriate imaging techniques, and provide imaging examples of the clinically important injuries that may be encountered in this region. These injuries include rectal or colonic perforation; genito-urinary trauma, for example urethral injury; injury to the sciatic nerve; and a spectrum of vascular trauma including transection and pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula formation.

### Sacral stress fractures [^113Msa8e]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Stress fractures result from skeletal failure resulting from submaximal repetitive forces over time. Sacral stress fractures may represent an underdiagnosed cause of low back and buttock pain. They occur primarily in two populations, young active persons and elderly osteoporotic women, usually corresponding to fatigue and insufficiency-type fractures, respectively. The clinical presentation of these fractures is similar, but the medical and rehabilitation management of these patient populations differs and is tailored to the specific underlying etiology. In both types of fractures, appropriate conservative measures generally result in good functional outcomes. This paper provides an overview of the anatomical considerations, risk factors, clinical presentations, diagnostic imaging findings, appropriate laboratory studies, medical management, and rehabilitation management of patients with sacral stress fractures.

### Complex sacral fracture [^116Ye6Y1]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We reported a case of a patient with suspected cauda equina syndrome secondary to sacral fracture, after sustaining a fall. The difficulty in early diagnosis of complex sacral fractures and the lack of clearly defined guidelines for treatment are highlighted. Thorough clinical examination is mandatory, in order to make an adequate initial assessment and follow symptoms progression and response to treatment. The threshold for performing CT imaging (or MRI, if advised), when suspecting sacral fracture and neurological compromise, should be low. A multidisciplinary approach, with contributions from orthopaedic and/or neurosurgical surgery and physiatry, should be the gold standard of treatment. In this particular case, conservative management and close follow-up led to a significant improvement of problems and a good final outcome, showing that surgical decompression is not the only valid option and that further prospective studies are needed, regarding patient selection and timing of intervention.

Fournier's gangrene is a potentially life-threatening necrotising fasciitis of the perineum and genital region requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment (Fig. 22). Initial symptoms are severe pain in the genital region followed by swelling and erythaema. In patients with SCI, lack of pain sensation often delays diagnosis. Risk factors for the development of necrotising perineal fasciitis include immunosuppression, paralysis, skin ulceration, peripheral vascular disease, renal insufficiency and instrumentation or catherisation. Adjunct CT imaging may be useful to confirm diagnosis, define the extent of disease and plan surgical treatment. Treatment requires early, aggressive antibiotics and surgical debridement, which should not be delayed by imaging.

### Spinal pseudomeningocoele: a diagnostic dilemma [^113JxSMT]. Spinal Cord (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To describe the difficulty in diagnosing spinal pseudomeningocoele.

Setting

Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Case Report

A case of progressive sacral swelling in a paraplegic man who sustained spinal cord injury 14 years ago is presented. Although his clinical features were suggestive of pseudomeningocoele, we were unable to confirm the diagnosis preoperatively.

Conclusion

Traumatic spinal pseudomeningocoele is very rare. Even with the available modern diagnostic imaging techniques, it is still difficult to diagnose a spinal pseudomeningocoele.

### Caution: laparoscopic biopsy of a large pelvic mass may result in disaster [^116xpiTS]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Anterior sacral meningocele is a rare cause of a pelvic mass. Herein the authors describe the case of a young patient presenting with chronic pelvic pain undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy. She was found to have a retrorectal mass confirmed as an anterior sacral meningocele on subsequent MRI. The authors explore the case, describe a method of intraoperative management to minimize the risk of severe complications and include a discussion of the differential diagnosis. Central to this is an emphasis on advocating a cautious approach when confronted with an incidental unknown pelvic mass, as deleterious consequences may occur from biopsy of such a lesion.

### Imaging of sacral tumors [^116fcXek]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Sacral tumors are somewhat unique to the skeletal system in that the prevalence of various neoplasms is different from that at other osseous sites. There are also unique imaging-related considerations, related in part to diagnosis, but particularly to the evaluation site for tumor biopsy sampling and resection. In this report, the authors describe imaging features of the most common sacral lesions, provide numerous radiological examples, and give suggestions for optimal imaging of this region of the body.

### Sacral Ewing's sarcoma and challenges in it's diagnosis on MRI [^114wmcsq]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

A 15-yr old boy presented with low backache for 4 months associated with weakness of left lower limb. MRI of lumbosacral spine showed a sacral lesion with intraspinal and presacral soft tissue extension with neural compression. A diagnosis of tuberculosis was considered in the view of high prevalence in this part of the world, however biopsy revealed Ewing's sarcoma. Ewing's tumor of sacrum is rare, but should be suspected in low backache in children. Differential diagnosis for a sacral lesion includes tuberculosis, pyogenic osteomyelitis, lymphoma, chordoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. MRI is sensitive in detecting these lesions but is nonspecific requiring histopathological examination for confirmation.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113xx2J3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

### Giant cystic sacral schwannoma mimicking tarlov cyst: a case report [^1149bYZE]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present a rare case of a giant schwannoma of the sacrum mimicking a Tarlov cyst.

Methods

A 58-year-old woman had a 1-year history of low back pain. MRI revealed a large cystic mass in the sacral canal with bony erosion. Radiological diagnosis of Tarlov cyst was made.

Results

The patient underwent surgical treatment for the lesion, which revealed a solid mass. Histopathological examination of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient has had significant improvement in her pain 1 month postoperatively.

Conclusion

Giant cystic schwannoma of the sacrum is a very rare diagnosis overlooked by practitioners for more common cystic etiologies, but its treatment is significantly different. Care should be taken to include this diagnosis in a differential for a cystic sacral mass.

### Effect of early mobilization on 30-day wound complications following sacral amputation for en bloc tumor resection [^114bZxg5]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sacral amputations for en bloc resection of malignant spinal tumors are associated with significant morbidity, especially wound complications, and require complex plastic surgery reconstructions to achieve wound closure. In this study, the authors investigate wound healing related to early postoperative mobilization (≤ 3 days of bed rest) compared with delayed postoperative mobilization (> 3 days of bed rest). The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative wound complications.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent sacral amputation at a single institution with a single neurosurgeon between 2018 and 2023. Demographic information, comorbid conditions, pathological diagnosis, surgical characteristics, length of bed rest, and postoperative wound complications were collected for each patient. Univariate analysis followed by stepwise multivariable logistic regression was utilized to identify independent predictors of 30-day postoperative wound complications, defined as reoperation, infection, or dehiscence at the surgical site.

Results

Forty-three patients were included in the analysis. Thirty-one patients were placed on standard bed rest (> 3 days; mean 5.9 [SD 2.4] days), while 12 were mobilized early (≤ 3 days; mean 2.3 [SD 1.4] days). The overall wound complication rate was 37.2%. Of the patients with delayed mobilization, 15 (48.4%) experienced wound complications, while 1 (8.3%) with early mobilization experienced wound complications. On multivariable analysis, early mobilization was independently associated with reduced odds of 30-day wound complications (OR 0.035, 95% CI 0.002–0.689; p = 0.0275).

Conclusions

These data show that early mobilization after sacral amputation is associated with a decreased incidence of wound complications compared with delayed mobilization. Further prospective studies investigating early mobilization after sacral amputation are warranted.

### Closed-incision negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in elderly patients following sacral pressure sore reconstruction [^115dXY9F]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pressure sores continue to represent a significant source of morbidity among old patients, underscoring the critical need for effective management strategies in the realm of geriatric care. An epidemiologic study by Margolis et al. highlighted that the annual period prevalence of pressure sores in patients over the age of 65 varied from 0.31% to 0.70%, with incidence rates escalating notably with age. Similarly, another investigation reported a prevalence rate of 27.9% for pressure sores in individuals aged 65 years and older within municipal healthcare settings in Sweden. Pressure sores often cause significant pain, and they can also become primary infection sources for life-threatening sepsis in cases of concurrent osteomyelitis. In the elderly, the risk of osteomyelitis significantly increases if surgical intervention is delayed due to deteriorating general condition. It is not uncommon for old patients and their caregivers to present at outpatient clinics with sores that have been either neglected or inadequately managed, some of which may be contaminated with fecal matter. As a prevalent and chronic issue among frail or immobilized patients in hospital environments, pressure sores also impose considerable socio-economic burden on patients, their families, and caregivers. The etiology of pressure sores in old patients is complex, often compounded by comorbidities such as diabetes, stroke, and dementia. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is often warranted for the effective treatment of pressure sore in this demographic.

The causes and pathophysiology of the development of pressure sores have been extensively elucidated in the literature. Sustained compression of a body part compromises the circulation of nearby tissues and causes direct deformation damage, eventually leading to a breach in the skin barrier or causing skin necrosis. Shearing forces are also known to be one of the key factors for the development of pressure sores. In terms of sore site, the sacrum is one of the areas prone to chronic pressure sores. This is especially the case for paraplegic patients or those suffering from debilitating medical illnesses, who are obliged to remain in the supine position for most of their days. Due to the proximity of the sacrum to the anus, this area is very prone to fecal contamination, leading to prolonged and cumbersome healing especially in patients with urinary or fecal incontinence.

### Sacral stress fractures: an unusual cause of low back pain in an athlete [^1156Wj7J]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report of a sacral stress fracture causing low back pain in an athlete.

Objective

To document the occurrence of sacral stress fractures in athletes and to recommend it in the differential diagnosis of low back pain, especially in runners and volleyball players.

Summary Of Background Data

Low back pain is common both in the general population and in athletes. Athletes place high physical demands on their bodies, which often lead to stress fractures. Sacral stress fractures can cause back pain and are often not included in the differential diagnosis of back pain.

Methods

The authors were involved in the care and treatment of this patient and reviewed all medical records, radiologic tests, and related literature.

Results

In a 16-year-old volleyball player with a 4-week history of low back pain, magnetic resonance imaging of her pelvis revealed a stress fracture of the left sacral ala. She was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, rest, and conditioning exercises and had a good functional outcome.

Conclusion

Sacral stress fractures should be included in the differential diagnosis of athletes with low back pain, particularly runners and volleyball players. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first report of a volleyball player with a sacral stress fracture. A review of the literature yielded 29 cases of sacral stress fractures in athletes, mainly runners.

### Atypical unilateral sacroiliitis secondary to mechanical stress injury [^1177JS8R]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

We report for the first time a case of atypical unilateral sacroiliitis secondary to mechanical stress injury. Unilateral sacroiliitis can be caused by a variety of etiologies. The first diagnosis to rule out is infection since it requires urgent treatment to avoid its serious consequences. Spondyloarthritis can be manifested by unilateral sacroiliitis in its early stage. Sacral fractures should always be looked for on the imaging modalities performed. In our case, no signs of infection or systemic disease were found. No fracture was seen on the imaging examinations and we had negative cultures on the computed tomography-guided biopsy realized. A history of mechanical stress was the only clue found suggesting the diagnosis of a probable stress related sacroiliitis. A thorough review of the literature will be provided stating the different causes of sacroiliitis described till now, with discussion of this new reported entity.

### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a cause of protracted wound healing and vitamin D deficiency in a spinal cord injured patient with a sacral pressure sore: a case report [^1178oodX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pressure sores are sometimes refractory to treatment, often due to malnutrition. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) obstructs absorption in the digestive tract and causes malnutrition. However, little is known about the association between pressure sore wound healing and SIBO. Here, we report a case of a patient with a refractory sacral pressure sore and SIBO.

Case presentation

A 66-year-old woman who was spinal cord injured 14 years before visiting our hospital presented with the chief complaint of a sacral pressure sore, 10.0 × 6.5 cm in size, which was refractory to treatment. Physical examination showed abdominal distension and emaciation, with a body mass index of 15. Further examination revealed elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (1260 U/L), bilateral tibial fracture, multiple rib fracture, and osteoporosis. We diagnosed the patient with osteomalacia with vitamin D deficiency. Despite oral supplementation, serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D remained low. Also, despite concentrative wound therapy for the sacral pressure sore by plastic surgeons, no wound healing was achieved. Due to a suspicion of disturbances in nutrient absorption, we performed bacterial examination of collected gastric and duodenal fluid, which showed high numbers of bacteria in gastric content (10 4 E. coli, 10 5 Streptococcus species, and 10 5 Neisseria species) and duodenal content (10 6 E. coli, 10 4 Candida glabrata). Therefore, we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and started selective decontamination of the digestive tract using polymyxin B sulfate and amphotericin B. After starting treatment for SIBO, the sacral pressure sore began to heal and was nearly healed after 285 days. The patient's serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, vitamin D, and other fat-soluble vitamins also gradually increased after starting treatment for SIBO.

Conclusion

We report a case of a patient with a refractory sacral pressure sore that healed after starting treatment for SIBO. We conclude that SIBO may be an overlooked cause of malnutrition and poor wound healing in patients with chronic pressure sores.

### Suture granuloma diagnosed and treated with bedside ultrasound [^114Rt6qd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians frequently evaluate patients with postoperative wound issues. The differential is broad, but obviously includes postoperative site infections. We present a case where a suspected postoperative abscess was evaluated with bedside ultrasound prior to incision and drainage. Suture material was recognized, shifting our approach to treatment of the lesion.

Case Report

A 24-year-old female patient presented with pain, swelling, and drainage from a left lower quadrant abdominal wound that had been present since undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy 1 year prior. A computed tomography scan was performed, which was negative for foreign bodies. Prior to incision and drainage, a bedside ultrasound was performed to evaluate the lesion, which was notable for sonographic findings consistent with suture material. Suture granuloma was diagnosed, and ultrasound was then used to successfully guide retrieval of the suture. To our knowledge, this is the first published case where ultrasound was used to both diagnose and dynamically remove the offending suture material. We briefly discuss suture granulomas, their sonographic appearance, and management. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians frequently perform ultrasound on suspected abscesses prior to incision and drainage and should be aware of the sonographic appearance of suture material as it would change management if present. If a suture granuloma is suspected due to swelling at a postoperative site, ultrasound use should be strongly considered for evaluation.

### Reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers [^116g3UJZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There are several possible interventions for managing pressure ulcers (sometimes referred to as pressure injuries), ranging from pressure-relieving measures, such as repositioning, to reconstructive surgery. The surgical approach is usually reserved for recalcitrant wounds (where the healing process has stalled, or the wound is not responding to treatment) or wounds with full-thickness skin loss and exposure of deeper structures such as muscle fascia or bone. Reconstructive surgery commonly involves wound debridement followed by filling the wound with new tissue. Whilst this is an accepted means of ulcer management, the benefits and harms of different surgical approaches, compared with each other or with non-surgical treatments, are unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different types of reconstructive surgery for treating pressure ulcers (category/stage II or above), compared with no surgery or alternative reconstructive surgical approaches, in any care setting.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022.

Selection Criteria

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed reconstructive surgery in the treatment of pressure ulcers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies, extracted study data, assessed the risk of bias and undertook GRADE assessments. We would have involved a third review author in case of disagreement.

Main Results

We identified one RCT conducted in a hospital setting in the United States. It enrolled 20 participants aged between 20 and 70 years with stage IV ischial or sacral pressure ulcers (involving full-thickness skin and tissue loss). The study compared two reconstructive techniques for stage IV pressure ulcers: conventional flap surgery and cone of pressure flap surgery, in which a large portion of the flap tip is de-epithelialised and deeply inset to obliterate dead space. There were no clear data for any of our outcomes, although we extracted some information on complete wound healing, wound dehiscence, pressure ulcer recurrence and wound infection. We graded the evidence for these outcomes as very low-certainty. The study provided no data for any other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently there is very little randomised evidence on the role of reconstructive surgery in pressure ulcer management, although it is considered a priority area. More rigorous and robust research is needed to explore this intervention.

### Surgical treatment of sacral pressure wounds in patients with COVID-19: a case series [^111TQnH5]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID 19 pandemic has resulted in an increased number of patients requiring intubation and intensive care. This has led to an increased incidence of sacral pressure ulcers requiring surgical management. We report our experience of COVID 19 related sacral pressure ulcers requiring surgical reconstruction.

Methods

A case series study was performed with 12 patients who presented grade IV sacral pressure ulcers after hospitalization for COVID-19 in a single institution. The mean age was 49.8 years and the most frequent comorbidities were arterial hypertension, diabetes and obesity, each present in 6 patients. All of them were submitted to surgical reconstruction with fasciocutaneous flaps after improvement of their clinical status. Follow up time was of at least 30 days after reconstruction. Preoperative laboratory tests and surgical outcomes were compared to data available in the literature.

Results

No major dehiscence was observed and minor dehiscence happened in 2 cases (16.7%). Out of the 12 patients, 8 (66.7%) had hemoglobin levels less than 10.0 and 5 (41.7%) had albumin levels less than 3.0, though this did not lead to a higher rate of complications.

Conclusion

This study showed that ambulating patients with grade IV pressure ulcer after COVID- 19 infection may undergo debridement, negative-pressure wound therapy and closure with local flaps with adequate results and minimal complication rate.

### A sacral hydatid cyst mimicking an anterior sacral meningocele [^116eUzWp]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Hydatid disease is a zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus. It is a progressive disease with serious morbidity risks. Sacral hydatid disease is very uncommon, accounting for < 11% of spinal hydatidosis cases. The diagnosis of a sacral hydatid cyst is sometimes difficult because hydatidosis can simulate other cystic pathologies. The authors report on 9-year-old boy admitted to their service with a paraparesis that allowed walking without aid. The boy presented with a 2-year history of an evolving incomplete cauda equina syndrome as well as a soft cystic mass in the abdomen extending from the pelvis. Radiological examination revealed an anterior meningocele. A posterior approach with laminectomy from L-5 to S-3 was performed. Three lesions with classic features of a hydatid cyst were observed and removed. The diagnosis of hydatid cyst was confirmed histopathologically. Antihelmintic treatment with albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) was included in the postoperative treatment. The patient's condition improved after surgery, and he recovered normal mobility. The unusual site and presentation of hydatid disease in this patient clearly supports the consideration of spinal hydatid disease in the differential diagnosis for any mass in the body, especially in endemic areas.

### Incidental detection of sacral insufficiency fracture on 68Ga-FAPI PET / MR [^1179zHRW]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 61-year-old woman with low-set rectal adenocarcinoma (cT4bN1Mx) received radiotherapy and chemotherapy for 4 months, and then she underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and 68Ga-FAPI PET/MR. Obviously increased 68Ga-FAPI uptake was unexpectedly revealed on both sides of the sacrum with low 18F-FDG uptake, which was diagnosed as insufficiency fracture based on the imaging features, advanced patient age, and radiotherapy history. The possibility of insufficiency fracture should be considered when accidental, symmetrically increased sacral 68Ga-FAPI uptake appears in cancer patients, and differential diagnosis should be carefully made.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pressure ulcer, more specifically with respect to evaluation for wound infection, WHS 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that signs and symptoms of chronic wound infection include:

- delayed healing, defined as a lack of progress toward the closure of the wound and no decrease in wound size

- discoloration of granulation tissue (edematous granulation tissue or pale, dusky in color) as opposed to the red beefy color of healthy granulation tissue

- friable granulation tissue bleeding spontaneously or bleeding with little provocation

- pocketing at the base of the wound or recessed areas with an absence of granulation tissue

- foul odor (typically caused by Gram-negative organisms and usually associated with anaerobic organisms)

- wound breakdown characterized by increased size, loss of epithelium, bony exposure, and nonadherent granulation tissue (results from abnormal collagen formation caused by high bioburden)

- increased level of pain even in the absence of any discernible signs of inflammation (suggestive of wound infection).

Postoperative complications and revisions – stage 1

As expected, no intraoperative complications were observed. Postoperative complications regarding stage 1 (Table 3) were rare and included only two adverse events. One patient had a urinary tract infection (Clavien I), which was treated with an antibiotic selected according to a microbiological examination. In another patient, a wound infection was found in the area of the test electrodes, necessitating early removal of the electrodes (Clavien IIIb). In this case, the test was assessed as negative and was not repeated at the patient's request. Both adverse events were observed in the younger age group. Due to the rarity of both events, no statistical significance could be detected.

### Porcine tri-layer wound matrix for the treatment of stage IV pressure ulcers [^113FzjLD]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

A 41-year-old woman with T9 paraplegia presented to the emergency department in March 2014 with fever and chronic pressure ulcers of the sacrum and vulva caused by an ill-fitting wheelchair. She had a history of a sacral pressure ulcer since 2012 with associated coccygeal osteomyelitis (Fig 1, A). She was treated previously with wound vacuum dressings and Apligraf (Organogenesis, Inc, Canton, MA), a bilayer living tissue matrix, by an outside wound care facility.

Laboratory results showed leukocytosis, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia consistent with malnutrition. Imaging found changes suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis involving the right pubic ramus and hip joint. The patient was evaluated by the plastic surgery department and determined to be a poor candidate for surgical intervention because of her poor nutritional status and current smoking. Based on wound culture results, she was started on intravenous ertapenem via peripherally inserted central catheter for osteomyelitis and recommended for outpatient wound care follow-up.

The patient presented to the wound care clinic in March 2014. Examination found a sacral wound with tunneling to 3 cm and granulation tissue noted in the wound bed (Fig 1, A). Over time, this ulcer degenerated to a stage IV ulcer with exposed muscle at the base.

Two weeks later, the patient had a left greater trochanter ulcer (Fig 2, A). The wound had a large, black eschar and necrotic tissue in the wound bed. The ulcer continued to collapse and was debrided. Ultimately, the ulcer extended to the joint capsule.

In May 2014, examination found a new sacral ulcer distal to her initial ulcer, with a large amount of necrotic tissue in the wound (Fig 3, A). The ulcer progressed until there was tunneling with palpable bone at the base of the wound. Thus, the patient's presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of multiple stage IV pressure ulcers.

### Spine injury [^115E3wPS]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Spinal shock duration and clinical markers of resolution — course and reflex findings — note that spinal shock can persist from days to weeks and may be prolonged by toxic or septic syndromes; there is a lack of consensus to define its end, and clinicians may interpret resolution by the appearance of the bulbocavernosus reflex occurring within several days of injury, the return of deep tendon reflexes which can take several weeks, or the return of reflexive bladder function, while for most patients the end is seen with early return of the deep plantar reflex and progressive recovery of the bulbocavernosus, cremasteric, ankle jerk, Babinski sign, and knee jerk; spared distal sacral reflexes such as the bulbocavernosus and anal wink can occur yet should not be confused with sacral sparing, as patients with a complete SCI lack sacral sensation.

### The decubitus ulcer: facts and controversies [^114CEKjB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Defining the decubitus ulcer proves as difficult as agreeing on a name for the condition. Causes include pressure over bony prominences, shearing force, destruction of skin, and compromised blood flow. Evidence is emerging of the importance of ischemia as a primary causative agent, rather than pressure, which needs further investigation. Scales, staging, and treatment and prevention guidelines should be used with caution due to their arbitrary implementation and lack of evidence-based support. Unfortunately, much of the research and expert opinion developed by the government and touted as regulation lacks appropriate strength-of-evidence. Although decubitus ulcers should be prevented and treated to the best of our abilities, recognizing the possibility that the skin, like any other organ in the body, may fail is crucial.

### Operative debridement of pressure ulcers [^114C9D3d]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Infection in severe pressure ulcers can lead to sepsis with a 6-month mortality as high as 68%.

Methods

Operative records of 142 consecutive operative debridements on 60 patients in a dedicated wound healing inpatient unit were reviewed, from the Wound Electronic Medical Record, for identification of key steps in debridement technique, mortality, unexpected returns, and time to discharge following debridement.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 73.1 years, and 45% were men. Most wounds (53%) were located on the hip (ischial or trochanteric); others were on the sacrum (32%) and the heels (14%). The mean initial wound area prior to debridement was 14.0 cm(2), and 83% of debridements were performed on stage IV pressure ulcers. The postoperative hospital stay averaged 4.1 days. Key steps in the technique included (1) exposure of areas of undermining by excising overlying tissue; (2) removal of callus from wound edges; (3) removal of all grossly infected tissue; and (4) obtaining a biopsy of the deep tissue after debridement of all nonviable or infected tissue for culture and pathology to determine the presence of infection, fibrosis, and granulation tissue. There was one death 9 days post-debridement of a sacral ulcer and one unplanned return to the operating room for bleeding 8 days post-debridement.

Conclusions

Operative debridement of pressure ulcers is safe, despite the medical co-morbidities in patients with severe pressure ulcers. Proper debridement technique may prevent sepsis and death in patients with multiple co-morbid conditions.

### Validation of the AO spine sacral classification system: reliability among surgeons worldwide [^1136Z1ms]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Communication, research, education, and appropriate evidence-based treatment of patients are all dependent on the ability to comprehensively classify their injuries or conditions, as is the accuracy of information that surgeons are able to impart to patients about prognosis. Reliability is essential to communicate, classify, and appropriately guide treatment of relevant pathology. Without establishing such reliability, the education of surgeons becomes impractical. Furthermore, the validity of any research regarding the treatment and outcomes of sacral fractures can be called into question. The development process for the AO Spine classification systems is based on the evaluation of numerous cases in multiple sessions by a group of investigators and follows an iterative methodological pathway geared toward developing a validated system. The goal is for all surgeons to be able to accurately and reliably describe injury morphology and severity to facilitate communication between clinicians and researchers, with the ultimate goal of providing universal evidence-based algorithms for the treatment of fractures. Sacral fractures are rare, composed of both low-energy insufficiency and high-energy fractures, where controversy ensues regarding management. Adding to the uncertainty surrounding the most appropriate treatment of sacral fractures is the lack of a reliable and comprehensive means to classify these injuries. Our results suggest that the AO Spine Sacral Classification System may be reliably used to accurately classify sacral fractures despite user subspecialty or level of experience.

D. Bullous amyloidosis is more often associated with primary cutaneous amyloidosis rather than primary systemic amyloidosis with multiorgan involvement
E. Congo red stain can highlight amyloid deposits around the sweat glands and within blood vessel walls in primary systemic amyloidosis

Answers:

A. Primary cutaneous anosacral amyloidosis has been described mostly in Caucasian populations – Incorrect. Primary cutaneous anosacral amyloidosis is a rare entity that has been reported primarily in Asian and Chinese-Caribbean patients to date.
B. In bullous amyloidosis, amyloid deposits within the epidermis leading to an intraepidermal split – Incorrect. Bullous amyloidosis is characterized by amyloid deposits in the dermis causing a subepidermal or intradermal split. In our patient, we suspect his ulcerations occurred due to prolonged pressure on the sacrum while sitting or lying down, resulting in shearing of skin rendered fragile from dermal amyloid deposition.
C. Primary cutaneous anosacral amyloidosis is characterized histologically by dermal and perivascular amyloid aggregates – Incorrect. Primary cutaneous anosacral amyloidosis is characterized by papillary dermal amyloid deposition, hyperkeratosis, an increase in melanin in the basal layer, and pigment incontinence.
D. Bullous amyloidosis is more often associated with primary cutaneous amyloidosis rather than primary systemic amyloidosis with multiorgan involvement – Incorrect. Bullous amyloid lesions have been described more commonly in association with primary systemic amyloidosis including myeloma-associated amyloidosis, though rare cares without systemic involvement have been described.
E. Congo red stain can highlight amyloid deposits around the sweat glands and within blood vessel walls in primary systemic amyloidosis – Correct. In primary systemic amyloidosis, amyloid deposits can be observed in the dermis, subcutis, around sweat glands, and within blood vessel walls. Amyloid can be detected with multiple modalities including Congo red, crystal violet, Thioflavin T with ultraviolet fluorescence, and antiserum amyloid P antibodies.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113vS5vE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infection — antibiotic selection recommends a first-generation cephalosporin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin for MSSA, or vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or ceftaroline where risk factors for MRSA are high (nasal colonization, prior MRSA infection, recent hospitalization, recent antibiotics) (strong, low). Agents active against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone in combination with metronidazole, are recommended for infections following operations on the axilla, gastrointestinal tract, perineum, or female genital tract (strong, low).

### Comprehensive management of pressure injury: a review [^112v76dZ]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pressure injuries (PIs) are a spectrum of localized tissue destruction that develops most often at a bony prominence. PIs are the result of a combination of extrinsic (eg, pressure, shear, friction, and moisture) and intrinsic (nutritional status, spasticity, decreased sensation, and vascular disease) factors. Given their complex etiology, management of PIs requires a multidisciplinary approach from a team of health care professionals. After addressing both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, local wound care is generally recommended for stages 1 to 2 PIs and surgical intervention for stages 3 to 4.

### Pelvic trauma: WSES classification and guidelines [^113g7qK3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management of pelvic trauma. The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

### Genital prolapse in a newborn following resection of sacrococcygeal teratoma [^113RStKf]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Neonatal genital prolapse usually occurs during the first few days of life and presents as a tumor mass protruding from the vulva. We present a 15-day-old female neonate who developed neonatal genital prolapse following the operation of sacral teratoma. We suggest that sacral teratoma operation may be a significant predisposing factor for genital prolapse in neonates and the neonatal vaginal prolapse may be one of the differential diagnoses of interlabial mass during the late neonatal period.

### Nonhealing abdominal ulcer after robotic sleeve gastrectomy [^112eFSnR]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following statements is true concerning PG?
A. A biopsy with a neutrophilic infiltrate confirms the diagnosis
B. The PARCELUS score was introduced to estimate mortality associated with PG
C. History suggestive of pathergy excludes other diagnoses
D. PG is diagnosed once an underlying disease is found
E. PG is often misdiagnosed and treatment is delayed

Answers:

A. A biopsy with a neutrophilic infiltrate confirms the diagnosis – Incorrect. Although histopathologic findings of sterile neutrophilic infiltrate, mixed inflammation, and/or lymphocytic vasculitis increase suspicion of PG, only the Delphi consensus of international experts considers it a required major diagnostic criterion.
B. The PARCELUS score was introduced to estimate mortality associated with PG – Incorrect. The PARCELSUS score is a diagnostic scoring system where PG is likely with > 10 points based on the following criteria: Major criteria (3 points each): progressing disease, reddish-violaceous wound border, assessment of differential diagnoses; Minor criteria (2 points each): irregular ulcer shape, extreme pain > 4/10 on the visual analog scale, localization at site of trauma, and amelioration by immunosuppressant drugs; Additional criteria (1 point each): undermined wound border, and systemic disease associated.
C. History suggestive of pathergy excludes other diagnoses – Incorrect. Pathergy is also described in other dermatological diseases; therefore, thorough medical history and physical exam accounting for details in clinical presentation are essential in PG diagnosis. Laboratory exams that exclude differential diagnoses should be performed.
D. PG is diagnosed once an underlying disease is found – Incorrect. Proposed diagnostic criteria agree that comorbidities associated with PG augment likelihood of diagnosis, however about 1 of 3 of PG is idiopathic. Nevertheless, laboratory exams for commonly associated systemic diseases are recommended because prompt treatment of the underlying pathology ameliorates cutaneous manifestations.
E. PG is often misdiagnosed and treatment is delayed – Correct. Approximately > 10% of PG is misdiagnosed and 23% of PG patients receive delayed treatment. This may be due to lack of consensus over diagnosis criteria and ill-defined atypical, chronic, and coinfected presentations.

### Factitious disorder as a differential diagnosis for recurrent skin graft failure [^114PDaZZ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

This case report presents the history of a 43-year-old man who sustained a relatively minor burn to his face but who subsequently suffered significant morbidity. Although the wound was grafted on a number of occasions, it failed to heal. Multiple investigations were carried out to determine the cause of recurrent wound breakdown. It had been suspected that the patient was interfering with the wound but this could not be proven initially. He was eventually diagnosed with factitious disorder and it was only when this was managed in the multi-disciplinary setting that his wound finally healed.

### Inflammatory skin diseases and wounds [^114GTNhc]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory wounds of the skin can be caused by many different diseases. Of particular importance here are the very heterogeneous groups of vasculitides and vasculopathies. These are usually interdisciplinary relevant diseases that require extensive diagnostics in specialized centres. Clinically, these inflammatory wounds present as very painful ulcers that develop from necrosis and are surrounded by erythematous livid borders. The healing process is often difficult and protracted. Moreover, it considerably impairs the quality of life of the affected patients. In addition to clinical evaluation, histopathological examination of biopsies taken as early as possible is particularly important in diagnosis. Numerous differential diagnoses must be ruled out. Therapeutically, in addition to the often necessary systemic therapies, which include immunosuppressants (immunomodulating drugs and/or rheologics), appropriate topical wound treatment, usually in combination with compression therapy, should always be considered. Whenever possible, the causative factors should be diagnosed early and avoided or treated.

### Grafix, a cryopreserved placental membrane, for the treatment of chronic / stalled wounds [^115xCyCx]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Stage IV sacral wound case

An 82-year-old male was transferred to the wound care clinic from a rehabilitation center where he had been admitted after sustaining a fall and developing pneumonia. The patient presented with a stage IV sacral wound of 3 months duration measuring 2.5×2.5×1.6 cm (Fig. 3A). Past medical history included Parkinson's disease and both urinary and bowel incontinence. A collagenase ointment was being applied at the time of admission to our clinic. Neither off-loading nor cushioning for the wound was previously prescribed.

Figure. 3.
(A) A 2.5×2.5×1.6 cm stage IV sacral wound persisting for 3 months in an 82-year-old male before treatment. (B) Wound was surgically debrided to a 2 cm depth. A negative pressure wound vacuum (VAC), off-loading cushion, and air alternating mattress were prescribed. (C) First Grafix applied after 12 weeks of VAC, which was discontinued at this time. (D) Three weeks after first Grafix application. (E) Complete wound closure was recorded after two Grafix applications over 5 weeks.

The patient was taken to the operating room where the wound was radically debrided to a depth of 2.0 cm (Fig. 3B). Cultures taken at this time were negative. Postoperatively, a negative pressure wound vacuum (VAC) (125 mm/Hg) was prescribed as well as an off-loading cushion and air alternating mattress.

After 12 weeks of VAC and proper off-loading, the wound showed a well granulating base that measured 0.8×0.8×0.3 cm (Fig. 3C). At this point, VAC was discontinued because the noise and its effect on patient mobility had a significant negative impact on the quality of life for the patient. Grafix was a convenient option for this patient, and we believed that Grafix would close this wound faster than VAC. The wound was primed to receive Grafix, and upon application, the patient was discharged to return home where proper off-loading and cushioning were continued.

### Bleeding and bruising: a diagnostic work-up… [^111rUeTD]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Specialized Laboratory Tests PLATELET FUNCTION ACTIVITY Traditionally, the test of choice for evaluation of platelet function was bleeding time; however, the use of bleeding time to predict surgical bleeding has been questioned 17, 18 and its use has been discouraged or eliminated at some institutions. 1, 19 The Platelet Function Analyzer -100 has been shown to be superior to bleeding time in detecting von Willebrand's disease. 20–22. The reported sensitivity of the PFA-100 for diagnosing von Willebrand's disease and other platelet function disorders is 88 to 90 percent with a specificity of 86 to 94 percent. The sensitivity of the mixing study to detect a lupus anticoagulant is 95 percent with a specificity of 60 percent. 29 In a study of 42 laboratories asked to analyze known samples, 30 97. 5 percent correctly identified the sample with a lupus anticoagulant and
90. 2 percent correctly reported the negative serum sample as negative. However, 53.

6 percent did not correctly identify the factor VIII inhibitor and many did poorly with contaminated specimens. Therefore, knowledge of a laboratory's limitations, especially when trying to identify an inhibitor that is not a lupus anticoagulant, is helpful when interpreting the results. Referral If the laboratory work-up does not diagnose a bleeding disorder, but there is still high suspicion based on personal and family history, the patient should be referred to a hematologist. If von Willebrand's disease, a factor VIII inhibitor, or factor deficiencies are discovered, referral is based on the diagnosis and severity, as well as the comfort level of the physician. If the history, physical examination, or the routine laboratory studies are abnormal in the preoperative assessment, surgery should be delayed until a cause can be determined with a work-up or by referral. RESOLUTION OF CASE STUDIES Case One. Laboratory testing included a normal blood count and platelet count.

A PFA-100 test was abnormal to collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate. Further testing was diagnostic for von Willebrand's disease. Case Two. A complete blood count, PT, PTT, and PFA-100 were normal. The patient was reassured that with a low bleeding score, a negative family history, and an unremarkable physical examination, she most likely has purpura simplex. She was told to follow up if her symptoms got worse or if she had any new symptoms.

### Recognizing spinal cord emergencies… [^116B4AvK]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Physical Examination The physician should examine the entire spine for areas of redness, scars, blisters, lipomata, hairy patches, birthmarks and café-aulait spots. The spine should also be palpated for bony abnormalities, deviation from the midline and tenderness. Range of motion, including flexion, extension, lateral rotation and lateral bending, should be assessed. Diagnostic Tests LABORATORY TESTS The laboratory evaluation may include a complete blood cell count with differential, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a urinalysis. The findings of the clinical evaluation may indicate the need for other specific tests, such as a serum calcium level, a uric acid level, electrophoresis of serum and urine for light chains, and a prostate-specific antigen level. Laboratory tests are particularly useful when infection or malignancy is considered to be a possible cause of the spinal pathology.

Computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, myelography and combined CT and myelography can clearly define anatomy. However, these studies are costly and have a high false-positive rate. 8 Because MRI is noninvasive, does not involve radiation, covers a large area of the spine and can show changes within the disc and vertebral body, it has become the imaging modality of choice in the diagnosis of radiculopathy, spinal cord abscesses, spinal cord tumors, spinal stenosis and nontraumatic vascular lesions. 8–12 Using the magnetic resonance images in the fast sequence results in a myelography-like appearance that allows rapid screening of the spinal canal with high sensitivity for epidural masses. 9 Chelated gadolinium further enhances MRI studies. Compared with MRI studies, CT scans provide better imaging of bony structures. Hence, CT scanning is considered the imaging modality of choice to evaluate patients for spinal trauma and vertebral fractures.

Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine must always be followed by anteroposterior and open-mouth projections. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the thoracic or lumbar regions are indicated in patients with localized tenderness or a suspicious mechanism of injury. Because there is a 10 to 15 percent incidence of spinal fractures at more than one site, consideration must always be given to radiographic examination of the entire spine when one fracture is identified.
