## Question

what is the treatment of rotator cuff tendonitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of rotator cuff tendonitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the condition and diagnostic framing. Then, I should establish first-line management and exercise principles. Next, I will review pharmacologic options and their timing. After that, I need to examine injection therapies, including corticosteroids, PRP, and hyaluronic acid. Then, I will consider adjunctive modalities like manual therapy, taping, and electrotherapy. I should also address calcific tendinopathy-specific interventions. Finally, I will outline referral thresholds, return-to-function planning, and a practical algorithm, while continuously checking the strength and certainty of evidence and correcting any misinterpretations along the way.

> Let me first confirm the condition and diagnostic framing so I don't anchor on outdated terminology. Wait, let me verify the preferred nomenclature: contemporary guidelines favor "rotator cuff–related shoulder pain" or "rotator cuff tendinopathy" over "impingement syndrome" or "tendinitis", reflecting that symptoms are multifactorial and not solely due to a single structural lesion, and that imaging is not routinely indicated initially unless symptoms persist beyond about 12 weeks of appropriate care [^116gazYw] [^114zHMg3].

> Next, I should review first-line management. Hold on, I should verify that active rehabilitation is truly foundational. Multiple high-quality guidelines converge on prescribing an active, progressive exercise program as initial treatment to reduce pain and disability, emphasizing load management, motor control, and progressive resistance rather than passive modalities, with supervision potentially enhancing outcomes in the short term, although supervised and unsupervised programs often converge by 12 months [^113u3Ng2] [^113jq1nf] [^116jsitw] [^116wEz8W] [^112CgCdT].

> I will now examine exercise specifics and dosing, but wait, I need to check whether any particular exercise type is clearly superior. Evidence does not show consistent superiority of eccentric over other strengthening approaches, and high-load programs are not clearly better than low-load programs across time points; progressive, resisted, and sometimes pain-permitted loading tends to outperform nonprogressive or nonresisted programs, and scapula-focused programs may yield medium-term benefits even if short-term effects are modest, so I should avoid over-specifying exercise type and instead tailor load progression to symptom provocation and function [^115NATuD] [^113uqXfj] [^114Ewb7c] [^113jZhGe].

> Let me consider pharmacologic pain control, and I should double-check the hierarchy. Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are reasonable short-term options for analgesia, while opioids should be reserved for severe, refractory pain with close monitoring due to dependence risk; importantly, I must not overstate NSAIDs as disease-modifying — they provide symptom relief but do not alter tendon pathology, so they should be adjuncts to active rehabilitation rather than substitutes [^11496BFV] [^116Xgmyk].

> Now, injection therapies — this is where I need to be careful about timing and expectations. Corticosteroid injections can reduce pain and disability in the short term, typically up to 6–8 weeks, but do not confer medium- or long-term benefit and should not be first-line; if used, ultrasound guidance may improve accuracy and short-term pain reduction, though clinical importance can be small, and repeated injections should be avoided given potential harm and lack of cumulative benefit [^117748mQ] [^1165CcBN] [^114cM7gX] [^115Z46Ay] [^1166jjD1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought PRP might be broadly first-line based on some reports of superiority over corticosteroids; hold on, I should verify the certainty and context. The evidence for PRP is mixed and generally low to very low quality, with some trials and consensus statements suggesting potential superiority to corticosteroids in certain contexts, but guideline syntheses indicate no consistent medium-term advantage over placebo and often favor exercise over PRP for pain and disability; thus, PRP may be considered in select refractory cases, ideally with higher-concentration preparations, but it should not be first-line [^116GGrMp] [^113FWaxv] [^1147FPAk] [^114VoknL].

> I should also review hyaluronic acid briefly. The signal is inconsistent, with some analyses suggesting short- to medium-term improvements and others showing no significant benefit versus placebo; given cost and uncertainty, hyaluronic acid may be considered only in refractory cases after other conservative measures, not as first-line [^113YBYp4] [^1146prAc].

> Next, I should review adjunctive nonpharmacologic modalities, and I need to ensure I don't overstate their roles. Manual therapy can provide short-term pain relief, especially when combined with exercise, but effects on function are less certain; taping may offer short-term pain reduction as an adjunct; electrotherapy modalities like therapeutic ultrasound or low-level laser may have small, short-term benefits in some trials, but high-quality evidence is limited and they should not replace exercise-centered care [^1122am2M] [^112hTfmR] [^115s1pFh] [^112BUCc5] [^111t7uvg].

> But wait, what if the presentation is calcific tendinopathy rather than non-calcific tendinopathy? I should confirm that management diverges here. For calcific disease, first-line remains conservative care, but if symptoms persist, ultrasound-guided lavage (barbotage) with corticosteroid appears more effective than shockwave therapy for pain and function in the short to long term, and high-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy outperforms low-energy for pain, function, and deposit resorption; PRP as an adjunct to needling has shown mixed results with early inferiority but later comparable outcomes and fewer retreatments, so shared decision-making is key [^1113koPx] [^114e6RKm] [^113EEYbm] [^117GFEii] [^116jg9b3] [^111UrJek].

> I need to ensure I set appropriate referral thresholds and imaging strategy. If there is severe or persistent pain and/or disability despite up to 12 weeks of appropriate nonoperative care, referral to a musculoskeletal specialist is advised; early MRI is not recommended, and if imaging is needed, diagnostic ultrasound is preferred for rotator cuff disorders due to similar diagnostic performance at lower cost, with MRI reserved for persistent or complex cases or when surgical planning is anticipated [^116L7nja] [^114zHMg3].

> Let me think about return-to-function and sport planning, and I should verify that capacity and load tolerance guide progression. Clinicians should assess rotator cuff and scapular muscle capacity, kinetic chain contributions, and symptom provocation to individualize loading, using validated patient-reported outcomes to track progress and guide stepwise return to work or sport, recognizing that supervised programs may accelerate early gains even if long-term outcomes converge [^112mvZQv] [^112CgCdT].

> I should double-check the stance on subacromial decompression for pure tendinopathy without a full-thickness tear. High-quality long-term randomized data show no added benefit of arthroscopic acromioplasty over supervised exercise alone for rotator cuff tendinopathy, so surgery should not be offered as initial treatment for this diagnosis, reserving operative care for refractory cases with identifiable surgical lesions or failed comprehensive conservative management [^116w4PQj] [^116ARMEa].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. Start with education on the condition, load management, and a progressive, resisted exercise program emphasizing scapular and rotator cuff strengthening with supervision when feasible; use acetaminophen or NSAIDs short term as needed; avoid early imaging; if pain remains limiting after 6–8 weeks, consider a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection as a bridge while maintaining rehabilitation; if calcific disease is present and symptoms persist, discuss barbotage or high-energy shockwave; if symptoms remain severe beyond 12 weeks despite appropriate care, refer for specialist evaluation and advanced imaging; throughout, reassess function with validated tools and adjust loading to maintain progressive tendon loading without symptom flares [^115URABz] [^117748mQ] [^114zHMg3] [^116L7nja].

The cornerstone of rotator cuff tendinitis care is **active rehabilitation** [^113u3Ng2] with progressive, load-based exercises [^114Ewb7c] to restore strength, mobility, and function. NSAIDs and acetaminophen provide short-term pain relief [^11496BFV]; corticosteroid injections offer transient benefit [^117748mQ] and should not be first-line [^117748mQ]. Manual therapy and taping can reduce short-term pain [^1122am2M] [^115s1pFh]; electrotherapy has limited benefit [^112BUCc5]. Most patients improve with 3–6 months of conservative care [^notfound]; persistent symptoms warrant imaging [^114zHMg3] and specialist referral [^116L7nja]. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases or full-thickness tears [^116ARMEa].

## Conservative management

### Exercise therapy

- **Active rehabilitation**: Progressive, load-based exercises are first-line to reduce pain and disability [^113u3Ng2] [^113jq1nf].
- **Supervised vs unsupervised**: Supervised programs may yield greater short-term gains, but both improve outcomes [^112CgCdT].
- **Specific vs general**: Specific programs may outperform general ones, but evidence is limited [^1145bYPB] [^112dJBxq].
- **Isometric exercise**: Offers short-term pain relief and is useful early [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

NSAIDs and acetaminophen provide **short-term pain relief** [^11496BFV] [^116ARMEa]. Corticosteroid injections offer **short-term pain reduction** [^117748mQ] but no long-term benefit [^114cM7gX]; avoid as first-line [^117748mQ].

---

### Physical therapy modalities

Manual therapy provides **short-term pain relief** [^1122am2M] [^112hTfmR], and taping reduces short-term pain when added to exercise [^115s1pFh]. Electrotherapy (ultrasound, laser, TENS) offers **limited benefit** [^112BUCc5].

---

## Advanced interventions

### Injection therapies

- **Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)**: Mixed evidence; not first-line [^113FWaxv] [^114VoknL].
- **Hyaluronic acid**: Limited benefit; not first-line [^113YBYp4] [^1146prAc].
- **Stem cell therapy**: Insufficient evidence [^1134oPtb] [^1179dFcC].

---

### Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** or full-thickness tears; arthroscopic decompression is not first-line for tendinitis alone [^116ARMEa] [^116w4PQj].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Education on condition, load management, and activity modification is essential [^115URABz], and **home exercise programs** support adherence and outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Most improve with 3–6 months of conservative care; recurrence is common without ongoing exercise [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Exercise therapy | First-line | High |
| NSAIDs/acetaminophen | Short-term use | Moderate |
| Corticosteroid injections | Short-term use; not first-line | Moderate |
| Manual therapy | Short-term adjunct | Moderate |
| PRP/hyaluronic acid | Not first-line | Low |
| Surgery | Refractory cases | High |

---

Exercise-based rehabilitation is the **foundation of care** [^113u3Ng2]; adjuncts like NSAIDs, injections, and manual therapy provide short-term relief, while surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^116ARMEa].

### Cell therapy in tendon disorders: what is the current evidence? [^113wjt9S]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Various types of tissue-derived cells are being experimented with for the treatment of tendinopathy, tendon repair, and use in tissue engineering.

Purpose

The aim of this systematic review is to explore the current evidence with a view to evaluate the potential of this therapeutic intervention.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed. Search criteria included keywords "tendinopathy", "tendinitis", "tendinosis", "epicondylitis", "stem cell", and "cell therapy". Articles not written in English language were excluded.

Results

A total number of 379 articles were identified and a critical appraisal of the relevant articles was undertaken, which encompassed human and animal research. The review included articles related to various tissue-derived cells such as tendon progenitors, adipose tissue, synovium, muscle, bone marrow, and skin. The utility of cell therapy in tissue engineering and rotator cuff repair was also assessed.

Conclusion

With the limitation of the available evidence, the literature suggests that cell therapy is applicable and may be effective for the treatment of tendinopathy. However, further research into the precise biological mechanisms, long-term implications, and cost-effectiveness is needed.

### What's in a name? The case for using "Rotator cuff-related shoulder pain" in clinical practice [^116gazYw]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: In the absence of diagnostic accuracy (clinical and imaging), specific shoulder structures cannot be implicated as the definitive source of shoulder symptoms. Patients report that the (1) worst pain is unexplained pain, and (2) to engage in a treatment, the treatment must make sense. The diagnostic label, nonspecific shoulder pain does not tick either box: subacromial pain syndrome is confusing, and as nondescript as suprahumeral pain syndrome. The rotator cuff tendons are not the definitive and sole source of shoulder symptoms, which calls into question the validity of terms such as tendinopathy, tendinosis, and tendinitis. The term rotator cuff-related shoulder pain was the overwhelming first choice in a recent global survey of clinicians, and here, we make the case for its clinical use.

### Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff: management options [^112zdczF]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff tendons is a common cause of shoulder pain in adults and typically presents as activity-related shoulder pain. It is thought to be an active, cell-mediated process, although the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. Nonsurgical management continues to be the mainstay of treatment; most patients improve with modalities such as oral anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections. Several options are available for patients who fail nonsurgical treatment, including extracorporeal shock wave therapy, ultrasound-guided needle lavage, and surgical débridement. These modalities alleviate pain by eliminating the calcific deposit, and several recent studies have demonstrated success with the use of these treatment options. Surgical management options include arthroscopic procedures to remove calcific deposits and subacromial decompression; however, the role of subacromial decompression and repair of rotator cuff defects created by removing these deposits remains controversial.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113vFQ1B]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Objective

To quantify and describe effect size distributions from exercise therapies across a range of tendinopathies and outcome domains to inform future research and clinical practice through conducting a systematic review with meta-analysis.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis exploring moderating effects and context-specific small, medium and large thresholds.

Eligibility criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving any persons with a diagnosis of rotator cuff, lateral elbow, patellar, Achilles or gluteal tendinopathy of any severity or duration.

Methods

Common databases, six trial registries and six grey literature databases were searched on 18 January 2021 (PROSPERO: CRD42020168187). Standardised mean difference (SMD pre) effect sizes were used with Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis models to calculate the 0.25 (small), 0.5 (medium) and 0.75 quantiles (large) and compare pooled means across potential moderators. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool.

Results

Data were obtained from 114 studies comprising 171 treatment arms 4104 participants. SMD pre effect sizes were similar across tendinopathies but varied across outcome domains. Greater threshold values were obtained for self-reported measures of pain (small = 0.5, medium = 0.9 and large = 1.4), disability (small = 0.6, medium = 1.0 and large = 1.5) and function (small = 0.6, medium = 1.1 and large = 1.8) and lower threshold values obtained for quality of life (small = −0.2, medium = 0.3 and large = 0.7) and objective measures of physical function (small = 0.2, medium = 0.4 and large = 0.7). Potential moderating effects of assessment duration, exercise supervision and symptom duration were also identified, with greater pooled mean effect sizes estimated for longer assessment durations, supervised therapies and studies comprising patients with shorter symptom durations.

Conclusion

The effect size of exercise on tendinopathy is dependent on the type of outcome measure assessed. Threshold values presented here can be used to guide interpretation and assist with further research better establishing minimal important change.

Rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — overall controlled comparisons at unspecified follow-up show small-to-moderate standardized effects. A 2021 CPG reported that, based on low- to very-low certainty evidence (GRADE), corticosteroid injections significantly reduce pain (SMD, –0.65; 95% CI: –1.04, –0.26; 6 RCTs; n = 372) and disability (SMD, –0.56; 95% CI: –1.06, –0.05; 5 RCTs; n = 362) when compared to a control (sham or placebo control) in adults with RC tendinopathy at an unspecified follow-up time.

### Injection therapies for rotator cuff disease [^1179dFcC]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff disease affects a large proportion of the overall population and encompasses a wide spectrum of pathologies, including subacromial impingement, rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear, and calcific tendinitis. Various injection therapies have been used for the treatment of rotator cuff disease, including corticosteroid, prolotherapy, platelet-rich plasma, stem cells, and ultrasound-guided barbotage for calcific tendinitis. However, the existing evidence for these therapies remains controversial or sparse. Ultimately, improved understanding of the underlying structural and compositional deficiencies of the injured rotator cuff tissue is needed to identify the biological needs that can potentially be targeted with injection therapies.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115L97t6]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This meta-analysis is part of a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research; Health Technology Assessment 129 388 Exercise therapy for the treatment of tendinopathies. The inclusion criteria were influenced by the project aims, the results of our initial scoping review mapping the exercise and tendinopathy literature, as well as stakeholder workshops. The overall structure of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to address effectiveness were registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020168187) and individual full protocols made publicly available prior to any analyses. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 statement with checklist provided in online supplemental file 1.

Protocol deviations

Multiple protocol deviations occurred due to pragmatic considerations and reflecting on processes from previous work packages in the larger project. Originally, it was intended to extract data not in duplicate but to quantify reliability based on a random 10% sample. Given the large number of reviewers extracting data it was decided to perform extraction in duplicate with agreement following differences when required. Originally, it was intended to conduct risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental studies. As outlined in the following sections, due to pragmatic considerations Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool was used for both randomised and non-randomised designs.

Stakeholder involvement

People with lived experience of exercise for tendinopathy were involved in all stages of the review, from inception to dissemination activities, and were recruited via National Health Service (NHS) public involvement networks and social media. Two people who had received exercise for Achilles tendinopathy and rotator cuff related shoulder pain (RCRSP) in NHS and private settings contributed to the design stage by influencing the review questions. One of these people (female, RCRSP) went on to contribute to the oversight committee throughout the review and assisted with reviewing dissemination materials. We also held a stakeholder workshop to inform the direction of the review; four females with lived experience of RCRSP or patellar tendinopathy, including one high performance athlete, took part. We had anticipated greater public involvement; timing of activities (during COVID-19 lockdown) and conducting them solely online may be contributing factors. Nonetheless, contributions were helpful in informing the review.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^116oVLdD]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy clinical practice guideline — scope and definitions: The guideline targets adults with shoulder pain with suspected rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy and provides recommendations covering the assessment and prognosis, nonsurgical medical care and rehabilitation, and return to function and sport for elite and recreational athletes; it also addresses cases with RC tendinopathy with or without calcifications and partial-thickness RC tears. Background notes that RC disorders account for more than half of shoulder conditions, the RC comprises the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor, and the term RC calcific tendinopathy is used when a calcific deposit within the tendon is confirmed. The document highlights gaps in usual care, stating that initial diagnosis and treatment of RC disorders often do not follow evidence-based recommendations and that diagnoses of shoulder disorders commonly rely on the unnecessary use of diagnostic imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), driving additional costs, treatment delays, and potential overmedicalization.

Rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy is characterised by the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in one of the rotator cuff tendons and can be managed by ultrasound-guided lavage. However, evidence regarding the efficacy of ultrasound-guided lavage for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy remains inconclusive. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to update the available evidence on the efficacy of ultrasound-guided lavage in adults with rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy.

Methods

A literature search was conducted up to April 2018 in four bibliographic databases to identify randomised control trials that compared ultrasound-guided lavage alone with other interventions to treat rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy. Randomised control trials were assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Meta-analyses and/or qualitative synthesis of the evidence were performed.

Results

Three randomised control trials were included. Pooled results for pain (n = 226) indicated that ultrasound-guided lavage may significantly decrease pain when compared with shockwave therapy, with a mean difference of −1.98 out of 10 points (95% CI −2.52 to −1.45) in the short term and of −1.84 (95% CI −2.63 to −1.04) in the long term. Based on one trial (n = 25), ultrasound-guided lavage significantly improved function when compared with shockwave therapy (p < 0.05). Based on another trial (n = 48), the addition of ultrasound-guided lavage to a corticosteroid injection significantly improves function in the long term (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

For individuals with rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy, low-quality evidence suggests that ultrasound-guided lavage is more effective than shockwave therapy or a corticosteroid injection alone. Future trials could modify the present conclusions.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nta4u]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal condition associated with degenerative changes and characterised by a combination of pain impaired movement and reduced function that typically requires extended periods for recovery. Tendinopathy can affect any muscle-tendon unit in the body, however, it is most frequently reported in the Achilles, patellar, lateral elbow, rotator cuff and hip tendons. Surveys of prevalence of lower extremity tendinopathy in the general population have reported rates of 11.8 and 10.5 per 1000 person-years, while prevalence for upper limb tendinopathies have been estimated between 1.3% and 21.0%. Costs to the individual, the health service and economy (due to absenteeism and loss of productivity) are substantial such that identifying effective interventions is a priority.

Exercise therapy is the mainstay of conservative management of tendinopathy and has focused largely on resistance training, and in many instances eccentric strengthening techniques. The rationale of exercise therapy is to improve load tolerance and possibly structural adaptation of the musculotendinous unit to restore function. In the early phase of rehabilitation, flexibility exercises are often initiated and incorporated into strengthening regimes to facilitate improvements in mobility. Effective exercise therapy may also require targeting a range of contributing factors, which not only include muscle weakness and decreased flexibility, but also corticospinal and neuromuscular adaptations resulting from persistent pain. As such, proprioceptive exercise interventions have been used to retrain normal patterns of muscle recruitment in the rehabilitation of shoulder-related tendinopathies including impingement. The time course of tendinopathy recovery is usually slow, the degree of recovery may be incomplete and there may be differences between tendinopathies and across outcome domains. For example, quality of life may improve less quickly for people with rotator cuff tendinopathy compared with those with Achilles tendinopathy, whereas recovery may be faster for pain and the relative magnitudes of these improvements may not be equivalent. Quantifying any tendinopathy or domain-specific differences in expected improvements would help guide efforts to develop consensus concerning optimal management by enabling better intervention comparisons.

### Is ultrasound-guided lavage an effective intervention for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy? A systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115cnDNe]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of this review include the use of four important databases, a thorough search strategy and the use of the validated Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. However, this review also has limitations. The small sample size and the high risk of bias of two of the three articles are two important limitations of this review which limits the strength of our conclusions. Our meta-analysis only includes two RCTs, with the analysis heavily based on one RCT. The absence of comparison with a conservative treatment involving physical therapy with an exercise programme is another limitation of this systematic review.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CgCdT]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Despite almost all exercise therapies being of short duration (≤ 12 weeks), a substantial proportion of outcomes were measured beyond the intervention at a medium duration (13–52 weeks), and a relatively small number of instances of longer-term follow-up (> 52 weeks). Moderator analysis demonstrated an ordered effect with the smallest mean pooled effect size obtained for short durations (1.0 (95% CrI: 0.87 to 1.1)), and evidence of greater pooled means for medium (1.3 (95% CrI: 1.1 to 1.4); p > 0.999) and long durations (1.4 (95% CrI: 1.2 to 1.6) p > 0.999). While the absolute magnitude of the differences were relatively small (~0.2 to 0.4 increase) and there were only two studies that included long term observations, the finding are in keeping with previous research, and provide support for longer duration interventions as well as follow-up periods in studies. Moderator analyses also provided evidence of a greater mean pooled effect with supervised compared with unsupervised exercise therapies (β Unupervised:Supervised0.5 = 0.70 (95% CrI: 0.39 to 1.0), p = 0.797). Previous systematic reviews specifically investigating supervised versus unsupervised exercise therapy for the rotator cuff have suggested that both approaches are likely to lead to similar improvements. While previous reviews employed greater control and focused on more homogeneous comparisons and considerably smaller number of outcomes, the findings in the present analysis and the consistency of results after controlling for tendinopathy location and outcome, demonstrate that in general supervised exercise therapies are likely to provide clinically meaningful improvements beyond unsupervised exercise therapies. Finally, limited evidence was obtained to indicate that greater improvements may be obtained with patients reporting shorter symptom durations. However, differences in pooled mean estimates were close to zero after controlling for tendinopathy location and outcome domains, indicating the need for further research, and highlighting limitations of large modelling studies such as those included here, where systematic differences in a range of potential moderating factors can bias results and generate spurious associations.

### A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of various shoulder disorders [^111gH1tX]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) covering the management of common shoulder disorders.

Data Sources

A systematic search of CPGs on specific shoulder disorders was conducted up to August 2022 in relevant databases.

Study Selection

Twenty-six CPGs on rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy, RC tear, calcific tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis, glenohumeral (GH) instability, GH osteoarthritis, or acromioclavicular disorders published from January 2008 onward were screened and included.

Data Extraction

CPGs methodological quality was assessed with the AGREE II checklist. All recommendations from CPGs were extracted and categorized by shoulder disorder and care components (evaluation, diagnostic imaging, medical, rehabilitation, and surgical treatments). After semantic analysis of the terminology, recommendations for each shoulder disorders were classified by 2 reviewers into "recommended", "may be recommended", or "not recommended". Disagreements were resolved by discussion until reviewers reached consensus.

Data Synthesis

Only 12 CPGs (46%) were of high quality with major limitations related to the applicability and editorial independence of the guidelines. The initial evaluation of shoulder pain should include patient's history, subjective evaluation focused on red flags, and clinical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging is usually not recommended to manage early shoulder pain, and recommendations for X-rays are conflicting. Acetaminophen, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and rehabilitation including exercises were recommended or may be recommended to treat all shoulder pain disorders. Guidelines on surgical management recommendations differed; for example, 6 CPGs reported that acromioplasty was recommended or may be recommended in chronic RC tendinopathy, whereas 4 CPGs did not recommend it.

Conclusions

Recommendations vary for diagnostic imaging, conservative vs surgical treatment to manage shoulder pain, although several care components are consensual. The development of evidence-based, rigorous CPGs with a valid methodology and transparent reporting is warranted to improve overall shoulder pain care.

### How does surgery compare to sham surgery or physiotherapy as a treatment for tendinopathy? A systematic review of randomised trials [^114kPPvw]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the ' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses'(PRISMA) guidelines (figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram of included studies. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design and compared surgery to any mode of non-surgical management for any type of tendinopathy in terms of at least one of the following outcomes: 'pain', 'function', 'ROM', 'force/strength', 'patient satisfaction', 'treatment success', 'QoL', 'complications'. Non-randomised observational studies, case reports, case series and literature reviews were excluded. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy with or without radiological signs. Studies including patients with full tendon tears were excluded. Duration of symptoms/signs was not a criterion, neither was length of conservative treatment and follow-up. Language criterion was not applied.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (DC and CC) independently via Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL in March 2018, with the following Boolean operators: '(tendinopathy OR tendinosis OR tendinitis OR tendonitis OR tennis elbow OR jumper's knee OR lateral elbow tendinopathy OR lateral epicondylitis OR rotator cuff disease OR shoulder impingement OR patellar OR Achilles) AND (surgery OR surgical management OR surgical treatment OR tenotomy OR open surgery OR arthroscopic surgery) AND (conservative management OR conservative treatment OR physiotherapy OR eccentric exercises OR eccentric strengthening OR stretching OR shock-wave therapy OR ESWT OR extracorporeal shock wave therapy OR ultrasound OR iontophoresis OR laser OR LLLT OR polidocanol OR sclerotherapy OR botox OR botulinum toxin OR GTN OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin OR corticosteroid injections OR platelet rich plasma OR PRP OR autologous blood OR sham surgery)'.

Medical Subject Heading terms were not used to minimise the risk of missing relevant articles. Review articles were used to identify eligible articles that were missed at the initial search. Additionally, reference list screening and citation tracking in Google Scholar were performed for each relevant article.

### Corticosteroid injections give small and transient pain relief in rotator cuff tendinosis: a meta-analysis [^1166jjD1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The ability of injection of corticosteroids into the subacromial space to relieve pain ascribed to rotator cuff tendinosis is debated. The number of patients who have an injection before one gets relief beyond what a placebo provides is uncertain.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) Do corticosteroid injections reduce pain in patients with rotator cuff tendinosis 3 months after injection, and if so, what is the number needed to treat (NNT)? (2) Are multiple injections better than one single injection with respect to pain reduction at 3 months?

Methods

We systematically searched seven electronic databases for randomized controlled trials of corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff tendinosis compared with a placebo injection. Eligible studies had at least 10 adults and used pain intensity as an outcome measure. The Hedges's g as adjusted pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) (which expresses the size of the intervention effect in each study relative to the total variability observed among pooled studies) and NNT were calculated at assessment points less than 1 month, 1–2 months, and 2–3 months. The protocol of this study was registered at the international prospective register of systematic reviews. Eleven studies of 726 patients satisfied our criteria for data pooling. Three studies containing 292 patients used repeat injections. A random effects model was used owing to substantial heterogeneity among studies. The funnel plot indicated the possibility of some missing studies, but Orwin's fail-safe N and Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill suggested that missing studies would not significantly affect the results.

Results

Corticosteroid injection did not reduce pain intensity in adult patients with rotator cuff tendinosis more than a placebo injection at the 3-month assessment. A small transient pain relief occurred at the assessment between 4 and 8 weeks with a SMD of 0.52 (range, 0.27–0.78) (p < 0.001). At least five patients must be treated for one patient's pain to be transiently reduced to no more than mild. Multiple injections were not found to be more effective than a single injection at any time.

Conclusions

Corticosteroid injections provide-at best-minimal transient pain relief in a small number of patients with rotator cuff tendinosis and cannot modify the natural course of the disease. Given the discomfort, cost, and potential to accelerate tendon degeneration associated with corticosteroids, they have limited appeal. Their wide use may be attributable to habit, underappreciation of the placebo effect, incentive to satisfy rather than discuss a patient's drive toward physical intervention, or for remuneration, rather than their utility.

Rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — exercise efficacy versus minimal/sham or no treatment: Based on low-quality to very low-certainty evidence, progressive painful and resisted exercises significantly reduce pain (MD, −1.07/10; 95% CI: −1.57, −0.56; 3 RCTs; n = 197) and disability on the Constant-Murley Score (MD, −14.96/100; 95% CI: −21.37, −8.55; 4 RCTs; n = 271) compared with basic advice, placebo detuned laser, or no treatment in the short to medium term, whereas nonprogressive resistance and nonresisted exercises do not significantly reduce pain (MD, −0.33/10; 95% CI: −0.81, 0.15; 3 RCTs; n = 198) or disability (MD, −3.62/100; 95% CI: −9.43, 2.18; 3 RCTs; n = 198). Supervised exercise versus no exercise in the short term significantly reduces pain at rest (MD, −1.68/10; 95% CI: −3.00, −0.34; 1 RCT; n = 286), during movement (MD, −1.84/10; 95% CI: −2.76, −0.91; 5 RCTs; n = 353), and disability (SMD, −0.30; 95% CI: −0.52, −0.07; 5 RCTs; n = 396). Across studies at an unspecified follow-up, exercise reduced pain (SMD, −0.94; 95% CI: −1.69, −0.19; 5 RCTs; n = 189) and disability (SMD, −0.57; 95% CI: −0.85, −0.29; 4 RCTs; n = 202) versus no treatment. A network meta-analysis pairwise comparison showed exercise reduced pain compared with no intervention (SMD, −0.42; 95% CI: −0.68, −0.15) and compared with corticosteroid injections (SMD, −0.25; 95% CI: −0.48, −0.03), and reduced disability versus no intervention in the short to medium term (SMD, −0.69; 95% CI: −0.99, −0.39) and in the medium term (SMD, −0.32; 95% CI: −0.58, −0.06). The same analysis reported shoulder taping significantly reduces disability versus exercise in the long term (SMD, −0.35; 95% CI: −0.82, −0.15), though the number and quality of RCTs were not reported and effects were based on unknown certainty of the evidence.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy — methodological quality appraisal and recommendation development — used paired evaluators who "performed a critical appraisal using the AMSTAR II (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews, version 2) for systematic reviews, the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or the Scoping Review Checklist for scoping reviews, and assigned a level of evidence to each article", with disagreements resolved because "If the 2 evaluators did not agree on the critical appraisal or on the level of evidence for a particular article, a third evaluator was consulted to resolve disagreement". Recommendation drafting "followed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) collaboration's standards, adapted to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) frameworks", and "Each recommendation was based on a synthesis of the evidence addressing a clinical question within the scope of the CPG". Preliminary recommendations considered "the quality of the evidence, the trade-off between benefits and harms, the cost effectiveness, and the acceptability and feasibility of the proposed recommendations", were drafted by "A working group", approved by "all members of the working committee", and refined until "consensus was achieved". The grading approach states, "The overall certainty of the evidence was graded according to guidelines described by Guyatt et al and modified by MacDermid et al", and "The typical A, B, C, and D grade of the evidence have been modified to include the role of consensus expert opinion (TABLE 4)".

### Electrotherapy modalities for rotator cuff disease [^112BUCc5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Management of rotator cuff disease may include use of electrotherapy modalities (also known as electrophysical agents), which aim to reduce pain and improve function via an increase in energy (electrical, sound, light, or thermal) into the body. Examples include therapeutic ultrasound, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF). These modalities are usually delivered as components of a physical therapy intervention. This review is one of a series of reviews that form an update of the Cochrane review, 'Physiotherapy interventions for shoulder pain'.

Objectives

To synthesise available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of electrotherapy modalities for the treatment of people with rotator cuff disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2015), Ovid EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015), CINAHL Plus (EBSCOhost, January 1937 to March 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP clinical trials registries up to March 2015, unrestricted by language, and reviewed the reference lists of review articles and retrieved trials, to identify potentially relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials, including adults with rotator cuff disease (e.g. subacromial impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinitis, calcific tendinitis), and comparing any electrotherapy modality with placebo, no intervention, a different electrotherapy modality or any other intervention (e.g. glucocorticoid injection). Trials investigating whether electrotherapy modalities were more effective than placebo or no treatment, or were an effective addition to another physical therapy intervention (e.g. manual therapy or exercise) were the main comparisons of interest. Main outcomes of interest were overall pain, function, pain on motion, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, quality of life and the number of participants experiencing adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 47 trials (2388 participants). Most trials (n = 43) included participants with rotator cuff disease without calcification (four trials included people with calcific tendinitis). Sixteen (34%) trials investigated the effect of an electrotherapy modality delivered in isolation. Only 23% were rated at low risk of allocation bias, and 49% were rated at low risk of both performance and detection bias (for self-reported outcomes). The trials were heterogeneous in terms of population, intervention and comparator, so none of the data could be combined in a meta-analysis. In one trial (61 participants; low quality evidence), pulsed therapeutic ultrasound (three to five times a week for six weeks) was compared with placebo (inactive ultrasound therapy) for calcific tendinitis. At six weeks, the mean reduction in overall pain with placebo was -6.3 points on a 52-point scale, and -14.9 points with ultrasound (MD -8.60 points, 95% CI -13.48 to -3.72 points; absolute risk difference 17%, 7% to 26% more). Mean improvement in function with placebo was 3.7 points on a 100-point scale, and 17.8 points with ultrasound (mean difference (MD) 14.10 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.39 to 22.81 points; absolute risk difference 14%, 5% to 23% more). Ninety-one per cent (29/32) of participants reported treatment success with ultrasound compared with 52% (15/29) of participants receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.53; absolute risk difference 39%, 18% to 60% more). Mean improvement in quality of life with placebo was 0.40 points on a 10-point scale, and 2.60 points with ultrasound (MD 2.20 points, 95% CI 0.91 points to 3.49 points; absolute risk difference 22%, 9% to 35% more). Between-group differences were not important at nine months. No participant reported adverse events. Therapeutic ultrasound produced no clinically important additional benefits when combined with other physical therapy interventions (eight clinically heterogeneous trials, low quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there are differences in patient-important outcomes between ultrasound and other active interventions (manual therapy, acupuncture, glucocorticoid injection, glucocorticoid injection plus oral tolmetin sodium, or exercise) because the quality of evidence is very low. Two placebo-controlled trials reported results favouring LLLT up to three weeks (low quality evidence), however combining LLLT with other physical therapy interventions produced few additional benefits (10 clinically heterogeneous trials, low quality evidence). We are uncertain whether transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is more or less effective than glucocorticoid injection with respect to pain, function, global treatment success and active range of motion because of the very low quality evidence from a single trial. In other single, small trials, no clinically important benefits of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMF), microcurrent electrical stimulation (MENS), acetic acid iontophoresis and microwave diathermy were observed (low or very low quality evidence). No adverse events of therapeutic ultrasound, LLLT, TENS or microwave diathermy were reported by any participants. Adverse events were not measured in any trials investigating the effects of PEMF, MENS or acetic acid iontophoresis.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low quality evidence, therapeutic ultrasound may have short-term benefits over placebo in people with calcific tendinitis, and LLLT may have short-term benefits over placebo in people with rotator cuff disease. Further high quality placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm these results. In contrast, based on low quality evidence, PEMF may not provide clinically relevant benefits over placebo, and therapeutic ultrasound, LLLT and PEMF may not provide additional benefits when combined with other physical therapy interventions. We are uncertain whether TENS is superior to placebo, and whether any electrotherapy modality provides benefits over other active interventions (e.g. glucocorticoid injection) because of the very low quality of the evidence. Practitioners should communicate the uncertainty of these effects and consider other approaches or combinations of treatment. Further trials of electrotherapy modalities for rotator cuff disease should be based upon a strong rationale and consideration of whether or not they would alter the conclusions of this review.

### Efficacy of standardised manual therapy and home exercise programme for chronic rotator cuff disease: randomised placebo controlled trial [^113XQoVL]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder disorders are a common cause of persistent musculoskeletal morbidity, particularly in the middle to older age groups. Pain and compromised shoulder function have a substantial impact on tasks essential to daily living, as well as on sleep. Shoulder disorders are a common reason for seeking medical care and may require surgical intervention in up to 28% of cases. Shoulder disorders can thus lead to considerable disability, reduced health related quality of life, absenteeism from work, and use of healthcare resources.

Although definitions of different diagnostic categories of shoulder pain are controversial, a large proportion of shoulder problems can be classified as "rotator cuff disease", the most common cause of shoulder pain in primary care. The term, or its variants such as impingement syndrome, may include a spectrum of pathologies of rotator cuff disease (such as subacromial bursitis, partial rotator cuff tears, and bicipital tendinosis), but they are characterised clinically by pain with abduction (painful arc) and signs of impingement. Although standard criteria have not been established for use in clinical trials, most trials that have assessed interventions for rotator cuff disease have used variations of these features to select their study populations. Rotator cuff disease differs from other major diagnostic categories of shoulder pain such as adhesive capsulitis, osteoarthritis, and calcific tendinitis, which are known to have different presentations, underlying causes, prognoses, and responses to treatment.

A combination of modalities of physiotherapy, such as manual therapy and exercise, is often used in the management of rotator cuff disease. These aim to correct modifiable physical impairments thought to contribute to pain and dysfunction rather than to treat the specific pathology. These impairments include rotator cuff and scapular muscle weakness and dysfunction, tightness of the posterior capsule and other soft tissues, and postural abnormalities. Little conclusive evidence supports or refutes the efficacy of different physiotherapy programmes given the variable methodological quality of the trials, including a lack of placebo control and the fact that many tested a single modality despite multimodality treatment being the most common way in which physiotherapists treat shoulder disorders. The conclusions and recommendations of recent systematic reviews support the need for further clinical trials. The primary aim of this trial was, therefore, to determine whether a 10 week programme of standardised manual therapy and home exercise delivered by a physiotherapist improves shoulder pain and function more than placebo treatment does in people with chronic rotator cuff disease.

Data synthesis

Results from studies with similar comparators and outcome measures such as pain, function, quality of life and measures of impairment such range of motion, shoulder strength or size of the calcific deposit were considered for pooling into separate meta-analyses. Pooled mean differences were calculated. Pooled estimates with 95% CIs were calculated using Review Manager (RevMan V.5.3; The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Alpha level was set at 0.05. The inverse variance method was used to weigh each study. Analyses were performed with fixed effects. Visual inspection of the forest plots was performed. Only meta-analyses without a significant degree of heterogeneity were kept and reported (χ² p > 0.10 and I² < 60%). When SDs from original studies were missing, estimations were made using Review Manager and according to the Cochrane Collaboration recommendations on how to handle missing data. For studies not included in the meta-analyses, a qualitative analysis was performed.

Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy

With regard to the use of PRP to treat partial rotator cuff tears, several RCTs showed efficacy over CSI including one study that demonstrated that intralesional injections improved rotator cuff tear size. A systematic review examining the use of PRP for partial thickness rotator cuff tears consisted of eight studies on intra-articular, subacromial or intra-tendinous injection approaches. Although the review was inconclusive of the best injection approach, PRP injection was generally associated with functional improvement in rotator cuff tendinitis. A significant number of studies performed PRP injection as an adjunct to surgical repair, making the assessment of PRP effect challenging. Evaluation of certainty of evidence is difficult due to the heterogeneity of techniques (eg palpation-guided vs ultrasound-guided), location of injection (intratendinous/bursa vs intra-articular), and other variables. All clinical endpoints suggested that PRP is potentially superior to CSI for rotator cuff tendinitis. The three RCTs that showed no difference or some difference in only short-term outcomes used PRP preparations that were less than two times concentrated. This is important as Marx et al have suggested that the minimum definition of PRP is 4–5 times concentrated.

The use of BMAC injection to treat partial rotator tears versus exercise has been investigated in an RCT with a published mid-term analysis showing efficacy and reduced tear size. A second study of BMAC demonstrated reduced tear size and efficacy when compared to exercise.

Consensus Point 12. The use of PRP injection for rotator cuff tendinitis is likely to provide superior analgesia compared to corticosteroid injections, including intra-articular, subacromial, and intra-tendinous approaches. Studies with non-inferior outcomes utilized less than two times the platelet concentrations, highlighting the importance of having a minimum concentration of four to five times in the PRP injectate (Level I, Grade B).

Consensus Point 13. There are limited studies suggesting analgesic utility of BMAC compared to exercise therapy for rotator cuff tendinitis, although future studies are warranted (Level II-1, Grade C).

### Is ultrasound-guided lavage an effective intervention for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy? A systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114e6RKm]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

In individuals with chronic RC calcific tendinopathy, low-quality evidence suggests that US-guided lavage with a corticosteroid injection is more effective than shockwave therapy to reduce pain in the short and long term and to improve function in the short term and that these effects may or may not be clinically important. Low-quality evidence suggests that the addition of US-guided lavage to a corticosteroid injection is beneficial to improve function at 12-month follow-up and that this effect may or may not be clinically important. Further studies could modify the present conclusions.

### Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy: a final review of a randomised controlled trial at a minimum follow-up of ten years [^116w4PQj]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy.

Patients and Methods

This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88 women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability, working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding the final assessment.

Results

A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean 12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures. Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol: operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were found.

Conclusion

The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo, the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.

### Chronic calcific tendonitis of the rotator cuff: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing operative and nonoperative interventions [^115YuHE8]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcific tendinitis is a relatively common shoulder disorder, with 7%-17% of individuals with shoulder pain having rotator cuff calcium deposits. Several nonoperative interventions, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) and ultrasonography-guided needling (UGN), and surgical techniques have been described to treat calcific tendonitis with satisfactory outcomes. Clinical guidelines are lacking for surgical excision in cases refractory to nonoperative treatment. Several arthroscopic and open operative techniques have been described to treat calcific tendonitis with satisfactory clinical outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials is to compare outcomes and complications of nonoperative vs. operative management of chronic calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff, to provide evidence-based treatment guidelines for practitioners.

Methods

EMBASE, PubMed, and OVID [MEDLINE] were searched from database inception until February 20, 2022, for randomized controlled trials reporting outcomes related to operative or nonoperative management for calcific tendonitis of the shoulder. Clinical outcomes including pain on visual analog scale (VAS), Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome Score (CMS), and resolution of calcific deposits were evaluated. Continuous data at last follow-up was pooled into mean differences using a random effects model for meta-analysis.

Results

A total of 27 studies (2212 nonoperative patients and 140 operative patients) met the final inclusion criteria. Pooled mean difference in VAS for ESWT was -3.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] -5.38, -2.27); P < .001), compared to -4.83 (95% CI -5.44, -4.22; P < .001) for UGN, and -4.65 (95% CI -5.47, -3.82; P < .001) for the operative interventions. Pooled mean difference in CMS score after ESWT was 18.30 (95% CI 10.95, 25.66; P < .001) compared to 22.01 (95% CI 8.17, 35.84; p = 0.002) for UGN, and 38.35 (95% CI 31.68, 45.02; P < .001) for the operative interventions. Eighty-five percent of patients receiving operative and 67% of patients receiving UGN management had complete radiographic resolution of calcific deposit.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment of chronic calcific tendonitis of the rotator cuff results in larger improvement in functional outcome scores and comparable pain reduction to nonoperative interventions, particularly UGN. Both operative and nonoperative treatment modalities are likely to have clinically significant improvements in function and pain, and thus it is reasonable to trial UGN and ESWT as first-line treatment. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be needed to support one treatment over the other. High-quality randomized controlled trials directly comparing nonoperative interventions to operative interventions in patients prior to failing conservative treatment are needed to establish high-quality evidence-based guidelines.

### Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder [^117PjgbK]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder is a process involving calcium deposition commonly in the rotator cuff tendons. It is a cell-mediated process that is often chronic in nature, but it is usually self-limiting with regard to its acute pain states. Nonoperative management is still the treatment of choice and is successful in up to 90% of patients. When conservative measures fail, a needling technique or surgical removal may be indicated; the trend is toward arthroscopic management. Acromioplasty should not be performed without radiographic signs of impingement. If a resulting large rotator cuff defect is found after removal of the calcific deposit, it may be worthwhile to close the defect arthroscopically with suture to prevent cuff tear progression and to promote healing.

Rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — eccentric exercises versus resistance and mobility exercises: A systematic review with meta-analysis reported that eccentric exercises do not significantly reduce pain in the short term (MD, –13.5; 95% CI: –28.5, 1.4; 6 RCTs; n = 281) and in the long term (MD, –4.9; 95% CI: –15.4, 5.6; 3 RCTs; n = 167) but did in the medium term (MD, –11.9; 95% CI: –18.2, –5.5; 3 RCTs; n = 194); the evidence further notes these effects may or may not be clinically important for pain in the medium term, and in the short and long terms the nonsignificant CIs are large and the true effects remain unclear for pain reductions.

### Is ultrasound-guided lavage an effective intervention for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy? A systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113EEYbm]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

What is already known?

Rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy is characterised by the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in one of the rotator cuff tendons.
Rotator cuff calcific deposit is more prevalent in adults with subacromial pain syndrome.
It is unclear whether ultrasound-guided lavage has beneficial effects compared with conventional interventions in the treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy.

What are the new findings?

Low-quality evidence suggests that ultrasound-guided lavage with a corticosteroid injection is more effective than shockwave therapy in the treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy.
Low-quality evidence suggests that the addition of ultrasound-guided lavage to a corticosteroid injection is beneficial for adults with rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy.

Rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections versus landmark or intramuscular approaches provide small short-term pain reductions without clear disability benefit and uncertain clinical importance. A CPG reported that ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections significantly reduce pain and disability compared to landmark-guided injections in the short term (6 weeks), although the differences are probably not clinically meaningful. A Cochrane review reported moderate-certainty evidence of reduced pain (MD, –0.58/10; 95% CI: –1.05, –0.11; 12 RCTs; n = 777) but not disability (MD, –5.06/100; 95% CI: –13.35, 3.23; 11 RCTs; n = 678) compared with landmark or intramuscular injections in the short term, and low-certainty evidence of no significant differences in quality of life or adverse events.

### A self-managed single exercise programme versus usual physiotherapy treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy: a randomised controlled trial (the SELF study) [^112PYPvY]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a self-managed single exercise programme versus usual physiotherapy treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.

Design

Multi-centre pragmatic unblinded parallel group randomised controlled trial.

Setting

UK National Health Service.

Participants

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of rotator cuff tendinopathy.

Interventions

The intervention was a programme of self-managed exercise prescribed by a physiotherapist in relation to the most symptomatic shoulder movement. The control group received usual physiotherapy treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was the Shoulder Pain & Disability Index (SPADI) at three months. Secondary outcomes included the SPADI at six and twelve months.

Results

A total of 86 patients (self-managed loaded exercise n = 42; usual physiotherapy n = 44) were randomised. Twenty-six patients were excluded from the analysis because of lack of primary outcome data at the 3 months follow-up, leaving 60 (n = 27; n = 33) patients for intention to treat analysis. For the primary outcome, the mean SPADI score at three months was 32.4 (SD 20.2) for the self-managed group, and 30.7 (SD 19.7) for the usual physiotherapy treatment group; mean difference adjusted for baseline score: 3.2 (95% Confidence interval -6.0 to +12.4 P = 0.49). By six and twelve months there remained no significant difference between the groups.

Conclusions

This study does not provide sufficient evidence of superiority of one intervention over the other in the short-, mid- or long-term and hence a self-management programme based around a single exercise appears comparable to usual physiotherapy treatment.

### Efficacy of adjuvant application of platelet-rich plasma after needle aspiration of calcific deposits for the treatment of rotator cuff calcific tendinitis: a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with 2-year follow-up [^111UrJek]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Needle aspiration of calcific deposits (NACD) is a frequently used treatment for rotator cuff calcific tendinitis (RCCT). However, a substantial number of patients experience recurrent or persisting shoulder symptoms after NACD.

Purpose

To compare the effects of adjuvant application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after NACD (NACP+PRP) with those of conventional NACD with corticosteroids (NACD+corticosteroids) on pain, shoulder function, and quality of life (QoL).

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

In a single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, 80 adults with symptomatic RCCT were randomly allocated to receive NACD+corticosteroids or NACD+PRP. Pain, shoulder function, and QoL were assessed at baseline; 6 weeks; and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment using a numeric rating scale for pain (NRS); the Constant-Murley score (CMS); the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH); the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS); and the EuroQol 5-dimension scale (EQ-5D). Additionally, resorption of calcific deposits and the integrity of rotator cuff tendons were assessed by using standard radiographs and ultrasound examination, respectively. The results were analyzed using noninferiority analysis for NRS scores and a mixed model for repeated measures.

Results

Eighty patients were included (48 female; mean age, 49 ± 6 years; 41 patients in the NACD+PRP group). Both groups showed improvement of clinical scores at the 2-year follow-up (P < .001 for all clinical scores). NACD+PRP was found to be noninferior to NACD+corticosteroids with regard to the mean decrease of NRS scores (4.34 vs 3.56; p = 0.003). Mixed-model analysis showed a significant difference in favor of NACD+PRP (CMS, P < .001; DASH, P = 0.002; OSS, P = 0.010; EQ-5D, P < .001). However, clinically relevant differences in favor of NACD+PRP were only seen at the 6-month follow-up for NRS and CMS scores, whereas at the 6-week follow-up a clinically relevant difference in favor of NACD+corticosteroids was found for all clinical scores except for the NRS. Full resorption of calcific deposits was present in 84% of the NACD+PRP group compared with 66% in the NACD+corticosteroids group (P = 0.081). In the NACD+PRP group, 10 (24%) patients required a second NACD procedure compared with 19 (49%) patients in the NACD+corticosteroids group (P = 0.036). Six complications, of which 5 were frozen shoulders, occurred in the NACD+PRP group compared with 1 complication in the NACD+corticosteroids group (P = 0.11).

Conclusion

NACD+PRP resulted in worse clinical scores at the 6-week follow-up but better clinical scores at the 6-month follow-up compared with NACD+corticosteroids. At the 1- and 2-year follow-ups, the results were comparable between groups. Furthermore, PRP seemed to reduce the need for additional treatments but was associated with more complications. In conclusion, NACD+corticosteroids had a favorable early effect on pain and function combined with low comorbidity. Thus, it remains the treatment of choice for patients with RCCT.

### Musculoskeletal ultrasound: how to treat calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff by ultrasound-guided single-needle lavage technique [^1165Ctod]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this video article is to illustrate the ultrasound appearance of calcium deposition in the rotator cuff and provide a detailed step-by-step protocol for performing the ultrasound-guided single-needle lavage technique for the treatment of calcific tendinitis with emphasis on patient positioning, necessary supplies, real-time lavage technique, and steroid injection into the subacromial subdeltoid bursa.

Conclusion

Musculoskeletal ultrasound is well established as a safe, cost-effective imaging tool in diagnosing and treating common musculoskeletal disorders. Calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff is a common disabling cause of shoulder pain. Although most cases are self-limiting, a subset of patients is refractory to conservative therapy and requires treatment intervention. Ultrasound-guided lavage is an effective and safe minimally-invasive treatment not readily offered in the United States as an alternative to surgery, perhaps because of the limited prevalence of musculoskeletal ultrasound programs and limited training. On completion of this video article, the participant should be able to develop an appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for the treatment of calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff using ultrasound.

### The efficacy of manual therapy for rotator cuff tendinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1175Avxj]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of manual therapy (MT) for patients with rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy.

Background

Rotator cuff tendinopathy is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, for which MT is a common intervention used by physical therapists. However, evidence regarding the efficacy of MT is inconclusive.

Methods

A literature search using terms related to shoulder, RC tendinopathy, and MT was conducted in 4 databases to identify randomized controlled trials that compared MT to any other type of intervention to treat RC tendinopathy. Randomized controlled trials were assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analyses or qualitative syntheses of evidence were performed.

Results

Twenty-one studies were included. The majority had a high risk of bias. Only 5 studies had a score of 69% or greater, indicating a moderate to low risk of bias. A small but statistically significant overall effect for pain reduction of MT compared with a placebo or in addition to another intervention was observed (n = 406), which may or may not be clinically important, given a mean difference of 1.1 (95% confidence interval: 0.6, 1.6) on a 10-cm visual analog scale. Adding MT to an exercise program (n = 226) significantly decreased pain (mean difference, 1.0; 95% confidence interval: 0.7, 1.4), as reported on a 10-cm visual analog scale, which may or may not be clinically important. Based on qualitative analyses, it is unclear whether MT used alone or added to an exercise program improves function.

Conclusion

For patients with RC tendinopathy, based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, MT may decrease pain; however, it is unclear whether it can improve function. More methodologically sound studies are needed to make definitive conclusions.

### Topical glyceryl trinitrate for rotator cuff disease [^117U21nA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Rotator cuff disease is a common cause of shoulder pain. Topical glyceryl trinitrate is a possible new treatment.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of topical glyceryl trinitrate for rotator cuff disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, the Australian Clinical Trials Registry, Current Controlled Trials (to October 2007) and the references and citations of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of people with rotator cuff disease who received topical glyceryl trinitrate, alone or in combination, compared to placebo or active therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

Three small studies, one at moderate risk of bias and two at high risk of bias, were included. Meta-analysis was precluded due to different interventions and outcome measures. Study participants also had differing durations of symptoms and data for pain and function could only be extracted from one study. One placebo-controlled trial (20 participants) tested 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patches, used daily for three days, among participants with 'acute supraspinatus tendinitis' of less than seven days duration. Treatment resulted in reduced pain intensity (adjusted MD -3.50, 95% CI -3.96 to -3.04). Function was not measured. One trial (53 participants) compared one quarter of a 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patch used daily for up to 24 weeks combined with rehabilitation to placebo patches and rehabilitation among participants with 'supraspinatus tendinopathy' for longer than six months. A third trial (48 participants) tested 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patches, used daily for three days, compared to corticosteroid injection among participants with 'rotator cuff tendinitis' of less than six-weeks duration. Fifteen out of 24 participants in the glyceryl trinitrate treatment reported headache (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.96).

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence from one study at high risk of bias that topical glyceryl trinitrate is more effective than placebo for rotator cuff disease among patients with acute symptoms (< seven-days duration), but there is insufficient evidence to be certain about their longer-term effects. Headache was a common side effect in one trial and any benefits of treatment need to be balanced against the risk of headache. Further high quality research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this new therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections and other injections for management of tendinopathy: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1157siAr]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Few evidence-based treatment guidelines for tendinopathy exist. We undertook a systematic review of randomised trials to establish clinical efficacy and risk of adverse events for treatment by injection.

Methods

We searched eight databases without language, publication, or date restrictions. We included randomised trials assessing efficacy of one or more peritendinous injections with placebo or non-surgical interventions for tendinopathy, scoring more than 50% on the modified physiotherapy evidence database scale. We undertook meta-analyses with a random-effects model, and estimated relative risk and standardised mean differences (SMDs). The primary outcome of clinical efficacy was protocol-defined pain score in the short term (4 weeks, range 0–12), intermediate term (26 weeks, 13–26), or long term (52 weeks, ≥ 52). Adverse events were also reported.

Findings

3824 trials were identified and 41 met inclusion criteria, providing data for 2672 participants. We showed consistent findings between many high-quality randomised controlled trials that corticosteroid injections reduced pain in the short term compared with other interventions, but this effect was reversed at intermediate and long terms. For example, in pooled analysis of treatment for lateral epicondylalgia, corticosteroid injection had a large effect (defined as SMD > 0.8) on reduction of pain compared with no intervention in the short term (SMD 1.44, 95% CI 1.17–1.71, p < 0.0001), but no intervention was favoured at intermediate term (-0.40, -0.67 to -0.14, p < 0.003) and long term (-0.31, -0.61 to -0.01, p = 0.05). Short-term efficacy of corticosteroid injections for rotator-cuff tendinopathy is not clear. Of 991 participants who received corticosteroid injections in studies that reported adverse events, only one (0.1%) had a serious adverse event (tendon rupture). By comparison with placebo, reductions in pain were reported after injections of sodium hyaluronate (short [3.91, 3.54–4.28, p < 0.0001], intermediate [2.89, 2.58–3.20, p < 0.0001], and long [3.91, 3.55–4.28, p < 0.0001] terms), botulinum toxin (short term [1.23, 0.67–1.78, p < 0.0001]), and prolotherapy (intermediate term [2.62, 1.36–3.88, p < 0.0001]) for treatment of lateral epicondylalgia. Lauromacrogol (polidocanol), aprotinin, and platelet-rich plasma were not more efficacious than was placebo for Achilles tendinopathy, while prolotherapy was not more effective than was eccentric exercise.

Interpretation

Despite the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in the short term, non-corticosteroid injections might be of benefit for long-term treatment of lateral epicondylalgia. However, response to injection should not be generalised because of variation in effect between sites of tendinopathy.

### The midterm effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy in the management of chronic calcific shoulder tendinitis [^117XS96C]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This systematic review explored the midterm effectiveness of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in reducing pain and improving shoulder function. Calcified rotator cuff tendinitis is a common cause of chronic shoulder pain that leads to significant pain and functional limitations. ESWT is an alternative to surgery when conservative treatments such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, steroidal injections, and physiotherapy fail to relieve symptoms. It is hypothesised that ESWT is effective in the midterm for reducing pain and improving function for patients with chronic calcific tendinitis and that a dose-response relationship exists in the treatment parameters for effectiveness.

Materials and Methods

Articles were electronically searched from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PUBMED, EMBASE, SPORTSDiscus and PEDro using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials testing the midterm effectiveness of ESWT for chronic calcific tendonitis. Methodologic quality was assessed by PEDro (total score = 10). The strength of the evidence was reported using the National Health and Medical Research Council body of evidence framework.

Results

Six of the nine included studies scored 7 or more for methodologic quality. All studies had follow-up periods of at least 6 months. Common methodologic flaws were insufficient blinding of clinicians and assessors. There was consistent evidence of midterm effectiveness of ESWT in reducing pain and improving shoulder function for patients with chronic calcified tendinitis.

Discussion

ESWT is a potential alternative to surgery with good mid-term effectiveness and minimal side effects. This review noted several limitations with the current body of evidence. Studies were mainly from a few European countries involving medical doctors, with a lack of diverse perspectives and effectiveness evaluation from other health professionals who might use this treatment option for patients with chronic calcific tendinitis. Further, the different outcome measures used and inadequate reporting details in the included studies did not permit a quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of this treatment. A lack of follow up period beyond one year in the studies also precluded conclusion to be made on the longer term effectiveness of ESWT.

Conclusion

Due to variable treatment parameters (eg dosage), this review was unable to provide clear guidance of the dose-effect of the midterm effectiveness of ESWT. Studies of better methodologic design using standardized treatment protocols and studies with longer follow-up are required.

### Rotator cuff tears [^11334sug]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are the most common upper extremity condition seen by primary care and orthopaedic surgeons, with a spectrum ranging from tendinopathy to full-thickness tears with arthritic change. Some tears are traumatic, but most rotator cuff problems are degenerative. Not all tears are symptomatic and not all progress, and many patients in whom tears become more extensive do not experience symptom worsening. Hence, a standard algorithm for managing patients is challenging. The pathophysiology of rotator cuff tears is complex and encompasses an interplay between the tendon, bone and muscle. Rotator cuff tears begin as degenerative changes within the tendon, with matrix disorganization and inflammatory changes. Subsequently, tears progress to partial-thickness and then full-thickness tears. Muscle quality, as evidenced by the overall size of the muscle and intramuscular fatty infiltration, also influences symptoms, tear progression and the outcomes of surgery. Treatment depends primarily on symptoms, with non-operative management sufficient for most patients with rotator cuff problems. Modern arthroscopic repair techniques have improved recovery, but outcomes are still limited by a lack of understanding of how to improve tendon to bone healing in many patients.

### Progressive exercise compared with best practice advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders (GRASP): a multicentre, pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised controlled trial [^116wEz8W]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is common, with approximately 1% of adults aged 45 years and older presenting to primary care services with a new episode of shoulder pain each year, accounting for 2.4% of all general practitioner (GP) consultations in the UK. Disorders of the rotator cuff are the most common cause, accounting for 70% of cases. Rotator cuff disorders are often associated with substantial and persistent disability and pain and approximately half of patients continue to have pain or functional limitations for up to 2 years. Most problems with shoulder pain are managed in primary care by physiotherapists and GPs. The aim of treatment is to improve pain and shoulder function. Treatment options include rest, advice, analgesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, exercise, manual therapy, and corticosteroid injections.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

A Cochrane review published in 2016 highlighted insufficient evidence about the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of physiotherapy for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders despite the treatment's widespread provision. Evidence from several small trials with short-term follow-up also raised uncertainty about which types of exercise and delivery mechanisms were associated with best outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to identify new evidence relevant to the GRASP (Getting it Right: Addressing Shoulder Pain) trial (date of last search June 30, 2020; see appendix p 20 for search terms). From an initial 2354 records, we identified seven trials published between 2013 and 2020, comparing the effects of supervised exercise versus unsupervised exercise, or no intervention, in people with a rotator cuff disorder (excluding those who required surgery). The quality of trials was variable and considerable heterogeneity meant we could not combine data from studies. All trials were small apart from two moderate sized trials. Only two of the seven trials reported on the effect of exercise on shoulder pain and function at 12 months. Most of the trials concluded that little or no difference existed between supervised and unsupervised exercise at 6 and 12 months, with the exception of the SUPPORT trial, which showed a benefit of supervised exercise compared with an exercise leaflet at 6 months but not at 12 months. At the time of planning the GRASP trial, a systematic review showed that in comparison with placebo, corticosteroid injection had short-term benefit for treating patients with tendinopathy, although uncertainty existed regarding the injection's use in patients with rotator cuff disorders. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry to identify new evidence relevant to the GRASP trial (date of last search June 30, 2020; see appendix p 20 for search terms). From an initial 794 records, we identified one small trial (n = 50) comparing the effects of corticosteroid injection versus no injection in patients with a rotator cuff tear, which found no difference in shoulder pain and function when analysed at 3 months or 6 months. We identified an additional ten trials comparing the effects of corticosteroid injection with placebo injection, of which four were judged as suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. The remaining trials could not be included because of either incomplete or incompatible outcome data. In these trials, corticosteroid injection showed a benefit over placebo in the short term but not the medium term for shoulder pain and function. No trials provided outcome data beyond 6-month follow-up and none reported any serious adverse events as a result of injection.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^114zHMg3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy — diagnostic imaging use and referral thresholds: Clinicians should not prescribe or recommend a diagnostic imaging test to confirm rotator cuff tendinopathy in the initial management of an adult with shoulder pain. Clinicians may recommend or prescribe diagnostic imaging test(s) for adults with rotator cuff tendinopathy if symptoms do not resolve or improve within a maximum of 12 weeks of appropriate nonsurgical management, and clinicians must consider suspected pathologies, diagnostic properties, accessibility, and costs when choosing a test. Clinicians must prioritize diagnostic ultrasound because of its lower cost and its diagnostic properties being similar to magnetic resonance imaging for confirming a rotator cuff disorder. Clinicians should refer adults with rotator cuff tendinopathy who have severe and persistent pain and/or disability despite a maximum of 12 weeks of appropriate nonsurgical care to a musculoskeletal physician specialist such as a primary care sports physician, a physiatrist, or an orthopedic surgeon for further assessment and treatment.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^1134oPtb]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy — stem cell injections: A moderate-quality randomized controlled trial included 24 patients with chronic RC tendinopathy with partial tears (> 3 months) and reported that MSCs injections (allogeneic adipose tissue-derived adult MSC with fibrin glue) do not significantly reduce pain during activity and disability on the American Shoulder and Elbow Score (ASES) when compared to placebo, with the primary pain outcome change between baseline and 3 months MD: –1.37/10 ± 2.85 in the stem cell injections group and –3.0/10 ± 2.56 in the placebo group (P = 0.25). A low-quality pilot RCT included 20 patients with RC tendinopathy who had not responded to physiotherapy treatments for at least 6 weeks and reported that stem cell injections (unmodified autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells) (n = 12) significantly reduce disability on the ASES in the medium and long term when compared to corticosteroid injection (n = 8), while stem cell injections do not significantly reduce pain compared to corticosteroid injection in the medium and long terms. Recommendations state: Insufficient evidence to formulate a recommendation.

### Interventions for tears of the rotator cuff in adults [^114uTHPP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Tears of the rotator cuff tendons, which surround the joints of the shoulder, are one of the most common causes of pain and disability in the upper extremity.

Objectives

To review the efficacy and safety of common interventions for tears of the rotator cuff in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised trail register (July 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library issue 2, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001), EMBASE (1974 to December 2001), Biological Abstracts (1980 to December 2001), LILACS (1982 to December 2001), CINAHL (November 1982 to December 2001), Science Citation Index and reference lists of articles. We also contacted authors and handsearched conference proceedings focusing on shoulder conditions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving tears of the rotator cuff were the focus of this review. All trials involving conservative interventions or surgery were included (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular or subacromial glucocorticosteroid injection, oral glucocorticosteroid treatment, physiotherapy, and open or arthroscopic surgery).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed suitability for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. Dichotomous data were presented as relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), using the fixed effects model.

Main Results

Eight trials involving 455 people were included and 393 patients analysed. Trials were grouped in eight categories of conservative or surgical treatment. The median quality score of all trials combined was 16 out of a possible 24 points, with a range of 12–18. In general, included trials differed on diagnostic criteria for rotator cuff tear, there was no uniformity in reported outcome measures, and data which could be summarised were rarely reported. Only results from two studies comparing open repair to arthroscopic debridement could be pooled. There is weak evidence for the superiority of open repair of rotator cuff tears compared with arthroscopic debridement.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is little evidence to support or refute the efficacy of common interventions for tears of rotator cuff in adults. As well as the need for further well designed clinical trials, uniform methods of defining interventions for rotator cuff tears and validated outcome measures are also essential.

### High-energy versus low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy for calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder: which is superior? A meta-analysis [^116jg9b3]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are several treatment options for calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder. The next step treatment after conservative treatment fails is still a matter of dispute. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been shown to be a good alternative to surgery, but the best treatment intensity remains unknown. High-energy ESWT is much more painful, more expensive, and usually is done in an inpatient setting, whereas low-energy ESWT can be performed in an outpatient setting by a physical therapist.

Questions/Purposes

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials was performed to answer two clear research questions: (1) Is there a greater increase in the Constant-Murley score in patients treated with high-energy ESWT compared with those treated with low-energy ESWT by 3 months and by 6 months? (2) Is there a greater chance of complete resorption of the calcifications in patients treated with high-energy ESWT compared with those treated with low-energy ESWT by 3 months and by 6 months?

Methods

Five relevant electronic online databases, Medline (through PubMed), EMBASE (through OVID), Cinahl (through EBSCO), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were systematically searched. We also crosschecked the reference lists of articles and reviews for possible relevant studies. Eligible for inclusion were all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared high-energy ESWT (> 0.28 mJ/mm²) with low-energy ESWT (< 0.08 mJ/mm²). One author examined titles and abstracts of each identified study to assess study eligibility. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and study quality. The primary outcome measure, the Constant-Murley score, was assessed by comparing mean functional outcome scores between the groups. Secondary outcomes were assessed using odds ratios, when appropriate data were pooled. Based on this process, five RCTs (359 participants) were included.

Results

All five RCTs showed greater improvement in functional outcome (Constant-Murley score) in patients treated with high-energy ESWT compared with patients treated with low-energy ESWT at 3 and 6 months. The 3-month mean difference was 9.88 (95% CI, 9.04–10.72, p < 0.001; 6-month data could not be pooled). Furthermore, high-energy ESWT more often resulted in complete resorption of the deposits at 3 months. The corresponding odds ratio was 3.40 (95% CI, 1.35–8.58) and p = 0.009 (6-month data could not be pooled).

Conclusion

When shock wave therapy is chosen, high-energy shock wave therapy is more likely to result in improved Constant-Murley score and resorption of the deposits compared with low-energy therapy.

### Radiological and clinical predictors of long-term outcome in rotator cuff calcific tendinitis [^113XXXdF]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rotator cuff calcific tendinitis (RCCT) is frequently diagnosed: reported incidence rates range from 6.8–54%. Nevertheless, information on its epidemiology, radiological characteristics, long-term course and prognostic factors is scarce. In current literature, generally small populations are assessed, with short follow-up periods. This includes a recent trial from our institution, in which results of barbotage (needling and lavage) were superior to subacromial injections after one year of follow-up. Surprisingly, results of both treatments appeared comparable in the case of Gärtner type I calcifications. However, the measurement properties and reliability of most radiological RCCT characteristics, including the Gärtner classification, and their association with long-term outcome are unclear.

The current observational study is the first to assess long-term shoulder function in a large group of RCCT patients treated with barbotage (under local anesthesia) or more conservative methods. Additionally, patient demographics, radiological characteristics (size, location, Gärtner classification), interobserver agreement of radiological characteristics, and the association of these baseline parameters with long-term outcome are evaluated.

Typical RCCT symptoms are pain in the deltoid region, with variable functional impairment and variable duration of symptoms, ranging from months to years. Treatment of these generally self-limiting symptoms is usually conservative, e.g. with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy. In the case of persisting or severe symptoms, more invasive treatments can be applied, including corticosteroids injections, barbotage, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), or surgery. Only a few studies have compared various treatments and their long-term effects. It is also unclear which patients follow a mild and self-limiting course, or who might benefit from more invasive treatment strategies. Consequently, clinical decision making is often based on personal experience and regional preferences.

With regard to the epidemiology of RCCT, several etiologies have been reported, including cell-mediated calcification, RC degeneration, RC overuse and micro-trauma, genetic predisposition, local metabolic or hemodynamic abnormalities, and subacromial impingement. Based on these theories, RCCT would predominantly affect the dominant arm or both arms in individuals with suboptimal vascular status (e.g. middle to older age, diabetes, or smokers) with frequent overhead activities. However, this has not been confirmed in clinical studies.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy — PRP injections versus exercise therapy favors exercise on several outcomes from low-quality trials. In 1 low-quality RCT, PRP is not more effective than exercise to reduce pain and disability, with confidence intervals below clinically important differences for pain and below a moderate effect size for disability, and a systematic review reported a narrative synthesis of 2 RCTs that compared PRP injections to exercise therapy for the treatment of RC tendinopathy, noting that based on 1 low-quality RCT there was a significant difference for pain in favor of exercise therapy in the short to medium term and that exercise therapy significantly reduces disability on the WORC but not the DASH when compared to PRP in the medium term.

### Effectiveness of isometric exercise in the management of tendinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111s81Ds]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

What is already known

Isometric exercise has become popular in recent years in the management of tendinopathy.
Conflicting results have been reported in terms of immediate and short-term pain relief.
Definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of isometric exercise in tendinopathy are yet to be made.

What are the new findings

Based on the current literature, isometric exercise does not appear to be superior to isotonic exercise in the management of chronic tendinopathy.
Isometric exercise appears to be no more effective than ice therapy in the short term for acute rotator cuff tendinopathy.
The immediate and short-term pain response to isometric exercise is variable both within and across tendinopathy populations.
Future research identifying which patient characteristics are more likely to affect treatment outcome and response to isometric and isotonic exercise programmes will be beneficial.

### Is ultrasound-guided lavage an effective intervention for rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy? A systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113DdKey]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is highly prevalent, and among musculoskeletal disorders, it is the third most common reason for visiting a primary care physician. One common shoulder disorder resulting in pain and loss of function is rotator cuff (RC) calcific tendinopathy. The estimated prevalence of RC calcific deposit is of 7.8% in asymptomatic adults and of 42.5% in adults with subacromial pain syndrome. The prevalence is higher in middle-age adults and in women.RC calcific tendinopathy is characterised by the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals in one of the RC tendons, most commonly the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons.RC calcific tendinopathy is often classified into three stages which are precalcific, calcific and postcalcific stagesand the time course of these different stages can evolve within a few months to several years.

Initial conservative treatment of RC calcific tendinopathy consists of physiotherapy including an exercise programmeand may also include therapeutic ultrasound. Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can also be prescribed for pain management. If initial conservative treatment fails, other treatments may be prescribed, as a second-line treatment, such as corticosteroid injections or shockwave therapy. Arthroscopic debridement may be considered only in severe chronic recalcitrant cases.

Ultrasound-guided lavage (US-guided lavage), as a second-line treatment, has gained popularity in the last decades. US-guided lavage is a minimally invasive intervention consisting in the introduction of a needle into the calcific deposit. A saline and/or an anaesthetic solution is then injected into the calcification with several short injections, each followed by release of pressure on the plunger to allow the solution and calcific material to evacuate back into the syringe.US-guided lavage is often followed by a subacromial corticosteroid injection. Although several studies have investigated the use of US-guided lavage, it is unclear whether this intervention has beneficial effects compared with conventional interventions. There is a lack of standardisation in the definition of the US-guided lavage intervention. Most reviews on US-guided lavage also included needle fragmentation without lavage.US-guided needle fragmentation is a procedure that is similar to US-guided lavage; however, it does not include the lavage procedure and may not be as efficient for calcification removal. Pooling of US-guided lavage and needle fragmentation without lavage is then debatable since those two interventions are different.

### Rotator cuff disease [^112oiUNA]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff disease is a complex condition. It includes a variety of pathologies, ranging from tendinosis to complete tear. The cause seems to be multifactorial and is most likely a combination of major trauma, microtrauma from daily wear and tear, and age related degeneration. When establishing a program for the patient with rotator cuff dysfunction, the rehabilitation specialist should consider biomechanical factors, the patient's functional goals, and issues beyond the shoulder that may affect the course of the disease.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy — platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections versus placebo or saline shows mixed and low-certainty effects. Based on a 2021 CPG, there is very low-quality evidence that PRP injections may significantly reduce pain and disability when compared to placebo in adults with RC tendinopathy in whom other nonsurgical treatment has failed, yet a systematic review with meta-analysis reported that PRP injections do not significantly reduce pain when compared to a placebo (saline or other injections) in the medium term, while they also reported that PRP injections significantly reduce pain in the long term at 6 to 7 months and that PRP injections do not significantly reduce disability when compared to placebo (saline or other injections).

### Diagnosing, managing, and supporting return to work of adults with rotator cuff disorders: a clinical practice guideline [^116ARMEa]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical practice guideline covering the assessment, management, and return to work of adults with rotator cuff disorders. DESIGN: Clinical practice guideline. METHODS: Using systematic reviews, appraisal of the literature, and an iterative approach to obtain consensus from key stakeholders, clinical recommendations and algorithms were developed in the context of the health care system and work environment of the province of Quebec (Canada). RESULTS: Recommendations (n = 73) and clinical decision algorithms (n = 3) were developed to match the objectives. The initial assessment should include the patient's history, a subjective assessment, and a physical examination. Diagnostic imaging is only necessary in select circumstances. Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and injection therapies may be useful to reduce pain in the short term. Clinicians should prescribe an active and task-oriented rehabilitation program (exercises and education) to reduce pain and disability in adults with rotator cuff disorders. Subacromial decompression is not recommended to treat rotator cuff tendinopathy. Surgery is appropriate for selected patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. A return-to-work plan should be developed early, in collaboration with the worker and other stakeholders, and must combine multiple strategies to promote return to work. CONCLUSION: This clinical practice guideline was developed to assist the multidisciplinary team of clinicians who provide health care for adults with a rotator cuff disorder. The CPG guides clinical decisionmaking for diagnosis and treatment, and planning for successful return to work. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(10):647–664.

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^114dsBcJ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The ever-expanding arsenal of treatment regimes for tendinopathy can be overwhelming to the treating healthcare professional. New treatments continuously emerge and so do research studies that aim to assess their effectiveness. The most powerful tool that evidence-based medicine has to offer remains systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which constitute the highest level of evidence and are therefore often used to inform guidelines and guide clinical practice.

Unlike a narrative review, which is purely a summary of a proportion of (or all) the available studies on a given topic without assessing the quality of the included evidence, an SR is expected to include all the relevant evidence which is comprehensively and thoroughly appraised and presented with qualitative or quantitative syntheses and accompanying strengths of evidence. For reliable, clinically relevant conclusions to be reached, the potential limitations of the included studies need to be considered. What determines the 'quality' of a study remains poorly defined but should relate to the extent to which its design, conduct, analysis and presentation are appropriate to answer its research question. Generally, study quality assessment includes a combined assessment of its internal validity (freedom from bias), external validity (generalisability/applicability) and precision (freedom from random error)(online supplemental figure 1). The Cochrane group, which produce some of the highest quality SRs, recommend emphasising the internal validity when assessing the quality of a study, reflected by the risk-of-bias assessment (RoB) tool they have produced. However, external validity and precision should not be overlooked.

Assessing the strength of evidence (also known as 'certainty', 'quality', 'level' or 'grade' of evidence) is closely interlinked with RoB assessment and is a process which is commonly overlooked by many SRs. Together with a meticulous methodology and comprehensive RoB assessment, this is what distinguishes a SR from other types of review articles. Assigning a strength of evidence to a finding is as important as the finding itself. Strength of evidence should accompany every assessed outcome measure within an SR for every assessed follow-up time period. A result with a low strength of evidence differs substantially from that with a high level of evidence in terms of its applicability to clinical practice; further research is likely to change the former but not the latter. Equally, the strength of evidence can be high in an outcome measure and low in another, and high for a certain follow-up but period and low for another.

### Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the treatment of chronic calcifying tendonitis of the rotator cuff… [^117GFEii]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

in 7 orthopedic departments in Germany and Austria. Interventions Either high-energy ESWT, low-energy ESWT, or placebo. The 2 ESWT groups received the same cumulative energy dose. Patients in all 3 groups received 2 treatment sessions approximately 2 weeks apart, followed by physical therapy. 6000 shock waves of 0. 08 mJ/mm². In both groups, 120 impulses were applied per minute. Adequate intravenous analgesia and sedation were provided as necessary. Local anesthetics were prohibited. All patients received a second ESWT treatment at 12 to 16 days; thus, patients in each group received a cumulative. massage, and manual therapy to prevent worsening in range-of-motion, muscular deficit, or imbalance. Rescue medication was allowed throughout the entire study if pain became unbearable.

No other therapies were allowed until after the 6-month follow-up. The primary end point was the change in the mean Constant and Murley Scale 29 score from baseline to 6 months. The 6-month interval was selected because we expected that healing would likely be evident at this point. Clinically relevant improvement was defined as a 30% increase from baseline on the CMS score. Patients who needed additional therapies, except the allowed amount of rescue medication and physiotherapy, were defined as failing treatment. In the low-energy group, complete disappearance was observed in 21% and 37%, respectively. In the sham treatment group, complete disappearance was observed in 11% after 6 months and in 25% after 12 months. Finally, it appeared that more patients in the sham treatment group used additional therapies after.

these cases, ESWT has been proposed as an alternative to operative procedures, 21, 24, 33–35 although methodological flaws have limited the conclusions of previous studies. 12 In our study, we found a significant clinical benefit for both high- and low-energy ESWT at 6 months, with significantly better.

### Shock wave therapy for rotator cuff tendonitis… [^116bbpxN]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Calcific tendonitis is relatively common and often self-limiting. Treatment is usually conservative and involves cortisone injections, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. For patients with chronic calcification, surgical removal of deposits has been helpful. Gerdesmeyer and colleagues compared extracorporeal shock wave therapy with placebo treatment to determine whether ultrasonography treatment can be offered as an alternative to surgery. Patients were randomized at seven centers to receive high-energy ESWT, low-energy ESWT, or sham treatment. Eligible patients were 18 years or older with at least six months of pain or tenderness from idiopathic type I or type II calcific tendonitis resistant to conservative treatment. They also had to have radiographic evidence of calcific deposits in the absence of rotator cuff tears and subacromial bursitis.

Primary outcomes were a change in function and pain score at six months, with a 30 percent improvement defined as clinically relevant. Secondary end points were changes in mean three- and 12-month scores and in self-rated pain at three, six, and 12 months according to a visual analog scale, as well as interval radiographic assessment of presence and size of calcific deposits. A total of 144 patients were treated, with 48 patients in each group. After six months, 10 patients were lost to follow-up, with greater numbers lost to follow-up after that. High-and low-energy treatments were superior to sham treatment after six months, with pain and function scores showing similar results. Scores at other intervals did not change this finding. Patients in the high-energy group had significantly less pain by visual analog score than patients in the low-energy group, and both groups had less pain than patients in the sham treatment group at six months.

At other intervals, the low-energy and sham groups were not statistically different in terms of the visual analog score. Radiographically, complete disappearance of the calcific deposit was observed in 60 and 86 percent of the high-energy group at six and 12 months, respectively. Complete disappearance of deposits was observed in 11 and 25 percent of the placebo group at six and 12 months, respectively. The authors conclude that high- and low-energy ESWT has significant clinical benefit compared with sham treatment, and that high-energy ESWT is associated with significantly better outcomes. Because of high dropout rates, the data are more reliable at six months after treatment than at 12 months. ESWT may be a less expensive treatment for chronic calcific shoulder tendonitis than surgery.

### Betamethasone ineffective for rotator cuff tendinosis… [^112wZLwW]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

In severe cases, it leads to massive cuff tears and osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint. Multiple factors play a role in developing cuff degeneration, including tension overload, primary or secondary impingement, impaired repair mechanisms, and overhead activities. Treatment of rotator cuff tendinosis includes rest, activity modification, and physical therapy. One treatment option is corticosteroid injection. Studies demonstrate positive and negative outcomes with corticosteroid injection; however, few have used sham injections as a control. Alvarez and associates performed a randomized controlled trial of patients with chronic rotator cuff tendinosis to evaluate the efficacy of subacromial injections of betamethasone with lidocaine compared with lidocaine alone.

Participants were randomly assigned to subacromial posterolateral injection of 1 mL of betamethasone with 4 mL of 2 percent lidocaine or 5 mL of 2 percent lidocaine alone. The injections were given by the two principal investigators using pre-filled syringes to blind the trial. Outcome measures included a disease-specific quality-of-life index completed by each participant, standardized shoulder assessments, a Neer impingement sign evaluation, and active range of motion. Participants were evaluated at two weeks, six weeks, three months, and six months after the injection. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the scores for any of the outcomes at any time during the study, with the exception of active forward elevation at two weeks. This difference was not present at subsequent evaluations.

At six months, 13 percent of the betamethasone group and 18 percent of the control group reported a "good to excellent" result. The authors conclude that subacromial injection of betamethasone with lidocaine for six months was no more effective than lidocaine alone in the treatment of patients with chronic rotator cuff tendinosis unresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy. They add that despite the popularity of this intervention, they were unable to document any benefit to subacromial corticosteroid injection in these patients.

### Shoulder pain… [^116qwLmV]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

What causes pain in my shoulder. A common cause of shoulder pain is soreness of the tendon in the rotator cuff. The tendon is a cord that attaches a muscle to another body part. The rotator cuff is the part of the shoulder that helps the arm do a circular motion. Another common cause of shoulder pain is soreness of the subacromial bursa. How does the rotator cuff get hurt. One of the muscles rests on top of the shoulder. Its tendon travels under the bone on the outside of the shoulder. This tendon is the one most often injured because of its position between the bones. As the tendon becomes inflamed, it can be pinched between the two bones. The pad of fluid that cushions the tendon also can be damaged. What can I do to help the pain. Treatment should do two things: help your pain and help you get back normal function in your shoulder.

Pain relief includes the following steps: Active rest Physical treatments such as ultrasound Application of ice. Medicine such as ibuprofen or naproxen Occasionally, an injection of steroids into your shoulder Normal function can be restored with special exercises. The first step is simple range-of-motion exercises. By bending over and moving your shoulder in large circles, you can help avoid a serious complication of rotator cuff injury, called frozen shoulder. Range-of-motion exercises are followed by exercises using rubber tubing or light dumbbells. The final step is training with weight machines or free weights. What exercises should I do. Are there other things I can do to help this injury heal. An aerobic exercise program will help improve the blood flow to the tendon and bursa. Increased blood flow helps reduce soreness.

Smokers should quit smoking so that more oxygen will reach the injured tendon. This will help the injury heal faster. Will I need surgery. Sometimes an injury that lasts a long time will cause the tendon to tear. This type of injury may need surgery. You might have a torn rotator cuff if the pain goes on in spite of a good exercise program or if you have weakness in certain arm motions.
