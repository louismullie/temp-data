## Question

What is the clinical significance of lipoprotein A?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical significance of lipoprotein(a). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that makes Lp(a) uniquely atherothrombotic. Then, I should verify the genetic and epidemiologic evidence for causality. Next, I will define risk thresholds and magnitude, check independence from LDL-C and residual risk, characterize genetic determinants and ancestry variability, address measurement challenges, refine screening indications and risk stratification, review current and emerging therapies with a practical management approach, and finally identify knowledge gaps and future directions, while self-verifying key claims at each step.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiological foundation. Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with a single apoB-100 covalently linked to apolipoprotein(a) via a disulfide bond, which reduces LDL receptor–mediated clearance and increases residence time, while its oxidized phospholipid cargo and plasminogen homology promote inflammation and impair fibrinolysis, respectively, thereby conferring distinct atherothrombotic properties beyond LDL [^11215S7e] [^114f2cNs]. Wait, I should verify the magnitude claim: stating that Lp(a) is approximately six-fold more atherogenic per particle than LDL comes from modeling that incorporates oxidized phospholipid load and receptor interactions; the direction is correct, but the exact multiple is an estimate, so I will qualify it as approximate and reference both mechanistic and genetic-per-particle analyses to avoid overstatement [^11215S7e] [^11662Atq].

> Next, I should review causality. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check that Lp(a) is causal across ASCVD and CAVD and not just correlated. Mendelian randomization and genome-wide analyses consistently show that genetic variants increasing Lp(a) raise risk for ASCVD and calcific aortic valve disease independent of confounders, and large cohorts like UK Biobank demonstrate a log-linear association with incident ASCVD of about HR 1.11 per 50 nmol/L increment across the distribution, strengthening the case for causality [^116FAxEM] [^115E1bGA]. Let me verify generalizability: multiethnic cohorts corroborate these associations, with similar per-unit risk despite different population distributions, supporting global relevance of elevated Lp(a) [^115E1bGA] [^111xsHNy].

> I need to define clinically meaningful thresholds and risk magnitude. Lp(a) above 50 mg/dL (approximately 125 nmol/L) is widely used to denote elevated risk, supported by meta-analytic data showing increased ASCVD events even at low achieved LDL-C on statins and by consensus statements that operationalize 50 mg/dL as a pragmatic risk "rule-in" level; the gray zone of 30–50 mg/dL warrants context-specific interpretation, and unit conversion is approximate due to assay differences, so I should emphasize nmol/L where possible [^114YnHeg] [^112Y9G4e]. Wait, I should double-check high thresholds: concentrations ≥ 150 nmol/L are present in roughly 12% of primary prevention populations and associate with HR ≈1.50 for incident ASCVD, highlighting a subgroup with particularly high risk [^115E1bGA].

> Let me now examine independence from LDL-C and the concept of residual risk. Participant-level meta-analyses of statin trials demonstrate that Lp(a) and LDL-C contribute independent, additive risk, and importantly, those with Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL maintain higher event rates even when LDL-C is driven to very low levels on therapy, underscoring Lp(a) as residual risk not fully mitigated by LDL-C lowering [^114YnHeg] [^1137pjHN]. I should confirm this across prevention settings: in a large health system cohort, the relative hazard from very high Lp(a) percentiles was greater in primary than in secondary prevention, consistent with a larger proportional risk signal when competing risks are fewer [^113LSAPs].

> I will now characterize genetic determinants and ancestry variability. Lp(a) levels are 70–90% heritable, dominated by LPA locus variation, with the number of kringle IV-2 repeats inversely related to concentration and small apo(a) isoforms producing markedly higher levels, though the strength of this inverse relation is ancestry dependent [^116FAxEM] [^114wg62Q]. Let me verify population distributions: median Lp(a) is highest in people of African ancestry and lowest in East Asians, but per 50 nmol/L risk increments appear similar across groups, arguing against ancestry-specific thresholds in most clinical contexts [^115E1bGA] [^116gbJqC].

> Next, I should review measurement and standardization challenges because clinical interpretation hinges on assay fidelity. There is no gold standard assay, results are variably reported in mg/dL or nmol/L, and some methods are sensitive to apo(a) isoform size, so isoform-independent assays and reporting in molar units are preferred to reduce misclassification risk [^114f2cNs] [^11215S7e]. Hold on, I should verify LDL-C contamination: cholesterol within Lp(a) accounts for about 30–45% of Lp(a) mass, meaning conventional LDL-C includes Lp(a)-cholesterol and may overestimate true LDL-C in those with high Lp(a); correction formulas exist but show large interindividual variability and are not guideline-endorsed for routine care, so clinical judgment is essential when interpreting "LDL-C" in this setting [^1113TbEL] [^112UxpX6] [^112Y9G4e].

> I need to ensure screening indications are aligned with high-credibility guidance. Measuring Lp(a) at least once in adulthood for selected groups is recommended, especially in those with premature ASCVD, a family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a), suspected or confirmed FH, recurrent events despite optimal LDL-C lowering, intermediate borderline risk needing reclassification, or calcific aortic valve stenosis, recognizing that single measurements are generally sufficient given lifelong stability [^117UYGxr] [^115wxbB2] [^111Rref9]. But wait, what if baseline risk is unclear? In such cases, adjunctive imaging like coronary artery calcium can refine risk, and elevated Lp(a) may act additively with family history and CAC to identify individuals warranting intensified prevention [^115nAcMS].

> Let me consider therapeutic management with currently available options. Among approved agents, PCSK9 inhibitors lower Lp(a) by roughly 20–30% and reduce cardiovascular events, with benefit correlating in part to baseline Lp(a) and degree of reduction, while lipoprotein apheresis achieves larger acute reductions but is invasive and reserved for very high-risk, progressive disease despite maximal therapy [^114f2cNs] [^113GRb1B] [^115wxbB2]. I should double-check therapies that are ineffective or counterproductive: statins minimally affect outcomes in an Lp(a)-specific way and can modestly raise Lp(a), so further statin intensification should be guided by true LDL-C and global risk rather than the Lp(a) level per se, whereas ezetimibe and fibrates have little impact on Lp(a) [^113GRb1B] [^111BtH1R].

> I will now examine emerging targeted therapies and practical algorithms. Antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA directed at apo(a) expression achieve 65–98% reductions in Lp(a) in phase 2–3 trials, with multiple large cardiovascular outcomes trials underway to determine whether selective Lp(a) lowering translates into event reduction, which could reshape practice if positive [^111Rref9] [^113GRb1B]. In the interim, a pragmatic approach is to measure Lp(a) once in indicated adults, intensify comprehensive risk reduction targeting non–HDL-C and other modifiable risks, consider PCSK9 inhibitors for high-risk patients with elevated Lp(a), and reserve apheresis for select, very high-risk cases while monitoring the outcomes literature [^115wxbB2] [^114f2cNs].

> Let me think about risk equivalence and clinical magnitude to contextualize targets. Genetic, apoB-per-particle analyses suggest that an approximately 85 nmol/L higher lifetime Lp(a) exposure confers a similar CHD odds ratio to 1 mmol/L higher lifetime LDL-C, implying that if selective Lp(a) lowering yields proportional risk reductions akin to LDL-C lowering, an 85 nmol/L reduction could translate to roughly a 20–25% relative risk reduction in a 5-year trial, though this extrapolation awaits empirical confirmation [^11662Atq]. I should confirm that epidemiology supports broad prevalence and relevance: about one in five individuals have elevated Lp(a), with levels more common at the high end in certain ancestries, underscoring the population-level importance of testing in appropriate settings [^111Rref9] [^111cQiB3].

> Hold on, I should verify the interplay between Lp(a) and low achieved LDL-C to avoid misinterpretation in practice. Even when statins or PCSK9 inhibitors achieve very low LDL-C, elevated Lp(a) remains associated with higher events, and part of the apparent residual "LDL-C" may actually be Lp(a)-cholesterol; therefore, escalation solely to chase an "LDL-C" target without accounting for Lp(a) content can be misleading and, in some cases, counterproductive if it further increases Lp(a) [^114YnHeg] [^1113TbEL] [^111BtH1R]. Let me reconsider whether inflammation modifies Lp(a)-mediated risk; contemporary data indicate that Lp(a) confers risk independent of hs-CRP strata, suggesting parallel and additive biology rather than a pure inflammatory dependency [^112JHD4x].

> Next, I should review special populations and phenocopies to avoid diagnostic error. Elevated Lp(a) can inflate calculated or directly measured "LDL-C", potentially mimicking familial hypercholesterolemia; measuring Lp(a) can clarify the phenotype and guide cascade screening and management in suspected FH or premature ASCVD families, while recognizing that ApoB-based metrics may better reflect particle number in such cases [^1113TbEL] [^1163UTTo] [^11662Atq]. I need to ensure we acknowledge non-genetic influences: while levels are largely genetic, factors such as estrogen therapy and kidney disease can modulate Lp(a), and dietary saturated fat reduction paradoxically raises Lp(a) despite lowering LDL-C, underscoring the need for precision risk discussions without overinterpreting modest lifestyle-induced Lp(a) shifts [^114niYKc] [^114mQYN6].

> Finally, I will identify knowledge gaps and correct any incomplete statements. No completed outcomes trial has shown that selectively lowering Lp(a) reduces cardiovascular events yet; wait, that sentence in the original trace was truncated, so let me be precise: outcomes trials of apo(a)-targeted agents are ongoing and will test whether potent, selective Lp(a) reduction improves hard endpoints, which is the pivotal missing link for routine, targeted therapy and treatment thresholds beyond risk-informed prevention [^111Rref9] [^113GRb1B]. I should double-check threshold concepts: although risk appears log-linear across the distribution, clinical thresholds like 50 mg/dL and 150 nmol/L are pragmatic tools for decision-making amid assay variability and heterogeneous absolute risk, not hard biological "cut points", and may evolve as assays and outcomes evidence mature [^115E1bGA] [^112Y9G4e].

Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a **genetically determined, independent, and causal risk factor** [^111Rref9] for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), with risk rising continuously across the distribution [^114YnHeg]. About 20% of the global population [^111Rref9] has Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (125 nmol/L), a level associated with higher ASCVD and CAVS risk [^116FAxEM]. Lp(a) risk is **independent of LDL-C** and persists despite LDL-C lowering [^114YnHeg], so testing is recommended at least once in adulthood, especially in those with premature ASCVD, family history, or familial hypercholesterolemia [^111Rref9]. Current therapies have limited effect on Lp(a) [^114f2cNs], but RNA-based agents lowering Lp(a) by > 70% are in trials [^111Rref9]; until then, manage overall risk aggressively and consider PCSK9 inhibitors [^113GRb1B] or apheresis in very high-risk patients [^115wxbB2].

---

## Structure and genetic determinants

- **Structure**: Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with apoB-100 covalently linked to apo(a) [^116FAxEM], which is homologous to plasminogen and confers proatherogenic, proinflammatory, and antifibrinolytic properties [^111Rref9].

- **Genetics**: Lp(a) levels are ~70–90% genetically determined [^116FAxEM], mainly by LPA kringle IV-2 copy number and SNPs; smaller apo(a) isoforms correlate with higher Lp(a) [^114wg62Q].

- **Ethnic variation**: Median Lp(a) levels differ by ancestry [^111Rref9], highest in Black individuals, intermediate in South Asians, and lower in East Asians and Europeans [^113cfHjU].

---

## Epidemiological evidence and clinical associations

- **ASCVD**: Elevated Lp(a) is independently associated with coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease [^115E1bGA], with a log-linear risk relationship [^114YnHeg].

- **CAVS**: High Lp(a) is causally linked to calcific aortic valve stenosis [^111Rref9], supported by genetic and observational data [^116ays5z].

- **Residual risk**: Lp(a) confers risk independent of LDL-C [^1137pjHN] and persists despite intensive LDL-C lowering, including with statins [^114YnHeg].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Lp(a) **promotes atherogenesis** through lipid deposition [^111xsHNy], inflammation [^116FAxEM], and oxidized phospholipids [^114f2cNs]. Apo(a) homology to plasminogen **impairs fibrinolysis**, thereby increasing thrombosis risk [^116FAxEM]. Lp(a) also **drives vascular and valvular calcification**, contributing to CAVS [^111Rref9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Testing**: Measure Lp(a) at least once in adulthood, especially in premature ASCVD [^117UYGxr], family history, or familial hypercholesterolemia [^115wxbB2].

- **Thresholds**: Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (125 nmol/L) is high risk; ≥ 180 mg/dL (430 nmol/L) confers lifetime risk similar to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

- **Management**: Intensify overall risk reduction (LDL-C, blood pressure, lifestyle) [^114f2cNs]; consider PCSK9 inhibitors [^113GRb1B] or apheresis in very high-risk patients [^115wxbB2].

---

## Therapeutic strategies

Current therapies such as statins and ezetimibe have little effect on Lp(a) [^114f2cNs], while **PCSK9 inhibitors reduce Lp(a) by ~20–30%** and reduce events, particularly at higher baseline Lp(a) [^113GRb1B]. Emerging RNA-based therapies (antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA) [^111xsHNy] lower Lp(a) by **> 70%** [^111Rref9] and are in phase 3 outcomes trials [^113GRb1B].

---

## Clinical implications and future directions

Lp(a) testing **refines risk assessment** and guides preventive strategies [^114f2cNs]. Research needs include standardized assays, harmonized guidelines, and **outcomes trials of Lp(a)-lowering therapies** [^116FAxEM].

---

Elevated Lp(a) is a **causal, independent risk factor** for ASCVD and CAVS [^111Rref9], with risk independent of LDL-C [^114YnHeg]; testing and aggressive risk management are recommended, and RNA-based therapies may soon enable targeted Lp(a) lowering [^111Rref9].

- **Epidemiological evidence linking Lp(a) to cardiovascular risk**: Robust epidemiological, Mendelian randomization, and genome-wide association studies have established elevated Lp(a) as an independent and causal risk factor for ASCVD and CAVD. Early studies focusing on White European populations first identified the association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular risk. Subsequent large-scale, multiethnic cohorts have confirmed these findings across diverse populations, highlighting the global relevance of elevated Lp(a).

Investigators from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study evaluated over 13,000 Black and White participants in the United States and demonstrated that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and overall CVD events. The Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Dallas Heart Study (DHS) demonstrated that White, Black, Hispanic, and Chinese Americans with elevated Lp(a) levels had a significantly higher incidence of CHD and CVD events, independent of traditional risk factors. The case-control INTERHEART study further demonstrated that while elevated Lp(a) levels confer cardiovascular risk across multiple ethnic groups, the absolute risk varies due to differences in Lp(a) distribution and the prevalence of other risk factors.

In addition to atherosclerotic disease, Lp(a) has emerged as an important risk factor for CAVD. The Copenhagen General Population Study provided compelling evidence linking elevated Lp(a) levels to increased risk of aortic valve stenosis.

### Independence of lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: A participant-level meta-analysis [^114YnHeg]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels are independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, the relationship between Lp(a) level, LDL-C level, and ASCVD risk at different thresholds is not well defined.

- **Methods**: A participant-level meta-analysis of 27,658 participants enrolled in six placebo-controlled statin trials was performed to assess the association of LDL-C and Lp(a) levels with the risk of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease events, stroke, or any coronary or carotid revascularization (ASCVD). The multivariable-adjusted association between baseline Lp(a) level and ASCVD risk was modeled continuously using generalized additive models. The association between baseline LDL-C level and ASCVD risk by baseline Lp(a) level was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The joint association between Lp(a) level and statin-achieved LDL-C level with ASCVD risk was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models.

- **Results**: Compared with an Lp(a) level of 5 mg/dL, increasing levels of Lp(a) were log-linearly associated with ASCVD risk in statin- and placebo-treated patients. Among statin-treated individuals, those with Lp(a) level > 50 mg/dL (≈125 nmol/L) had increased risk across all quartiles of achieved LDL-C level and absolute change in LDL-C level. Even among those with the lowest quartile of achieved LDL-C level (3.1–77.0 mg/dL), those with Lp(a) level > 50 mg/dL had greater ASCVD risk (hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.06–1.79]) than those with Lp(a) level ≤ 50 mg/dL.

### Existing and emerging strategies to lower lipoprotein(a) [^113GRb1B]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

Abundant evidence links elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) to higher cardiovascular risk, leaving clinicians with the challenge of what measures to take to mitigate Lp(a)-associated risk. Some therapies that may reduce cardiovascular risk, such as aspirin, statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe, have little effect on Lp(a) and, in some cases, may even increase its concentration. Other agents that reduce levels of Lp(a), such as niacin or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have neutral or only slightly favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes.

The only currently available therapeutic approaches that lower Lp(a) and reduce cardiovascular risk are PCSK9 inhibitors and lipoprotein apheresis. For PCSK9 inhibitors, the magnitude of clinical benefit is associated with the baseline level of Lp(a) and appears to be associated with the degree of Lp(a) reduction. Antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA agents targeting apolipoprotein(a) have the potential to reduce circulating Lp(a) concentrations by more than 70%. The results of cardiovascular outcomes trials will determine whether such substantial reductions in Lp(a) are associated with meaningful clinical benefit.

### Lipoprotein(a) is not related to markers of insulin resistance in pregnancy [^113jzLon]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

It would be logical to assume that Lp(a), as a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), may be influenced by or may influence other known risk factors such as dyslipidemia or glucose intolerance. For example, blood glucose was correlated with the risk of coronary heart disease in the Framingham Offspring Study and was found to be an independent predictor for cardiovascular mortality. However, there was no significant correlation between Lp(a) and glycemic biomarkers, such as fasting glucose, A1C, and AUCg, in our study group, which is in agreement with the findings from at least two other studies. Small case studies showed a positive correlation between Lp(a) and HDL-C, and a negative correlation between Lp(a) and triglycerides (TG). In contrast, a low correlation between Lp(a) and lipids has been shown previously in a large prospective study of Lp(a) concentration and the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in initially healthy US women. Similarly, Lp(a) did not show a significant correlation with other serum lipids in our study group, although we observed a significant positive relationship with LDL-C. This might be explained because LDL-C is included in the cholesterol contained in Lp(a) particles. The lack of correlation between Lp(a) and parameters of glycemia and lipid metabolism is not surprising given that systemic Lp(a) concentrations are highly genetically determined, and only a few environmental or physiological factors have been shown to influence serum Lp(a) levels.

Consistent with data from others, our women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) showed slightly lower levels of LDL-C than women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). However, in this study, LDL-C postpartum levels…

### Lp(a) (lipoprotein[a]) concentrations and incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: New insights from a large national biobank [^115E1bGA]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). High credibility.

Lp(a) (lipoprotein[a]) concentrations are associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and new therapies that enable potent and specific reduction are in development. In the largest study conducted at the time of writing, we address three areas of uncertainty:

- **Magnitude and shape of ASCVD risk**: The risk conferred across the distribution of lipoprotein(a) concentrations was examined. The relationship between lipoprotein(a) and ASCVD was studied in 460,506 middle-aged UK Biobank participants. Over a median follow-up of 11.2 years, incident ASCVD occurred in 22,401 (4.9%) participants. The median lipoprotein(a) concentration was 19.6 nmol/L (25th-75th percentile, 7.6–74.8). The relationship appeared linear across the distribution, with a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.10–1.12) per 50 nmol/L increment.

- **Variation across racial and clinical subgroups**: Substantial differences in concentrations were noted according to race. Median values for white, South Asian, black, and Chinese individuals were 19, 31, 75, and 16 nmol/L, respectively. However, the risk per 50 nmol/L increment appeared similar, with hazard ratios of 1.11, 1.10, and 1.07 for white, South Asian, and black individuals, respectively.

- **Clinical importance of a high lipoprotein(a) threshold**: A high concentration, defined as ≥ 150 nmol/L, was present in 12.2% of those without and 20.3% of those with preexisting ASCVD. It was associated with hazard ratios of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.44–1.56) and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05–1.27), respectively.

### Lipoprotein(a) genotype influences the clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia [^1163UTTo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Our results highlight the importance of measuring lipoprotein(a) to perform the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) appropriately and to exclude the possibility that the observed phenotype is driven by elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) before performing the genetic test that is often requested based on the presence of elevated LDL‐C levels.

Clinical and laboratory investigations for differentiating FH, elevated lipoprotein(a), or the combination of both are also important for accurate risk stratification and treatment strategies, as in the future, patients with both elevated lipoprotein(a) and FH conditions may be shown to benefit from interventions to reduce both LDL‐C and lipoprotein(a) plasma levels.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^114ShmcG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025).

While universal testing may be ideal, targeted testing remains a pragmatic approach in most clinical settings. The following groups should be prioritized for Lp(a) measurement:

- **Individuals with premature ASCVD**: Premature ASCVD, defined as cardiovascular events occurring before age 55 years in men and 65 years in women, points to possible underlying genetic contributors, including elevated Lp(a). In these individuals, Lp(a) measurement may uncover a risk factor that may not be addressed by standard lipid-lowering therapies alone.

- **Family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a)**: Given the strong heritability of Lp(a) levels, first-degree relatives of individuals with premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a) should undergo testing. Cascade screening in such families can identify at-risk individuals before the onset of clinical disease, allowing for early intervention.

- **Recurrent ASCVD despite optimal LDL-lowering therapy**: Patients with less than expected response to statins or who continue to experience cardiovascular events despite achieving low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) targets may have residual risk driven by elevated Lp(a). In such cases, Lp(a) measurement can inform the need for more aggressive secondary preventive strategies.

- **Patients with suspected or confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: Lp(a) elevation is common among individuals with FH and may contribute to the observed variability in cardiovascular risk within this group. Identifying elevated Lp(a) in these patients can help stratify risk.

### Non-genetic influences on lipoprotein(a) concentrations [^114mQYN6]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

An elevated level of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically regulated, independent, causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the extensive variability in Lp(a) levels between individuals and population groups cannot be fully explained by genetic factors, emphasizing a potential role for non-genetic factors. In this review, we provide an overview of evidence on non-genetic factors influencing Lp(a) levels with a particular focus on diet, physical activity, hormones, and certain pathological conditions.

- **Diet**: Findings from randomized controlled clinical trials show that diets lower in saturated fats modestly influence Lp(a) levels, often in the opposing direction to LDL cholesterol.

- **Physical activity**: Results from studies on physical activity and exercise have been inconsistent, ranging from no to minimal or moderate change in Lp(a) levels. This can potentially be modulated by age and the type, intensity, and duration of the exercise modality.

- **Hormones**: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women lowers Lp(a) levels, with oral HRT being more effective than transdermal estradiol. The type of HRT, dose of estrogen, and addition of progestogen do not modify the Lp(a)-lowering effect of HRT.

- **Kidney diseases**: Kidney diseases result in marked elevations in Lp(a) levels, although these are dependent on disease stages, dialysis modalities, and apolipoprotein(a) phenotypes.

In contrast, Lp(a) levels are reduced in liver diseases in parallel with disease progression. Although population studies have yielded conflicting results, there is evident association between Lp(a) levels and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertriglyceridemia, specifically with respect to lipoprotein levels, the ES 2012 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of ApoB or lipoprotein A levels, whereas the measurement of other apolipoprotein levels has little clinical value.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, specifically concerning lipoprotein(a), the CCS 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of lipoprotein(a) levels to refine risk assessment in patients with an intermediate Framingham Risk Score or a family history of premature coronary artery disease.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^115nAcMS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Risk assessment and management of individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are actionable. Individuals with elevated Lp(a) may benefit from additional risk assessment, including a detailed family history and selective use of subclinical atherosclerosis imaging. A family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a first-degree relative (17%) and elevated Lp(a) (25%) are independently associated with an increased risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) over a 20-year follow-up, with those having both experiencing the highest risk (43%). Therefore, risk attributable to a family history of CHD and elevated Lp(a) appears to be additive, and clinicians should strive to assess such risk, especially among those with elevated Lp(a). These efforts may also facilitate cascade screening. In addition to family history, measurement of subclinical atherosclerosis burden may be helpful to guide risk assessment among individuals with elevated Lp(a) who do not have clinical ASCVD.

Among individuals without prior myocardial infarction or stroke, the measurement of coronary artery calcium (CAC) provides further granularity to understanding risk for those with elevated Lp(a), as CAC and Lp(a) are independently associated with ASCVD. Compared to persons without elevated Lp(a) and absence of CAC, Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL is associated with a 29% higher risk of ASCVD, whereas CAC 1–99 Agatston Units (AU) and ≥ 100 AU are associated with a 68% and 2.7-fold higher ASCVD risk, respectively. When assessed concurrently, there is a 4.7-fold higher risk.

### Non-genetic influences on lipoprotein(a) concentrations [^113jkNr2]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

The evidence on non-genetic influences on Lp(a) concentration indicates a potential role for diet, hormones, and liver and kidney diseases. In particular, strong consistent evidence suggests an impact on Lp(a) concentration by reducing dietary saturated fat intake, sex hormones, hormone replacement therapies, kidney diseases, and treatment modalities.

In contrast, more data is needed to firmly establish any potential role for physical activity/exercise and certain liver diseases in influencing Lp(a) concentration. The use of well-standardized assay methods for Lp(a) measurement is of paramount importance for studying non-genetic influences on Lp(a). Additional factors of consideration include large, sufficiently powered sample sizes and potential confounders, including but not limited to race/ethnicity, metabolic status, and genetic variability.

Research to elucidate mechanisms underlying the changes in Lp(a) concentration and the modulation of Lp(a) properties beyond its plasma level will help improve our understanding of non-genetic influences on Lp(a). Finally, the clinical significance of the changes in Lp(a) concentration and its risk-mediating properties due to non-genetic factors, including lifestyle interventions, remains to be seen.

### Lipoprotein(a) and diet-a challenge for a role of saturated fat in cardiovascular disease risk reduction [^114niYKc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

In this perspective, we discuss new evidence relating to dietary recommendations to reduce saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake to modulate an individual's global risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although it is well established that lowering dietary SFA intake has a beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol concentrations, findings increasingly indicate an opposite effect on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. In recent years, many studies have firmly established a role for an elevated Lp(a) concentration as a genetically regulated, causal, and prevalent risk factor for CVD. However, there is less awareness of the effect of dietary SFA intake on Lp(a) concentrations. This study discusses this issue and highlights the contrasting effect of reducing dietary SFA intake on LDL cholesterol and Lp(a), two highly atherogenic lipoproteins. This calls attention to the need for precision nutrition approaches that move beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach. To illustrate the contrast, we describe the dynamic contributions of Lp(a) and LDL cholesterol concentrations to CVD risk during interventions with a low-SFA diet, with the hope that this will stimulate further studies and discussions regarding dietary management of CVD risk.

### Lipoprotein(a) and cardiovascular disease [^111Rref9]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

One in five people are at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis due to high lipoprotein(a). Lipoprotein(a) concentrations are lowest in people from East Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia, intermediate in people from South Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, and highest in people from Africa. Concentrations are more than 90% genetically determined and 17% higher in post-menopausal women than in men.

Individuals at a higher cardiovascular risk should have lipoprotein(a) concentrations measured once in their lifetime to inform those with high concentrations to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and receive medication to lower other cardiovascular risk factors. With no approved drugs to lower lipoprotein(a) concentrations, it is promising that at least five drugs in development lower concentrations by 65–98%, with three currently being tested in large cardiovascular endpoint trials.

- **Historical perspectives, physiology, and pathophysiology**: This review covers these topics to provide context for understanding lipoprotein(a).
- **Genetic evidence of causality, epidemiology, role in familial hypercholesterolaemia, and diabetes**: These aspects are explored to highlight the importance of lipoprotein(a) in various health conditions.
- **Management, screening, diagnosis, measurement, prevention, and future lipoprotein(a)-lowering drugs**: The review outlines strategies and emerging therapies aimed at reducing lipoprotein(a) levels and mitigating cardiovascular risk.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^114wg62Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Most individuals (> 80%) express two different apolipoprotein(a) isoforms, inherited from each parent, which contribute to lipoprotein(a) levels in a codominant manner. The kringle IV-2 encoding domain of each apolipoprotein(a) allele can include from 2 to > 40 repeats, with each kringle IV-2 encoding repeat being 5.6 kb in size. A general inverse correlation has been observed between apolipoprotein(a) isoform size and plasma lipoprotein(a) levels, whereby smaller isoform sizes are associated with higher levels.

Median lipoprotein(a) concentrations are 4 to 5 times higher in individuals with small apolipoprotein(a) isoforms (< 22 kringle IV repeats) than those with only large isoforms (≥ 22 kringle IV repeats). However, as previously discussed, the contribution of apo(a) isoform size to observed plasma lipoprotein(a) levels varies by up to 80% among individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. The strength of the inverse correlation between isoform size and concentration appears stronger in European and Asian individuals compared with those of African descent.

Population studies suggest that 61% to 69% versus 19% to 44% of the variance in lipoprotein(a) levels can be explained by this inverse correlation with apolipoprotein(a) isoform size in individuals of European descent versus African descent, respectively. Larger apolipoprotein(a) isoforms are less likely to be expressed in individuals of European descent compared with those of African descent, with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) thought to play a significant but varying role.

### Lipoprotein(a) and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with or without baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113LSAPs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, whether the optimal Lp(a) threshold for risk assessment should differ based on baseline ASCVD status is unknown.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to assess the association between Lp(a) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with and without baseline ASCVD.

- **Methods**: We studied a retrospective cohort of patients with Lp(a) measured at two medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts, from 2000 to 2019. To assess the association of Lp(a) with incident MACE — including nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular mortality — Lp(a) percentile groups were generated with the reference group set at the first to 50th Lp(a) percentiles. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the association of Lp(a) percentile group with MACE.

- **Results**: Overall, 16,419 individuals were analyzed with a median follow-up of 11.9 years. Among the 10,181 (62%) patients with baseline ASCVD, individuals in the 71st to 90th percentile group had a 21% increased hazard of MACE (adjusted HR: 1.21; P < 0.001), which was similar to that of individuals in the 91st to 100th percentile group (adjusted HR: 1.26; P < 0.001). Among the 6,238 individuals without established ASCVD, there was a continuously higher hazard of MACE with increasing Lp(a), and individuals in the 91st to 100th Lp(a) percentile group had the highest relative risk with an adjusted HR of 1.93 (P < 0.001).

### Lipoprotein(a), c-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention populations [^112JHD4x]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a putative causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). There are conflicting data as to whether Lp(a) may increase cardiovascular risk only in the presence of concomitant inflammation.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether Lp(a) is associated with cardiovascular risk independent of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in both primary and secondary prevention populations.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This cohort study uses data from three distinct cohorts, including one population-based cohort and two randomized clinical trials. Participants included individuals from the UK Biobank (data from 2006–2010) without prevalent ASCVD, participants in the FOURIER (TIMI 59) trial (data from 2013–2017) who had baseline Lp(a) and hs-CRP data, and participants in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial (data from 2010–2013) who had prevalent ASCVD and baseline values for Lp(a) and hs-CRP. The data analysis took place from November 2022 to November 2023.

- **Exposure**: Baseline plasma Lp(a), considered either as a continuous variable or dichotomized at 125 nmol/L.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which includes a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or ischemic stroke, along with the individual MACE components and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

- **Results**: Among 357,220 individuals in the UK Biobank without prevalent ASCVD, 232,699 (65%) had low hs-CRP (< 2 mg/L), and 124,521 (35%) had high hs-CRP (≥ 2 mg/L) values. In a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for ASCVD risk factors, higher Lp(a) was associated with…

### Lipoprotein(a) and ethnicities [^113cfHjU]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

The initial studies focusing on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and its role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were conducted exclusively in Whites. Over the last four decades, multiple large-scale, independent investigations have established clear race/ethnic differences in plasma Lp(a) concentration and population distribution. Blacks have the highest Lp(a) level of all race/ethnic groups studied, followed by South Asians, Whites, Hispanics, and East Asians. The mechanisms underlying these differences have been explored, and genetics plays an important role in providing insights into the observed differences.

The association of elevated Lp(a) level with cardiovascular disease risk in different race/ethnic groups has also been studied. These studies show that, in general, elevated Lp(a) level is associated with cardiovascular risk in all groups. However, given the race/ethnic differences in Lp(a) level and distribution, finding an appropriate Lp(a) threshold that predicts risk, meaningfully categorizes risk among individuals, and guides preventive therapy use has been challenging.

In this review, we discuss the available evidence regarding race/ethnic differences in Lp(a) and the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, the association of Lp(a) with cardiovascular risk in various race/ethnic groups and the nuances of identifying the appropriate Lp(a) threshold are discussed. Key points on Lp(a) and ethnicities are described in Box 1.

### Lipoprotein(a) and diet-a challenge for a role of saturated fat in cardiovascular disease risk reduction [^1155GgaT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

The role of dietary modification in reducing cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality has been a focus of studies for many years, going back to the Seven Countries Study. Although the reduction of the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) has been robustly associated with lower LDL cholesterol concentrations and decreased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, there has been uncertainty regarding the optimal replacement strategy for SFA. However, given the consistent lowering effect of LDL cholesterol by reducing SFA intake, recent observations that this same intervention strategy resulted in an increase in lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations are noteworthy.

Lp(a) was initially identified by Berg as a factor present in an LDL fraction used to immunize rabbits around the time when diet modification was shown to affect CVD risk. The discovery of the molecular structure, using protein sequencing and cDNA cloning, of apo(a) — the unique structural component of Lp(a) — identified the homology of apo(a) to plasminogen. This led to improvements in Lp(a) assessment methods and the characterization of the importance of apo(a) size variability as a major genetic regulator of Lp(a) concentrations.

Elevated Lp(a) concentrations have identified individuals at high risk of CVD. More recent studies identified molecular components of Lp(a) as having potential atherogenic importance, such as oxidized phospholipids, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. Targeted interventions to lower Lp(a) concentrations, and their effect on CVD risk, are currently being tested in clinical studies.

### Lipoprotein(a) and coronary calcification: Prognostic implications in rotational atherectomy patients [^112Eh2t4]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations have long been associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). However, the relationship between Lp(a) and clinical outcomes in patients with severe coronary calcifications undergoing rotational atherectomy (RA) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the prognostic implications of Lp(a) in patients with calcified coronary lesions after RA.

- **Methods**: Data from 494 consecutive patients undergoing RA were retrospectively collected. Lp(a) levels were stratified into two categories: < 50 mg/dL and ≥ 50 mg/dL. Outcomes included MACE and cardiovascular death (CVD).

- **Results**: Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of MACE in patients with Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (log-rank p = 0.006), but no significant difference was observed in the incidence of CVD (log-rank p = 0.062). We applied the minimum p-value method and identified an optimal threshold of 68.3 mg/dL for CVD, further validated by survival analysis (log-rank p = 0.02). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed Lp(a) remained an independent risk factor for MACE after adjusting for confounders. Age, hemodialysis, complications, and heart failure were common risk factors for both MACE and CVD. Subgroup analysis indicated that Lp(a) predicted higher MACE risk in smokers and patients with comorbidities.

- **Conclusion**: In patients with severe calcification undergoing RA, Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL was independently associated with MACE but not with CVD, except when Lp(a) was markedly elevated (≥ 68.3 mg/dL). Additionally, Lp(a) was found to predict higher MACE risk in specific patient subgroups.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^11215S7e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The objectives of this narrative review are threefold. First, we discuss underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that make Lp(a) a potent contributor to cardiovascular risk. Second, we explore the landscape of Lp(a) measurement, including available assay techniques, standardization efforts, and interpretation of results, with a particular focus on addressing the ongoing challenges in clinical application. Third, we outline recommendations regarding who should undergo Lp(a) testing, incorporating insights from recent clinical practice guidelines. By synthesizing the latest data, this review seeks to inform clinicians and provide practical guidance on integrating Lp(a) measurement into routine cardiovascular risk assessment. Lastly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting Lp(a), underscoring their potential to reshape clinical practice in the future.

- **Pathophysiological role**: Lp(a) is a structurally unique lipoprotein particle consisting of an LDL-like core (apolipoprotein-B-100) that is attached to apo(a) via a disulfide bond. Although both LDL and Lp(a) contain one apolipoprotein-B (ApoB) molecule, Lp(a) does not bind to LDL receptors with the same affinity as LDL due to the steric interference of the apo(a) moiety on Lp(a). Additionally, apo(a) alters the shape of ApoB, which may decrease binding to the LDL receptor. Decreased uptake by the LDL receptor and the presence of oxidized phospholipids on the apo(a) moiety contribute to an approximately six-fold higher atherogenicity for Lp(a) compared to LDL.

### Lipoprotein(a) concentration and risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes [^117FXVdd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal risk factor for cardiovascular diseases with no established therapy. The attribute of Lp(a) that affects cardiovascular risk is not established. Low levels of Lp(a) have been associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

- **Objectives**: This study investigated whether cardiovascular risk is conferred by Lp(a) molar concentration or apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] size, and whether the relationship between Lp(a) and T2D risk is causal.

- **Methods**: This was a case-control study of 143,087 Icelanders with genetic information, including 17,715 with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 8,734 with T2D. The study used measured and genetically imputed Lp(a) molar concentration, kringle IV type 2 (KIV-2) repeats (which determine apo(a) size), and a splice variant in LPA associated with small apo(a) but low Lp(a) molar concentration to disentangle the relationship between Lp(a) and cardiovascular risk. Loss-of-function homozygotes and other subjects genetically predicted to have low Lp(a) levels were evaluated to assess the relationship between Lp(a) and T2D.

- **Results**: Lp(a) molar concentration was associated dose-dependently with CAD risk, peripheral artery disease, aortic valve stenosis, heart failure, and lifespan. Lp(a) molar concentration fully explained the Lp(a) association with CAD, and there was no residual association with apo(a) size. Homozygous carriers of loss-of-function mutations had little or no Lp(a) and increased the risk of T2D.

- **Conclusions**: Molar concentration is the attribute of Lp(a) that affects the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^112srr6t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

It is well documented that lipoprotein(a) levels are largely controlled at the stage of biosynthesis rather than the catabolism of the particle. A potential mechanism to explain the inverse association between apolipoprotein(a) isoform size and lipoprotein(a) concentration is based on decreased residency time of smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoforms in the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in decreased susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation and more efficient maturation of smaller apolipoprotein(a) proteins. This correlates with increased hepatic secretion of smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoforms and higher susceptibility of larger apolipoprotein(a) proteins to endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation, resulting in reduced secretion of larger apolipoprotein(a) isoforms.

- **Gene: Polymorphisms and splicing**: Recently, it has been shown that there are complex relationships between the genetic factors affecting lipoprotein(a) levels. This includes, for example, that modulation of the contribution of allele size to lipoprotein(a) levels is modified by many functional SNPs over the entire range of LPA allele frequencies, as well as interactions of SNPs with other SNPs and with short tandem repeats. Several loss‐of‐function SNPs have been identified within the LPA gene locus, such as the null alleles rs41272114 and rs143431368, which are caused by splice site mutations.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^1113TbEL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the cornerstone in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. LDL-C is used as a screening test, diagnostic marker for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), target of therapy for diet, drugs, and apheresis, and goal for adequate care in the outpatient clinic, after hospital discharge and in clinical guidelines. It is generally accepted that the laboratory measure "LDL-C" is an accurate representation of what is being measured. However, because of methodological limitations, all available clinical methods that measure and report "LDL-C" are affected by the presence of the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]-C). This includes all methods of calculated or measured "LDL-C", including the Friedewald formula, ultracentrifugation, or direct LDL-C methods. The main reason for this is the inability to separate low-density lipoprotein from lipoprotein(a) particles and quantify cholesterol content separately on these particles.

Lipoprotein(a) is composed of apolipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B-100, cholesteryl esters, free cholesterol, phospholipids, and carbohydrates on apolipoprotein(a). Based on observations from multiple laboratories with expertise in lipoprotein(a) biochemical analyses, the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) constitutes approximately 30% to 45% of total lipoprotein(a) mass. This implies that if lipoprotein(a) mass levels are low (e.g. < 10 mg/dL), the contribution of Lp(a)-C to plasma LDL-C is small (< 5 mg/dL). However, if lipoprotein(a) mass is high (e.g. 150 mg/dL)…

### Lipoprotein(a) is elevated and inversely related to coronary endothelial function in people with HIV [^116VJgPP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

As HIV has transitioned from a progressive fatal disease to a chronic condition with increased adoption of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV‐associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) is becoming an increasingly important source of morbidity and mortality. People with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death compared with individuals without HIV. Notably, the excess CVD risk in PWH persists even after controlling for traditional risk factors. The mechanisms underlying this residual risk remain incompletely understood; however, chronic inflammation associated with HIV infection has been implicated as an important driver of coronary atherosclerosis in PWH.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), a low‐density lipoprotein–like particle containing apolipoprotein B covalently linked to a carbohydrate‐rich protein termed apolipoprotein(a), has emerged as a powerful predictor of CVD in the general population, independent of traditional risk factors. Plasma Lp(a) concentration is predominantly genetically determined, with higher levels observed in Black adults and women. Interestingly, Lp(a) concentrations are also influenced by states of acute and chronic inflammation. HIV infection is characterized by immune dysregulation and inflammation, which persists despite viral suppression with ART. Few studies, most originating from WIHS (Women's Interagency HIV Study), have studied Lp(a) levels in PWH, and the relationship between Lp(a) and coronary atherosclerotic disease in HIV remains unknown.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a risk factor associated with ischemic heart disease: Ouro Preto study [^114PLyRE]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, literature has been controversial in confirming its role as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the association between serum levels of Lp(a) and ischemic heart disease, as well as other cardiovascular risk factors, in a population-based study conducted on a local cohort of the Brazilian population.

Lp(a) serum levels were measured in 400 individuals selected from a larger sample of a population survey carried out in Ouro Preto, a city in the southeast of Brazil. Lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, anthropometric, and clinical parameters were analyzed. Lp(a) levels were significantly associated with the presence of ischemic heart disease. In relation to other cardiovascular risk factors, it was verified that Lp(a) levels were statistically associated with age, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and percentage of body fat determined by bioelectric impedance. Lp(a) was also highly associated with the Framingham risk score (p = 0.003).

In a multivariate analysis, two significant interactions were revealed: one involving ischemic heart disease, sex, and age, and another associating ischemic heart disease, age, and total cholesterol. In summary, in the present analysis, Lp(a) serum levels were correlated with the occurrence of ischemic heart disease and other cardiovascular risk factors.

### High-density lipoprotein revisited: Biological functions and clinical relevance [^117PkJ2m]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Taken together, HDL is a dynamic multifaceted lipoprotein that can serve several physiological roles, most of which have been preserved throughout evolution for reasons other than protection from atherosclerosis. Clinically, low HDL-C remains a strong and important risk marker for increased risk of ASCVD, likely due to the inverse association with increased levels of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins. For patients with extremely high HDL-C, the documented increased risk of infectious disease and all-cause mortality should inform patients and doctors alike of the possible negative prognostic consequences of high HDL-C. Finally, the observed increased risk of AMD observationally and genetically, for any increase in HDL levels, is of concern. Future efforts to pharmacologically modulate HDL should likely focus on functional metrics of HDL function rather than HDL-C and other clinical indications besides ASCVD.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^114iv3wR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the critical need for accurate and individualized risk assessment strategies. Traditional cardiovascular risk calculators that incorporate risk factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and diabetes have significantly advanced population-level risk prediction. However, these calculators often fall short in identifying high-risk individuals who lack traditional risk factors.

In this context, cardiovascular biomarkers have emerged as important tools that improve risk stratification and guide personalized therapeutic interventions while providing deeper insights into pathophysiological mechanisms. Biomarkers can not only help identify at-risk individuals but also enable early disease detection and adverse outcome prognostication, and may even serve as therapeutic targets. As the paradigm of clinical care shifts towards precision medicine, the role of biomarkers in refining risk prediction and guiding treatment strategies has become increasingly prominent.

Among the vast array of cardiovascular biomarkers, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] stands out as a unique and often under-recognized causal risk factor. Structurally, Lp(a) is comprised of an LDL-like particle that is covalently bound to apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which confers distinct proatherogenic, proinflammatory, and antifibrinolytic properties. Unlike traditional lipid and lipoprotein parameters, Lp(a) levels are predominantly genetically determined and remain relatively stable throughout.

### Lipoprotein(a) is markedly more atherogenic than LDL: An apolipoprotein B-based genetic analysis [^11662Atq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

By employing apoB as a common denominator in assessing the relationship of Lp(a) versus LDL to risk, we have potentially overcome several limitations. First, apoB assays are well standardized and less susceptible to bias than those for Lp(a). Second, apoB is relatively uniform in protein structure between individuals. Third, since there is one mole of apoB per mole of Lp(a) or LDL, apoB-based odds ratios can be translated directly to per-particle risk.

A further consideration in estimating the impact of a given degree of Lp(a) lowering on CHD risk is how to map lifelong risk of higher Lp(a) (and conversely the lifelong benefit of a lower concentration) onto the timescale of a typical clinical trial. A 1 mmol/L higher lifetime LDL-C is expected to result in a CHD odds ratio of 1.54, which translates into a 22% risk reduction within the context of a 5-year clinical trial.

Here, we estimated that an 85 nmol/L (around 40 mg/dL) higher lifetime Lp(a) results in a CHD odds ratio of 1.54. Thus, if drug-induced Lp(a)-lowering reduces risk in the same manner as LDL-C does, a lowering of 85 nmol/L Lp(a) is expected to decrease CHD risk by 22% within a 5-year clinical trial.

Our findings indicate that Lp(a) is indeed a highly atherogenic lipoprotein. The basis for this heightened atherogenic effect on CHD risk is not yet clear. It may be due, among other mechanisms, to the high content of oxidized phospholipids on Lp(a) that may stimulate inflammatory pathways involved in atherosclerosis or to the structural similarity of apo(a) to plasminogen and hence its possible effects on related pathways.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham Heart Study [^116khWRS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease but is not measured in routine clinical care. Screening for high lipoprotein(a) in individuals with moderate elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods and results**: We examined 2,606 Framingham Offspring participants (median age, 54 years; 45% men) prospectively with a median follow-up of 15 years (n = 392 incident cardiovascular events). Individuals with higher (≥ 100 nmol/L) versus lower lipoprotein(a) were divided into groups based on LDL-C < 135 mg/dL versus ≥ 135 mg/dL. In Cox models, after adjustment for known risk factors, high lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL were each significant predictors of cardiovascular disease [LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL: hazard ratio (HR), 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006; high lipoprotein(a): HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026].

	- **Risk analysis by groups**: Across the groups of high/low lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL or < 135 mg/dL, the absolute cardiovascular disease risks at 15 years were 22.6% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 248), 17.3% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 758), 12.7% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 275), and 11.5% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 1,328, reference group). Among individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, those with high lipoprotein(a) had a 43% higher risk (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.02). Presence of high lipoprotein(a) with moderate LDL-C levels (135–159 mg/dL) yielded absolute risks equivalent to those with lower levels.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^111BtH1R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Many physicians aim to achieve an "LDL-C" < 70 mg/dL for high-risk patients, a target further supported by guidelines. Thus, many patients with "LDL-C" ≥ 70 mg/dL and elevated lipoprotein(a) while on statin therapy actually have true LDL-C significantly lower than 70 mg/dL. The recommendation to further increase LDL-C–lowering therapy in such patients may not accurately reflect whether true LDL-C versus lipoprotein(a) indicates additional residual risk. Statins tend to increase lipoprotein(a); therefore, further increase in statin dosage in a patient with already true low LDL-C may be counterproductive.

In patients being treated with PCSK9 inhibitors that achieve exceedingly low LDL-C (i.e. < 20 mg/dL), true LDL-C levels may be at or near zero if lipoprotein(a) is elevated, a suggestion we recently made.

Should lipoprotein(a) mass and/or cholesterol content be part of the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) diagnosis? Using a more accurate measurement of LDL-C would result in many subjects not meeting the criterion of "LDL-C" ≥ 190 mg/dL used in many scores unless Lp(a)-C was included in the measurement. The concept of formally including lipoprotein(a) in the diagnosis of FH is consistent with studies showing a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if patients with FH have concomitantly elevated lipoprotein(a) levels.

The meta-analysis included a wide range of patients receiving different statins, reflecting their use in various cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention cohorts. Accurately quantifying true LDL-C without its content of Lp(a)-C is essential.

### Lipoprotein(a): A risk factor for atherosclerosis and an emerging therapeutic target [^114f2cNs]. Heart (2022). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a complex circulating lipoprotein, and increasing evidence has demonstrated its role as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and as a possible therapeutic target. The atherogenic effects of Lp(a) are attributed to several potential mechanisms in addition to cholesterol accumulation in the arterial wall, including proinflammatory effects mainly mediated by oxidized phospholipids. Several studies have found a causal and independent relationship between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, several studies also suggest a causal association between Lp(a) levels and calcific aortic valve stenosis.

Available lipid-lowering agents have at best a moderate impact on Lp(a) levels. Among available therapies, antibody proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are the most effective in reducing Lp(a). Potent Lp(a)-lowering treatments that target LPA expression are under development.

- **Measurement challenges**: Lp(a) level measurement poses challenges due to the absence of a definitive reference method and the reporting of Lp(a) values as molar (nanomoles per litre (nmol/L)) or mass concentrations (milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL)) by different assays.

Currently, Lp(a) measurement is recommended to refine cardiovascular risk in specific clinical settings. This includes individuals with a family history of premature ASCVD, patients with ASCVD not explained by standard risk factors, or those with recurrent events despite optimal management of traditional risk factors. Patients with high Lp(a) levels should be managed more intensively.

### Independence of lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: A participant-level meta-analysis [^1137pjHN]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

In this meta-analysis of statin trials, Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were independent and additive cardiovascular risk factors, and potent LDL-C level reduction did not offset Lp(a)-mediated risk. Our findings emphasize the need for testing and incorporation of Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessment. Future trials will elucidate the role of targeted Lp(a) therapeutics for cardiovascular risk reduction in the context of LDL-C levels.

### Phenotypic characterization of genetically lowered human lipoprotein(a) levels [^116ays5z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Genomic analyses have suggested that the LPA gene and its associated plasma biomarker, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), represent a causal risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, lowering Lp(a) levels has emerged as a therapeutic strategy. Beyond target identification, human genetics may contribute to the development of new therapies by defining the full spectrum of beneficial and adverse consequences and by developing a dose-response curve of target perturbation.

- **Objectives**: The goal of this study was to establish the full phenotypic impact of LPA gene variation and to estimate a dose-response curve between genetically altered plasma Lp(a) and risk for CHD.

- **Methods**: We leveraged genetic variants at the LPA gene from three data sources: individual-level data from 112,338 participants in the U.K. Biobank; summary association results from large-scale genome-wide association studies; and LPA gene sequencing results from case subjects with CHD and control subjects free of CHD.

- **Results**: One SD genetically lowered Lp(a) level was associated with a 29% lower risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.73), a 31% lower risk of peripheral vascular disease (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.80), a 13% lower risk of stroke (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.96), a 17% lower risk of heart failure (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.94), and a 37% lower risk of aortic stenosis (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.83). We observed no association with 31 other disorders, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. Variants that led to gain of LPA gene function increased the associated risks.

### Lp(a) - an overlooked risk factor [^111cQiB3]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an increasingly discussed and studied risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis. Many genetic and epidemiological studies support the important causal role that Lp(a) plays in the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Although dependent upon the threshold and unit of measurement of Lp(a), most estimates suggest that between 20% and 30% of the world's population have elevated serum levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are predominantly mediated by genetics and are not significantly modified by lifestyle interventions.

Efforts are ongoing to develop effective pharmacotherapies to lower Lp(a) and to determine if lowering Lp(a) with these medications ultimately decreases the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. This review discusses the genetics and pathophysiological properties of Lp(a), as well as the epidemiological data demonstrating its impact on the incidence of cardiovascular disease. It also includes recommendations for screening and current approaches for patients with elevated Lp(a). Finally, the spectrum of pharmacotherapies under development for Lp(a) lowering is detailed.

### Lipoprotein(a), measured with an assay independent of apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, and risk of future cardiovascular events among initially healthy women [^116qfiTX]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

Controversy exists as to whether lipoprotein(a), a lipoprotein with homology to plasminogen, is a clinically meaningful cardiovascular risk marker in women. There is also poor agreement among lipoprotein(a) levels obtained by different assays.

- **Objective**: To determine the association of lipoprotein(a) levels, measured with an assay independent of apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, with the incidence of future cardiovascular events.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Prospective study of 27,791 initially healthy women in the Women's Health Study, enrolled between November 1992 and July 1995, and followed up for 10 years. Lipoprotein(a) level was measured in blood samples obtained at baseline with an assay independent of apolipoprotein(a) isoform size.

- **Main outcome measure**: Hazard ratios (HRs) for first-ever major cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal cerebrovascular event, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular deaths).

- **Results**: During follow-up, there were 899 incident cardiovascular events. After adjusting for age, smoking, blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, hormone use, C-reactive protein, and randomization treatment groups, women in the highest quintile of lipoprotein(a) (≥ 44.0 mg/dL) were 1.47 times more likely (95% CI, 1.21–1.79; P for trend < 0.001) to develop cardiovascular events than women in the lowest quintile (≤ 3.4 mg/dL). This association, however, was due almost entirely to a threshold effect among those with the highest lipoprotein(a) levels.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^112UxpX6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

There is currently no gold standard method available to measure true LDL‐C or Lp(a)‐C. The main reason for this is that lipoprotein(a) is a low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)–containing particle, and thus its density overlaps with that of LDL, creating challenges in separating the respective particles without overlap for measuring their cholesterol content.

In this study, we estimated corrected LDL‐C (LDL‐C corr) using parameters derived from prior biochemical studies. We hypothesized that the predictive value of LDL‐C corr would be diminished by removing the Lp(a)‐C content from LDL‐C. Furthermore, we quantified how patients might be reassigned into different LDL‐C categories if the Lp(a)‐C content was removed. We conducted the present analysis in a meta‐analysis from the Lipoprotein(a) Studies Collaboration of 18,043 patients with 5,390 cardiovascular disease events derived from five landmark statin trials and in a US clinical laboratory database of 531,144 patients.

### Heart UK consensus statement on lipoprotein(a): A call to action [^115wxbB2]. Atherosclerosis (2019). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a modified atherogenic low-density lipoprotein particle containing apolipoprotein(a). Its levels are highly heritable and variable within the population. This consensus statement by HEART UK presents evidence that Lp(a) is an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor while providing recommendations for its measurement in clinical practice and reviewing emerging therapeutic strategies to reduce CVD risk.

Ten statements summarize the most salient points for practitioners and patients with high Lp(a) levels. HEART UK recommends measuring Lp(a) in adults under the following conditions:

- **Personal or family history**: Those with a personal or family history of premature atherosclerotic CVD.
- **First-degree relatives**: Those with first-degree relatives who have Lp(a) levels greater than 200 nmol/l.
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia**: Patients with this condition.
- **Calcific aortic valve stenosis**: Patients diagnosed with this condition.
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Those with a borderline (but less than 15%) 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event.

The management of patients with elevated Lp(a) levels should include:

- **Atherosclerotic risk reduction**: Implement strategies to decrease overall atherosclerotic risk.
- **Dyslipidemia control**: Achieve a desirable non-HDL-cholesterol level of less than 100 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l).
- **Lipoprotein apheresis consideration**: Consider this procedure as a potential treatment option.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^11467D6V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our findings provide insights that the predictive value of LDL-C is potentiated by its Lp(a)-C content. This study provides a rationale to develop improved methods to accurately quantify LDL-C. Additional clinical investigations are needed to more accurately assign CVD risk to the responsible lipoproteins and to assess the true effect of LDL-C–modifying therapies.

### Lipoprotein (a) and diabetes mellitus [^1164rExB]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

Lp(a) and diabetes are both well-established risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. However, studies attempting to link these risk factors find an inverse association between Lp(a) and the risk of prevalent and incident diabetes. It is not yet clear whether this association is causal or whether it results from the concentration of Lp(a) itself, the length of the apo(a) isoforms, or both.

The results of Mendelian randomisation studies are highly heterogeneous. This review aims to illuminate the most recent findings of epidemiological and Mendelian randomisation studies and disentangle the contradictory results. Only part of the observed association of Lp(a) with diabetes can likely be explained by causality and may also be influenced by reverse causation, co-morbidities, or medications. Furthermore, this review summarizes the role of Lp(a) in patients with diabetes.

Several studies suggest that elevated Lp(a) is a causal independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients. Although therapies specifically targeting and lowering Lp(a) have not been evaluated in diabetic patients, analysis of the large PCSK9 clinical outcomes trials suggests they are beneficial for cardiovascular outcomes.

### Ancestry, lipoprotein(a), and cardiovascular risk thresholds: JACC review topic of the week [^116gbJqC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

This study reviews ancestral differences in the genetics of the LPA gene, risk categories of elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as defined by guidelines, ancestry-specific Lp(a) risk, absolute and proportional risk, predictive value of risk thresholds among different ancestries, and differences between laboratory vs. clinical accuracy in Lp(a) assays.

For clinical decision-making, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the predictive value of Lp(a) does not vary sufficiently to mandate the use of ancestry-specific risk thresholds. This paper interprets the literature on Lp(a) and ancestral risk to support:

- **Clinicians**: to better understand cardiovascular disease risk in different ancestral groups.

- **Trialists**: to aid in the design of clinical trials that ensure adequate ancestral diversity, supporting broad conclusions of drug effects.

- **Regulators**: in evaluating the design and interpretation of results of Lp(a)-lowering trials with different Lp(a) inclusion thresholds.

- **Clinical laboratories**: to measure Lp(a) by assays that discriminate risk thresholds appropriately.

### Independence of lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: A participant-level meta-analysis [^1155vYha]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Previous studies have sought to address the relationship between Lp(a) and LDL-C levels for cardiovascular risk. In a similar meta-analysis of seven statin trials, the association between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk appeared to increase linearly and independently of LDL-C levels when evaluated at specific Lp(a) cut points. This study also demonstrated that the independent risk associated with Lp(a) levels persisted in statin-treated individuals. Our study adds to this previous work by demonstrating that Lp(a) and LDL-C levels are independent and additive predictors of cardiovascular risk. Whereas the previous study evaluated Lp(a)-mediated risk specifically, we evaluated the implications of LDL-C lowering on global cardiovascular risk in the context of elevated Lp(a) levels, demonstrating that even with the lowest achieved LDL-C levels (both absolutely and relatively), overall risk remains increased in those with elevated Lp(a) levels. Potent LDL-C lowering does not appear to completely offset the risk associated with elevated Lp(a) levels.

In an observational study from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), participants were categorized by Lp(a) level either above or below 50 mg/dL and LDL-C level either above or below 100 mg/dL. Over a mean follow-up of 13.4 years, there was an increased risk when Lp(a) level alone was elevated (HR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.02–3.27]), compared to when both Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were lower. MESA used baseline Lp(a) and LDL-C results, excluded individuals on lipid-lowering therapy, and involved only a small number of individuals with isolated elevations.

### Lipoprotein(a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: A European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^1147aWAQ]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The study examines the reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol needed to decrease global cardiovascular risk, similarly to the risk posed by high levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. The cumulative absolute lifetime risk of a major cardiovascular event was assessed among 440,368 UK Biobank participants of European descent. Major cardiovascular events included the first occurrence of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal or non-fatal ischemic stroke, or coronary revascularization procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Participants were classified into three groups:

- **Reference group**: This group had population average Lp(a) levels [16–17 nmol/L] and LDL cholesterol levels [3.5–3.6 mmol/L] without any copies of the rs10455872 or rs3798220 Lp(a)-increasing alleles.

- **Higher Lp(a) exposure group**: Participants had higher lifetime exposure to Lp(a) [136–138 nmol/L] due to inheriting one copy of either the rs10455872 or rs3798220 Lp(a)-increasing alleles, along with population average LDL cholesterol levels [3.5–3.6 mmol/L].

- **Combined exposure group**: This group had both higher lifetime exposure to Lp(a) [136–138 nmol/L] due to inheriting one copy of either the rs10455872 or rs3798220 Lp(a)-increasing alleles and lifetime exposure to 0.5 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol [3.0–3.1 mmol/L] due to inheriting LDL cholesterol-lowering genetic variants.

The findings demonstrate that the increased risk of major cardiovascular events due to approximately 120 nmol/L higher lifetime exposure to Lp(a) can be mitigated at all ages by sustained exposure to lower LDL cholesterol levels.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^114i7xGR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically transmitted codominant trait that independently drives cardiovascular disease risk. The concentration of lipoprotein(a) is heavily influenced by genetic factors, including LPA kringle IV-2 domain size, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and interleukin-1 genotypes. Apolipoprotein(a) is encoded by the LPA gene and contains 10 subtypes with a variable number of copies of kringle-2, resulting in more than 40 different apolipoprotein(a) isoform sizes. Genetic loci beyond LPA, such as APOE and APOH, also impact lipoprotein(a) levels.

Lipoprotein(a) concentrations are generally 5% to 10% higher in women than in men. There is up to a three-fold difference in median lipoprotein(a) concentrations between racial and ethnic populations. Nongenetic factors, including menopause, diet, and renal function, may also impact lipoprotein(a) concentration. These levels are also influenced by inflammation because the LPA promoter contains an interleukin-6 response element; interleukin-6 released during inflammation leads to transient increases in plasma lipoprotein(a) levels.

Screening can identify elevated lipoprotein(a) levels and facilitate intensive risk factor management. Several investigational, RNA-targeted agents have shown promising lipoprotein(a)-lowering effects in clinical studies. Large-scale lipoprotein(a) testing will be fundamental to identifying eligible patients should these agents become available. Lipoprotein(a) testing requires routine, nonfasting blood draws, making it convenient for patients.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^117UYGxr]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, specifically concerning lipoprotein(a), the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of lipoprotein(a) in selected patients. This is particularly advised for patients with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease, as well as for reclassification in patients who fall at the borderline between moderate and high risk.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor [^115rm4hY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a class of lipoprotein particles having the lipid composition of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but with a distinct protein moiety comprised of two proteins linked together by a disulfide bridge. The two proteins are apoB100, the protein moiety of LDL, and apo(a), a heavily glycosylated protein that is specific for Lp(a). Apo(a) has a strong structural similarity to plasminogen and has a wide-size polymorphism that has a genetic origin and is partially responsible for the size and density heterogeneity of Lp(a).

High plasma levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease that is related to the atherogenic and thrombogenic potentials of this lipoprotein enhanced by the presence of other risk factors, among which are high plasma levels of LDL or low levels of high-density lipoprotein. The factors determining the plasma levels of Lp(a) have not been clearly identified except for an association with different alleles of the apo(a) gene, which is located in the long arm of chromosome 6. Currently, there are no generally accepted ways to normalize the plasma levels of Lp(a) by either dietary or pharmacologic means. Until further progress in this area is made, patients with high plasma levels of Lp(a) should be advised to correct modifiable risk factors in order to decrease the cardiovascular pathogenicity of this lipoprotein class.

### Lipoprotein(a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: A European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^112Y9G4e]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

- **Consequences for risk thresholds**: While the association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular outcomes is linear, in clinical practice, threshold levels identify values expected to translate to a clinically significant increase in risk, although analytical issues may raise questions about their validity. One solution is to define assay-specific cut-offs, analogous to those used in different cardiac troponin assays. This consensus panel suggests a pragmatic approach, with Lp(a) cut-offs to 'rule out' (50 mg/dL or > 125 nmol/L) risk. The interim grey zone (i.e. 30–50 mg/dL; 75–125 nmol/L) is relevant when considering Lp(a)-attributable risk in the presence of other risk factors and in risk stratification. Laboratories should include in reports the assay name to allow for tracking of discrepant results in patient follow-up.

- **Should Lp(a)-cholesterol be used to correct low-density lipoprotein cholesterol?** Cholesterol contained in Lp(a) particles cannot be separated from that in LDL particles and is therefore collectively reported as LDL-C concentration. Previous analyses of isolated Lp(a) particles suggested cholesterol accounted for 30%–45% of Lp(a) mass concentration. Thus, Lp(a)-cholesterol [Lp(a)-C] was estimated by multiplying Lp(a) mass (mg/dL) by 0.3 and used to correct LDL-C (= Lp(a)-C-corrected LDL-C).

However, this approach has limitations. Direct measurement of Lp(a) cholesterol relative to Lp(a) mass showed inter- and intraindividual variation ranging from 6% to 60%, which may impact risk prediction. Therefore, this panel does not recommend using this approach.

### Lipoprotein(a): the perpetual supporting actor [^114rfSeK]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Verbeek et al.'s article further highlights that high Lp(a) levels are closely associated with adverse clinical outcomes in subjects with low LDL-C values. For instance, in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.16–1.78, p < 0.01) for the group with LDL-C values ranging between 2.5–3.49 mmol/L. In contrast, in a relatively small group of patients with LDL-C < 2.5 mmol/L (< 10% of the cohort sample size) and high Lp(a), the association of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with Lp(a) levels was strongly attenuated: HR was 1.11 (95% CI 0.77–1.59) and 1.08 (95% CI 0.85–1.38) in the EPIC-Norfolk and the CCHS cohort, respectively. However, the rate of CVD events increased by more than 100% when high levels of Lp(a) were associated with higher LDL-C values (≥ 5.5 mmol/L).

The findings of this large observational study add new evidence to the role of Lp(a) as a potential independent CVD risk factor and suggest that the risk is highest when both Lp(a) and LDL-C values are elevated. Hazard ratios are, on the other hand, modest when taken individually for Lp(a). The clinical implications of these findings for medical practice remain to be assessed, and it is unclear whether Lp(a) can be added as an incremental value for CVD risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: Current status [^111xBb8p]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Scientific and clinical evidence favoring an interpretation of causality between elevated levels of a lipoprotein and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk constitutes a prerequisite for selecting desirable levels. For an interpretation of causality, five types of evidence should each favor causality, and all three types of human evidence (epidemiology, genetics, and intervention trials) must concur. For elevated LDL cholesterol levels, all five criteria are well documented, and there is consensus on causality. Based on the same criteria, elevated Lp(a) levels are probably also causally related to increased CVD risk.

Recommendations proposing desirable levels should preferably be based on evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials documenting the benefit of treatment (level Ia evidence). Desirable levels for LDL cholesterol are based on such evidence from statin trials. For Lp(a), the evidence is less clear; however, a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials documenting the benefit of niacin (nicotinic acid) treatment has recently been published.

- **Desirable levels**: For reduction of plasma Lp(a) as a secondary priority after reducing LDL and total cholesterol levels, we recommend a desirable level below the 80th percentile (less than approximately 50 mg/dL). As for LDL reduction, treatment of high Lp(a) levels in persons without CVD/CHD or diabetes is recommended.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^116YKAr2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Genetic determinants of plasma lipoprotein(a) levels are crucial for understanding the cardiovascular risks associated with this lipoprotein. As previously discussed, significant variation exists in measured plasma lipoprotein(a) among individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. This variation is largely attributable to genetic variants located within the LPA gene locus.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: Current status [^1173Ysam]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

We suggest that Lp(a) should be measured once in all subjects at intermediate or high risk of CVD/CHD who present with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, a ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to the European guidelines, and a ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal and/or non-fatal CHD according to the US guidelines. Repeat measurement is only necessary if treatment for high Lp(a) levels is initiated in order to evaluate therapeutic response.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a potential causal genetic risk factor of cardiovascular disease: A rationale for increased efforts to understand its pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies [^112biF27]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recent published studies have provided increasing evidence that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] may be a potential causal, genetic, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lp(a) levels greater than 25 mg/dl are present in approximately 30% of Caucasians and 60% to 70% of Blacks. Lp(a) is composed of apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. Circulating Lp(a) levels are primarily influenced by the LPA gene without significant dietary or environmental effects, mediating CVD risk throughout the patient's lifetime.

Recent clinical outcomes studies, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomization studies, where randomization of Lp(a) levels is achieved through the random assortment of LPA gene variants thereby removing confounders, have shown that genetically determined Lp(a) levels are continuously and linearly related to risk of CVD. Currently, Lp(a) pathophysiology is not fully understood, and specifically targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not available.

- **Rationale for increased efforts**: We provide a rationale for increased basic and clinical investigational efforts to further understand Lp(a) pathophysiology and assess whether reducing Lp(a) levels minimizes CVD risk.
	- A detailed understanding of Lp(a) synthesis and clearance has not been realized.
	- Several mechanisms of atherogenicity are known to varying extents, but the relative contributions of each are not known.
	- Lp(a) may be atherothrombotic through its low-density lipoprotein moiety and through apo(a), including its ability to be retained in the vessel wall and mediate pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol — the Framingham Heart Study [^112X6SCD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is among the most common genetic dyslipidemias worldwide, affecting 1 in 5 individuals, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although evidence from Mendelian randomization supports a causal role of lipoprotein(a) in CVD, limited therapeutic options exist to directly lower lipoprotein(a). Recommended strategies for management of individuals with high lipoprotein(a) emphasize the importance of managing other risk factors, including lowering elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) concentrations, without much supporting evidence for such an approach.

Among individuals with premature acute coronary syndromes, elevations of LDL‐C > 135 mg/dL were more frequent among patients with high lipoprotein(a), suggesting greater absolute risk when both lipoproteins were elevated. Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the absolute and relative risks of incident CVD associated with elevated lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L, approximately equivalent to 50 mg/dL) in the presence of LDL‐C values above and below 135 mg/dL, prospectively in the community‐based Framingham Offspring Cohort. Given that American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association lipids guidelines also consider an LDL‐C ≥ 160 mg/dL as an optional indication for early lipid‐lowering therapy, we also evaluated whether the concomitant presence of high lipoprotein(a) with LDL‐C levels between 135 and < 160 mg/dL conferred similar CVD risk.

### Effect of two lipoprotein (a)-associated genetic variants on plasminogen levels and fibrinolysis [^117RB5Wg]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. While the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is multifactorial, substantial evidence has shown that lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a significant and independent risk factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Plasma Lp(a) concentration varies up to 1000-fold among individuals, is highly heritable, and is influenced minimally by environmental factors. Levels of plasma Lp(a) are regulated, in part, by the LPA gene located on chromosome 6q26–27, which encodes for apo(a). The number of kringle 4 type 2 (KIV-2) repeats can vary from 12 to 51, resulting in 34 apo(a) isoforms with different sizes, and the size of apo(a) is inversely related to the plasma Lp(a) concentration. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LPA gene are associated with Lp(a) levels. Among them, a nonsynonymous SNP that results in an isoleucine to methionine substitution at position 1891 (rs3798220) and an intronic variant (rs10455872) have been confirmed to be strongly associated with increased levels of plasma Lp(a) and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Indeed, a recently published study by our group has provided additional evidence that these variants are significantly associated with Lp(a)-cholesterol levels independently of each other and KIV-2 repeat number. The elucidation of a potential mechanism of action behind these Lp(a)-associated variants for CVD could lead to novel targets for treatment and/or prevention of CVD.

### Estimation of the required lipoprotein(a)-lowering therapeutic effect size for reduction in coronary heart disease outcomes: A mendelian randomization analysis [^111u1wUH]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Genetic and epidemiologic data suggest that lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is one of the strongest genetically determined risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Specific therapies to lower Lp(a) are on the horizon, but the required reduction of Lp(a) to translate into clinically relevant lowering of CHD outcomes is a matter of debate.

The objective of this study was to estimate the required Lp(a)-lowering effect size that may be associated with a reduction of CHD outcomes compared with the effect size of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapies.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Genetic epidemiologic study using a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the required Lp(a)-lowering effect size for a clinically meaningful effect on outcomes. We used the effect estimates for Lp(a) from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis on Lp(a) published in 2017 of five different primarily population-based studies of European ancestry. All Lp(a) measurements were performed in one laboratory. Genetic estimates for 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms on Lp(a) concentrations were used. Odds ratios for these 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CHD risk were retrieved from a subsample of the CHD Exome+ consortium.

- **Exposures**: Genetic LPA score, plasma Lp(a) concentrations, and observations of statin therapies on CHD outcomes.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Coronary heart disease.

The results included 13,781 individuals from the Lp(a)-GWAS-Consortium from five primarily population-based studies and 20,793 CHD cases and 27,540 controls from a subset of the CHD Exome+ consortium.

### Lipoprotein(a): A genetically determined, causal, and prevalent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116FAxEM]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). High credibility.

High levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an apoB100-containing lipoprotein, are an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through mechanisms associated with increased atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Lp(a) is predominantly a monogenic cardiovascular risk determinant, with approximately 70% to over 90% of interindividual variability in levels being genetically determined. The two major protein components of Lp(a) particles are apoB100 and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease development even when plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB100 are effectively reduced.

Despite its demonstrated contribution to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden, there is currently a lack of assay standardization and harmonization, as well as universal guidelines for diagnosing, providing risk assessment, and addressing targeted treatments to lower Lp(a). There is a clinical need to understand the genetic and biological basis for variation in Lp(a) levels and its relationship to disease in different ancestry groups.

This scientific statement utilizes the expertise of a diverse basic science and clinical workgroup to highlight the history, biology, pathophysiology, and emerging clinical evidence in the Lp(a) field. It addresses key knowledge gaps and future directions required to mitigate the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk attributable to elevated Lp(a) levels.
