## Question

What are the common risk factors for developing steroid myalgia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common risk factors for developing steroid myalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining steroid myopathy and its clinical context. Then, I should verify the dose–duration thresholds that meaningfully increase risk. Next, I will examine patient-specific susceptibility factors, followed by disease and treatment-related modifiers. After that, I need to consider critical illness and ICU-specific contributors, and finally synthesize a hierarchical risk model and practical clinical implications for prevention and monitoring, making sure I double-check conflicting data and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and context. Steroid myopathy, or glucocorticoid-induced myopathy, is characterized by proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, and reduced endurance, predominantly affecting the lower limbs, and reflects catabolic and anti-anabolic effects on muscle protein turnover. It is a recognized adverse effect of systemic glucocorticoids across multiple indications, including neuromuscular diseases, inflammatory myopathies, oncology, and critical care settings [^117An9CZ] [^116GNmk4] [^112fYynb].

> Now, I should verify the dose–duration relationship because that is foundational to risk stratification. Wait, let me verify the commonly cited thresholds: doses below about 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent are generally considered low risk, whereas doses at or above 40 mg/day for at least one month are consistently associated with clinically meaningful weakness. Cumulative exposure also matters, with higher total steroid burden increasing risk, and prolonged therapy beyond two weeks already raises the likelihood of musculoskeletal adverse effects including myopathy [^111HxQ8E] [^116GNmk4] [^117An9CZ]. Hold on, I should also note that in asthma cohorts, associations with systemic glucocorticoids and muscle impairment are inconsistent, underscoring heterogeneity and the need to integrate dose, duration, and patient context rather than relying on a single cutoff in isolation [^115esgWU].

> Next, I will examine patient-specific susceptibility. Older age independently increases risk, likely reflecting reduced muscle reserve and altered pharmacokinetics. Male sex appears more frequently affected in Cushing's syndrome cohorts, though sex effects vary by population and indication. Pre-existing neuromuscular disease, low muscle mass, and poor baseline function further amplify vulnerability. Genetic susceptibility remains under investigation, but phenotype and baseline strength clearly modify risk and recovery trajectories [^116nn3Tj] [^117An9CZ].

> I need to check disease and treatment-related modifiers. Endogenous Cushing's syndrome carries a very high prevalence of myopathy, often exceeding 50%, reflecting sustained glucocorticoid excess; in inflammatory myopathies, glucocorticoids are both therapeutic and myotoxic, and prolonged high-dose regimens contribute to damage; in critical illness, concomitant neuromuscular blockade, sepsis, and hyperglycemia synergize with steroids to promote ICU-acquired weakness; co-administration of other myotoxic or interacting drugs, such as statins, can compound muscle injury, though the mechanisms and attributable risk vary and should be individualized [^116nn3Tj] [^1113VN2x] [^11678HUm] [^117Kh2oR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ICU populations. I should double-check the conflicting steroid data. Some prospective ICU studies link high-dose corticosteroids to critical illness myopathy, whereas others, particularly with low-dose hydrocortisone in septic shock, do not show increased risk, suggesting a dose-dependent and context-dependent relationship. Immobility, severity of illness, systemic inflammation, and hyperglycemia emerge as dominant co-factors, and early mobilization and glycemic control are key modifiable levers to mitigate risk [^114J5cU4] [^115re1P4] [^11678HUm] [^11552Gbt].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchical risk model, but I should confirm I'm not overstating any single factor. Tier 1 drivers include dose at or above 40 mg/day prednisone equivalent for at least one month and cumulative exposure, with higher total dose conferring greater risk. Tier 2 contributors include older age, pre-existing neuromuscular disease, critical illness with sepsis or multi-organ failure, prolonged immobility, and hyperglycemia. Tier 3 modifiers include male sex in Cushing's cohorts, concomitant neuromuscular blockade, and co-administered myotoxins such as statins. Importantly, low-dose regimens under 10 mg/day are generally low risk, though individual susceptibility and cumulative exposure still matter [^111HxQ8E] [^116GNmk4] [^11678HUm] [^117An9CZ].

> I should now translate this into practical clinical implications. Prevention hinges on using the lowest effective glucocorticoid dose for the shortest necessary duration, implementing structured taper plans, and prioritizing steroid-sparing immunosuppression in inflammatory diseases. Routine screening for steroid myopathy should include functional assessments such as observing rise from squat, sit-to-stand testing, and strength grading, with early referral to physical therapy for resistance and aerobic exercise. In patients on chronic glucocorticoids, address bone health proactively and monitor for metabolic and infectious complications per consensus guidance [^112fYynb] [^113sNSnQ] [^115knJ5M] [^115Ezngk].

> But wait, what if the patient is in the ICU and steroids are indicated for the underlying disease? I need to ensure we balance risks and benefits: favor the lowest effective steroid dose, avoid unnecessary deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade, implement early mobilization, and maintain tight but safe glycemic control, recognizing that the steroid contribution to ICU-acquired weakness is likely modest at low doses and heavily influenced by the overall critical illness milieu [^11552Gbt] [^11678HUm] [^114J5cU4].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and recovery expectations. Onset of steroid myopathy is typically insidious over weeks to months with high-dose exposure, though acute severe myopathy can occur with very high doses and neuromuscular blockade in critical care. Recovery is often slow and may take weeks to years after steroid withdrawal, reinforcing the importance of early recognition, dose reduction, and rehabilitation engagement to optimize functional recovery [^117An9CZ] [^1133pmWY].

---

Steroid myopathy is primarily driven by **high-dose glucocorticoids** (≥ 40 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for ≥ 1 month) [^111HxQ8E] and **prolonged therapy** (> 2 weeks) [^116GNmk4], with additional risk from **critical illness** (sepsis, ARDS, prolonged ICU stay) [^111feMU1], neuromuscular blockade [^11678HUm], and metabolic derangements (hyperglycemia, hypokalemia) [^11552Gbt]. Patient-specific risks include older age, male sex, pre-existing neuromuscular disease [^116nn3Tj], and high cumulative steroid exposure [^116C5Vqj]; **modifiable risks** can be mitigated by minimizing dose and duration, early mobilization, and glycemic control [^113sNSnQ].

---

## Dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy

High-dose glucocorticoids (** ≥ 40 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for ≥ 1 month**) [^111HxQ8E] are a major risk factor for steroid myopathy, whereas **prolonged therapy** (> 2 weeks) [^116GNmk4] increases risk even at lower doses.

---

## Patient-specific factors

- **Age**: Older adults have higher risk due to reduced muscle mass and impaired regeneration [^11678HUm].

- **Sex**: Male sex is associated with higher risk in Cushing's syndrome [^116nn3Tj].

- **Pre-existing neuromuscular disease**: Myasthenia gravis and other disorders increase susceptibility [^113uy2jK].

- **Cumulative steroid exposure**: Higher total dose correlates with greater risk [^116C5Vqj].

---

## Clinical conditions and comorbidities

- **Critical illness**: Sepsis, ARDS, and prolonged ICU stay increase risk [^111feMU1].

- **Hyperglycemia**: Poor glycemic control is a key risk factor [^11552Gbt].

- **Hypokalemia**: Low potassium increases risk.

- **Neuromuscular blockade**: Concurrent use, especially with aminoglycosides, heightens risk [^112nnn15].

---

## Medication-related factors

Medication-related factors include **fluorinated steroids** (dexamethasone, triamcinolone), which carry a higher myopathy risk than non-fluorinated agents, and **drug interactions** — notably CYP3A4 inhibitors and neuromuscular blockers — that increase risk [^1133pmWY] [^112HLKgp].

---

## Summary of risk factors

| **Risk factor category** | **Specific risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration | - High-dose glucocorticoids (≥ 40 mg/day) <br/> - Prolonged therapy (> 2 weeks) |
| Patient-specific factors | - Older age <br/> - Male sex <br/> - Pre-existing neuromuscular disease <br/> - High cumulative steroid exposure |
| Clinical conditions | - Critical illness (sepsis, ARDS) <br/> - Hyperglycemia <br/> - Hypokalemia <br/> - Neuromuscular blockade |
| Medication-related factors | - Fluorinated steroids <br/> - Drug interactions (CYP3A4 inhibitors, neuromuscular blockers) |

---

## Preventive strategies

- **Minimize dose and duration**: Use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration [^1172VX2H].

- **Early mobilization**: Start physical therapy early to reduce muscle atrophy [^11552Gbt].

- **Glycemic control**: Maintain strict glucose control in critically ill patients [^113J5fbY].

- **Monitor electrolytes**: Correct hypokalemia promptly.

- **Avoid high-risk combinations**: Limit concurrent neuromuscular blockade and interacting drugs [^11678HUm].

---

Steroid myopathy risk is multifactorial, with **high-dose and prolonged glucocorticoid therapy** as primary drivers; risk is amplified by critical illness, metabolic derangements, and patient-specific factors. Prevention centers on **minimizing steroid exposure**, early mobilization, and glycemic control [^113sNSnQ].

Risk factors for expiratory muscle weakness in critically ill patients

Risk factors for the development of ICU-acquired weakness of the peripheral muscles and diaphragm have been discussed recently. Whether these risk factors also have an impact on the expiratory muscles is largely unknown. We briefly discuss risk factors that may contribute to the development of expiratory muscle weakness.

Sepsis

Sepsis and systematic inflammation have been linked to the development of muscle weakness, including weakness of the expiratory muscles. Sepsis induces a severe and persistent increase in protein catabolism, resulting in muscle wasting and muscle weakness. Compared with non-septic surgical patients, the rectus abdominis muscle from surgical patients with sepsis showed significantly lower in vitro contractility. In addition, the reduced MEP (≤ 30 cm H₂O) found at the time patients regained normal consciousness showed an independent association with septic shock.

Mechanical ventilation

Mechanical ventilation plays an important role in the development of diaphragmatic dysfunction in critically ill patients. Potential mechanisms include disuse atrophy due to ventilator over-assist, or load-induced injury as a result of ventilator under-assist. The impact of mechanical ventilation on expiratory muscles has not been systematically investigated. However, as mentioned earlier, ventilator settings including PEEP and the level of inspiratory assist may have an impact on the activity of the expiratory muscles (Fig. 3), although the ultimate impact of mechanical ventilation on expiratory muscle strength is largely unknown and should be further investigated.

Other risk factors

Co-morbidities, such as COPD and myopathies, or complications such as intra-abdominal hypertension, may put patients at increased risk of ICU-associated expiratory muscle weakness. Drugs such as sedatives, neuromuscular blockers and corticosteroids have been shown to affect peripheral muscle function and diaphragm muscle function in ICU patients. The effects of these drugs on expiratory muscle function have not been systematically studied.

### Implications of glucocorticoid therapy in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^1113VN2x]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of therapy in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), despite adverse effects and suboptimal therapy success rates. Glucocorticoids are used in patients with IIM to suppress inflammatory and immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Nevertheless, potential inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on skeletal muscle mass, myogenesis and immune responses that promote skeletal muscle regeneration after muscle injury warrant attention. Glucocorticoids lead to skeletal muscle catabolism by modulating major pathways involved in regulating muscle mass. Glucocorticoids also inhibit muscle regeneration by decreasing myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, glucocorticoids might have inhibitory effects on immune cells that have been shown to be an important component of the muscle regenerative response. Better understanding of the signalling pathways involved in restorative versus adverse effects of glucocorticoids in IIM could yield additional insight into the aetiopathogenesis of persistent muscle weakness in patients with IIM after glucocorticoid treatment, and help in the development of novel, targeted treatment options with fewer adverse effects.

As the most frequent cause of acquired myopathy, toxic myopathies are characterised by clinicopathological features that vary depending on the mode of action of the drugs or toxins involved. Although a large number of substances can induce myotoxicity, the main culprits are statins, alcohol, and corticosteroids. A rigorous, well-organised diagnostic approach is necessary to obtain a rapid diagnosis. For early diagnosis and management, it is important for clinicians to be aware that most toxic myopathies are potentially reversible, and the goal of treatment should be to avoid serious muscle damage.

Myopathy and other muscle pain or weakness

Myopathy was prospectively defined as otherwise unexplained muscle pain or weakness with CK > 10× ULN (within 28 days). The majority of myopathy cases presented to their managing clinician between scheduled clinic visits, and all cases were adjudicated by a clinician at the study co-ordinating centre. A report during follow-up of new unexplained muscle pain or weakness that was not associated with a diagnosis of myopathy (within 28 days) was defined as 'other muscle symptoms'. A subset of these individuals with CK > 5 ≤ 10× ULN was also examined.

### Statin-induced debilitating weakness and myopathy [^1164QtMa]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A large percentage of the US population is either receiving or should be considered for statin therapy. Whether through primary or secondary prevention for atherosclerotic disease, statins remain one of the mainstay options available to physicians. Myalgias are the most commonly reported side effects, though largely self-limited and subjective in nature. Here, we report a case of drug-related myonecrosis following long-term use of atorvastatin. Prompt recognition of the condition and initiation of treatment is paramount to control the disease's progression. While high-dose steroids are first line, quick escalation to methotrexate, IVIG or rituximab should be considered in refractory cases. This decision is guided by monitoring of serum markers such as CK and transaminases. The goal is quick normalisation of these enzymes, signalling cessation of underlying muscle necrosis. Patients may never regain full function and treatment can last months to years.

At last visit, 5 patients (patients 1–5) showed normalization of CK levels with no significant or slight disability (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 1 or 2). In contrast, the remaining 5 patients (patients 6–10) showed sustained increase in CK level, including 2 patients (patients 6, 7) with moderate or moderately severe disability (mRS 3 or 4) and increased CK levels. Interestingly, 3 patients (patients 8–10) showed no or slight muscular symptoms (mRS 0 or 1) despite markedly increased CK levels at last visits (2,871 ± 1,152 IU/L; range 1,701–4,004). These 3 patients developed myopathy at relatively younger ages. Although they showed resistance to combined treatments with steroids and immunosuppressants, IVIg was effective for improving muscle strength and decreasing CK level, which led to clinical remission.

### Simvastatin (Zocor) [^112HLKgp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors for Myopathy

Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher ZOCOR dosage; Chinese patients on ZOCOR may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. The risk of myopathy is increased by elevated plasma levels of simvastatin and simvastatin acid. The risk is also greater in patients taking an 80 mg daily dosage of ZOCOR compared with patients taking lower ZOCOR dosages and compared with patients using other statins with similar or greater LDL-C-lowering efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis

The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ZOCOR is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is required, temporarily suspend ZOCOR during the duration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment. The concomitant use of ZOCOR with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, or danazol is also contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

ZOCOR dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking lomitapide, verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone, amlodipine or ranolazine [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. ZOCOR use should be temporarily suspended in patients taking daptomycin. Lipid modifying doses (≥ 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and grapefruit juice may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Myopathy and other muscle symptoms

During 196 521 person-years of exposure to study simvastatin across the three studies, representing a mean 3.4 years of treatment, 171 participants developed myopathy, including 14 cases in whom there was evidence of more marked muscle damage (i.e. CK > 40× ULN) as well as end-organ damage (defined prospectively as rhabdomyolysis). Of the 131 individuals who had myopathy and at least one scheduled follow-up visit within the previous 28 days (when they would have been explicitly asked about any muscle symptoms), 96 (73%) had not reported muscle pain or weakness prior to the diagnosis of myopathy. The mean time from initiation of study simvastatin to myopathy was 18 months, with 36% of cases occurring in the first 6 months of treatment. The rate of myopathy per 10 000 person-years was 9 overall, but it was higher in the first year of treatment vs. later years (19 vs. 5), in Chinese vs. European individuals (26 vs. 2 with simvastatin 40 mg daily), and in those receiving higher doses (13 vs. 1 with simvastatin 80 mg vs. 20 mg daily doses; Table 1).

Creatine kinase was measured at every study visit in the SEARCH study, and less extreme CK elevations (CK > 5 ≤ 10× ULN) than required for the definition of myopathy were detected on 7 (0.2%) of 4495 visits at which muscle symptoms were reported and 102 (0.1%) of 171 090 visits at which they were not. In contrast to myopathy, reports of muscle symptoms other than myopathy (i.e. pain or weakness but without CK elevations > 10× ULN) were extremely common, occurring at least once during follow-up in 26% (15 208/58 390) of participants, with an overall rate of 981 events per 10 000 person-years (Supplementary material online, Table S2).

Management of statin-associated muscle symptoms

If a patient complains of muscle symptoms, the clinician needs to evaluate risk factors which can predispose to statin-associated myopathy, exclude secondary causes (especially hypothyroidism and other common myopathies such as polymyalgia rheumatica, or increased physical activity), and review the indication for statin use. The clinician should bear in mind that other commonly prescribed drugs such as anti-inflammatory (glucocorticoids), antipsychotic (risperidone, haloperidol), immunosuppressant or antiviral agents (human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors), lipid-modifying drugs (gemfibrozil), as well as substances of abuse (alcohol, opioids, and cocaine) may also cause muscle-related side effects. Several factors including female sex, ethnicity, multisystem disease, and small body frame predispose to SAMS (see Box 1), with the presence of an increasing number of factors associated with greater risk.– Additionally, pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions (DDIs) that increase statin exposure increase the risk of statin-associated myopathy (Box 2). Concomitant treatment with a statin and medication(s) that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes, organic anion transport protein 1B1 (OATP1B1), or P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) has been associated with increased risk of new or worsening muscle pain (see Overview of the pathophysiology of statin-induced myopathy section). Polypharmacy, including both prescribed and self-prescribed or over the counter medications (e.g. vitamins, minerals and herbal remedies), is a potential cause of DDIs with statins. In addition, pharmacogenetic considerations may be relevant, potentially influencing plasma concentrations of statins and in turn statin–drug interactions.

Drug–drug interactions: concomitant use of certain drugs including gemfibrozil, macrolides, azole antifungal agents, protease inhibitors, and immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, and inhibitors of CYP450 isoenzymes, OATP 1B1, or P-gp, can affect the metabolism of statins, increase their circulating levels and, consequently, the risk for SAMS.
Pharmacogenetic considerations may be relevant (see Overview of the pathophysiology of statin-induced myopathy) CYP450, cytochrome P450; OATP 1B1, organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1; P-gp, P-glycoprotein 1.

Factors That Increase Adverse Effects by Increasing Exposure to Statins

There are a number of mechanisms that affect drug exposure in individual patients; these are integral to and associated with risk of adverse events that exhibit dose dependence (notably myopathy). They include pharmacokinetic interactions, and pharmacogenomic factors that result in higher levels of statins in the blood and in hepatic and muscle tissue.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^115Ezngk]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis prevention in neuromuscular disease (NMD) is supported by the finding that there is an increased risk of vertebral fracture with GC dosing as low as 2.5 mg/day of prednisone, with the highest risk of bone loss being within the first 3 to 6 months, and the task force statements recommend osteoporosis prevention strategies at any dose of GC used for greater than 3 months, with implementation at the onset of GC therapy when the likelihood of being on GC for over 3 months is high. At the start of treatment and during active treatment with GC at any dose for > 3 months, screening for GC-induced osteoporosis should be recommended, preventative management should be instituted at any dose of glucocorticoid when used for > 3 months, and lifestyle modifications (balanced diet, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake, and regular weight-bearing exercise) should be recommended. Vitamin D supplementation at 600–800 IU/day and calcium intake of 1000–1200 mg/day should be recommended to all patients on any dose of GC for > 3 months unless there are contraindications, and if necessary, input on prescription pharmacologic treatment for GC-induced osteoporosis should be obtained from the primary care clinician and/or other appropriate specialists.

Multiple organ system phenotype

The above‐described phenotypes are not always clear‐cut and some individuals present with complex multiple organ system manifestations and multiple studies report a separate multiple organ system phenotype. An interesting observation from a large cluster analysis of hospitalised (inpatients) and those not requiring hospitalisation (outpatients) with PCC was a multiple organ system cluster characterised by high‐frequency laboratory abnormalities associated with a severe course of acute COVID‐19, such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopaenia, elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and ferritin. This phenotype contained statistically higher proportions of inpatients (34.0%) compared to any other cluster (15.2–21.0%), with a higher prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and corticosteroid use during acute COVID‐19, indicating that this phenotype may represent individuals experiencing residual effects from more severe COVID‐19. The study suggests that older age, male sex, and certain comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, mild liver disease, and peripheral vascular disease) are risk factors for this severe multiple organ system phenotype. However, less severe multiple organ system phenotypes with only a few or mild PCC symptoms and less functional impairment have also been identified.

Other common symptoms and risk factors

Besides the above‐described clinical presentations of PCC, other symptoms and risk factors have been identified. Examples of frequently occurring symptoms that clustered in multiple phenotypes are muscle fatigue or postexertional malaise and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhoea, which will be elaborated on in the next section (' Pathology and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms '). In addition, several risk factors for developing PCC in general have been identified that may not pose a risk to a particular PCC phenotype.

While males are more susceptible to severe acute COVID‐19, women are disproportionally affected by PCC, a pattern that remains incompletely understood. It is thought that both psychosocial factors (e.g. mental health conditions including depression) and biological factors (e.g. hormonal factors, differences in immune response, autoimmune predisposition) (vide infra) account for the observed sex differences, underscoring a biopsychosocial model as an essential approach for understanding and managing sex‐related manifestations in PCC.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^1149sfaD]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Infectious disease prophylaxis during glucocorticoid (GC) therapy notes that Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a fungal infection associated with immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving GC therapy, and it is also important to consider prophylaxis for tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and strongyloides based on geography and patient demographics; recommendations for infection prophylaxis vary and there are no neurology specific recommendations. For PJP, factors reported to increase risk in patients on GC include lymphopenia, interstitial lung disease, active malignancy, organ dysfunction, and low CD4 count, and initiation of PJP prophylaxis when chronic GC is used at a dose ≥ 20 mg/day has been recommended in the infectious disease literature and is not specific to the underlying indication for GC treatment, although the risk for PJP infection appears to vary and generally is low in the neuromuscular patient population.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^116doobP]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Glucocorticoid (GC)-related adverse reactions and risks are commonly seen during the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory neuromuscular disorders. There is wide variation in the management of associated complications. The aim of this study is to develop international consensus guidance on the management of GC-related complications in neuromuscular disorders.

Methods

Through the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM), an international task force of 15 experts was convened to develop clinical guidance for the management of GC-related complications in neuromuscular patients. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method (RAM) was used to develop consensus guidance statements. Initial guidance statements were crafted after a thorough literature review and were modified after anonymous panel input, with up to three rounds of voting via email to achieve consensus.

Results

Statements were developed and achieved consensus for general care, monitoring of patients while on GC, osteoporosis prevention, vaccinations, infection screening, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. A multidisciplinary approach to the management of GC-related complications was emphasized.

Discussion

These formal consensus statements provide guidance to clinicians who use GC in the treatment of neuromuscular diseases regarding prevention and management of the more common associated adverse events and risks that arise with long and short-term GC use and serve as a springboard for investigation and updates.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^114Q81CU]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: There are several barriers to clinical translation of this work. The first is the sheer scale of the problem, because of the number of people who are (and should be) prescribed statins. Second, we have not yet identified directly the conditions that precipitate overt myopathy, although our data provided a strong indication of what these factors may be. Third, there are currently no cost-effective alternative antilipidemic agents that match the efficacy of statins for those at high risk of myopathy. Statins confer additional therapeutic benefits independent of their ability to lower serum cholesterol (pleiotropic actions), which are not evident with other drugs. For example, the recently licensed PCSK9 inhibitors cost 50 to 100 times more than generic statins and lack the pleiotropic actions effects of statins.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^116nAky9]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events, but little is known about the impact of different risk factors for statin-related myopathy or their relevance to reports of other types of muscle symptom.

Methods and Results

An observational analysis was undertaken of 171 clinically adjudicated cases of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle pain or weakness with creatine kinase > 10× upper limit of normal) and, separately, of 15 208 cases of other muscle symptoms among 58 390 individuals with vascular disease treated with simvastatin for a mean of 3.4years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of myopathy. The rate of myopathy was low: 9 per 10 000 person-years of simvastatin therapy. Independent risk factors for myopathy included: simvastatin dose, ethnicity, sex, age, body mass index, medically treated diabetes, concomitant use of niacin-laropiprant, verapamil, beta-blockers, diltiazem and diuretics. In combination, these risk factors predicted more than a 30-fold risk difference between the top and bottom thirds of a myopathy risk score (hazard ratio: 34.35, 95% CI: 12.73–92.69, P across thirds = 9.1 × 10⁻⁴⁸). However, despite the strong association with myopathy, this score was not associated with the other reported muscle symptoms (P across thirds = 0.93). Likewise, although SLCO1B1 genotype was associated with myopathy, it was not associated with other muscle symptoms.

Conclusions

The absolute risk of simvastatin-related myopathy is low, but individuals at higher risk can be identified to help guide patient management. The lack of association of the myopathy risk score with other muscle symptoms reinforces randomized placebo-controlled evidence that statins do not cause the vast majority of reported muscle symptoms.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: a 2023 update [^111HxQ8E]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) — muscle and connective tissue complications are often cGVHD-related and include steroid myopathy, fasciitis/deep sclerosis, polymyositis, and myasthenia gravis. Steroid myopathy presents with proximal weakness and "an improvement in strength may occur by 2 to 3 weeks after steroid reduction", with dose effects such that " < 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent is unlikely to result in myopathy, but ≥ 40 mg/day for ≥ 1 month usually causes weakness". For cGVHD-associated fasciitis, "patients with fasciitis may benefit from a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program to control edema and preserve range of motion", and polymyositis "usually presents with moderate to severe proximal muscle weakness and myalgia". Myasthenia gravis linked to cGVHD tends to be delayed, with "most cases occurring > 2 years post-HCT".

### Intensive care unit-acquired weakness: risk factors and prevention [^11552Gbt]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Intensive care unit-acquired weakness, the main clinical sign of critical illness neuromyopathy, is an increasingly recognized cause of prolonged mechanical ventilation and delayed return to physical self-sufficiency. Identifying risk factors and developing preventive measures are therefore important goals. Several studies on risk factors for critical illness neuromyopathy including prospective observational studies with a multivariate analysis of potential risk factors were conducted over the last decade. A large body of data is also available from two large prospective randomized trials comparing the effect of strict vs. conventional blood-glucose control on intensive care unit mortality and on secondary outcomes including the occurrence of critical illness neuromyopathy. Five central risk factors and their related potential measures to prevent intensive care unit-acquired weakness can be identified including multiple organ failure, muscle inactivity, hyperglycemia, and use of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blockers. Although strong evidence regarding the efficacy of preventive measures is still lacking, the results of available studies are promising and cast doubt on the widespread belief that the treatment of intensive care unit-acquired weakness is essentially supportive. Early identifying and treating conditions leading to multiple organ failure, especially severe sepsis and septic shock, avoiding unnecessary deep sedation and excessive blood glucose levels, promoting early mobilization, and carefully weighing the risks and benefits of corticosteroids might contribute to reduce the incidence and severity of intensive care unit-acquired weakness.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111h8def]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Monitoring for acute, short-term, and long-term adverse effects of glucocorticoids — patients should be routinely assessed for a defined set of acute and chronic toxicities, gastrointestinal prophylaxis is recommended, and bone health measures are advised for those at risk or on longer-term therapy. Acute or short-term adverse events (AEs) include increased vulnerability to infection, insomnia, anxiety, diabetes or glucose intolerance, hypertension, and cutaneous changes; long-term AEs include bone loss with fractures, cataracts or glaucoma, steroid myopathy, relative adrenal insufficiency, psychiatric disturbance, and gastric or duodenal ulcers. GI prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2 antagonist is recommended; to limit steroid-induced bone loss, patients should receive adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise, bone-modifying agents may be offered to patients on steroids for > 3 months and are recommended for those with pre-existing osteoporosis, and patients with or at risk for osteoporosis who have long-term survival potential should undergo bone mineral density testing.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1172VX2H]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Steroid-related adverse effects during immune-related adverse event (irAE) management — general principles: Steroids remain the most studied and valuable agents in the management of immunotherapy-related AEs, but higher steroid doses may be necessary and use is often prolonged, placing patients at significant risk for acute and long-term toxicities. Evaluation of the patient's pre‑existing conditions and careful monitoring of steroid-related complications is crucial, and prophylactic agents to prevent certain opportunistic infections along with preemptive measures to mitigate various toxicities are necessary for patients needing longer‑term steroid use. The lowest possible dose of steroids should be used for the shortest possible duration, steroid tapers should be gradual and individualized based on the irAE's response and the patient's ability to tolerate steroids, and certain patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, an immune‑compromised state, and the elderly will need special attention. A multidisciplinary approach may be used for certain steroid‑related complications, institutional guidelines should be considered in decision making, and readers are directed to Table 12 for a complete set of recommendations for prevention and management of AEs related to steroid use.

### Clinical review: intensive care unit acquired weakness [^11678HUm]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

After a first case report of pronounced weakness in a patient treated with corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents, multiple others followed. Denervated and steroid-treated animals showed muscle changes similar to those observed in critically ill patients. Some prospective studies indeed suggested that corticosteroids and (prolonged) neuromuscular blocking agents may contribute to CIP/CIM or ICUAW. However, other prospective studies, of which some were randomized controlled trials, could not confirm such a role for corticosteroids or for neuromuscular blocking agents. These apparently contradicting findings suggest that the relationship between these drugs and neuromuscular complications is more complex and depends on other factors such as dose, timing, and concomitant glycemic control. Age was also identified as an independent risk factor for ICUAW. This may to some extent reflect the importance of the premorbid physiological muscle reserve, although the actual premorbid functional status is determined by many other factors. The premorbid functional status is often difficult to document due to the unplanned nature of ICU admissions. One report identified parenteral nutrition as a risk factor for CIP. The effect of nutritional strategies as a modifiable factor is further discussed in 'Prevention and therapy'. Other factors identified only in single studies might be incidental findings (female sex) or related to other risk factors (hyperosmolality, hypoalbuminemia, renal replacement therapy) and await confirmation.

Only few studies specifically addressed risk factors for respiratory weakness in the ICU. These studies demonstrated that respiratory muscle weakness is associated with infection or sepsis, disease severity, and peripheral weakness. The phrenic nerve and diaphragm also show similar electrophysiologic abnormalities as the peripheral nerves and muscles, so these data suggest that respiratory weakness is indeed part of ICUAW. Additionally, the duration of mechanical ventilation may contribute to weakness and atrophy of the diaphragm. This time-dependent and early development of diaphragmatic atrophy and dysfunction is also labeled "ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction" (VIDD).

### Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies of childhood [^114vUfo7]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Juvenile dermatomyositis, the most common inflammatory myopathy of childhood, is a rare systemic autoimmune vasculopathy that is characterised by weakness in proximal muscles and pathognomonic skin rashes. The length of time before the initiation of treatment affects presenting symptoms, laboratory measures, and pathophysiology. It also affects disease outcomes, including the development of pathological calcifications, which are associated with increased morbidity. Both genetic and environmental risk factors seem to have a role in the cause of juvenile dermatomyositis; HLA B8-DRB1✱0301 ancestral haplotype is a strong immunogenetic risk factor, and antecedent infections and birth seasonality suggest that environmental stimuli might increase risk. Activation of dendritic cells with upregulation of genes induced by type-1 interferon (alpha) in muscle and peripheral blood seems to be central to disease pathogenesis. Treatment often includes combinations of corticosteroids, methotrexate, and other immunosuppressive agents. Disease outcome, if treatment is initiated early, is generally good. Randomised controlled trials are needed to define the most effective treatments.

### The treatment and prognosis of dermatomyositis: an updated review [^116gPTjM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. The mainstay of treatment for DM is oral corticosteroids. However, the dose and length of treatment is debated. Adding to the confusion, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the use of various corticosteroid doses and taper rates, and no controlled long-term studies assessing the hypothesis that, unlike systemic lupus erythematous, patients with DM can often achieve long-term remission off therapy. This literature review supports an approach that prednisone should be started at about 1 mg/kg/d, which is then tapered slowly based on the response. As patients respond differently to prednisone, additional therapies may be necessary. When to initiate these therapies requires clinical judgment. In addition, as we learn more about the pathophysiology of DM, newer medications that target specific mechanisms in the immune response may help us better treat the disease. Evidence-based data with long-term follow-up will allow for selection of the best treatment to maximize long-term remission, not simply short-term lowering of the systemic corticosteroid dose.

This is an up-to-date review on external environmental factors for adult-onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). Environmental factors with suggestive evidence including ultraviolet radiation, smoking, infectious agents (viruses in particular), pollutants, medications (ie, statin) and vitamin D deficiency are discussed. We also discuss the potential implications of environmental factors in IIM development, identify current challenges, and provide insight into future investigations.

### Risk factors in critical illness myopathy during the early course of critical illness: a prospective observational study [^114J5cU4]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are controversially discussed as aggravating factors of CIM. It is well established that high-dose application of corticosteroids, for example in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, results in selective loss of thick myosin filaments in skeletal muscle fibers, a so-called steroid-induced myopathy.

Nevertheless, these reports refer to steroid myopathy as a result of high-dose steroid application. A link between 'low-dose hydrocortisone' treatment as adjunctive therapy during septic shock and development of CIM has been postulated, but never proven. Several data indicate that moderate doses of steroids do not prolong mechanical ventilation due to muscle weakness but are related to significantly more ventilator-free days and earlier spontaneous breathing capacity. In an earlier study we did not observe an association between low-dose hydrocortisone application and development of paresis. In this study we were able to show that low-dose hydrocortisone application does not provoke impaired muscle membrane excitability, suggesting that steroid involvement in CIM development is dose dependent.

Furthermore, dosage of analgesics and sedatives was significantly associated with the development of non-excitable muscle membrane. Interpreting higher doses of analgesics and sedatives as higher degrees of immobilization, this finding is in line with recent studies describing that immobilization aggravated neuromuscular weakness in an experimental setting and that early physical mobilization resulted in a better clinical outcome of motor function.

For clinicians it is difficult to estimate patients at risk for the development of CIM. The APACHE-III score has been cited as being able to identify patients at risk for critical illness neuromyopathy. In our study we used the SOFA score because it is widely accepted in the ICU setting, and has been validated to monitor organ dysfunction-related to sepsis. Our results indicate that a SOFA score of 10 or above and/or IL-6 plasma levels of 230 pg/ml or more at the onset of critical illness disclose high-risk patients for the development of non-excitable muscle membrane.

The following limitations of this study need to be addressed. Although we observed a statistically significant effect for IL-6 as a main risk factor for non-excitable muscle membrane, it has to be stressed that the overall effect was small, which may be due to small sample size. It also needs to be mentioned that blood samples were collected at two different time points only and that the course of inflammatory parameters was not followed daily. However, this was designed as a pilot study for hypothesis generation. The clinical significance has to be addressed in further studies.

### Factors associated with severe COVID-19 in people with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy: results from the COVID-19 global rheumatology alliance physician-reported registry [^114pMaWB]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study of 348 patients with IIM, we have identified factors associated with severe COVID-19, namely, older age, male sex, region other than North America/Europe, history of two or more comorbidities, high disease activity, prednisolone-equivalent intake of > 7.5 mg/day and rituximab exposure. COVID-19 diagnosis later in the pandemic was associated with less severe COVID-19.

The increased odds of more severe COVID-19 in people with IIM with age is consistent with reports on people with other rheumatic diseasesand non-rheumatic populations. An increased number of comorbidities being a contributor to COVID-19 severity has also been reported in inflammatory bowel diseaseand in the general population. Increased glucocorticoid use and high disease activity are also associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity consistent with other rheumaticand non-rheumatic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, although the possibility of confounding by indication has been raised as a potential explanation for the glucocorticoid association. In our data set, patients with high disease activity were 3.5 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 outcome compared with those in remission, and those on doses of > 7.5 mg/day of prednisolone-equivalent glucocorticoids were 2.4 times more likely to have a severe COVID-19 outcome. Other studies have also identified rituximab as an important risk factor of COVID-19 adverse outcomes in other conditions.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^115PRBLK]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The findings of this study have implications both to help guide safety monitoring with statin therapy, and to help ensure that patients do not stop their statin therapy due to mistakenly attributing common muscle symptoms to it. The absolute risk of myopathy due to standard statin regimens is low, but individuals can be identified who are at elevated risk by combining a number of independent risk factors in a myopathy risk score. The lack of association of this score with the much more common reports of other muscle symptoms is consistent with the randomized placebo-controlled evidence that statin therapy does not typically cause such symptoms (Take Home Figure). Consequently, CK should be measured in patients who report muscle symptoms on a statin and monitored in the small minority who are found to have moderately elevated CK levels, but otherwise they should be encouraged to continue taking their statin therapy.

### Up-to-date treatment and management of myositis [^115uBSPB]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Myositis, or idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, is an overarching concept that includes dermatomyositis, polymyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and the antisynthetase syndrome. Glucocorticoids are still considered the mainstay of treatment of myositis but some patients require add-on immunosuppressive therapy because of insufficient response to glucocorticoids, relapses when glucocorticoids are tapered, or because they incur glucocorticoid-related side effects.

Recent Findings

The goal of this article was to review (PubMed search from January 2019 through June 2020) the efficacy and safety of standard and novel agents used in adult dermatomyositis, polymyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and the antisynthetase syndrome.

Summary

Established therapies beyond glucocorticoids continue to have a major role in managing patients with myositis. In addition, novel agents are being tried for refractory manifestations of myositis.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115vUst2]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Overview of topics to discuss when prescribing oral glucocorticoids describes that all patients on long-term supraphysiologic therapy should be counseled on the risk for developing exogenous Cushing syndrome at the time of initiation with education on common sequelae including weight gain, sarcopenia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and bone demineralization; the table also lists the risk for developing chronic adrenal insufficiency with emphasis that even transient adrenal insufficiency requires education to raise awareness of the need to stress dose when appropriate; for education on stress dosing strategies, eligible patients are those who have reduced dosing to physiologic or subphysiologic levels and should receive dedicated education at least when dosing approaches a physiologic range to prepare for routine and emergent stress dosing; education on injectable emergency glucocorticoid administration is included among considerations; and for glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, eligible patients are those ready to begin tapering at the time tapering begins, noting that some patients experience symptoms as the doses are tapered.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^113sNSnQ]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-related adverse reactions and risks are commonly seen during the treatment of immune-mediated and inflammatory neuromuscular disorders, and the aim was to develop international consensus guidance on the management of GC-related complications in neuromuscular disorders. American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) consensus guidance was developed by an international task force of 15 experts using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method (RAM). Initial guidance statements were crafted after a thorough literature review and modified after anonymous panel input, with up to three rounds of voting via email to achieve consensus. Statements achieved consensus for general care, monitoring of patients while on GC, osteoporosis prevention, vaccinations, infection screening, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis, and a multidisciplinary approach was emphasized.

### Pulmonary complications of inflammatory myopathy [^111sA6Xt]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary complications cause significant morbidity and mortality in the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Advances in biomarker discovery have facilitated clinical phenotyping, allowing investigators to better define at-risk patient subsets and to potentially gauge disease activity. This serologic characterization has complemented more traditional assessment tools. Pharmacologic management continues to rely on the use of corticosteroids, often in combination with additional immunosuppressive agents. The rarity of myositis-associated interstitial lung disease and lack of controlled trials have limited analyses of treatment efficacy, mandating the development of standardized outcome measures and improvement of data sharing between disciplines.

### Persisting muscle dysfunction in Cushing's syndrome despite biochemical remission [^116nn3Tj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy with self-reported muscle weakness is present in up to 60% of patients with florid Cushing's syndrome (CS). It is reported to be more frequent in men than in women. The development of proximal muscle wasting and weakness is also a typical side effect of systemic glucocorticoid treatment. Based on the common use of steroids for the treatment of several medical conditions, exogenous glucocorticoids have become the most common reason for drug-induced myopathy.

Cushing's syndrome-associated myopathy particularly affects the proximal part of the limbs. The clinical management of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy is difficult, as patients typically experience relevant muscular impairment at the time of initial diagnosis. Quantitative muscle ultrasound is proposed to be a useful diagnostic tool for the detection of CS before the development of symptoms. A specific therapy is not available so far, and current treatment recommendations consist of adequate protein intake and moderate physical exercise. Given that endogenous CS is a rare disease, so far, associated myopathy has been studied only in small patient cohorts. Several characteristic clinical features of CS, including cognitive impairments, fatigue, and an increased cardiovascular risk, can persist even years after a successful cure. We and others have suggested that CS-associated myopathy and muscle damage may continue in the early recovery phase after successful treatment, but its long-term prognosis and outcome is unknown. In retrospective, cross-sectional studies, patients in long-term remission showed decreased muscle strength and a lower aerobic exercise capacity compared to controls. Whether this finding is due to a long-term change of muscle fibers in terms of an irreversible myopathy or due to a persisting cardiorespiratory dysfunction remains controversial. To analyze the long-term outcome of muscle dysfunction in CS, we evaluated the prospective data of the German Cushing's Registry.

### Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy in people with asthma: a systematic review [^115esgWU]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review the current literature on the evidence and the underlying characteristics of glucocorticoids (type, dosage, and duration) associated with myopathy in asthma.

Data Sources

Four electronic databases were searched to October 19, 2020.

Study Selection

Inclusion criteria: adults or adolescents with asthma, taking systemic glucocorticoids, and measures of muscle impairments.

Results

Nine studies met the eligibility criteria. The methodologic quality of most studies was fair or good. Two studies reported significantly lower inspiratory muscle function in outpatients taking daily oral glucocorticoids (≥ 10mg), but one study reported no such difference. No differences was found in limb muscle strength in one study. Only 11–36% patients with acute exacerbation taking glucocorticoids intravenously suffered from limb muscle weakness during/after critical care admissions. Two studies reported significant associations between dosage of oral glucocorticoid use and inspiratory and limb muscle function, whereas seven studies did not find any significant correlations among the characteristics of systemic glucocorticoids and myopathy. Two studies comparing people with non-glucocorticoid dependent asthma taking inhaled glucocorticoid and healthy people did not find any significant differences in their inspiratory muscle strength and endurance.

Conclusions

There were limited studies and inconsistent results on glucocorticoid-induced myopathy in people with asthma, and its association with the characteristics of glucocorticoids use. We recommended future studies should use a commonly accepted operational definition of myopathy, utilize a cohort study design, measure the cumulative dosage of glucocorticoids, and integrate possible confounding factors in the analysis.

### Management of patients with neuromuscular disorders at the time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [^115Kos2m]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The NMD patient without SARS-CoV-2 infection

Risk assessment and stratification

Risk assessment and stratification are crucial to identify NMD patients who are at increased risk to suffer from severe COVID-19 complications. National and international neurologic and neuromuscular networks have produced guidance to help both NMD patients and families and their physicians to prevent and manage SARS-CoV-2 infection in this category. Overall, these documents recognize that the risk of severe complications from COVID-19 is high or moderately high in most NMD patients, apart from those with the mildest forms.

Features associated with high or very high risk include weakness of respiratory muscles with a reduction of respiratory volumes, use of invasive or non-invasive ventilation devices, oropharyngeal weakness determining inefficient airway clearance, the use of immunosuppressive treatments and the presence of severe comorbid conditions and/or multiorgan impairment (Table 1).

Table 1
Factors conferring a high or very high risk of developing severe COVID-19 complications

Some conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, metabolic myopathies and myasthenia gravis, might also determine a worse outcome because of the risk of deterioration or rhabdomyolysis secondary to fever and infections. In addition, patients receiving steroid treatment might undergo an adrenal crisis during fever or infection if steroid dosage is not adjusted. Patients with conditions that do not affect respiratory and swallowing functions and whose immunocompetence is not affected by medications are generally not considered to be high risk. However, there are additional risk factors that might add to the pre-existent neurologic condition and increase the risk in the single patient (Table 2).

Table 2
Additional risk factors increasing the risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease

Therefore, risk assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis. It is worth pointing out that highly-dependent patients that need help from caregivers in basic activities of daily living (BADL) present an increased risk due to their impossibility to isolate.

Following available guidelines, and in the opinion of the authors, NMD patients who do not present a high or very high risk of severe complications should follow general rules outlined in the World Muscle Society (WMS) guidelines. Conversely, high-risk patients should be advised to practice "shielding", that means not leaving their home and avoid any face-to-face contact and social situation unless extremely necessary.

### The spectrum of statin myopathy [^113gyShc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the spectrum of myopathies associated with statin use, with special attention given to a recently identified statin-associated autoimmune-necrotizing myopathy. The clinical characteristics of these patients, pathologic findings, associated autoantibody and immunogenetic risk factors are discussed.

Recent Findings

In the past several years, a novel form of autoimmunemyopathy associated with statin use has been described. Patients with this form of myositis have unique clinical, pathologic and pathophysiologic features when compared with those with self-limited statin toxic myopathy. An autoantibody directed against HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the pharmacologic target of statins, characterizes the disease and can be used in clinical practice to identify these patients and direct therapy. Still, many questions remain to be answered regarding the pathogenic mechanisms at play, risk factors for developing the disease, long-term prognosis and effects of rechallenge with statins or other cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Summary

Statins can cause a spectrum of muscle diseases, most of which are self-limited and improve with discontinuation of the offending agent. In a subgroup, an autoimmune necrotizing myopathy develops that persists after discontinuation of statins. Specific autoantibody testing can help identify these patients in clinical practice and determine the need for immunosuppressive therapy.

### Genetic and environmental risk factors for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^112Wn7TU]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Although the studies discussed are beginning to reveal a number of genetic and possible environmental risk factors for myositis, further investigations are needed to fully understand and classify these syndromes. The difficulties in this process include small numbers of subjects with varying disease phenotypes available for study, polygenic risk factors for which it remains unclear which are primary and which are secondary or linked genes, and the lack of validated environmental exposure assessment tools. New technologies and international collaborative approaches, however, may overcome some of these difficulties and allow us to identify genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as the critical gene-environment interactions in the IIM and its subgroups. Nonetheless, our understanding of these diseases is still in the early stages. Although we have learned a great deal about these disorders through detailed investigations over the last several decades, we have even further to go to understand the environmental triggers and genetic susceptibilities for the myositis syndromes.

### Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy: a comprehensive review [^117An9CZ]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy (GIM) is a prevalent and often underdiagnosed condition that significantly impacts the quality of life and functional capabilities of affected individuals. This review summarises the current understanding of GIM, focussing on its pathophysiology, diagnostic challenges, and emerging therapeutic strategies.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify relevant studies on GIM. Databases, such as PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, were searched using keywords related to GIM, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Studies were selected based on their relevance to the topic and the quality of their methodologies.

Results

GIM is characterised by proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, persistent fatigue, and reduced muscular endurance, predominantly affecting the lower limbs. The pathophysiology involves both catabolic and anti-anabolic mechanisms, leading to the degradation of muscle proteins and inhibiting protein synthesis. Diagnostic challenges include the nonspecific nature of symptoms and the lack of sensitive biomarkers. Emerging therapeutic strategies include the use of growth hormones, insulin-like growth factor-1, branched-chain amino acids, and creatine although their efficacy in humans requires further validation. Physical therapy, particularly resistance and aerobic exercise, has shown promise in managing GIM.

Conclusions

The diagnosis and management of GIM require a multifaceted approach, including early diagnosis, optimised corticosteroid use, and targeted therapies. Future research should focus on developing improved biomarkers for early detection, exploring genetic susceptibility, and validating the efficacy of emerging therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes for patients with GIM.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^114g4cT3]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

A better understanding of factors affecting the risk of myopathy due to statin therapy could help guide safer prescribing in people at higher risk of it (e.g. use of lower doses of more potent statins, perhaps in combination with other LDL-lowering agents) and support more regular monitoring strategies for those in higher-risk groups. When patients do report muscle-related symptoms, measurement of CK levels (particularly during the first year of therapy or after an increase in dose or the addition of interacting medications) is warranted not only to detect the rare cases of myopathy but also to identify individuals with moderately elevated levels who may be more likely to develop myopathy. In addition, the much larger number of patients who do not have elevated CK levels can be reassured that their symptoms are not likely to be a pharmacologic consequence of their statin treatment; therefore, they should not stop their statin therapy and put themselves at increased risk of a heart attack or a stroke.

### Genomewide association study of statin-induced myopathy in patients recruited using the UK clinical practice research datalink [^111QDYK5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Risk of statin‐induced myopathy is associated with variation of the SLCO1B1 gene, which encodes the OATP1B1 hepatic uptake transporter, of which statins are substrates. To date, no other validated genetic risk factors have been identified.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ Undertaking a genomewide association study in a "real‐world" patient cohort recruited via the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, this study aimed to determine whether any other novel genetic risk loci for statin myopathy could be identified.

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ The study suggests that, aside from SLCO1B1, no other risk loci for statin myopathy are apparent. The unexplained statin myopathy risk is likely due to nongenetic risk factors or the influence of rare genetic variants analyzed in this study.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Common genetic variants do not seem to explain statin myopathy risk. The data presented seem to suggest that future translational work in this field should focus on rare variant analysis and on identifying nongenetic risk factors.

### Risk factors for the development of polyneuropathy and myopathy in critically ill patients [^112PKqA3]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Previously, mainly retrospective and a few important prospective studies postulated the role of sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple organ failure, and the use of medication as causative factors for the development of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM). This study aimed to identify the risk factors in the development of CIPNM.

Methods

Prospectively, we studied 98 patients who were on artificial respirators for the development of CIPNM. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score, presence of SIRS, and sepsis severity score at entry; the dosage of midazolam, vecuronium, and steroids at entry and day 7 of artificial respiration; and the use of aminoglycosides at entry were related with time to CIPNM or time of last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used.

Results

Thirty-two patients (33%) developed CIPNM. After multivariate analysis, it was found that the APACHE III score and the presence of SIRS were significantly related with risk for the development of CIPNM. No significant relation was found for the use of midazolam, vecuronium, or steroids. Based on a risk index from a Cox regression model with APACHE III score and presence of SIRS as outcomes, three groups could be constructed with low-, medium-, and high-risk patients for the development of CIPNM.

Conclusions

The APACHE III score, a quantitative index of disease severity based on clinical and laboratory physiologic data, is a valuable predictor for the development of CIPNM in patients in the intensive care unit. Together with the presence of SIRS, it can be used to estimate the risk of developing CIPNM for patients on artificial respirators.

### An exploratory study on physical function in stem cell transplant patients undergoing corticosteroid treatment for acute graft-versus-host-disease [^116C5Vqj]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is treated with corticosteroids, placing patients at risk for steroid myopathy. In this single-arm cohort study, 23 patients who were started on high-dose corticosteroids for acute graft-versus-host disease underwent a series of functional tests (baseline and days 14, 28, and 56): 6-min walk test, hip flexor and knee extensor strength via dynamometry, five times sit-to-stand, Brooke scale for myopathy, modified Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool, and manual muscle testing. Participants were prescribed home exercises including walking and resistance exercises, with low adherence. Fifteen (63%) participants were male and median (range) age was 60 (36–70) yrs. Median (range) corticosteroid duration and cumulative equivalent methylprednisolone dose were 66 (22–165) days and 3625 (1020–11720) mg, respectively. At day 14, there was a significant decline in five times sit-to-stand (P = 0.0132), knee extensor (P = 0.0182), and manual muscle testing (P = 0.0466). Functional tests negatively associated with cumulative corticosteroid dose included 6-min walk test distance (P = 0.0103), hip flexor strength (P = 0.0262), knee extensor strength (P = 0.0369), and manual muscle testing strength (P = 0.0319). Five times sit-to-stand was positively associated with corticosteroid dose (P = 0.0003). In conclusion, stem cell transplant patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids for acute graft-versus-host disease are at risk for weakness detected as early as day 14. Increasing adherence to exercise may mitigate these changes.

### A different look at corticosteroids… [^1176iZBL]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Progression of other opportunistic infections associated with HIV infection as a result of the immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids is a risk that must be considered. While some studies report only minor complications associated with steroid therapy, such as reactivation of localized herpetic lesions, 18 others have reported an increased incidence of infection and cancer. 15 Whether the development of these severe complications is due to effects of the steroids or to the increased longevity and survival rate of these severely immunocompromised patients is unknown.
15. Based on the benefits and risks of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, the current recommendations are not intended for all patients but only for those with confirmed or suspected HIV and PCP infection who are at high risk of respiratory failure and death. Patients at risk include those with an arterial oxygen pressure of less than 70 mm Hg or an arterial-alveolar gradient of more than 35 mm Hg.

14, 16, 19 This therapy should be initiated along with anti-pneumocystis treatment. A confirmatory diagnosis of PCP and HIV infection should be obtained, and other diseases, such as tuberculosis and cryptococcosis, should be ruled out before steroid therapy is begun. 14 Corticosteroids may mask the symptoms of these diseases once the immunosuppressive effect of therapy occurs. Other causes of hyperthyroidism that may be treated with corticosteroids are subacute thyroiditis and thyroid storm. Hyperthyroid disease related to thyroiditis is usually mild and self-limited. Beta blockers may be used to treat symptoms. In subacute thyroiditis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids can be used to relieve thyroid pain and tenderness. 25 Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition of the hyperthyroid state. 26 It most commonly occurs in patients with Graves' disease but may also occur in those with multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma.

27 It is treated by correcting the hyperthyroidism and treating the precipitating events. 26 Correction of the hyperthyroid state involves using drugs such as propylthiouracil or methimazole, beta blockers or corticosteroids, which decrease the peripheral effects of thyroid hormone and the conversion of thyroxine to the more potent triiodothyronine. Studies show that potent corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, combined with appropriate antibiotics reduce the risk of acquired sensorineural deafness and the incidence of other neurologic sequelae in meningitis caused by.

Mechanisms underlying anti-HMGCR Ab+ myopathy remain unknown, and only statin, genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, or both have been suggested. In this study, we found cancer association was more frequent than statin exposure in our cohort, and most of the associated cancers were in an advanced stage and were detected within 1 year of myopathy diagnosis. Our findings suggest that cancer association is one of the risk factors for the development of anti-HMGCR Ab+ myopathy.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution) [^114zArei]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.

Musculoskeletal: Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in children and adolescents and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (i.e., post-menopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy.

Neuro-psychiatric: Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatinine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

### Predictive score for oral corticosteroid-induced initial worsening of seropositive generalized myasthenia gravis [^113zzfVf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Initial worsening of symptoms after the start of corticosteroid administration is a major concern in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG). However, the risk factors or specific patient backgrounds related to this issue have not been fully understood. We aimed to determine the risk factors and developed a scoring system for predicting initial worsening in generalized MG.

Methods

We enrolled 62 generalized MG patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody. Initial worsening was defined as an increment of three points in the Quantitative MG score within 2 weeks after the start of steroid treatment. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the risk factors, and predictive scores were assigned. Bootstrap resampling was applied to evaluate the risk score model's internal validity.

Results

Steroid-induced initial worsening occurred in 26% of MG patients and was correlated with thymoma-associated or early-onset MG (p = 0.018), initial prednisolone doses ≥ 40 mg/day (p = 0.029), and upper limb weakness (p = 0.039). Stepwise multivariate logistic regression identified these three clinical factors for predicting initial worsening in MG. A predictive score of 0–3 points had a bootstrapping area under the curve of 0.770 (0.625–0.878).

Conclusions

Our scoring system based on three clinical characteristics can predict the likelihood of steroid-induced initial worsening in MG.

### The myopathy of statins [^1136tDmJ]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Statins are first-line drugs for prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic disease. Despite the fact that statins are generally well tolerated and have a positive impact on human health, their myotoxic properties should keep physicians on alert. Mechanisms of statin-induced myopathy are still not fully understood. Phenotypic characteristics of patients, individual statin properties, and metabolic interaction with other drugs are important factors that may increase risk for statin myopathy. The lowest effective dose of statin should be used during treatment. Early recognition of myopathy and discontinuation of statin is critical in preventing serious sequelae such as rhabdomyolysis with all its complications.

### Exertional rhabdomyolysis: physiological response or manifestation of an underlying myopathy? [^111Mu7PH]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Other external or acquired provoking factors

In addition to unaccustomed physical exercise, other factors contributing to the risk of ERM include inadequate hydration, high ambient temperatures, supplement use (ephedra, creatinine and herbal weight loss supplements) or certain medications (statins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), illicit drug or alcohol use, or recent viral illnesses. This is illustrated by the report of a 31-year-old athlete and physiology professor who experienced an episode of rhabdomyolysis after resistance training, where high intrinsic motivation, mental stress, use of supplements and dehydration were identified as probably additive provoking factors. Along similar lines, the rare reported cases of rhabdomyolysis with ARF in marathon runners most likely result from the combination of several factors, such as heat stress, dehydration, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or other analgesic use, viral or bacterial infection, and possibly latent myopathies.

Most recently, obstacle races combining aerobic and anaerobic activities performed at different environmental settings (eg, running and/or crawling on mud, diving in freezing water and being exposed to electrical discharges, which are commonly followed by alcohol intake) such as Tough Mudder are becoming popular. This is associated with various risk factors for rhabdomyolysis such as extenuating exercise, dehydration and exposure to heat, infectious disease, electrical pulses, physical trauma and alcohol consumption.

Furthermore, intense and enthusiastic coaching or challenge by peers is the force that drives the already highly motivated professional or recreational athletes beyond their limit of exertion in many cases. This includes sports teams, as well as inmates in prison and soldiers.

Symptoms of CK increase

In many patients, early, uncomplicated rhabdomyolysis is subtle, with delayed-onset myalgia and localised oedema being the only noted symptoms. Myalgia typically occurs 12–36 hours after the exercise. In a minority of patients, generalised weakness and myoglobinuria are the presenting symptoms. However, not all patients present with this classic triad. Other symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever. In severe cases, patients may have delirium and oliguria. Muscle pain and weakness can continue during and after recovery from rhabdomyolysis. In theory, an inflammatory myopathy may occur with subsequent fibrosis of muscle tissue. If the patient is asymptomatic with a persistent and stable raised CK, consider an underlying neuromuscular condition such as muscular dystrophy (table 1).

### Acute pharyngitis… [^113M7avZ]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

An analysis of national claims data found that 21% of adults received at least one outpatient prescription for a short-term systemic corticosteroid over a three-year period, even after excluding patients who had asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, or inflammatory conditions for which chronic steroids may be indicated. The most common diagnoses associated with outpatient prescribing of short-term corticosteroids included upper respiratory infection, spine conditions, allergic rhinitis, acute bronchitis, connective tissue and joint disorders, asthma, and skin disorders. 1 The estimated number needed to harm after a short course of steroids was 140 for fracture, 454 for venous thromboembolism, and 1, 250 for sepsis. There are also case reports of avascular necrosis developing after even one course of systemic steroids.

4, 5 It is well understood that short-term systemic steroids can cause hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, immunocompromised state, mood and sleep disturbance, and fat necrosis when injected. Acute Bronchitis Short-term systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed for patients with acute bronchitis. P = 0. 71). 18 However, patients receiving steroids had more adverse effects, including epigastric symptoms, mood changes, and hyperglycemia. 18 After that systematic review, an RCT identified 269 patients with acute lumbar radiculopathy attributable to a herniated disk; the patients were randomly prescribed prednisone or placebo. 30 In the other study, prednisolone may have helped with rash healing and acute pain at seven and 14 days but not beyond. 31 Neither study showed that steroids decreased the risk for postherpetic neuralgia. 32 Adverse effects of corticosteroids were reported, including gastrointestinal symptoms, and edema.

Corticosteroids could potentially increase the risk of secondary bacterial skin infection, which is a possible complication of herpes zoster. 33, 34 Steroids should not be used without antivirals, may help decrease acute pain for zoster when used concomitantly with antivirals, and do not reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. Research is needed to determine whether there is a role for steroid use after antiviral therapy in those with recalcitrant symptoms. Given the lack of clear effectiveness for steroids and possible adverse effects, routine steroid use for zoster is not supported by evidence.

### Levofloxacin-induced myopathy of the iliac and gluteal muscles [^112WNVCe]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Levofloxacin is one of the prototypical fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In this section, we discuss the case with reference to the wider evidence on the fluoroquinolone class. The pathophysiology of fluoroquinolone-induced myopathy remains inadequately understood. However, there have recently been reports identifying myopathy as a clinical manifestation. A PubMed search restricted to the title/abstract field using the terms 'myopathy' or 'rhabdomyolysis' in combination with 'levofloxacin', 'fluoroquinolone', 'ciprofloxacin', 'moxifloxacin', 'ofloxacin', 'norfloxacin', 'delafloxacin', 'gemifloxacin', 'gatifloxacin' or 'quinolone', together with a title-restricted Google Scholar search using the same keywords, identified 13 reports in which detailed information relevant to the present case could be confirmed, eight of which involved levofloxacin (data as of August 2025).

Drug-induced myopathy arises through various mechanisms, including direct myotoxicity, immune-mediated inflammatory myopathy, indirect muscle damage or a combination of multiple mechanisms. The precise mechanism of fluoroquinolone-induced myopathy is not known, but it is hypothesised that abnormal muscle metabolism caused by fluorine compounds may play a role. Additionally, it is suggested that the mechanism underlying fluoroquinolone-induced tendinitis may also be applicable to myopathy. This hypothesis posits that fluoroquinolones impair integrin function in musculoskeletal tissues by chelating magnesium ions or induction of direct cytotoxic effects through increased production of reactive oxygen species and matrix metalloproteinases involved in tendon cell remodelling.

A recent observational study identified risk factors for fluoroquinolone-induced adverse events, including advanced age, renal impairment, organ transplantation and corticosteroid use. In the present case, end-stage renal disease and advanced age may have been risk factors. In dialysis patients, approximately 24% of administered levofloxacin is removed during the procedure, but during the interdialytic period, its half-life is prolonged due to the reduced systemic clearance. In this case, a 500 mg dose of levofloxacin was initially administered, and it is thought that until dialysis was performed the following day, the plasma concentration of levofloxacin remained elevated compared with individuals with normal renal function.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies or myositis syndromes (the most common forms are polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis) are systemic autoimmune diseases defined by chronic muscle weakness and inflammation of unknown etiology and result in significant morbidity and mortality. Research suggests that categorizing heterogeneous myositis syndromes into mutually exclusive and stable phenotypes by using clinical and immune response features is useful for predicting clinical signs and symptoms, associated genetic and environmental risk factors, and responses to therapy and prognosis. Knowledge of myositis phenotypes should enhance clinicians' ability to recognize and manage these rare disorders.

### Critical illness myopathy [^115FWiq5]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe the incidence, major risk factors, and the clinical, electrophysiological, and histological features of critical illness myopathy (CIM). Major pathogenetic mechanisms and long-term consequences of CIM are also reviewed.

Recent Findings

CIM is frequently associated with critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), and may have a relevant impact on patients' outcome. CIM has an earlier onset than CIP, and recovery is faster. Loss of myosin filaments on muscle biopsy is important to diagnose CIM, and has a good prognosis. Critical illness, use of steroids, and immobility concur in causing CIM.

Summary

A rationale diagnostic approach to CIM using clinical, electrophysiological, and muscle biopsy investigations is important to plan adequate therapy and to predict recovery.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^114Phczi]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy

Of the independent risk factors identified for myopathy (Figure 1), simvastatin dose (with doses other than 40 mg daily only used by European individuals, and 20 and 80 mg doses only used in the SEARCH trial) was the strongest predictor, with > 20-fold higher risk among those receiving simvastatin 80 mg vs. 20 mg daily after allowance for other risk factors. In contrast, there was no significant difference in risk between patients who received 40 or 20 mg doses [hazard ratio (HR): 1.36, 95% CI: 0.31–6.05, P = 0.68). Chinese participants (who all received 40 mg simvastatin daily) had a ∼10-fold risk of myopathy compared to European participants, and older age, lower body mass index, and being female were each independently associated with higher risks. In addition, independent of the other risk factors identified, diabetic individuals receiving hypoglycaemic medication were at over twice the risk of myopathy compared with non-diabetic individuals (HR, 2.43; 95% CI: 1.73–3.41), whereas diabetic individuals not receiving any such medication were at comparable risk to those without diabetes (HR, 1.13; 95% CI: 0.62–2.06). Concomitant use of certain other medications also independently influenced myopathy risk: verapamil was associated with an eight-fold higher risk; niacin-laropiprant (mostly driven by events in Chinese individuals) and diltiazem with more than three-fold higher risks; and beta-blockers and diuretics with about 65–75% higher risks.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^11462Kf1]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Reports of muscle pain or weakness with statin therapy are very common (a quarter of the participants in the present study reported them on at least one occasion) and are often cited as a reason for discontinuing treatment. Patients' perceptions of the possibility of muscle-related problems with statins may influence their likelihood of reporting them (i.e. the 'nocebo' effect). For example, in ASCOT-LLA, the rates of reported muscle symptoms did not differ between participants on atorvastatin 10 mg daily or on matching placebo while blinded to their randomized assignment, whereas during the subsequent 'open-label' phase, those who were receiving much the same statin therapy were 40% more likely to report such symptoms than those who did not. The lack of association in the present study of muscle pain or weakness in the absence of marked CK elevations with a risk score associated with more than 30-fold differences in the relative risk of myopathy is consistent with the lack of an excess of such symptoms with statin therapy in the randomized blinded comparisons. This finding supports the conclusion that these commonly reported muscle symptoms are not part of a continuum with simvastatin-related myopathy, but instead represent a nocebo effect.

The results of this study are relevant to the treatment of millions of patients worldwide. Simvastatin continues to be widely used: for example, it is the second most widely prescribed statin in the US with over 56 million prescriptions in 2017; and, in the UK, nearly 22 million simvastatin prescriptions were dispensed in 2019. The absolute risk of statin-related myopathy on standard statin regimens is typically low; 2 per 10 000 patients per annum with simvastatin 40 mg daily in the present study. However, the absolute risk is influenced considerably by patient characteristics and by concomitant treatment with certain commonly used medications. For example, in this study population, certain risk factor combinations confer differences in risk comparable to doubling simvastatin dose from 40 to 80 mg daily (i.e. ~20-fold higher than average). It should be noted, however, that the benefits of statin treatment typically far outweigh any statin-related myopathy risks even in people who are at the highest risk of myopathy.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^114XdBau]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Conditions in which increased SR Ca²+ leak can be expected should be considered a risk factor when statins are prescribed. Identifying risk factors underlying statin-induced myopathy is important because recent modeling experiments have indicated that improving statin adherence by 50% (e.g. by preventing statin-induced myopathy) would prevent twice as many deaths as a 5% reduction in the cardiovascular risk threshold for statin prescription.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Up to one-third of patients report statin-associated muscle symptoms in observational studies. The incidence in randomized controlled trials is much less. In part, this difference may arise because those susceptible to myopathy or with indications of myopathy in the run-in phase are excluded from trials. However, the experience of muscle pain is subjective, and many patients are primed to expect this because of patient information leaflets and widespread reporting of side effects of statins in the press. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism of statin myopathy and factors that make users more susceptible to overt muscle pain and weakness (even potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis) are essential. In this study, we demonstrated leaky RyRs in skeletal muscle following statin treatment. Although this by itself did not cause overt myopathy, it did provide a strong indicator of the populations who are at real risk of myopathy — those whose lifestyle or genotype predispose them to SR Ca²+ leak. This includes patients who undertake regular high-intensity exercise or have mutations in the RyR1 associated with malignant hyperthermia. In these individuals, statins should be used cautiously with consideration of dose, alternative cholesterol-lowering strategies, and monitoring of serum creatine kinase levels. However, our data do support the view that moderate exercise should be actively encouraged in those who take statins. As well as the positive effects of exercise on cardiovascular health, this type of activity appears to limit potentially harmful effects of statins on skeletal muscle.

Gastrointestinal

Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer.

Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.

Musculoskeletal

Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in children and adolescents and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (i.e., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy.

Neuro-psychiatric

Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease.

### Statin intolerance [^1143qSam]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The term statin intolerance refers to an inability to use statins because of muscle symptoms or elevated creatine kinase, and the major diagnostic challenge is to unambiguously link these to statin use. Roughly 5% to 10% of statin users develop statin intolerance, and because statin use is expected to increase — especially after recent updated guidelines have expanded the statin benefit groups — adverse effects from statins will become a growing issue. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology — and even the terminology — of statin-related muscle injury lacks clarity. Several risk factors have been identified, including advanced age, family history of myopathy and statin dose; many cases manifest only after patients are administered an interacting medication (e.g., azole antifungals, cimetidine, clarithromycin, erythromycin and cyclosporine). The diagnosis of myopathy remains challenging, especially because some patients can have normal serum creatine kinase levels despite demonstrable weakness and muscle biopsy-proven statin-induced myopathy. A statin withdrawal and rechallenge helps patients distinguish whether their myalgia symptoms are because of statins, but, in at least 1 clinical trial, even 5% of placebo-treated patients developed myalgias during a controlled withdrawal and rechallenge. No consensus exists for management of patients with statin intolerance. Many patients can eventually tolerate a statin but often at suboptimal doses. A subset of patients do well with nondaily regimens such as every other day or once weekly dosing. Some patients cannot tolerate statins at all, requiring nonstatin lipid-lowering medications — the benefit of which remains unclear with regard to preventing atherosclerotic events. Ultimately, statin intolerance undermines the drug adherence that is critical for achieving the benefits of lifelong lipid-lowering therapy. In conclusion, statin myopathy is a common challenge in lipid management, and further work is needed to establish a standard diagnostic criterion as well as treatment algorithms.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: new horizons for rheumatologists [^115bGvuA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypotension and volume depletion

With initiation of SGLT-2 inhibitors, blood pressure needs to be closely monitored. By causing osmotic diuresis, urine volume can increase by up to 400–500 mL putting patients at risk for volume depletion and subsequent hypotension. In some cases, diuretics and/or blood pressure medications will need to be lowered or discontinued.

Acute kidney injury

While there is an initial expected decrease in eGFR with the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, in general, these medications have been found to be protective against the development of acute kidney injury.

Hypoglycemia

In isolation, SGLT2 inhibitors are not thought to carry a significant risk of hypoglycemia. A meta-analysis did not show concerns for severe hypoglycemia with SGLT2 inhibitors compared to placebo. As SGLT2 inhibitors are commonly utilized with other treatments for diabetes, however, the clinician must be cognizant of combined risks of medications. Risk is thought to be largely due to background medications. This may be particularly pertinent for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with lupus, as hydroxychloroquine is also associated with a rare risk of hypoglycemia and patients should be monitored for adverse events.

Fragility fractures

A study of canagliflozin reported a higher incidence of fractures in patients on treatment. This is hypothesized to be due to potential risks of orthostatic hypotension as well as actual decreases in bone density. A meta-analysis did identify a trend toward increased risk of fracture for SGLT2 inhibitors (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99–1.16). For the rheumatologist, this risk needs to be kept in mind, particularly in the setting of concomitant high-dose steroid use, an additional risk factor for bone loss.

Lower limb amputation

Finally, SGLT2 inhibitor use has been associated with an increased risk of lower limb amputation and should be used with caution in patients with known risk factors including severe neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease or history of foot ulceration. The mechanisms for this risk remain unclear with hypotheses suggesting volume depletion leads to reduced tissue perforation predisposing to ulceration.

Of note for rheumatologists, there has been one case report for the development of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa associated with the use of empagliflozin and a case of anti-HMGCR positive myopathy after dapagliflozin exposure.

### Intensive-care-unit-acquired muscle weakness [^113J5fbY]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular abnormalities culminating in skeletal-muscle weakness occur very commonly in critically ill patients. Intensive-care-unit (ICU) acquired neuromuscular abnormalities are typically divided into 2 discrete classes: polyneuropathy and myopathy. However, it is likely that these 2 entities commonly coexist, with myopathy being the most common cause of weakness. Major risk factors for ICU-acquired neuromuscular abnormalities include sepsis, corticosteroid administration, and hyperglycemia, with other associated factors including neuromuscular blockade and increasing severity of illness. The pathogenesis of these disorders is not well defined, but probably involves inflammatory injury of nerve and/or muscle that is potentiated by functional denervation and corticosteroids. ICU-acquired neuromuscular abnormalities are associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including higher mortality, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, and increased length of stay. The only intervention proven to reduce the incidence of ICU-acquired neuromuscular abnormalities is intensive insulin therapy. Additional research is necessary to better delineate the causes and pathogenesis of these disorders and to identify potential preventive and therapeutic strategies. In addition, consensus guidelines for its classification and diagnosis are needed.

### Combination of histopathological and electromyographic patterns can help to evaluate functional outcome of critical ill patients with neuromuscular weakness syndromes [^112nnn15]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although acute neuromuscular weakness appears prevalent among patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation, few prospective studies have been reported that include both electrophysiological and histological patterns. Furthermore, nerve biopsy findings are absent, even in recent prospective studies. Our study is among the first to perform electromyography and obtain neuromuscular biopsies prospectively for all patients included. The neurophysiological abnormalities identified were of three types, namely CIP alone, acute myopathy and mixed neurogenic and myogenic disturbances, and they developed in a group of long-term mechanically ventilated patients who had undergone cardiovascular surgery. This type of severe and disturbing complication following cardiac surgery has been described previously, and led to an evaluation of hypothetical risk factors for such neurological disorders.

It is also widely believed that the development of critical illness neuropathy is invariably associated with multiple organ failure, sepsis and SIRS. Thus, CIP probably represents an organ failure caused by sepsis and SIRS, presumably as a result of the same basic mechanisms that lead to multiple organ dysunction, including inflammation, thrombosis, apoptosis and oxidant injury. In the present study, however, peripheral neurological changes occurred in a few patients who did not fulfill accepted objective criteria for sepsis or single organ failure. This observation was previously reported in four series of patients with respiratory failure. As might be expected, in the present study of long-term mechanically ventilated patients following cardiovascular surgery, sepsis and multiple organ failure were common but did not seem to be a prerequisite for the development of acute neuromuscular weakness, the cause of which remains unclear.

It was previously suggested that use of neuromuscular relaxants is associated with neuromuscular disorders in the ICU. Possible mechanisms include persistent effects of these drugs or their active metabolites, pharmacological denervation hastening muscle atrophy, or association of these drugs with intravenous corticosteroids or aminoglycosides. Vecuronium and its steroid components were also implicated as a cause of weakness. In our study atracurium was also administered in patients with prolonged neuromuscular weakness, although it has no steroidal component and there is no accumulation of this molecule in the event of kidney or liver failure. However, we are unable to conclude that neuromuscular relaxants predispose to the development of neuromuscular disorders in general, or any type of neuromuscular disease in particular, because of the lack of a control group. Other observational studies failed to identify neuromuscular relaxants as possible additional risk factors.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy: management and prognosis [^114tfnmS]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

We are entering an exciting era in our understanding and management of the connective tissue diseases and, in particular, inflammatory myopathy. There is an established array of immunosuppressive regimens available to clinicians; rehabilitative and physical therapeutic interventions are evolving to provide many nonpharmacologic options to complement current therapy. Our ability to quantify [table: see text] the disease burden, using newly developed tools to distinguish myositis disease activity from disease damage, will allow us to measure with greater sensitivity the effects of treatment interventions. These measures, together with the development of international consensus regarding the standardization of many clinical trial design parameters, will enhance our capacity to conduct well-designed, prospective, multicenter studies of established and newly developed therapies. The explosion of immunopathogenetic information, in conjunction with novel biologic agents (Table 4), will afford investigators a treatment menu with multiple therapeutic options. The continuing challenge for the practitioner is the development of a logical, well-studied, multifaceted, and multidisciplinary holistic approach that optimizes the risk: benefit ratio for each individual patient and uses a rational combination of immunomodulatory agents in conjunction with ancillary measures.

Glucocorticoid (GC) management in neuromuscular disease — consensus recommendations for general care and screening during chronic therapy specify that a multidisciplinary approach with the primary care clinician and relevant specialists should be established early; patients starting chronic GC should be counseled on common and serious side effects; glycemic control should be checked before initiation and at regular intervals in coordination with the primary care clinician, endocrinologist, or the multidisciplinary team; blood pressure should be monitored and managed regularly; in patients with risk factors for peptic ulcer disease such as chronic or frequent NSAID use, pharmacologic therapy for peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis should be prescribed unless there is a contraindication; ophthalmological examination is recommended for patients on therapy for ≥ 6 months and annually thereafter or when there is a concern for cataracts or glaucoma; and to avoid GC treatment withdrawal, chronic glucocorticoid therapy should be tapered slowly and not stopped abruptly. The guidance notes there is no single "correct" GC tapering regimen and that specific tapering regimens were not evaluated or voted upon.

### Risk factors in critical illness myopathy during the early course of critical illness: a prospective observational study [^113cUzSW]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Systemic inflammation during early critical illness turned out to be the main risk factor for the development of non-excitable muscle membrane indicating CIM. It may be hypothesized that inflammation-induced impairment of growth factor-mediated intracellular signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of CIM. Furthermore, adjunctive treatment with low-dose hydrocortisone during septic shock was not associated with development of CIM.

Recommendations

Recommendations are followed by parentheses detailing GRADE and SoA details (strength of recommendation, quality of body of evidence, SoA).

(i) How should skeletal muscle inflammation (myositis) be treated?

1 -High dose glucocorticoids should be used to treat active muscle inflammation at time of treatment induction (1, B, 100%).

1a - Adult-specific. Oral prednisolone at a dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, usually 40–60 mg, is recommended (1, B, 100%).

1b - Paediatric-specific. Oral prednisolone at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day or intravenous methylprednisolone pulses 30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g daily i.v. dose is recommended (1, B, 100%).

1c -Intravenous methylprednisolone is to be considered, especially when there are concerns about gastrointestinal absorption. Use of intravenous methylprednisolone may allow increased therapeutic effect and less toxicity compared with oral glucocorticoid (2, B, 96%).

2 -Oral prednisolone should be tapered according to clinical response (1, B, 100%).

3 -Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs should be used to reduce muscle inflammation, achieve clinical remission and reduce steroid burden (1, C, 100%).

3a - Paediatric-specific. Early, complete control of muscle weakness and inflammation should be sought in juvenile-onset IIM, with the aim of improving outcomes and reducing disease-related complications (1, B, 100%).

3b - Paediatric-specific. A combination of high dose glucocorticoid and methotrexate should be used as first-line treatment in most cases (1, B, 100%).

3c - Paediatric-specific. A combination of prednisolone and methotrexate, as opposed to prednisolone and ciclosporin, should be used for the treatment of juvenile-onset IIM as this has a more favourable side effect profile (1, B, 100%).

### Steroid-induced myopathy in the ICU [^11541tX6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of steroid-induced myopathy resulting from prolonged administration of corticosteroids in an asthmatic patient in a medical intensive care unit.

Case Summary

A 30-year-old white man presented with status asthmaticus requiring intubation for respiratory failure. His hospital course was complicated by the need for reintubation and the development of "quadriplegia". Electromyography does not identify neuropathy. After rapid tapering of systemic steroids, the patient quickly regained muscle strength, was extubated, and was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for prolonged physical therapy.

Discussion

Steroid-induced myopathy is a rare occurrence in the intensive care setting. Cases of myopathy that have been reported have been associated with prolonged and combined use of corticosteroids with neuromuscular blocking agents or aminoglycosides. Corticosteroids are thought to produce deleterious effects through 1 or all of 3 main pathways: altered electrical excitability of muscle fibers, loss of thick filaments, and/or inhibition of protein synthesis. All of these pathways are believed to increase the rate of muscle catabolism and result in loss of muscle movement.

Conclusions

Steroid-induced myopathy is a complication of high-dose steroid use. Unfortunately, in this patient, initial treatment of status asthmaticus required intravenous steroids in high doses to adequately treat the presenting illness. Clinicians should be aware of neuromuscular findings and act aggressively to appropriately eliminate systemic steroids from the treatment regimen.

### Reversible tetraplegia after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy and septic shock: a case of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy with acute onset and complete recovery [^111feMU1]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

PNL is a procedure that requires indications of the treatment of large, hard infected stones, obstruction-related stones, extracorporeal lithotripsy failures and stones related with anatomic variations. Most of the complications of PNL are minor and without clinical repercussion. Although fever and infection after PNL are common, progression to sepsis is rare. Sepsis may develop as a result of bacteriemia or endotoxemia after stone or urinary tract manipulation and may trigger an inflammatory cascade leading to septic shock.

CIP is an acute axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy and CIM is an acute primary myopathy with a continuum of myopathic findings, from myopathies with pure functional impairment and normal histology to myopathies with atrophy and necrosis. According to Koch et al. CIM was more frequent than CIP and most patients with CIP featured concomitant CIM. Approximately 70–80% of critically ill patients develop CIP and a comparable percentage of them develop CIM. Sepsis, SIRS, MOF and ARDS are the most common risk factors for CIP and/or CIM; prolonged ICU stay, medication and infections, are also major risk factors for CIP/CIM. Especially, Gram-negative bacteremia is an independent risk factor for the development of CIP/CIM. Other identified risk factors include female sex, hyperglycemia, severe illness, long duration of organ dysfunction, renal failure and renal replacement therapy, hyperosmolarity, malnutrition, low serum albumin, parenteral nutrition, vasopressor and catecholamine support, and septic encephalopathy, etc. Although excessive use of corticosteroids may lead to increased incidence of CIM, short-term use of methylprednisolone was meant to treat the septic shock in our case. Since the time interval between the initiation of methylprednisolone therapy and the onset of paralysis is quite short, we do not believe that the onset of CIM was due to methylprednisolone itself.

### Steroid side effects… [^111XgmX7]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Grennan D, Wang S. Steroid Side Effects. JAMA. 2019; 322:

282. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.8506 Steroid medications, which are prescribed in many different forms for many different conditions, have a multitude of side effects. Corticosteroid medications — often just called steroids by clinicians and patients — are used to reduce inflammation and inhibit the immune system. They are also associated with many side effects. Corticosteroid medications are synthetic versions of the human steroid hormone cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal glands. These are different from the synthetic versions of the human steroid hormone testosterone used by some athletes or the synthetic versions of the human steroid hormone estrogen used by some women after menopause. Steroids can be taken as a tablet for simple rashes or mild asthma attacks or given intravenously for flares of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis.

To minimize the side effects of oral or intravenous steroids, steroid treatments that act locally were developed. Examples include Topical application to the skin for conditions like eczema or psoriasis. Infection: Steroids are effective in treating autoimmune diseases because they reduce the ability of the immune system to function. Patients taking steroids are not only more susceptible to infections but more likely to have severe or unusual infections. These patients should be aware of their increased risk of infection, and their physicians may recommend additional anti-infective medications. Adrenal crisis: Cortisol is produced in the adrenal glands. It has many effects throughout the body, including regulating blood pressure. Because steroids are so similar to cortisol, prolonged use of systemic steroids at higher doses can cause the adrenal glands to stop making cortisol.

If the systemic steroid is stopped suddenly, this adrenal suppression and resulting lack of steroid can cause a wide range of symptoms, such as dangerously low blood pressure. Health care practitioners are cautious in prescribing steroids because of the side effects. They prescribe them only when necessary and for as short a time as possible. Local rather than systemic therapy is preferable and prescribed when possible. If a patient needs to stop taking a systemic steroid after taking it for a long time, they are prescribed a gradually reduced dose to give the adrenal glands time to "wake up" and start producing cortisol again. When longer courses of higher-dose systemic steroids are necessary, as in some autoimmune conditions, the patient is monitored closely for side effects.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^113tYoWg]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

According to guidelines, glucocorticoids with an initial dose (prednisone equivalent) of 1 mg/kg body weight per day, combined with azathioprine or methotrexate, are sufficient in most cases on the new diagnosis of DM. As other cases with severe clinical courses benefitted from high-dose glucocorticoid regimens, we opted for the same approach, which later necessitated a second-line therapy with IVIG due to symptom exacerbation under first-line therapy.

Learning points

In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), a comprehensive clinical evaluation — including diagnostic investigations such as laboratory parameters and antibody profiling — is essential for accurate diagnosis.
Both clinical and laboratory findings can provide valuable insights into the risk of an underlying malignancy.
Cancer screening should be guided by risk stratification to avoid missing a malignancy and to ensure appropriate causal treatment.
A thorough search for rarely associated malignancies is warranted.

### Toxic myopathies [^113dLuan]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our aim is to highlight major advances reported in the last few years in drug-induced muscle toxicity.

Recent Findings

Our focus is on myopathies induced by statins and immune checkpoint inhibitors with a brief overview of rare steroid myopathies. Statin muscle injury is frequently because of direct toxicity rather than an autoimmune mechanism. Laboratory testing and muscle pathologic features distinguish these two conditions. Statin-associated necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (SANAM) is associated with an autoantibody in 66% of cases targeting the HMGCR enzyme. The later autoantibody is a marker for necrotizing autoimmune myopathy, regardless of statin exposure. In SANAM, MHC-I antigens are expressed on the surface of intact muscle fibers. Genetic HLA loci predispose patients exposed to statins to immunologic toxicity. SANAM requires long-term therapy with multiple immunosuppressive therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are powerful emerging therapies for advanced cancer that pause a novel therapeutic challenge.

Summary

This review is focused on statins, the most prevalent myotoxic drug class. In addition, we examine the accumulating body of evidence of muscle injury and its management with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We anticipate the reader to become more knowledgeable in recent discoveries related to these myotoxic drugs, and their mechanisms of action and management.

### Outcomes in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myopathy and prolonged follow-up [^116BMD4c]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Two-thirds of patients (70%, 16/23) had residual symptoms/signs at 6 months, and this number gradually declined to 40% (6/15) at 12 months (Figure 3B). Dissecting whether these symptoms/signs represent ongoing inflammation or simply residual damage to muscle tissue is challenging, but patients who stopped immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments at 3 months continued to improve over time from a neurologic perspective. This suggests that the gradual improvement noted over the span of 12 months may represent slow muscle recuperation and compensatory mechanisms rather than active persistent inflammation. Nevertheless, reports of patients with long-term corticosteroid dependency, including a patient in our cohort who experienced an exacerbation on corticosteroid taper 4 months from symptom onset, suggest that some patients may experience chronic inflammation. Future studies prospectively following patients treated with a prolonged vs short treatment course would be necessary to identify optimal treatment duration but may be limited by the relative rarity of this disease and the multiple concomitant comorbidities that these patients have, which may affect both morbidity and mortality.

### Diagnosis and management of complications from the treatment of primary central nervous system tumors in adults [^114Z8ogR]. Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Steroids

Steroids have been a mainstay in the symptomatic treatment of brain tumor patients for decades. They are mainly used to reduce the tumor-surrounding edema, which is commonly found in different types of brain tumors. By reducing mass effect, steroids provide relief from various symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and many focal neurological deficits. Dexamethasone is most frequently used with daily doses mostly in the range of 2–16 mg. Despite their undisputed beneficial effects on the patients' quality of life, steroids are also associated with significant toxicities which ultimately override the positive aspects; furthermore, steroid intake may be associated with inferior survival in glioblastoma. Treatment with steroids is associated with increased blood sugar levels, particularly in patients with diabetes. These patients should be checked carefully for a hyperglycemic condition that may require appropriate antidiabetic treatment. Similarly, an increase in blood pressure may require regular controls and the initiation or adaption of antihypertensive medication. Insomnia developing during steroid intake may be prevented or reduced by administering steroids as a single dose in the morning, together with sleeping aids, if absolutely needed. Obstructive sleep apnea may develop due to the redistribution of fat. More problematic side effects that typically occur in patients with a continuous need of steroid treatment comprise gastric ulceration, rarely bowel perforation, osteoporosis with the risk of vertebral fractures, myopathy, depression, and less frequently psychosis. Psychiatric disorders related to steroids need to be appropriately treated with antidepressant and neuroleptic drugs and psychiatric consultations may be required. A causative role for comedications such as levetiracetam must be considered. No specific prophylaxis other than reducing the steroid dose is available. In patients at risk for developing osteoporosis, supplementation with calcium and vitamin D formulations is frequently used in the absence of compelling evidence. Myopathy may represent a particular problem for patients with brain tumors as they are frequently affected by neurological deficits such as tumor-related paresis, ataxia, and other symptoms, which may worsen because of myopathy-associated weakness. Physiotherapy may help to prevent falls and maintain quality of life. Because of an increased risk for the occurrence of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, prophylactic treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine inhalations should be evaluated in patients requiring steroid treatment for more than 4 weeks or those taking steroids in combination with alkylating chemotherapy or patients low lymphocyte counts. While the interaction of steroids with immunotherapeutic agents has not yet been fully clarified, there is increasing evidence that concurrent steroid intake interferes with the antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

(iv) What management steps should be taken to reduce fracture risk in people with IIM?

1 - Adult-specific. A bone health assessment should be performed, regardless of glucocorticoid therapy, and appropriate management instigated (1, B, 100%).

Fracture risk consideration in IIM is important given glucocorticoid use, female preponderance, and average age of onset for adult disease. Fragility fracture risk assessment should be carried out in accordance with NICE guidance at time of diagnosis and whenever risk factors change. Glucocorticoid weaning, once remission is attained, may reduce fragility fracture risk.

Studies, although limited by small populations, suggest JDM is associated with increased vertebral fracture risk, even before substantial corticosteroid exposure.

### Steroid-induced myopathy in patients intubated due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111aU2FV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine incidence, risk factors and impact on various outcome parameters of the development of acute quadriplegic myopathy in a selected population of critically ill patients.

Setting

A prospective cohort study carried out in the intensive care unit of a tertiary-level university hospital.

Patients

All patients admitted due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and received high doses of intravenous corticosteroids.

Interventions

A neurophysiological study was performed in all cases at the onset of weaning. Muscular biopsy was taken when the neurophysiological study revealed a myopathic pattern.

Measurements and Results

Twenty-six patients were enrolled in the study. Nine patients (34.6%) developed myopathy. Only seven patients were treated with muscle relaxants. Histology confirmed the diagnosis in the three patients who underwent muscle biopsy. APACHE II score at admission, the rate of sepsis and the total doses of corticosteroids were significantly higher in patients with myopathy compared with those patients that did not develop it. Myopathy is associated with an increase in the duration of mechanical ventilation [15.4 (9.2) versus 5.7 (3.9) days; p < 0.006], the length of ICU stay [23.6 (10.7) versus 11.4 (7.05) days; p < 0.003] and hospital stay [33.3 (19.2) versus 21.2 (16.1) days; p < 0.034)]. Myopathy was not associated with increased mortality.

Conclusions

In the population under study, severity of illness at admission, the development of sepsis and the total dose of corticosteroids are factors associated with the occurrence of myopathy after the administration of corticosteroids. Myopathy was associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and in-hospital stay.

### Risk factors in critical illness myopathy during the early course of critical illness: a prospective observational study [^115re1P4]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

ICU-acquired muscle weakness is a serious complication of critical illness. It has been recognized as the clinical manifestation of an ICU-acquired peripheral neuromuscular pathology that, with regard to muscle pathology, is characterized by atrophy of type II muscle fibres and thick filament myopathy.

Diagnosis of critical illness myopathy (CIM) is either based on clinical proof of muscle weakness after awakening from analgesia and sedation, measurement of short duration low amplitude muscle unit potentials, depending on voluntary muscle contraction, or histological confirmation of muscle pathology. As muscle biopsies are not routinely taken at the onset of critical illness neither approach is suitable to diagnose CIM at early critical illness.

Recent studies described measurements of muscle membrane excitability after direct muscle stimulation as a valid electrophysiological marker indicating CIM in critically ill patients. As the investigation of muscle membrane excitability is independent of voluntary muscle contraction, it enables the detection of CIM during early critical illness when clinical evaluation is generally not applicable. Attempts to determine predisposing risk factors for CIM have yielded mixed results. Illness severity, duration of immobility, systemic inflammation, hyperglycemia, and the use of corticosteroids or neuromuscular blocking agents are disputed risk factors. Recent data suggest a relation between growth factor-mediated dysregulation of glucose and protein metabolism due to systemic inflammation and the development of myopathy.

Measurement of muscle membrane excitability during early critical illness offers a unique opportunity to better understand and investigate early markers and potential risk factors for non-excitable muscle membrane.

The objective of this study is to investigate predisposing risk factors for the development of non-excitable muscle membrane during early critical illness, particularly considering concentration patterns of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-system prior to first proof of pathologically reduced muscle membrane excitability.

### Triamcinolone acetonide (Triesence) [^1133pmWY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Effect on Growth and Development

Long-term use of corticosteroids can have negative effects on growth and development in children. Growth and development of pediatric patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully monitored.

5.10 Use in Pregnancy

Triamcinolone acetonide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Human and animal studies suggest that use of corticosteroids during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of orofacial clefts, intrauterine growth restriction and decreased birth weight. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while using this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.11 Weight Gain

Systemically administered corticosteroids may increase appetite and cause weight gain.

5.12 Neuromuscular Effects

Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that they affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect.

An acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs (e.g., pancuronium). This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.

5.13 Kaposi's Sarcoma

Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

### Current overview of statin-induced myopathy [^115AZV5z]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Statins are an efficacious and well-tolerated class of lipid-altering agents that have been shown to reduce the risk of initial and recurrent cardiovascular events. However, cerivastatin was withdrawn from the world market because of its potential for severe myotoxic effects. Since the benefits of statin treatment outweigh the small risk of adverse events, statins remain the first-line therapy for lipid lowering and preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The risk of myopathy may be minimized with the appropriate choice of agent and by identifying patients at risk of myotoxic effects. Elderly or female patients, or those with concomitant medications or impaired metabolic processes, may be at increased risk and should be monitored closely. The risk of myopathy may also be inferred from the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of the statin used. Since myotoxic events are more frequent at higher doses, statins that are effective in reducing cholesterol levels and helping patients to reach target levels at start doses may be useful. The lipophilicity of a statin and its potential for drug-drug interactions may also help to determine the likelihood of muscular effects. Drug-drug interactions may be avoided by selecting a statin that does not share the same metabolic pathway.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies-the burden of disease: cohort analysis focusing on damage and comorbidities [^112TtAnr]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Background

Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIM) continue to be a major clinical challenge worldwide. The exact aetiopathogenesis of this chronic and disabling disease remains elusive, preventing the development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies and leading to a high incidence of damage. The complexity of treating these diseases is even greater due to the numerous comorbidities that affect these patients.

Methods

Retrospective review of the cohort of patients diagnosed with IIM and followed in a dedicated unit of a tertiary hospital between 1971 and December 2022, with particular attention to damage and comorbidities. Damage was assessed using the Myositis Damage Index. Comorbidities were recorded and analysed as a whole and also assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index (DI) was performed by phone call in December 2022, to all patients actively followed-up in the Unit.

Results

Analysis of 149 patients with a mean follow-up of 9 years (range 0–51) revealed > 90% with damage and comorbidities. Most comorbidities were a consequence of the damage and were particularly related to prolonged steroid therapy. Cardiovascular damage, which occurred either as cardiovascular risk factors or as end-organ sequelae (cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease), was the main cause and a major contributor to death. Depression was also high on the list of associated comorbidities. Median HAQ was 2.09 representing high negative impact in quality of life.

Conclusions

Although survival rates have increased in recent decades, patients with IIM carry a high burden of disease with poor quality of life, mainly caused by damage and comorbidities. While comorbidities accumulation is the major factor for poor quality of life, damage severity is the main predictor for mortality. Improved therapeutic strategies are needed to reduce the need for steroids and to introduce routine screening and management of comorbidities as an essential partner of immunosuppressive therapy, leading to comprehensive care of myositis patients and effective improvement of their quality of life.

### Neuromuscular manifestations of critical illness [^1143sc2g]. Muscle & Nerve (2005). Low credibility.

Critical illness, more precisely defined as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), occurs in 20%-50% of patients who have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 1 week in an intensive care unit. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and myopathy (CIM), singly or in combination, occur commonly in these patients and present as limb weakness and difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. Critical illness myopathy can be subdivided into thick-filament (myosin) loss, cachectic myopathy, acute rhabdomyolysis, and acute necrotizing myopathy of intensive care. SIRS is the predominant underlying factor in CIP and is likely a factor in CIM even though the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids predominate in CIM. Identification and characterization of the polyneuropathy and myopathy depend upon neurological examination, electrophysiological studies, measurement of serum creatine kinase, and, if features suggest a myopathy, muscle biopsy.

### Walking inability in children during early treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: incidence and risk factors [^114BRCKt]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This explorative study revealed that more than one out of four paediatric ALL patients temporarily stopped walking during intensive early treatment phases. Remarkably, we did not find treatment protocol (i.e. prednisone vs. dexamethasone) to be a risk factor for walking inability. Although no studies have examined the incidence of complete walking inability during the early treatment phases in paediatric ALL patients before, studies in line with our findings described impaired motor performance, especially balance problems, during early treatment phases and impaired quadriceps strength, walking distance and overall motor function shortly after diagnosis in paediatric ALL patients. These effects might be due to high-dose glucocorticoid treatment leading to muscle weakness and vincristine and its related peripheral neuropathy. Although we hypothesized that dexamethasone would be related to a higher incidence of walking inability compared to prednisone, we did not observe this in our study. Teuffel et al. reported a seven times higher risk of myopathy in paediatric ALL patients treated with dexamethasone compared to those receiving prednisone for induction therapy in their systematic review. As myopathy leads to muscle weakness, we hypothesized treatment protocol to be an important cause of walking inability in paediatric patients with ALL. However, we are unaware of how myopathy was assessed previously which might have caused a discrepancy with our study. Moreover, walking ability might also be influenced by other ALL symptoms and side effects of treatment including poor nutritional status and physical inactivity and subsequent changes in body composition. Besides glucocorticoids, paediatric ALL patients receive vincristine on days 8, 15, 22 and 29 according to the ALL-11 protocol and on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 according to the ALLTogether1 protocol. The vincristine dose per day patients receive is similar for all patients. By including treatment protocol into our regression models, we tried to correct for the effect of steroids (prednisone vs. dexamethasone) and vincristine on walking inability.

### Adverse effects in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica… [^115xwCUn]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica is a disease characterized by pain and stiffness in the proximal regions of the extremities and the trunk. It tends to occur in middle-aged and elderly persons who often experience pain and stiffness for a month or longer before diagnosis. Standard therapy consists of oral corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or both. Because these medications are associated with adverse side effects, Gabriel and colleagues performed a retrospective study to analyze the long-term incidence and risks of adverse events associated with their use in patients diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica. The authors reviewed an extensive database of patients who were part of the Rochester Epidemiology Project and identified all patients diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica between 1970 and 1991.

Diagnostic criteria included an age of 50 years or older; a sedimentation rate of 40 mm per hour or more; and bilateral pain and morning stiffness for at least one month involving two of the following areas: neck or torso, shoulders or proximal regions of the arms. When the diagnosis was questionable, three rheumatologists independently reviewed the patient's medical data and reached a consensus. A total of 232 patients were included in the study. Patients were then categorized into three groups: those treated with corticosteroids alone, those treated with NSAIDs alone and those treated with both. Data on adverse events often associated with steroid or NSAID use were collected. The mean age at diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica was 72. 9 years, and the average follow-up time was eight years. Among the 175 patients treated with corticosteroids, the mean duration of therapy was 2. 4 years, and the average daily dosage was
9. 6 mg.

Patients who did not receive medical care or consultation from a rheumatologist received an average initial daily dosage of prednisone that was 9. 5 mg higher than the dosage in patients who did have a rheumatologist involved in their medical care. The three variables found to independently increase the risk of an adverse event were female sex, older age at diagnosis and a cumulative dose of prednisone in excess of 1, 800 mg. Preventive measures, which include the addition of calcium, estrogen or bisphosphonate therapy, should be considered in all of these patients. — j. t. k.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: definition and management of refractory disease [^116HrhEJ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Adult idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, commonly referred to as myositis, are a heterogeneous group of diseases with an autoimmune etiology. In this review, the authors are going to focus on myositis excluding inclusion body myositis. They will review the prognostic factors (for mortality and response to steroids), define refractory disease, introduce a new concept (presumed refractory disease), analyze definitions of active disease, damage and improvement criteria, and summarize therapeutic alternatives for refractory patients, based on different disease phenotypes.

### Update on statin-associated myopathy symptoms in the view of new clinical management strategies [^117NkUvS]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Purpose of this review is to highlight the recent findings in terms of clinical aspects, pathogenic mechanisms and managements of statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and focusing on the use of novel therapeutic alternatives in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

While extensive research has been conducted on SAMS, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Recent findings continue to explore various aspects, including potential risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies. Managing SAMS involves a careful assessment to confirm the diagnosis, a stepwise approach to treatment that may include dose adjustments, switching statins, considering alternate-day dosing, and exploring nonstatin therapies, all while prioritizing patient well being and cardiovascular risk reduction through shared decision-making and ongoing monitoring. In recent years, the therapeutic landscape has expanded with the introduction of several novel lipid-lowering agents, providing valuable alternatives for both statin-tolerant and statin-intolerant patients but their use in clinical practice is still limited because of high costs, regulatory limitations and type of administration.

Summary

Given the increasing use of both traditional and emerging lipid-lowering therapies, a clear understanding of their comparative safety, particularly regarding musculoskeletal adverse effects, is essential for guiding clinical decision-making.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad? [^116GNmk4]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The Adverse Effects of Prescribed GCs

The clinical benefits of GCs are not in doubt. However, especially when used at high doses, for a prolonged period of time (> 2 weeks), and in a reverse circadian regimen (higher doses in the evening compared to the morning), treatment is associated with significant adverse effects. These include, but are not limited to, increased overall mortality, metabolic effects [glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia], and musculoskeletal disorders (osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, myopathy, sarcopenia), as well as hypertension, adrenal suppression, and an increased risk of infection (Fig. 2). The breadth and potential severity of this adverse effect profile often creates a challenging decision for both treating clinicians and patients who derive clinical benefit from GC treatment, while accepting the significant side-effects profile that may occur. Here, we summarize the published data detailing the adverse effects of GC therapy and outline the current management strategies that have been used.

### Independent risk factors for simvastatin-related myopathy and relevance to different types of muscle symptom [^113er2s3]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Distinction between myopathy and other muscle symptoms

The combined myopathy risk score had a median of 7.2 (IQR 6.1–8.0) in myopathy cases and 4.2 (IQR 3.1–5.6) in other participants. It was a very strong predictor of myopathy, with a 34-fold difference in myopathy risk between the top and bottom thirds (HR, 34.35; 95% CI: 12.73–92.69; P for trend across thirds = 9.1 × 10⁻⁴⁸; Figure 2). Patients with muscle symptoms and less extreme CK elevations (CK > 5 ≤ 10× ULN; n = 62) than required for the definition of myopathy had only a 3.5-fold difference in risk between top and bottom thirds of the myopathy risk score (HR, 3.51; 95% CI: 1.74–7.09; P for trend across thirds = 6.1 × 10 −5).

In contrast, among the large number of patients (n = 15 208) reporting any muscle symptoms while taking a statin other than those confirmed to be myopathy, there was no association with the myopathy risk score (HR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96–1.04; P for trend across thirds = 0.93; Figure 2). The associations between each of the independent variables and these other muscle symptoms are presented in Supplementary material online, Table S4.
