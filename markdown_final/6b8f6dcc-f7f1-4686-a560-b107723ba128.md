## Question

​Renal artery aneurysm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step evaluation and management algorithm for suspected or confirmed renal artery aneurysm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about who warrants evaluation and the best initial imaging strategy. Then, I should define anatomical characterization that drives risk stratification. Next, I will delineate indications for repair versus surveillance, including special populations. After that, I need to select the optimal modality and technique based on anatomy and patient factors. Finally, I will plan perioperative care and surveillance, acknowledging controversies and the natural history data that temper intervention thresholds.

> Let me first confirm which patients prompt suspicion and how to image them, because missing a high-risk context (e.g., pregnancy) would be unsafe. Patients may be identified via refractory hypertension, hematuria, flank pain, or incidentally on imaging; connective tissue disorders and fibromuscular dysplasia should heighten suspicion, and women of childbearing age merit special attention given rupture risk in pregnancy [^114Xba7F] [^115gbUm4]. Wait, let me verify the imaging approach: CTA is recommended first-line for diagnosis, anatomical delineation, and procedural planning; if radiation or contrast is problematic, non-contrast MRA is reasonable; duplex ultrasound can assist in detection and surveillance when acoustic windows are favorable [^116BmCLP] [^111dPQGj] [^112ggy7s] [^115XzroV].

> I should now characterize the aneurysm in a way that maps to treatment options, and I need to ensure I capture neck morphology, branching, and multiplicity. Key features include location along the main trunk, bifurcation, or distal branches; maximal diameter; neck width; side-branch involvement; calcification or thrombus; and multiplicity, which occurs in roughly a fifth of cases, as this anatomy predicts feasibility of endovascular approaches versus the need for open or hybrid strategies [^114B4HpC] [^116v1TQj]. Hold on, I should verify classification utility: contemporary anatomic schemes that discriminate narrow- versus wide-neck and branch complexity improve planning and interobserver agreement, supporting their operational use in modality selection [^114B4HpC].

> Next, I need to decide when to intervene versus surveil, and I should double-check the size threshold because historical 2 cm cutoffs may no longer apply. For asymptomatic true RAAs, ESVS 2025 recommends considering repair at diameter ≥ 30 mm; for < 30 mm and asymptomatic, annual surveillance is appropriate, typically with duplex and CTA as needed for image quality; this reflects contemporary data showing low rupture rates in conservatively managed cohorts [^111FhzHX] [^113ydApm] [^115XzroV] [^1138hEcy]. But wait, what about the older 2 cm rule? Earlier literature and reviews supported lower thresholds, yet pooled natural history now suggests very slow growth and rare rupture, bolstering the modern 3 cm criterion for asymptomatic lesions [^117RPerz] [^113x7NvV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on size alone, because symptoms and special circumstances override thresholds. Symptomatic RAAs, including those with pain, hematuria, or uncontrolled hypertension, warrant urgent repair regardless of size, and any rupture mandates emergent intervention; pregnancy or childbearing potential is a strong indication for treatment at any size due to maternal–fetal risk; mycotic aneurysms generally require urgent open surgery with antibiotics, while endovascular palliation is reserved for patients unfit for open repair [^1152xdLs] [^115kt5Nf] [^114aC8HC] [^116V8uua] [^116aLxHJ] [^114szdYw].

> I will now examine how to choose between endovascular and open approaches, and I need to ensure anatomy truly supports an endovascular-first strategy. For anatomically suitable RAAs, guidelines recommend endovascular repair over open surgery, and when possible, arterial reconstruction is favored over parent vessel occlusion to preserve renal parenchyma; multidisciplinary planning is essential to align anatomy, device options, and preservation goals [^116rsUx1] [^111MQxF9] [^113879rS]. Hmm, wait a minute, if the main feeding vessel is inaccessible or a mass effect must be relieved, open or hybrid surgery remains appropriate, so I should not overcommit to an endovascular approach in those scenarios [^112yADUk].

> Let me consider specific endovascular techniques and match them to morphology, and I should confirm renal preservation implications. Coil packing is preferred for saccular, narrow-neck aneurysms, often with detachable coils to achieve dense packing; balloon remodeling can mitigate coil herniation for wider necks; covered stents are options for main renal artery lesions when branch preservation is feasible; in select complex anatomies, flow-modulating stents may preserve branch perfusion, though data are limited and selection is case-specific; overall, endovascular series show high technical success with low periprocedural mortality and acceptable renal preservation, acknowledging an infarction risk and need for surveillance against reperfusion [^116pWsVs] [^115qEjy5] [^116ds6HU] [^1171FiEY] [^1138sAMX]. I should double-check that the center has the necessary armamentarium and access strategies, as tortuous aortic takeoffs may require alternate access or longer devices [^112yADUk].

> Now, I need to review open surgical options and verify when they outperform endovascular strategies. In situ reconstructions include aneurysmorrhaphy (tailoring), resection with end-to-end anastomosis, and bypass; for complex hilar or distal branch disease, ex vivo repair with renal autotransplantation allows meticulous reconstruction while preserving nephrons; minimally invasive or robotic techniques can be considered in selective centers to reduce morbidity; nephrectomy is reserved for unreconstructable renal parenchyma or failed salvage [^1172kVrh] [^111bfSFS] [^115dY45e] [^115EkXfS] [^1176LuLp] [^113f5TVG]. Hold on, I should verify durability and selection: open repairs remain durable in experienced hands, but patient risk and anatomy should guide the threshold to move first to endovascular where suitable [^116B74kz].

> Next, I should assess perioperative risk, renal function protection, and blood pressure outcomes, and I need to check if comorbidities tilt the balance. Diabetes, coagulopathy, and concomitant aneurysms predict higher perioperative mortality across modalities; endovascular repair typically shortens ICU and hospital stay compared with open surgery; renal function is preserved in most endovascular series, with a measurable risk of renal infarction; both open and endovascular repairs often improve renovascular hypertension, though magnitudes vary by etiology and technique [^114RWDvW] [^112gL36m] [^1138sAMX] [^114B4HpC]. Let me reconsider: while early outcomes favor endovascular in length of stay, long-term equivalence in renal function and reintervention risk requires tailored surveillance and patient counseling [^116B74kz].

> I should confirm surveillance protocols after treatment and during conservative management, and I need to ensure modality choice aligns with image quality constraints. After endovascular repair, individualized imaging follow-up with duplex ultrasound is preferred, escalating to CTA if sonographic windows are inadequate; after open repair, annual imaging for three years, then individualized oversight is reasonable; for conservatively managed asymptomatic RAAs < 30 mm, annual imaging is recommended; for renal artery dissection managed nonoperatively, annual duplex is advised to detect aneurysm formation or stenosis progression [^112ggy7s] [^115XzroV] [^1138hEcy] [^1135BZdr]. Wait, let me verify MRI considerations: in renal insufficiency or high radiation exposure scenarios, non-contrast MRA can substitute for CTA to maintain safety without compromising diagnostic yield [^111dPQGj].

> But wait, what about the size threshold controversy and natural history that might change practice over time. Historical thresholds around 2 cm have shifted toward 3 cm in modern guidelines, reflecting data showing very slow growth and extremely low rupture rates in large observational cohorts; nonetheless, pregnancy, symptoms, rupture, and mycotic etiology appropriately supersede size-based conservatism; complex decision-making benefits from a multidisciplinary team that understands evolving endovascular tools and open reconstructive capabilities [^111FhzHX] [^117RPerz] [^113x7NvV] [^114aC8HC] [^113879rS].

> Finalizing the plan, I need to ensure the algorithm is concise and actionable while preserving these nuances. Diagnose and stage with CTA when feasible, or non-contrast MRA if contrast or radiation is a concern; classify by size, location, neck, and branch involvement; intervene for symptomatic, ruptured, pregnant/childbearing potential, mycotic, or asymptomatic lesions ≥ 30 mm; choose endovascular first in anatomically suitable cases with reconstruction favored over occlusion, reserving open or ex vivo repair for complex distal or wide-neck lesions or when endovascular is not feasible; implement structured surveillance after repair and for small asymptomatic RAAs under conservative management, adapting modality to image quality and renal function constraints [^116BmCLP] [^111dPQGj] [^111FhzHX] [^1152xdLs] [^114aC8HC] [^116rsUx1] [^111MQxF9] [^113ydApm].

---

Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare, often incidental, and carry a low rupture risk except during pregnancy or when large [^113x7NvV]. CTA is the **diagnostic gold standard** [^116BmCLP] for anatomic definition and procedural planning [^115xPwzc], while **endovascular repair is preferred** [^116rsUx1] for anatomically suitable cases due to lower morbidity and shorter recovery. Repair is indicated for **symptomatic RAAs, aneurysms ≥ 3 cm, or any size in women of childbearing potential** [^111FhzHX] [^116V8uua] [^114aC8HC]; **urgent intervention is required** for rupture or rapid growth. Open surgery is reserved for complex anatomy or failed endovascular therapy [^112yADUk] [^111FhzHX], while small, stable, asymptomatic RAAs are managed with surveillance [^113ydApm] [^115XzroV].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

RAAs are rare, with a **prevalence** of 0.1–1% in the general population [^112md7Xj] [^114XrLG6]. Risk factors include **atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, hypertension, connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan), trauma, and iatrogenic injury** [^114XrLG6] [^115puc7J].

---

## Clinical presentation

Most RAAs are **asymptomatic**, typically found incidentally on imaging [^112py34J], but when **symptomatic** they present with flank or abdominal pain, hematuria, hypertension [^114XrLG6], or, if ruptured, acute pain, hypotension, and shock [^115gbUm4] [^1122aNG5].

---

## Diagnostic imaging modalities

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the **gold standard** [^116BmCLP] for diagnosis, anatomic characterization, and procedural planning. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is an alternative for patients with renal insufficiency or when radiation exposure is a concern [^111dPQGj]. Duplex ultrasound is useful for surveillance, particularly for small, stable aneurysms [^113ydApm] [^1138hEcy].

---

## Indications for intervention

Per ESVS 2025 guidelines, **intervention is recommended** in the following scenarios:

| **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic aneurysms (pain, hematuria, hypertension) | Urgent repair regardless of size [^1152xdLs] |
| Asymptomatic aneurysms ≥ 3 cm | Elective repair [^111FhzHX] |
| Rapidly expanding aneurysms (> 0.5 cm/year) | Urgent repair |
| Pregnant patients or women of childbearing potential | Repair regardless of size |
| Mycotic aneurysms | Urgent open surgical intervention with antibiotics [^116aLxHJ] |

---

## Treatment options

### Endovascular repair

- **Techniques**: Coil embolization, covered stent placement, flow-diverting stents [^116rsUx1] [^115xPwzc].
- **Advantages**: Minimally invasive [^116rsUx1], shorter hospital stay [^116B74kz], lower perioperative morbidity [^1138sAMX], faster recovery [^115xPwzc].
- **Limitations**: Not suitable for complex anatomy, wide-neck aneurysms [^116rsUx1], or extensive branch involvement [^112yADUk].

---

### Open surgical repair

- **Techniques**: Aneurysmectomy with arterial reconstruction [^111MQxF9], bypass grafting, ex vivo repair with autotransplantation [^115dY45e].
- **Advantages**: Durable long-term results [^113itBMh], suitable for complex anatomy, wide-neck aneurysms, or failed endovascular attempts [^111MQxF9].
- **Limitations**: Higher perioperative morbidity, longer hospital stay, longer recovery [^111MQxF9].

---

## Outcomes and complications

| **Parameter** | **Endovascular repair** | **Open surgical repair** |
|-|-|-|
| Technical success | 96% [^1138sAMX] | 93–100% [^116huaBo] |
| Perioperative morbidity | Lower [^116rsUx1] | Higher [^111MQxF9] |
| Hospital stay | Shorter [^116rsUx1] [^116B74kz] | Longer [^111MQxF9] |
| Renal function preservation | 84% [^1138sAMX] | 93–100% |
| Reintervention rate | 3% [^1138sAMX] | 0–7% |

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Post-repair surveillance generally entails **annual imaging (duplex ultrasound or CTA) for the first 3 years**, then individualized thereafter, while **conservative management** of asymptomatic RAAs < 3 cm involves annual surveillance [^113ydApm] [^1138hEcy].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: High rupture risk; repair recommended regardless of size [^114aC8HC] [^114zi2G7].
- **Mycotic aneurysms**: Urgent open surgical intervention with antibiotics [^116aLxHJ] [^114szdYw].
- **Renal artery dissection**: Conservative management with blood pressure control and antiplatelet therapy; endovascular revascularization if refractory hypertension [^111JeuYy] [^115k4RCp].

---

Renal artery aneurysms are rare vascular lesions with a low rupture risk except during pregnancy or when large. Endovascular repair is **preferred for anatomically suitable cases** [^116rsUx1], while open surgery is reserved for complex anatomy or failed endovascular attempts [^112yADUk]. Surveillance is recommended for **small, stable, asymptomatic RAAs** [^113ydApm].

### Surgical renovascular reconstruction for renal artery stenosis and aneurysm: Long-term durability and survival [^113itBMh]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

To study functional outcome, mortality, and dialysis-free survival in patients undergoing open primary surgical repair of renal artery stenosis (RAS) or aneurysm (RAA), a retrospective single-center study was conducted. Patients underwent open surgical renal artery reconstruction from 1993 to 2007, and data on blood pressure, renal function, dialysis dependence, vessel patency, and mortality were collected. Survival was assessed by cross-matching with the population registry, providing follow-up for up to 20 years.

Of the 40 patients operated on, 25 (63%) were women. RAS was the indication for reconstruction in 31 patients; 23 had atherosclerotic etiology (ARAS), and eight had fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Nine patients had RAA. Patients with ARAS tended to be older (p = .008), have more extensive peripheral arterial disease (p = .004), and inferior renal function (p = .003) compared to those with FMD or RAA. In FMD and RAA cases, the right renal artery was affected in 13 of 17 (76%) cases. In contrast, in ARAS, the disease was evenly distributed. Among patients with ARAS, 15 of 25 (60%) of the stenotic renal arteries (including two bilateral procedures) were managed by aorto-renal bypass, while 2 of 25 (8%) required ilio-renal bypass. Additionally, 8 of 25 (32%) underwent endarterectomy. In FMD cases, all but one patient underwent aorto-renal bypass.

Early mortality was 2.5% (one patient with ARAS). Post-operatively, one patient with ARAS required dialysis. Notably, systolic blood pressure in patients with ARAS was significantly reduced, dropping from a median of 180 mmHg pre-operatively to 155 mmHg at one month (p = .003).

### Repair of complex renal artery aneurysms by laparoscopic nephrectomy with ex vivo repair and autotransplantation [^115dY45e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysms are being discovered more frequently due to the increased use of non-invasive imaging. Complex renal artery aneurysms involving multiple secondary or tertiary branches are not amenable to in vivo or endovascular treatment and often require ex vivo repair with autotransplantation. To minimize incisional morbidity and hasten recovery, we developed a technique of laparoscopic nephrectomy combined with backbench ex vivo repair, followed by autotransplantation through a small laparoscopic extraction incision. This study describes our initial experience with this combined technique in patients who were not candidates for endovascular techniques or in vivo arterial reconstruction.

Seven patients with complex renal artery aneurysms underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy and ex vivo repair with multiple saphenous vein grafts and autotransplantation through the small laparoscopic extraction incision. The aneurysms ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 cm. In all cases, the aneurysm was resected ex vivo, leaving multiple branch arteries that were extended with saphenous vein grafts. Arterial inflow was then re-established with sequential saphenous vein anastomoses to the external iliac artery. Ureteral reconstruction was performed via standard Lich ureteroneocystostomy. Patients were followed postoperatively for two to eight years.

Laparoscopic nephrectomy with ex vivo repair of complex aneurysms was successfully employed in seven patients with renal aneurysms that were not amenable to endovascular or in vivo repair.

### Natural history and management of renal artery aneurysms in a single tertiary referral center [^1164jjXP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are uncommon, several large reports have been published indicating their benign natural history. The objective of this study was to review our single-center experience managing this disease entity.

A retrospective review of the Yale radiologic database from January 1999 to December 2016 was performed. Only patients with RAA and a computed tomography scan of the abdomen were selected for review. Demographics of the patients, aneurysm characteristics, management, postoperative complications, and follow-up data were collected.

A total of 241 patients with 259 RAAs were identified, with a mean age of 69 years (range, 35–100 years); 147 were female (61%). On computed tomography, aneurysms were solitary and right-sided in 224 (86%) and 159 (61%), respectively. Additionally, 64 patients (27%) had aneurysms elsewhere. The breakdown of RAAs by location was as follows: renal bifurcation in 84 (32%), renal pelvis in 77 (30%), distal renal artery in 58 (22%), mid renal artery in 34 (13%), and proximal renal artery in 6 (2%).

Five patients had symptoms attributed to the RAA and underwent operative repair; all others were observed without an operation. Symptoms in the operative repair group included flank pain in four and uncontrolled hypertension in one. The mean overall diameter of the RAAs was 1.22 ± 0.49 cm. The diameter of operatively repaired and observed RAAs was 1.84 ± 0.55 cm and 1.21 ± 0.48 cm, respectively (P = 0.002). Operative repair included four coil embolizations and one open resection.

### Reconstruction for renal artery aneurysms using the tailoring technique [^1172kVrh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Renal artery (RA) aneurysm (RAA) is a rare and complex disease. Treatment options for a RAA include endovascular surgery and open surgery with ex vivo repair or in situ reconstruction. This study evaluated the long-term outcome after vascular reconstruction of RAAs using the tailoring technique. Tailoring, or aneurysmorrhaphy, means a partial resection of the aneurysm with direct suture of the remaining arterial wall.

A single-center retrospective study was conducted between January 1990 and December 2015. The tailoring technique was used to surgically repair 88 RAAs in 80 patients (52 women) with a mean age of 52.9 years. Patients' demographic data, vascular therapy, and renal function during follow-up were retrospectively evaluated.

The localization of the RAA was at the right kidney in 58 patients. The mean size of the aneurysm was 21.4 ± 9.7 mm (range, 8–67 mm). Hypertension was diagnosed in 56 patients, and 23 were asymptomatic. One RAA was ruptured. The overall morbidity rate was 16.3%, including bleeding (n = 4), RA stenosis (n = 3), RA occlusion (n = 4), RA dissection (n = 1), and myocardial infarction (n = 1). One patient died of myocardial infarction, resulting in a 30-day mortality rate of 1.3%. The 30-day primary patency rate was 90.0%, and the 30-day secondary patency rate was 95.0%. Follow-up data were obtained from 71 patients who underwent tailoring in 78 RAAs. The mean follow-up period was 60.7 months (range 2–229 months). In 76.4% of patients with RAA and hypertension, RAA reconstruction contributed to the cure or improvement of hypertension.

### Wide-neck renal artery aneurysm: Parenchymal sparing endovascular treatment with a new device [^113Xt6cR]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm is a rare disorder with a high mortality rate in the event of rupture, the most frequent complication, which can also occur in lesions smaller than those indicated for treatment by criteria. Surgery is still the first-line treatment, although a growing trend toward endovascular management of visceral artery aneurysms has emerged because of the high efficacy and low invasiveness demonstrated by several authors. Treatment of wide-necked aneurysms and, depending on location, those at renal artery bifurcations or distal branches is more complex and may require invasive surgical techniques, such as bench surgery.

- **Case presentation**: We describe the successful use of a new neurointerventional coil to treat an enlarging wide-necked segmental-branch renal aneurysm in an elderly woman who was not a candidate for surgery because of several comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**: The technique described allowed safe, successful treatment of a wide-necked aneurysm in an unfavorable vascular territory, reducing the risk of downstream artery embolization and consequent parenchymal damage and decreased renal function. In similar cases, other endovascular devices have often proven to be ineffective at nephron sparing. To validate the safety and efficacy of this system, more cases treated in this manner should be studied.

### Renal artery aneurysm: Successful exclusion with a stent graft [^111waqHh]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2004). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysms are uncommon. They are either incidentally discovered or identified during the workup for secondary hypertension. An association with rupture exists at sizes greater than 1.5 cm. This case report describes the exclusion of a renal aneurysm using a covered stent. Despite the compromise of a side-branch vessel, there were no deleterious effects on renal function at the 6-month follow-up.

### Renal artery aneurysms: Movement toward endovascular repair [^114Xba7F]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is an uncommon disease and is typically an incidental finding on imaging performed for other medical ailments. Sequelae of RAA include rupture and difficult-to-control hypertension. Repair of RAA is considered in suitable surgical candidates when a maximum diameter of 2 cm is reached or in females who are pregnant or trying to conceive. Surgical options have expanded from traditional open aneurysmectomy or arteriorrhaphy to robotic-laparoscopic repair and a manifold of endovascular approaches.

### Single centre experience in open and endovascular treatment of renal artery aneurysms [^112gL36m]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The true incidence and natural history of renal artery aneurysm (RAA) remain unclear, and there is still controversy over the indication for treatment. Several techniques of conventional surgical reconstructions are described in the literature, and more recently, endovascular therapies have been reported with satisfying results and a lower complication rate. This paper aims to investigate the outcomes of both endovascular and open repair of RAA achieved in a single institution involving three medical teams: urology, vascular surgery, and neuroradiology.

- **Material and methods**: We conducted a single-centre retrospective observational study involving all patients surgically or endovascularly treated for RAA over a 15-year period. Pre-operative, procedural, and post-operative data at the early, mid-, and long-term follow-up stages were collected and analysed, focusing on the operative technique used for repair and related outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 27 patients (17 women, 63%; mean age 58 ± 13.2 years; 26 saccular RAA) were included. The mean aneurysm size was 18.8 ± 6.3 mm. Most diagnoses were accidental. Symptomatic RAA presented with macroscopic haematuria (3 patients, 25.9%), unstable hypertension (2 patients, 7%), chronic lumbar pain (1 patient, 3.7%), and renal infarct (1 patient, 3.7%). Conventional surgery (ex-vivo repair, aneurysmorraphy, aneurysm resection, and end-to-end anastomosis) was performed in 14 cases (51.8%), while endovascular coiling embolization was conducted in 13 cases (48.2%). The mean hospital length of stay was 5.4 ± 3.6 days. Intensive Care Unit stay was needed only in the surgically treated patients (mean 1.1 ± 1 day).

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^115xPwzc]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

The CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee convened an expert writing group, tasked with creating up-to-date recommendations on the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms (VAAs) and visceral and renal artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs). This document is not a clinical practice guideline or a systematic review of the literature. As with all CIRSE Standards of Practice documents, this document does not intend to impose a standard of clinical patient care but recommends a reasonable approach and best practices for the endovascular treatment of VAAs and VAPAs. Institutions should regularly review their internal procedures for development and improvement, taking into account international guidance, local resources, and regular internal morbidity and mortality reviews.

- **Summary of recommendations**: A summary of key recommendations on the endovascular management of visceral and renal aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms can be found in Table 1.

### Wide-neck renal artery aneurysm: Parenchymal sparing endovascular treatment with a new device [^117AQnpV]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

In the present case, considering the patient's comorbidities and location of the aneurysm, surgical repair would have been very invasive and likely required bench surgery, so endovascular exclusion was preferable. The anatomical features and location of the aneurysm and the need for accurate coil deployment before release justified the use of this new type of neurointerventional detachable coil, which has not previously been reported to treat a renal artery aneurysm (RAA). A high packing density, with fewer coils and a shorter procedure time than required for other procedures using different materials, was also obtained.

To our knowledge, this is the first case of a visceral aneurysm treated with the Penumbra Coil 400™ Embolization System (Penumbra Inc.) that includes three years of follow-up. These 0.020-inch coils are larger in diameter than other neurointerventional coils and are inherently softer because of their diameter (softness increases by the third power of the diameter) and because of the different thickness of the nitinol stretch-resistant wire. The coil-within-a-coil design increases the ability of the device to occupy the aneurysmal sac with less risk of misplacement.

As previously reported, in the treatment of complex renal aneurysms in difficult locations, a neurointerventional coil system may facilitate complete sac embolization with lower morbidity and less risk of decreased renal function than can be achieved with surgery or other endovascular techniques. The Penumbra system in particular, because of its conformability and greater length-volume ratio, allows for superior outcomes in such procedures.

### Management of complex symptomatic renal artery aneurysm in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [^117K6GcW]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding indications for treatment, the guidelines suggest that aneurysms larger than 3 cm should be treated (previous cut-off was 2 cm) but with a low level of evidence (recommendation level 2C); symptomatic or ruptured renal artery aneurysms (RAA) must be treated irrespective of their size (recommendation level 1B).

The patient's underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) further complicated the clinical picture since the disease's associated systemic inflammation and autoimmunity-caused vasculopathy increased the risk of aneurysm rupture. SLE vasculitis could lead to degradation of arterial muscular and elastic elements and subsequently lead to fibrosis or aneurysm formation. However, visceral vasculitis in SLE is a rare phenomenon; medium-sized aneurysms are usually found in cases of polyarteritis nodosa.

In previously documented cases of renal aneurysms in SLE patients, the autoimmune disease was in an active status, which could suggest that active vessel wall inflammation could be present. In our patient, no recent flare-up of the disease was documented; however, he has received intermittent treatment with steroids for several years since his initial diagnosis. In a meta-analysis of 35 cases, Kurata et al. evaluated patient characteristics and possible pathogenetic mechanisms for aortic aneurysm in SLE. The authors documented a positive correlation between steroid duration and 10-year and 20-year survival and between atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Although glucocorticoids can be pro-atherogenic, vascular injury in SLE is more likely to result from disease-specific etiologies, as well as traditional risk factors.

### An anatomic classification scheme for surgical planning of renal artery aneurysms [^114B4HpC]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare disease. This study proposed and evaluated a new classification for RAA to assist in surgical decision-making.

- **Materials and methods**: Single-center data of 105 patients with RAAs from the vascular department of vascular surgery were collected retrospectively. A new classification scheme was proposed. Type I aneurysms arise from the main trunk, accessory branch, or first-order branches away from any bifurcation. Type II aneurysms arise from the first bifurcation with narrow necks (defined as dome-to-neck ratio > 2) or from intralobular branches. Type III aneurysms with a wide neck arise from the first bifurcation and affect two or more branches that cannot be sacrificed without significant infarction of the kidney.

- **Results**: There were 50 (47.62%) type I, 33 (31.43%) type II, and 22 (20.95%) type III aneurysms. The classification assigned endovascular repair as first-line treatment for type I or II, while open techniques were conducted if anatomically suitable for type III. A kappa level of 0.752 was achieved by the classification compared with a level of 0.579 from the classic Rundback classification. Technical primary success was achieved in 100% and 96.05%, and symptoms were completely resolved in 100% and 84.85%, while hypertension was relieved in 84.21% and 72.92% of patients receiving open surgery or endovascular repair, respectively. No significant difference was observed for perioperative or long-term complications among the three classification types.

- **Conclusion**: The new classification proved to be a convenient and effective method for surgical planning of renal artery aneurysms.

### Endovascular techniques for the treatment of renal artery aneurysms [^115uVw1b]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Our goal was to analyze the indications and limitations of the different percutaneous endovascular approaches reported for the treatment of renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) and to develop a scientific approach for the optimum selection of treatment strategy for RAAs through analyzing our experience and reviewing available literature.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the treatment and follow-up of 13 consecutive patients who presented with 13 RAAs by using a variety of endovascular interventional techniques. Different combinations of coil embolization, liquid embolization, stenting, and stent-graft exclusion were used in correlation with variable-specific aneurysm criteria.

- **Results**: All patients were successfully treated with no significant short- or long-term complications. Patients were followed for an average period of 43 months (range 13–103 months).

- **Conclusions**: Ten different determinants were found to affect our decision-making: shape, size, neck, position of aneurysm on artery, branches arising, artery involved, condition of the artery, age, general condition of the patient, and renal function.

### Successful repair of transplant renal artery aneurysm (TRAA) [^1169VXY9]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Renal transplantation is the definitive treatment for end-stage renal failure. Vascular complications, albeit rare, can potentially lead to allograft loss. Anastomotic renal artery aneurysms are often iatrogenic. Transplant renal artery aneurysm (TRAA), when detected in renal grafts, are often resected at the back-table before grafting. However, TRAA that develops de novo post-transplantation poses a unique challenge in the management.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^116ds6HU]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

A renal artery aneurysm is a rare clinical presentation that can be found incidentally on imaging or during a workup for refractory hypertension. Its presentation can be similar to that of a renal artery pseudoaneurysm, but the etiologies of these two vascular lesions differ. We present a patient who had an incidental finding of a large renal artery aneurysm that was managed with endovascular embolization. We also describe the literature surrounding the etiology, presentation, and management of both renal artery aneurysms and renal artery pseudoaneurysms.

- **Case presentation**: A 62-year-old man was referred to a urologic oncologist for the workup of a newly found renal mass. Initial imaging with computed tomography showed a homogenous, well-circumscribed mass arising from the right kidney. Further evaluation with Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated pulsatile flow within the renal mass, which was concerning for a renal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient initially underwent a diagnostic angiogram by interventional radiology and was found to have a true renal artery aneurysm. Interventional radiology considered the placement of a covered stent or angioembolization, but treatment was deferred due to concerns about compromising the patient's renal function. The patient was subsequently transferred to a neighboring hospital for management by vascular surgery. After considering both open surgical and endovascular approaches, the patient ultimately underwent angioembolization of the renal artery aneurysm. Short-term follow-up showed successful exclusion of the aneurysm with minimal adverse effects.

### Management of complex symptomatic renal artery aneurysm in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [^113xpMc7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The prevalence of renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) in angiographic and CT angiography (CTA) studies is estimated to be between 0.3% and 2.5%, encompassing a range of small, asymptomatic lesions to larger, clinically significant aneurysms. They are usually discovered during imaging tests performed to investigate other medical conditions. While smaller RAAs typically remain asymptomatic and only necessitate regular monitoring, larger aneurysms may present with complications such as haematuria, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and rupture. In turn, the rupture of an RAA can cause internal hemorrhage, shock, kidney loss, and death.

RAAs are categorized according to an angiographic classification system. Type I are saccular/fusiform aneurysms arising from the main renal artery; type II are fusiform/saccular aneurysms located on the main renal artery or a large segmental branch, and type III are more complex, involving multiple branches or intralobar, arising from small segmental arteries or intraparenchymal branches. All types are amenable to surgery, while types I and II are better suited to an endovascular approach. Type III RAAs are particularly concerning due to their larger size, irregular morphology, and proximity to vital renal structures, all of which elevate the risk of rupture and other complications during surgery, as commonly managed by autotransplantation after on-table reconstruction of the renal vessels.

### Growth patterns of true renal artery aneurysms in the current published literature [^113x7NvV]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to describe the methods of surveying true renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) and identify the pattern of growth of RAA in the literature.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive electronic database search was performed. The limits applied included full text and English language. The reference lists of included publications were manually searched for further relevant studies. Studies that surveyed RAA on imaging and calculated mean aneurysm growth rates per year were included.

- **Results**: Literature review yielded six studies comprising 876 patients and approximately 988 aneurysms. Computed tomography (CT) was the most common imaging modality utilized for evaluation of RAA. Mean initial RAA diameter ranged from 1.21 to 1.6 cm. The combined cohort was followed radiologically for up to a maximum of 142 months and reports a zero percent rupture rate. Mean growth rates were consistently below 0.1 cm/y across the included studies (range: 0.017–0.086 cm/y).

- **Conclusion**: The present study highlights a benign course of RAA. The evidence yields a rupture rate of zero in a combined cohort of approximately 988 aneurysms followed for up to 11 years. Future guidelines should recognize this indolent course and consider rationalization of RAA surveillance, particularly where initial aneurysm size is well below the threshold for treatment.

### Robotic surgery for in situ renal artery aneurysm repair: Technical note and literature review about a mini-invasive alternative [^1176LuLp]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old woman with a 20-mm complex renal artery aneurysm (RAA) located at the hilum, unsuitable for endovascular repair, was treated using a minimally invasive robotic approach. This method enabled in-situ reconstruction in a completely minimally invasive manner utilizing the Da Vinci Xi robot (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). The robotic system facilitated both surgical exposure and aneurysmectomy with patch closure. Clamping time was 38 minutes (warm ischemia), and the total operative time was 210 minutes.

A comprehensive literature review was conducted on studies reporting the robotic approach for RAA. The main outcomes of interest were surgical technique, total operative time, clamping time, blood loss, and postoperative renal function. Seven studies were identified, reporting a total of 20 RAAs. Most of the RAAs were treated by aneurysmoraphy (n = 9). Median total operative time ranged from 228 to 300 minutes (range: 155–360 minutes), and median clamping time ranged from 26 to 44 minutes (range: 10–82 minutes). Median blood loss was between 100 and 150 mL (range: 25–650 mL). No alteration of renal function in the early postoperative period was reported.

In conclusion, RAA in-situ repair using a robotic approach is feasible and safe. It should be considered an alternative to open surgical repair when the endovascular technique is not an option.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^112fRuTp]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Our case report demonstrates a patient who presented with an incidental finding of a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) during a workup for a renal mass. Although the renal lesion was initially diagnosed as a renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) by Doppler ultrasonography, the subsequent angiography study revealed that the patient had a true aneurysm. RAAs are a rare phenomenon with an overall incidence of 0.09% within the general population. They can be classified into three different forms: type 1 consists of saccular aneurysms arising from the main renal artery or a large segmental branch; type 2 includes fusiform aneurysms; and type 3 includes intralobar artery aneurysms. Our patient presented with a saccular type aneurysm, which accounts for about 94% of all aneurysms.

RAAs typically present without symptoms, but as they grow in size, they can lead to pain, hematuria, and hypertension due to compression of the renal parenchyma. Additionally, RAAs typically present after 60 years of age, are more commonly seen in females than males, are associated with hypertension, and are predominantly found on the right side when presenting as a unilateral lesion. RAAs can be diagnosed on physical exam as a pulsatile mass in the region of the renal hilum or when heard as a bruit on auscultation. However, these exam findings are rare, and RAAs are more commonly found incidentally on imaging. Our patient was initially diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm given the presence of a "yin-yang sign" on Doppler sonography, which is depicted by the swirling motion pattern of arterial blood flow in a cystic structure.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^116pWsVs]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

The aim of this endovascular treatment is to exclude the sac from the circulation while preserving the patency of the feeding vessel. The concept of vessel patency is of the utmost importance, particularly in neurointerventions. In visceral aneurysms, distal flow is crucial when dealing with vessels such as the mesenteric and renal branches; distal ischemia can lead to major complications. It is nowadays considered reasonable in other vascular territories too, in order to avoid post-embolization syndrome and ischemic complications.

- **Exclusion techniques**: The most common techniques are listed below:

	- **Coil packing**: This technique is often ideal in instances of saccular true aneurysms with a narrow neck. It consists of filling the sac with coils up to the neck of the aneurysm. Detachable coils are recommended, as their deployment is controlled and they can be retrieved if needed. Tight coil packing is key to this procedure to minimize the risk of subsequent coil compaction and/or sac reperfusion. 3D shape memory coils with a diameter corresponding to the largest measure of the sac are usually placed first, followed by smaller coils. Coil size is decided based on the size of the aneurysm. It has been shown in prospective studies that complex-shaped platinum coils facilitate higher packing density, which improves the recanalization rate compared to the use of helical coils.

	- **Balloon remodeling technique**: This involves the placement of a balloon catheter in the parent vessel across the aneurysm neck and a microcatheter.

### A new surgical approach for exclusion of renal artery aneurysms avoiding organ ischemia [^116j1kKx]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of renal artery aneurysms is inevitably associated with temporary renal artery occlusion and risk of ischemic injury. We present a technique for renal artery grafting and aneurysm exclusion without interrupting renal blood flow.

- **Report**: A symptomatic renal artery aneurysm was bypassed with a venous graft between the abdominal aorta and the very distal renal artery utilizing a distal anastomotic device without interruption of renal blood flow. The aneurysm was then excluded by means of hemostatic clips.

- **Conclusion**: The presented surgical technique offers the major advantage of avoiding organ ischemia and accelerating the surgical procedure.

### Renal artery aneurysms [^1133atvG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysms are rare in the general population, although the true incidence and natural history remain elusive. Controversy over criteria for repair persists across decades. Present indications for repair include aneurysm size > 2 cm, female gender within childbearing age, symptoms like pain and hematuria, medically refractory hypertension including that associated with functionally important renal artery stenosis, thromboembolism, dissection, and rupture. Conventional surgical reconstruction options are variable and continue to offer technically sound and durable results.

Endovascular therapies with novel devices also offer technical success with few major adverse events and are increasingly employed as indications for intervention broaden. This review summarizes the accumulated evidence on true renal artery aneurysms with a particular focus on contemporary treatment criteria, natural history, options for repair, and outcomes following such interventions.

### Robot-assisted laparoscopic reconstructed management of multiple aneurysms in renal artery primary bifurcations: a case report and literature review [^115r14y1]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is rare, and its incidence in the general population remains elusive. There have been few reports on the repair of multiple aneurysms conducted with the Da Vinci robot-assisted surgical platform (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), especially for those located in renal artery primary bifurcations.

- **Case presentation**: We report our experience in the surgical management of two expanding right-sided RAAs in a 64-year-old man using a robot-assisted laparoscopic approach. Two aneurysms were located in renal artery primary bifurcations, whose diameters were 1.8 and 1.2 cm. The aneurysms were resected, and the renal artery branch was reconstructed by in situ arteriorrhaphy. The operation lasted for 2 hours and 35 minutes, with a warm ischemia time of 26 minutes and estimated blood loss of 150 ml. The hospital stay was 6 days. The computed tomography (CT) scan performed 2 months after the surgery showed resolution of the aneurysms. Additionally, split renal function indicated the preservation of right renal function in the follow-up period.

- **Conclusions**: The robot-assisted laparoscopic procedure is a safe and effective surgical technique, which may be considered as an alternative to open surgery for complex multiple RAAs in the future.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^113hDL6q]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Our case report documents a unique case of an asymptomatic patient who presented for evaluation of a renal mass but was incidentally found to have a large renal artery aneurysm (RAA). An RAA is a rare clinical finding that can be managed with surveillance, open surgical reconstruction, or endovascular approaches. Given the size of the RAA and its risk for rupture, our patient underwent successful treatment with renal angioembolization and experienced minimal adverse effects following treatment. Although our patient presented for oncologic workup given initial imaging findings, additional testing with Doppler ultrasound elucidated the presence of a renal aneurysm, allowing the patient to be directed to the proper therapy. In addition to reviewing the etiology, presentation, and management of both RAAs and renal artery pseudoaneurysms (RAPs), we also aim to highlight the importance of using multiple imaging modalities for the workup of renal masses.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^115puc7J]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

The writing group for this document, which was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee, consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognized expertise in the interventional radiological treatment of visceral artery aneurysms. The writing group reviewed existing literature on visceral and renal artery aneurysms (VAA) and visceral artery pseudoaneurysm (VAPA) endovascular treatment, performing a pragmatic evidence search using PubMed relevant publications from 1980 to 2022. The writing group formulated the recommendations by consensus.

- **Background**: Visceral and renal artery aneurysms (VAAs) are rare pathologies with an incidence of 0.01–0.2%. Visceral aneurysms affect the splanchnic arteries and include the celiac axis and its branches, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and their branches. The splenic artery is involved in up to 60% of cases, followed by the hepatic artery as the second most commonly affected artery.

- **VAA/VAPA risk factors**: These include atherosclerosis, hypertension, infection, fibromuscular dysplasia, Kawasaki disease, Osler–Weber–Rendu disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome.

A true aneurysm is defined as a focal dilatation of an artery of more than 50% of the expected diameter for the anatomical area and patient gender, involving all three vessel layers; it may have a saccular or a fusiform shape. A false aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm is due to a contained rupture of the artery that is lined only by adventitia.

### Aneurysms of the renal artery [^112md7Xj]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The increasing utilization of diagnostic imaging studies has provided newer insights into our knowledge of visceral artery aneurysms. Because many are "silent", the appreciation of the true incidence and natural history of these nonaortic arterial aneurysms is only recently being understood. Historical data suggest that renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) occur in approximately 0.1% of the general population. Recognized complications associated with RAAs include renovascular hypertension, renal artery thrombosis, infarction from distal embolization, arteriovenous fistula formation, and the most dreaded risk, rupture. Unfortunately, there remains continued controversy about the indications for and mode of treating RAAs. This article attempts to shed some light on contemporary management options in view of advances in percutaneous endoluminal interventions.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^1165k9Yu]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

A renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare vascular malformation typically found incidentally on imaging. On rare occasions, RAAs can rupture, causing a life-threatening hemorrhage with a mortality rate approaching 10%. This risk is significantly higher in pregnant women. The RAA is characterized by a localized defect in the internal elastic tissue that allows it to dilate; a true aneurysm contains all three layers of the arterial wall. In contrast, a renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is a hematoma formed from an arterial defect that intermittently ruptures and clots off, creating a collection of blood products surrounded by the renal parenchyma or the renal capsule. RAPs occur due to injury to the kidney following abdominal trauma or renal surgery. We present the case of an incidentally discovered renal artery aneurysm and review some of the literature surrounding the etiology, presentation, and management of both RAAs and RAPs.

### Renal artery aneurysms: A 35-year clinical experience with 252 aneurysms in 168 patients [^112py34J]. Annals of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

To define the relevance of treating renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) surgically, a retrospective review was undertaken of 168 patients (107 women, 61 men) with 252 RAAs encountered over 35 years at the University of Michigan Hospital. Aneurysms were solitary in 115 patients and multiple in 53 patients. Bilateral RAAs occurred in 32 patients. Associated diseases included hypertension (73%), renal artery fibrodysplasia (34%), systemic atherosclerosis (25%), and extrarenal aneurysms (6.5%). Most RAAs were saccular (79%) and noncalcified (63%). The main renal artery bifurcation was the most common site of aneurysms (60%). RAAs were often asymptomatic (55%), with diagnoses most often made during arteriographic studies for suspected renovascular hypertension (42%).

Surgery was performed in 121 patients (average RAA size 1.5 cm), including 14 patients undergoing unilateral repair with contralateral RAA observation. The remaining 47 patients (average RAA size 1.3 cm) were not treated surgically. Operations included aneurysmectomy and angioplastic renal artery closure or segmental renal artery reimplantation, aneurysmectomy and renal artery bypass, and planned nephrectomy for unreconstructable renal arteries or advanced parenchymal disease. Eight patients underwent unplanned nephrectomy, being considered a technical failure of surgical therapy.

### Direct distal renal artery aneurysm repair [^111bfSFS]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of renal artery aneurysms (RAA) remains controversial. Endovascular treatment has increased for main trunk and very distal aneurysms. In contrast, surgical treatment seems to be a valid option for lesions located at the bifurcation. This study aimed to describe the technique of direct reconstruction of RAA and to report on outcomes.

- **Methods**: This study comprised a single-center prospective collection of data with retrospective analysis from January 2015 to August 2018 of patients operated on for distal RAA using direct reconstruction.

- **Results**: A total of 24 RAAs in 21 patients (seven men and 14 women, mean age 59 ± 13 years) were included. A history of hypertension was found in 15 patients, and renal insufficiency was present in one. Mean pre-operative systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 134 ± 21 mmHg and 74 ± 10 mmHg respectively. Mean pre-operative rates of creatinine and glomerular filtration rate were 67 ± 13 μmol/L and 93 ± 49 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. Indications for repair included a diameter > 20 mm in seven cases (mean diameter = 25 ± 2 mm), rapid growth in one case, symptomatic aneurysm in 12 cases (including hypertension, haematuria, pain), and a concomitant lesion in four cases (e.g. splenic aneurysm, abdominal aortic aneurysm, occlusive visceral artery lesions). All lesions were distal, with main artery bifurcation in 22 cases and hilar in two cases. The main aetiology was fibromuscular dysplasia (16 cases), followed by atherosclerosis (seven cases), and one case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In situ reconstruction was possible for 22 RAAs, while two cases required alternative approaches.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^114YAdTP]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms is an effective, minimally invasive treatment that has been successfully used since the early 1990s. The refined and expanded techniques and tools currently offer excellent outcomes. Due to increased detection of such lesions in recent years, many of which are asymptomatic, revision of the indications for intervention and the correct endovascular treatment approaches has become essential.

- **Purpose**: This document presumes that the indication for treatment is clear and approved by the multidisciplinary team. It defines the standards required for the performance of each intervention, as well as their relative advantages and limitations. CIRSE Standards of Practice documents are not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care but recommend a reasonable approach and best practices for the performance of endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms.

- **Methods**: The writing group was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognized expertise in endovascular treatments. The writing group reviewed the existing literature on visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, performing an evidence search using PubMed to identify publications in English related to human subjects from 1990 to 2022. The final recommendations were formulated through consensus.

Endovascular treatment has an established role in the successful management of these conditions.

### Therapy of renal artery aneurysms in New York state: Outcomes of patients undergoing open and endovascular repair [^114RWDvW]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate changing trends in therapy and determine outcomes among patients with a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) undergoing surgical or endovascular repair in New York State (NYS). A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent therapy for RAA in NYS from October 1, 2000, to December 31, 2006, was identified from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database. Regression models, including hospital and patient characteristics, were created to identify predictors of untoward events following surgical or endovascular intervention. Over this period, 215 patients with RAA repairs were analyzed.

In multivariate analysis, preoperative predictors of death included diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 57.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–1,430.1, p = 0.013), the presence of other aneurysms (adjusted OR = 18.5, CI 1.5–234.4, p = 0.024), and coagulopathy (adjusted OR = 16.9, CI 3.4–393.1, p = 0.03), but not repair type. Perioperative cardiac (adjusted OR = 16.7, CI 1.4–197.1, p = 0.026) and vascular device-related (adjusted OR = 11.1, CI 1.003–123.0, p = 0.049) complications were predictive of mortality. When patients with other aneurysms were excluded from analysis (n = 153), there were no significant predictors of death.

Ninety-one endovascular and 124 open surgical repairs were performed, with a significant increase in the proportion of endovascular repairs performed over time (p < 0.001), although since 2003 the proportion of both has been roughly equal. Diabetes (15.4% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.018), chronic anemia (5.5% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.04), and emerg…

### The society for vascular surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^115qEjy5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for renal artery aneurysm, specifically with respect to the choice of repair, the SVS 2020 guidelines recommend considering the use of endovascular techniques for the elective repair of anatomically appropriate RAA. This includes stent graft exclusion of main RAA in patients with poor operative risk and embolization of distal and parenchymal aneurysms.

### Management of complex symptomatic renal artery aneurysm in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [^1171FiEY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis concluded that endovascular methods were associated with higher rates of reintervention, but other visceral aneurysms were also included. Based on the complex morphology of our presented case of renal artery aneurysm (RAA), simple ligation would lead to a possible loss of renal parenchyma and subsequently compromise the renal function of the patient, who already necessitated four medications for blood pressure management. Additionally, as the patient was in his 70s, reconstruction or autotransplantation was not deemed appropriate. The decision to employ an endovascular approach was straightforward. However, embolization or placing a covered stent graft would also lead to occlusion of these vital branches and subsequently to possible kidney function deterioration. An attempt to preserve the RAA branches was made using a flow diverter.

Although the C-Guard stent has been approved in Europe since 2015 for the treatment of carotid artery disease, its innovative dual-layer design has the potential to manage complex arterial aneurysms. We employed the C-Guard stent, characterized by its open-cell structure wrapped in MicroNet mesh, to restrict blood flow and pressure into the aneurysmal sac, thereby promoting thrombosis while ensuring continued perfusion through the parent artery and aneurysm side branches.

The outcomes achieved in our patient align with our previous clinical experiences with RAAs, where a flow-modulating stent led to both symptom relief and functional improvement, offering a less invasive alternative to traditional surgery.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^112yADUk]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Endovascular treatment options are widely accepted in guidelines as preferable to open repair, unless the endovascular approach is unsuccessful due to an occluded or endovascularly inaccessible main feeding vessel. Surgery remains an option when endovascular exclusion would not eliminate a symptomatic mass effect, a situation sometimes associated with giant visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs).

- **General considerations**: High-resolution dynamic computed tomography angiography (CTA) and multi-planar reconstructions are necessary to assess the precise anatomy of the vascular territory and to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy and the easiest vascular access route. In cases of acute angulation of the feeding vessel from the aorta, brachial or radial access and the use of longer catheters and stents should be considered.

- **Equipment and guidelines**: High-quality standard angiographic equipment with high-resolution fluoroscopy and a wide assortment of dedicated materials and endovascular armamentarium for emergency treatment are mandatory for treating these patients, according to the guidelines of the European, US, and Canadian interventional radiology societies (CIRSE, SIR, and CIRA/CAIR).

- **Decision-making**: Decision-making around the approach to the intervention should be based on the necessity or willingness to preserve the parent artery; the shape, size, and type of aneurysm (narrow neck or fusiform/wide neck); the tortuosity and size of the parent artery; how distally the aneurysm is located; and the clinical acuity of the situation.

The aim of endovascular therapy (EVT) is to exclude the VAA or VAPA from the arterial circulation.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^113L9HsE]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

A renal artery aneurysm is a rare clinical presentation that can be found incidentally on imaging or during the workup for refractory hypertension. Its presentation can be similar to that of a renal artery pseudoaneurysm, but the etiologies of the two vascular lesions differ. We present a patient who had an incidental finding of a large renal artery aneurysm that was managed with endovascular embolization. We also describe the literature surrounding the etiology, presentation, and management of both renal artery aneurysms and renal artery pseudoaneurysms.

- **Case presentation**: A 62-year-old man was referred to a urologic oncologist for the workup of a newly found renal mass. Initial imaging with computed tomography showed a homogenous, well-circumscribed mass arising from the right kidney. Further evaluation with Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated pulsatile flow within the renal mass that was concerning for a renal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient initially underwent a diagnostic angiogram by interventional radiology and was found to have a true renal artery aneurysm. Interventional radiology considered the placement of a covered stent or angioembolization, but treatment was deferred due to concern for compromising the patient's renal function. The patient was subsequently transferred to a neighboring hospital for management by vascular surgery. After considering both open surgical and endovascular approaches, the patient ultimately underwent angioembolization of the renal artery aneurysm. Short-term follow-up showed successful exclusion of the aneurysm with minimal adverse effects.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^117RPerz]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Treatment for a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) or renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is typically sought when the aneurysm is greater than 3 cm in size, in a woman of childbearing age, or in a patient with medically refractory hypertension. The main reason for treatment is to reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture, which can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. Earlier reports estimated a high risk of RAA rupture ranging from 14% to 30%. Prior guidelines recommended repair of visceral artery aneurysms greater than 2 cm. However, more recent reports suggest RAAs have a much lower risk for rupture, even in aneurysms greater than 2 cm in size. Tham et al. followed 69 patients with RAA conservatively over a mean of 4 years and found that none of these patients developed RAA ruptures. A multicenter study by Klausner et al. showed that out of a cohort of 547 patients with untreated RAA, the rupture rate was 0.55%, and ruptures only occurred in patients with aneurysms greater than 3 cm in size.

Pregnancy has been associated with a higher rate of aneurysm rupture, possibly due to changes in vascular flow and hormonal shifts that result in weakening of the arterial wall elastic tissue. However, the true incidence of RAA within the pregnant population is unknown. The presence of an RAA with renovascular hypertension is also an indication for treatment. Studies have shown that reconstruction of an RAA can improve or cure co-existing hypertension, and the benefit of repair on hypertension is more likely to occur in those with renovascular hypertension than in those without arterial stenosis.

### Concomitant renal artery and aortic aneurysm: Is endovascular surgery the correct approach [^112BDYcL]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Our case illustrates the concomitant presence of a giant aneurysm of the left renal artery at the ostium and an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the presence of a complex aortic anatomy. The type of approach and timing of the treatment are still not well established for the rare coexistence of these two pathologies. In cases of surgical high-risk patients, endovascular therapy is now considered the best choice to exclude arterial and aortic aneurysms, though there is the potential need for further interventions during follow-up.

For this reason, we simultaneously treated both aneurysms through embolization with plugs and coils of the renal aneurysm and endovascular exclusion of the aortic aneurysm. In follow-up, the patient's renal function worsened until hemodialysis was required. Reperfusion of the renal aneurysm was observed, along with the onset of endoleak type I from above the aortic and renal aneurysm and type B from the iliac legs of the previous endograft. We performed a parallel graft technique on visceral vessels to exclude the refilling of both aneurysms and to preserve visceral vascularization. Follow-up at 12 months showed the complete exclusion of the aneurysms and the patency of stents in the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery.

### Renal artery aneurysm: Improved renal function after coil embolization [^113sogE9]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe a case of improved renal function and renovascular hypertension following percutaneous treatment of a renal artery aneurysm.

A case report focuses on a 72-year-old hypertensive woman with a hilar saccular aneurysm of the right renal artery. She underwent percutaneous coil embolization under local anesthesia. Four individual, soft, detachable platinum embolization coils were successfully inserted into the aneurysm, resulting in incomplete aneurysm exclusion. Despite this, the patient's blood pressure and renal function returned to normal. A three-month arteriogram demonstrated complete exclusion of the lesion and good renal perfusion. At 18 months post-treatment, the patient remains normotensive with documented improved renal function.

In conclusion, superselective coil embolization is effective for renal artery aneurysms exhibiting appropriate morphological features. While the long-term outcome of this less invasive therapy requires further assessment, it appears plausible that embolotherapy for renal artery aneurysms can correct secondary hypertension and deteriorating renal function.

### Renal artery aneurysms in pregnancy-management of an uncommon but serious vascular lesion [^114zi2G7]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is defined as a localized saccular or fusiform dilation of the renal vasculature that exceeds 50% of the adjacent artery diameter. RAAs are rare in the general population and account for less than 1% of all peripheral aneurysms. The incidental diagnosis of RAA has increased due to the widespread clinical application of visceral duplex ultrasound scanning and computed tomography imaging.

While the diagnosis of RAA before or during pregnancy is rare, pregnancy significantly increases the risk of rupture during the third trimester, with associated high mortality rates for both mother and fetus. The rarity of pregnancy-related RAAs contributes to our limited knowledge of their natural history, morphologic features, criteria for intervention, and treatment options. This review compiles opinions from published articles to provide an updated overview of RAA in pregnancy and aid clinicians in the management of this rare but serious vascular condition. An RAA of 1.5 cm in diameter requires open or endovascular treatment in a woman planning to become pregnant or who is pregnant.

### Robot-assisted laparoscopic reconstructed management of multiple aneurysms in renal artery primary bifurcations: a case report and literature review [^116v1TQj]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

RAA is a rare disorder, with multiple RAAs occurring in about 18% of cases, making them even rarer in the general population. Reaching a consensus on appropriate intervention indications for RAAs is challenging due to numerous factors, such as clinical symptoms (hematuria, refractory hypertension, persistent back pain, and renal infarction), anatomical characteristics (size, location, wall calcification, and enlarging lesion), and general clinical features (life expectancy, comorbidities, and planned pregnancy). Currently, widely accepted indications for RAA include an aneurysm size greater than 2 cm, reproductive-age women planning for pregnancy, and positive clinical manifestations such as pain, hematuria, and refractory hypertension attributable to the RAA. In our opinion, the coexistence of two RAAs in the renal artery increases the risk of rupture and progression, warranting active intervention.

RAAs can be managed by surgical or percutaneous interventional radiological treatments. Due to lower invasiveness and reduced morbidity, percutaneous interventional radiological techniques surpass traditional surgical techniques and have become increasingly popular. However, endovascular techniques are not preferred for conditions such as aneurysms located at artery bifurcations or distal branches. As the gold standard for RAAs, open surgery results in considerable blood loss, prolonged recovery, and a heavy patient burden. Since a report on laparoscopic repair of RAAs by…

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^113z3wdh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The Society for Vascular Surgery Clinical Practice Guidelines describe the care of patients with aneurysms of the visceral arteries. They include evidence-based size thresholds for the repair of aneurysms in the renal arteries, splenic artery, celiac artery, and hepatic artery, among others. Specific open surgical and endovascular repair strategies are also discussed. They also describe specific circumstances where aneurysms may be repaired at smaller sizes than these size thresholds, such as in women of childbearing age and in cases of false aneurysms. These guidelines offer important recommendations for the care of patients with aneurysms of the visceral arteries and provide long-awaited guidance for clinicians who treat these patients.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^113879rS]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms is an effective, minimally invasive treatment that has been successfully used since the early 1990s, with refined and expanded techniques and tools currently offering excellent outcomes. Due to increased detection of such lesions in recent years, many of which are asymptomatic, revision of the indications for intervention and the correct endovascular treatment approaches has become essential.

- **Purpose**: This document will presume that the indication for treatment is clear and approved by the multidisciplinary team and will define the standards required for the performance of each intervention, as well as their relative advantages and limitations. CIRSE Standards of Practice documents are not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care, but recommend a reasonable approach to, and best practices for, the performance of the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms.

- **Methods**: The writing group was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognized expertise in endovascular treatments. The writing group reviewed the existing literature on visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, performing an evidence search using PubMed to identify publications in English and relating to human subjects from 1990 to 2022. The final recommendations were formulated through consensus.

- **Results**: Endovascular treatment has an established role in the successful management of these conditions.

### A qualitative systematic review of endovascular management of renal artery aneurysms [^1138sAMX]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

To perform a qualitative systematic review, a comprehensive electronic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases from 2000 to 2022 was conducted using the search terms "renal artery", "aneurysm", and "endovascular". The primary endpoint focused on RAA-related mortality and rupture, while secondary endpoints included reintervention rate and renal infarction.

Twenty-six single-center retrospective observational studies were included in the review. A total of 454 RAAs were treated in 427 patients using endovascular techniques. The mean age of patients was 53.8 years, with a female predominance (62%). A variety of endovascular treatments for RAA were employed, yielding excellent technical success (96%), renal parenchymal preservation, and a low rate of moderate/severe adverse events (AEs). The most commonly used technique was primary coil embolization (44.7%). The overall AE rate was 22.9%, with 6.7% being moderate/severe, and there was 0% periprocedural mortality. The most common AE was renal infarction (49 patients, 11.5%); however, renal function was preserved in 84% of patients, and the nephrectomy rate was 0.4%. Computed tomography (CT) angiography was the most common imaging follow-up modality, used in 72% of studies. Only nine studies (34%) reported anticoagulant use. Although the risk of delayed aneurysm reperfusion warrants clinical and imaging surveillance, relatively few patients (3%) required reintervention in this cohort.

### Wide-neck renal artery aneurysm: Parenchymal sparing endovascular treatment with a new device [^114XrLG6]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare disorder, occurring in 0.01%–1.3% of the general population. It represents 1% of all aneurysms but is the second most common visceral artery aneurysm, accounting for approximately 25%.

RAAs are classified into four categories: saccular (70%), fusiform (22.5%), dissecting (7.5%), and mixed, including microaneurysms. Saccular aneurysms, the most common, typically occur at the primary or secondary bifurcations of renal arteries; more rarely, they are located intraparenchymally in a segmental artery or more distal branches. Etiologies for saccular aneurysms include atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, and neurofibromatosis. RAAs are often noted incidentally but can also be accompanied by hypertension, hematuria, or pain. Hypertension related to RAA remains a controversial topic; however, most case series on RAA treatment report improvement or resolution of hypertension after treatment.

The indication for treatment is currently based on a size threshold that continues to be debated, although most authors believe that aneurysms 2 cm or less in diameter do not require treatment. However, the decision to treat an aneurysm should be made not only on the basis of size, but also after considering other issues, such as the presence of clinical symptoms (hematuria, hypertension, back pain, and renal infarction), anatomical and morphological characteristics (location, wall calcification, enlarging lesion), and general clinical features (life expectancy, comorbidities, planned pregnancy).

### Endovascular vs open repair of renal artery aneurysms: outcomes of repair and long-term renal function [^116B74kz]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment (ER) of renal artery aneurysms (RAA) has gained popularity recently due to its presumed lower morbidity and mortality compared to open surgery (OS). This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of OS and ER and compare long-term renal function.

- **Study design**: Data from 2000 to 2012 were retrospectively collected to identify patients treated for RAA at a single institution. Morbidity, mortality, freedom from reinterventions, and renal function were compared between OS and ER for RAA.

- **Results**: Forty-four RAA repairs were identified in 40 patients (28 women, mean age ± SD 54 ± 13 years). Twenty RAA were repaired with OS (45%) and 24 RAA (55%) with ER. Mean aneurysm sizes were 2.5 ± 1.5 cm (OS) and 2.2 ± 2.2 cm (ER; p = 0.66). Endovascular repair included coil embolization with or without stent placement in 19 patients (79%) and stent grafts in 4 (17%). Open surgery included excision or aneurysmorrhaphy of the aneurysm in 11 kidneys (55%), graft interposition or bypass in 4 (20%), and 4 nephrectomies (20%). There was one technical failure in each group. Comorbidities were similar between the two groups (American Society of Anesthesiologists III-IV: OS, 40%; ER, 58%; p = 0.44). Endovascular repair and OS had equivalent perioperative morbidity (any complication OS, 15%; ER, 17%; p = 1.0) and no mortality (OS, 0%; ER, 0%). Endovascular repair was associated with shorter hospitalization (OS, 6.3 ± 2.5; ER, 2 ± 3.4 days, p < 0.001). Mean follow-ups were 21 ± 32 months (OS) and 27 ± 36 months (ER).

### Ex vivo repair and renal autotransplantation for complex renal artery aneurysms in a solitary kidney [^1159VMes]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare clinical entity with an incidence of 0.015–1%. Indications for interventional or surgical repair of RAAs are expanding aneurysms, a diameter greater than 2.5 cm, intractable renovascular hypertension, dissecting RAA, hematuria, and renal infarction after distal embolization. Interventional insertion of a stent graft as well as aortorenal bypass implantation are both low-risk procedures in simple aneurysms of the proximal renal artery. However, complex distal renal aneurysms involving several renal artery branches require not only excellent results in vascular reconstruction but also a surgical technique that offers maximal protection for the kidney during the ischemic period.

Here, we present a case of a solitary kidney with two consecutive RAAs of segmental renal artery branches (type 2 RAA). A surgical strategy, including renal explantation, ex vivo renal preservation, ex vivo reconstruction of the renal artery, and renal heterotopic autotransplantation, was successfully applied. The technique of ex vivo repair is a safe and effective surgical procedure in this clinical setting.

### Pregnancy with a ruptured renal artery aneurysm: Management concerns and endovascular management [^117BbS9H]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) affects less than 0.01% of the general population. Rupture of RAA is a rare catastrophe that can complicate pregnancy and is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. Presentation is usually acute, characterized by severe flank pain, with or without haematuria, and haemodynamic instability requiring exploration and nephrectomy.

A 26-year-old pregnant woman experienced the sudden onset of gross haematuria. Upon evaluation, she was found to have a left RAA with an intrapelvic rupture and thinned out renal parenchyma. In view of the high risk of surgery, she was managed with endovascular placement of an Amplatzer type II vascular plug. Immediate and complete occlusion of blood flow was achieved, thereby avoiding nephrectomy.

Follow-up Doppler ultrasound revealed a reduced 5 cm mass in the left renal fossa with no internal flow and the plug in position. She is currently on follow-up with ultrasonography every 3–6 months and does not require any intervention.

### Management and outcomes of renal artery aneurysms in older adults [^115AKAQA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare but clinically significant vascular abnormalities. The management of RAAs in older adults poses unique challenges related to their baseline comorbidities and age-related vascular changes. Traditionally, open surgery has been the gold standard for large or complex RAAs. However, recent data and guidelines support a more conservative threshold for intervention and a broader adoption of endovascular therapies, which offer lower perioperative morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and overall faster recovery. General indications for repair include symptomatic aneurysms, medically refractory hypertension, and lesions ≥ 3 cm. Medical management and surveillance are appropriate for asymptomatic patients with stable aneurysms < 3 cm, especially for those with limited life expectancy.

Open surgical techniques include both in situ and ex vivo reconstructions with demonstrated long-term durability but are associated with higher perioperative risk. Endovascular techniques, including coil embolization and stent grafting, are increasingly being used in anatomically suitable patients with high success. Postoperative outcomes suggest comparable long-term results between open and endovascular approaches. However, endovascular repair is associated with fewer complications and is increasingly preferred in elderly or high-risk populations. An individualized approach is essential to optimize outcomes, balancing the risks of intervention with the natural history of the disease.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^116huaBo]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Options for treatment of a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) include open surgical repair or endovascular approaches. Open surgery comprises ex-vivo reconstruction with auto-transplantation of the kidney or in-situ repair of the aneurysm. These open surgical approaches offer good vascular patency rates ranging from 93% to 100% and long-term survival rates averaging 90% at 10 years. Additionally, when performed in the appropriate patient, these surgeries are well tolerated with minimal morbidity and complication rates.

Endovascular treatments for RAA include the deployment of a covered stent or renal angioembolization. Small series have shown that the endovascular approach is well tolerated, with reported success rates of 83% to 100% and variable complication rates ranging from 13% to 60%. When comparing the endovascular approach to the open surgical approach, retrospective studies have suggested that the endovascular approach is associated with shorter hospitalizations, similar or fewer complications, and similar success rates. Additionally, no studies have reported a significant difference in mortality, perioperative morbidity, freedom from reintervention, or decline in renal function when comparing open and endovascular approaches to repairing RAAs.

Endovascular stenting or embolization is also the preferred approach for a renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP). In rare cases in which angioembolization is unsuccessful, open surgery with nephrectomy is necessary. Angioembolization of a RAP has a high success rate ranging from 93% to 96% in select series. The procedure is well tolerated with a complication rate of around 5%, with the most common complications including incomplete embolization.
