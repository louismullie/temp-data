## Question

What is the ideal duration of steroids in COPD exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ideal duration of systemic corticosteroids for acute COPD exacerbations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why duration matters. Then, I should verify the highest-quality direct evidence comparing durations. Next, I will review meta-analyses and guideline syntheses. After that, I need to check safety signals with longer courses. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why duration is important. Acute COPD exacerbations are common, costly, and associated with accelerated lung function decline and mortality, so minimizing steroid exposure while maintaining efficacy is a key trade-off. Prolonged systemic steroids increase risks such as hyperglycemia, infections, osteoporosis, and psychiatric effects, so the shortest effective course is desirable if outcomes are equivalent [^f5aa9415] [^f9b201f2].

> Next, I should review the pivotal direct evidence. The REDUCE randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared 5 days versus 14 days of 40 mg prednisone daily and found that 5 days was noninferior to 14 days for time to next exacerbation within 180 days, with no differences in lung function, need for ventilation, or adverse events, but with a 52% reduction in cumulative steroid exposure. This is the strongest single study informing duration decisions [^73e97173] [^ea0b0d5a].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and clinical relevance. In REDUCE, re-exacerbation rates were 35.9% with 5 days versus 36.8% with 14 days, with a hazard ratio of 0.95 and a 90% CI that met prespecified noninferiority margins. Median time to exacerbation was numerically longer with 5 days, and the cumulative prednisone dose fell from 793 mg to 379 mg, reinforcing the exposure benefit without sacrificing outcomes [^73e97173] [^ea0b0d5a].

> I will now examine corroborating evidence. A Cochrane review comparing short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (10–15 days) systemic steroids found no significant differences in treatment failure, relapse, lung function, or adverse events, supporting the concept that shorter courses are as effective and safe as longer ones. However, the authors emphasized that the evidence quality was moderate and that REDUCE strengthened confidence in a 5-day approach [^32827912] [^1def7614].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm guideline positions. GOLD 2025 explicitly recommends systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations, typically no more than 5 days, citing improvements in FEV1, oxygenation, and recovery time. The VA/DoD guideline similarly recommends 30–40 mg prednisone equivalent daily for 5–7 days, noting no benefit to higher doses or longer durations. ATS/ERS guidance allows up to 14 days but aligns with the principle of using the shortest effective course, and contemporary practice has shifted toward 5 days as standard [^bc848390] [^53c9ba8b] [^d4d0182f] [^f2e8d2f0] [^89aa9f94] [^baac830f].

> I need to check safety signals with longer courses. Observational data link longer steroid courses to increased risks of pneumonia, sepsis, and mortality, and pooled analyses of REDUCE and CORTICO-COP show that 2–5 day regimens yield more days alive and out of hospital and shorter hospital stays than 14-day regimens, without differences in death or ICU admission, reinforcing the harm of unnecessary exposure without added benefit [^f5aa9415] [^dbf7dcdd] [^0f74e2e7].

> But wait, what if the patient is different? Let me consider special populations. For milder exacerbations managed as an outpatient, 5 days remains reasonable given the same pathophysiology and the exposure-risk trade-off. For patients with repeated steroid bursts, cumulative toxicity becomes more salient, so minimizing exposure is even more important. For patients with diabetes or high infection risk, shorter, guideline-concordant courses with close monitoring are prudent [^bc848390] [^f5aa9415].

> I should double-check dosing and route. The standard dose is 40 mg prednisone orally daily, and oral therapy is as effective as intravenous, so IV should be reserved for those who cannot take oral medications. Tapering is not required for short 5-day courses, which simplifies care and reduces errors [^bc848390] [^f2e8d2f0].

> Let me synthesize. The ideal duration of systemic corticosteroids for an acute COPD exacerbation is 5 days at 40 mg prednisone orally daily, based on REDUCE's noninferiority, the Cochrane review showing no advantage to longer courses, and convergent guideline endorsements. Extending therapy to 7 days is acceptable if recovery is slower or comorbidities complicate tapering, but courses beyond 7–10 days should be avoided absent a compelling indication because they increase adverse effects without improving outcomes [^73e97173] [^32827912] [^bc848390] [^f2e8d2f0].

> Finally, I should confirm practical steps. Prescribe 40 mg prednisone daily for 5 days without taper, monitor for hyperglycemia, mood changes, sleep disturbance, and infection, and reassess at 48–72 hours. If there is inadequate response, reconsider the diagnosis, adherence, or complicating factors rather than reflexively extending steroids, and document the rationale if any deviation from 5 days is necessary [^bc848390] [^f2e8d2f0].

---

The ideal duration of systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations is **5 days** [^bc848390] at 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily [^53c9ba8b], as this achieves the same clinical outcomes as 7–14 days [^32827912] while minimizing adverse effects [^73e97173]. Prolonged courses beyond 5 days do not improve lung function, relapse, or readmission rates [^0f74e2e7] and increase risks such as hyperglycemia and infection [^f5aa9415]. Tapering is unnecessary for short courses, and oral therapy is preferred if feasible [^df05fec4].

## Evidence supporting a 5-day course

Multiple high-quality studies and guidelines converge on a **5-day course** as optimal:

- **REDUCE trial**: A randomized, double-blind trial showed 5 days of prednisone (40 mg daily) was noninferior to 14 days for time to next exacerbation, lung function, and clinical outcomes, with significantly less steroid exposure [^73e97173] [^ea0b0d5a].

- **Cochrane review**: Short courses (≤ 7 days) had similar rates of treatment failure, relapse, lung function, and adverse events compared with longer courses (10–15 days), supporting shorter durations [^32827912] [^1def7614].

- **GOLD 2025**: Recommends systemic corticosteroids for 5 days (typically 40 mg prednisone daily) to improve FEV1, oxygenation, and shorten recovery and hospitalization [^bc848390] [^53c9ba8b].

---

## Clinical outcomes of 5-day versus longer courses

| **Outcome** | **5-Day course** | **7–14 Day course** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Treatment failure | No significant difference | No significant difference | High [^32827912] |
| Relapse rate | No significant difference | No significant difference | High [^32827912] |
| Lung function (FEV1) | No significant difference | No significant difference | High [^32827912] |
| Adverse effects | Lower incidence | Higher incidence | High [^f5aa9415] |
| Hospital stay | Shorter | Longer | Moderate [^0f74e2e7] |

## Risks associated with prolonged corticosteroid use

Extending corticosteroids beyond 5 days increases **clinically meaningful risks**:

- **Hyperglycemia**: More frequent with longer courses [^notfound].

- **Infections**: Higher risk of pneumonia and other infections [^f5aa9415].

- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety, insomnia, and mood changes are more common with prolonged use.

- **Bone loss**: Increased osteoporosis risk with repeated or prolonged exposure.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Certain scenarios may warrant **individualized decisions**:

- **Severe exacerbations**: Consider 7–10 days if recovery is slow, but evidence for > 5 days is limited [^baac830f].

- **Frequent exacerbations**: Minimize cumulative exposure; avoid routine prolongation [^006a2899].

- **Comorbidities**: Use caution in diabetes, osteoporosis, or immunosuppression; prefer shorter courses [^f5aa9415].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

- **GOLD 2025**: 5 days of systemic corticosteroids (typically 40 mg prednisone daily) [^bc848390] [^53c9ba8b].

- **VA/DoD 2021**: 30–40 mg prednisone equivalent daily for 5–7 days; no benefit to higher doses or longer duration [^f2e8d2f0] [^89aa9f94].

- **ATS/ERS 2017**: Short course (≤ 14 days) of oral corticosteroids; oral preferred if feasible [^baac830f] [^df05fec4].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **Standard regimen**: 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for 5 days without taper [^bc848390].

- **Route**: Oral preferred if gastrointestinal function is intact [^df05fec4].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, and infection [^f9b201f2].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The ideal duration of systemic corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations is **5 days** at 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily [^bc848390]. This balances efficacy and safety, with no proven benefit to longer courses and clear increases in adverse effects with prolonged use [^73e97173] [^f5aa9415].

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^32827912]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be treated with systemic corticosteroid for seven to 14 days. Intermittent systemic corticosteroid use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness. Shorter treatment could reduce adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of short-duration (seven or fewer days) and conventional longer-duration (longer than seven days) systemic corticosteroid treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Methods

Searches were carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to June 2014 and ongoing trials registers up to July 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of systemic corticosteroid defined as short (i.e. seven or fewer days) or longer (i.e. longer than seven days). Other interventions-bronchodilators and antibiotics-were standardised. Studies with participants requiring assisted ventilation were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Eight studies with 582 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants (range 28 to 296) contributed to the meta-analysis. Mean ages of study participants were 65 to 73 years, the proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84%) and COPD was classified as severe or very severe. Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment. Five studies administered oral prednisolone (30 mg in four, tapered in one), and two studies provided intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Studies contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias. In four studies we did not find a difference in risk of treatment failure between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.46)), which was equivalent to 22 fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 51 fewer to 34 more). No difference in risk of relapse (a new event) was observed between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.56), which was equivalent to nine fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 68 fewer to 100 more). Time to the next COPD exacerbation did not differ in one large study that was powered to detect non-inferiority and compared five days versus 14 days of systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 311; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37). In five studies no difference in the likelihood of an adverse event was found between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 503; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.69, or nine fewer per 1000 (95% CI 44 fewer to 51 more)). Length of hospital stay (n = 421; mean difference (MD) -0.61 days, 95% CI -1.51 to 0.28) and lung function at the end of treatment (n = 185; MD FEV1 -0.04 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10) did not differ between short-duration and longer-duration treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids (of around five days) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer (10 to 14 days) courses. We graded most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates. The studies in this review did not include people with mild or moderate COPD; further studies comparing short-duration systemic corticosteroid versus conventional longer-duration systemic corticosteroid for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD are required.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1def7614]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) be treated with systemic corticosteroids (SCs) for seven to 14 days. Intermittent SC use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness. Shorter treatment could therefore reduce the risk of adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of short-duration (seven days or fewer) and longer-duration (more than seven days) SC treatment of acute COPD exacerbations in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials (to April 2011) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to April 2011), MEDLINE (from 1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (from 1980 to October 2010) and the reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of SC (seven days or fewer or more than seven days). Other interventions, e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics, were standardised; studies in other lung diseases were excluded, unless data on participants with COPD were available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data that were pooled them using Review Manager 5. We sought missing data from authors of studies published as abstracts only.

Main Results

We identified seven studies including 288 participants; two studies were fully published and five were published as abstracts. We obtained data for two studies published as abstracts from authors; these two abstracts and the two full papers contributed to meta-analysis. No study specified COPD diagnostic criteria and only one specified exacerbation criteria. Short course treatment varied between three and seven days and longer duration 10 to 15 days, at equivalent daily doses of corticosteroids; five studies used oral prednisolone (dose 30 mg, four studies, one tapered dose) and two studies used intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Mean ages of participants ranged from 64 to 73 years. We assessed the risk of allocation and blinding bias as low for these studies.

Primary Outcomes

risk of treatment failure did not differ significantly by treatment duration, but the confidence interval (CI) was too wide to conclude equivalence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.82; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.79) (three studies, n = 146). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) did not differ significantly when measured up to seven days (mean difference (MD) -0.07 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.05) or after seven days (MD -0.02 L;95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) in four studies (n = 187). The likelihood of an adverse event (four studies, n = 192) did not differ significantly by treatment duration, but again the CI was wide (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.40).

Authors' Conclusions

We based assessment of the efficacy of short (seven days or less) compared to longer duration (more than seven days) systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute exacerbations of COPD in this review on four of the seven included studies for which data were available. Two studies were fully published and two were published as conference abstracts but trialists were able to supply data requested for the review.The finding in this review that there is no significant increase in treatment failure with shorter systemic corticosteroid treatment for seven days or less for acute exacerbations of COPD, does not give conclusive evidence to recommend change in clinical practice due to a wide confidence interval around the estimate of effect. The four studies which contributed to the meta-analysis were of relatively low quality and five of the seven studies were not published as full articles. Thus there are insufficient data to allow firm conclusions concerning the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy of acute exacerbations of COPD to be drawn.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^73e97173]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (≥20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Interventions

Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to next exacerbation within 180 days.

Results

Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; P = .006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; P = .005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Inhaled corticosteroids versus placebo for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^3973f552]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much uncertainty. COPD clinical guidelines currently recommend selective use of ICS. ICS are not recommended as monotherapy for people with COPD, and are only given in combination with long-acting bronchodilators due to greater efficacy of combination therapy. Incorporating and critiquing newly published placebo-controlled trials into the monotherapy evidence base may help to resolve ongoing uncertainties and conflicting findings about their role in this population.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of inhaled corticosteroids, used as monotherapy versus placebo, in people with stable COPD, in terms of objective and subjective outcomes.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was October 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of ICS, given as monotherapy, with a placebo control in people with stable COPD. We excluded studies of less than 12 weeks' duration and studies of populations with known bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) or bronchodilator reversibility.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our a priori primary outcomes were 1. exacerbations of COPD and 2. quality of life. Our secondary outcomes were 3. all-cause mortality, 4. lung function (rate of decline of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )), 5. rescue bronchodilator use, 6. exercise capacity, 7. pneumonia and 8. adverse events including pneumonia. ]. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.

Main Results

Thirty-six primary studies with 23,139 participants met the inclusion criteria. Mean age ranged from 52 to 67 years, and females were 0% to 46% of participants. Studies recruited across the severities of COPD. Seventeen studies were of duration longer than three months and up to six months and 19 studies were of duration longer than six months. We judged the overall risk of bias as low.  Long-term (more than six months) use of ICS as monotherapy reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: rate ratio 0.88 exacerbations per participant per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94; I 2 = 48%, 5 studies, 10,097 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; pooled means analysis: mean difference (MD) -0.05 exacerbations per participant per year, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.02; I 2 = 78%, 5 studies, 10,316 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (MD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60; I 2 = 0%; 5 studies, 2507 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; minimal clinically importance difference 4 points). There was no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality in people with COPD (odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07; I 2 = 0%; 10 studies, 16,636 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Long-term use of ICS  reduced the rate of decline in FEV 1 in people with COPD (generic inverse variance analysis: MD 6.31 mL/year benefit, 95% CI 1.76 to 10.85; I 2 = 0%; 6 studies, 9829 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; pooled means analysis: 7.28 mL/year, 95% CI 3.21 to 11.35; I 2 = 0%; 6 studies, 12,502 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Adverse Events

in the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group, compared to placebo, in studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.88; I 2 = 55%; 9 studies, 14,831 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.91 to 3.68; 5547 participants) and hoarseness (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.74; 3523 participants). The long-term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures or bone mineral density over three years. We downgraded the certainty of evidence to moderate for imprecision and low for imprecision and inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review updates the evidence base for ICS monotherapy with newly published trials to aid the ongoing assessment of their role for people with COPD. Use of ICS alone for COPD likely results in a reduction of exacerbation rates of clinical relevance, probably results in a reduction in the rate of decline of FEV 1 of uncertain clinical relevance and likely results in a small improvement in health-related quality of life not meeting the threshold for a minimally clinically important difference. These potential benefits should be weighed up against adverse events (likely to increase local oropharyngeal adverse effects and may increase the risk of pneumonia) and probably no reduction in mortality. Though not recommended as monotherapy, the probable benefits of ICS highlighted in this review support their continued consideration in combination with long-acting bronchodilators. Future research and evidence syntheses should be focused in that area.

### Role of corticosteroids in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^b935e30a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid therapy for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has become increasingly commonplace over the past two decades. This practice was controversial because a number of small clinical trials provided inconclusive evidence about efficacy. Experience from recent trials indicates that systemic cortico-steroids are modestly effective in this setting. Systemic corticosteroids administered to hospitalized patients reduces the absolute treatment rate by about 10%, increases the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) by about 100 mL, and shortens the hospital stay by 1 to 2 days. Treatment should not extend longer than 2 weeks. The optimal starting dose is not known. Hyperglycemia and possibly an increased rate of secondary infections are expected complications of treatment.

### Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: does the dosage of corticosteroids and type of antibiotic matter? [^3de1216a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are significant events that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic therapy and systemic corticosteroids are important treatments for patients with severe AECOPD. The objective of this review is to summarize the most recent evidence concerning antibiotic and corticosteroid therapy, with a focused evaluation on the contribution of antibiotic type and corticosteroid dosage on patient outcomes.

Recent Findings

Macrolides should be considered the antibiotic of choice for prevention of AECOPD in patients who qualify for therapy. Macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams are all reasonable treatment options for severe AECOPD and the decision to use one over the other should be based upon patient characteristics and institutional or regional antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The best available evidence now suggests that higher-dose corticosteroids are not superior to treatment with lower-dose corticosteroids in patients with severe AECOPD. Additionally, longer durations of systemic corticosteroid therapy do not improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

Several antibiotic options are efficacious in the management of severe AECOPD and drug selection should be patient-specific. Recent studies suggest that lower dosages and shorter durations of corticosteroid treatment may be prudent.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^bc848390]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, corticosteroids, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering systemic corticosteroids (typically no more than 5 days) to improve FEV1, oxygenation, and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration in patients with acute exacerbation.

### Management of COPD exacerbations: a European Respiratory Society / American Thoracic Society guideline [^baac830f]. The European Respiratory Journal (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, corticosteroids, ATS/ERS 2017 guidelines recommend to consider administering a short course (≤ 14 days) of oral corticosteroids in ambulatory patients with COPD exacerbation.

### Corticosteroid therapy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^86085062]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized in part by a chronic inflammatory state in the airways (largely from chronic noxious stimuli such as tobacco smoke), punctuated with acute inflammatory exacerbations, which are often infectious. Although pathologically and biochemically different from the inflammation of asthma, the chronic inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in subgroups with asthma-like features and especially during exacerbations, might be expected to respond to corticosteroid therapy, as does asthma. Complications from long-term corticosteroid use are important, but they appear less when the corticosteroid is given via the inhaled route. Clinical evidence is particularly strong supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent exacerbations and oral corticosteroids to reduce the duration and impact of exacerbations.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^27196cb6]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Steroids of limited benefit for exacerbations of COPD (...) [^82b70321]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease frequently require hospitalization or intensive outpatient treatment when their symptoms worsen. Standard therapies for COPD include bronchodilators, oxygen, antibiotics and systemic steroids. In patients admitted to the hospital, high doses of steroids are often used, despite equivocal proof of efficacy in this clinical situation. Conversely, the adverse effects of steroids—hyperglycemia, mood changes and secondary infections—are well-known. Niewoehner and colleagues performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the role of systemic steroids in the management of exacerbations of COPD. The two goals of the study were to determine the rates of treatment failure and determine the optimal duration of steroid therapy. Patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups.

The first group was given 125 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone every six hours for 72 hours followed by oral prednisone that was tapered from 60 to 5 mg daily over an eight-week period. The second group received the same dosage of methyl-prednisolone followed by a tapering dose of oral prednisone for a two-week period. Patients who received eight weeks of steroids did not fare any better than those who received only two weeks. In addition, by six months the rates of treatment failure in the placebo and steroid groups were almost the same. Patients who received steroids did have shorter hospital stays and had a faster improvement in FEV. The authors conclude that systemic steroids provide a mild benefit for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD. The effect persists for at least 90 days.

There appears to be no benefit to administering steroids for longer than two weeks; an eight-week regimen was no more effective than a two-week regimen. It is unclear whether this benefit can be applied to the treatment of patients with mild exacerbations or stable COPD. editor's note: This study should challenge physicians to reevaluate their management approach to COPD, especially the use of steroids. At best, a short course of steroids may be indicated for select patients and must be weighed against the adverse effects of these medications. Similar data have been found with inhaled steroids in patients with COPD; that is, the benefits are small, often of short duration, and do not affect the clinical course of the disease. —j. t. k.

### A proposal for the withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in the clinical practice of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^2759c8a3]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

According to the current clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the addition of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to long-acting β 2 agonist therapy is recommended in patients with moderate-to-severe disease and an increased risk of exacerbations. However, ICS are largely overprescribed in clinical practice, and most patients are unlikely to benefit from long-term ICS therapy.Evidence from recent randomized-controlled trials supports the hypothesis that ICS can be safely and effectively discontinued in patients with stable COPD and in whom ICS therapy may not be indicated, without detrimental effects on lung function, health status, or risk of exacerbations. This article summarizes the evidence supporting the discontinuation of ICS therapy, and proposes an algorithm for the implementation of ICS withdrawal in patients with COPD in clinical practice.Given the increased risk of potentially serious adverse effects and complications with ICS therapy (including pneumonia), the use of ICS should be limited to the minority of patients in whom the treatment effects outweigh the risks.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: the evidence base [^b80663a0]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In long-term management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a number of medications improve pulmonary function test results. The long-term clinical benefits of those drugs would seem intuitive, but there is very little strong evidence that long-term outcomes in COPD are substantially affected by those drugs. Nevertheless, symptom improvement such as dyspnea reduction is certainly strong reason to use those agents. The 2 most compelling bodies of evidence in stable COPD are for oxygen therapy in the chronically hypoxemic patient and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Inhaled corticosteroids also appear to be useful in patients at risk for frequent exacerbations. In acute exacerbations, the rationale for therapy comes in part from the large body of literature regarding acute asthma therapy. Bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids both seem to reduce the severity and the duration of exacerbations. Moreover, routine antibiotic use seems beneficial, and the role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with patients suffering impending respiratory failure from acute COPD exacerbations is well supported by the literature.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management—key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

Management of exacerbations—pharmacologic treatment: The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events; short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation, and maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible, with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen considered in patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels; in patients with severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days; antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should be 5 days; methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

### Systemic corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^194712e8]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by symptoms of cough, sputum and breathlessness, which become worse during acute exacerbations. The airway inflammation associated with COPD has led to trials of the effect of systemic corticosteroids in COPD assessed in two Cochrane systematic reviews. In stable COPD, compared with placebo, oral corticosteroid treatment increased mean FEV(1) by 53 ml and mean 12-min walking distance by 29 m, but at an increased risk of any drug-related adverse event (OR 7.8). In acute exacerbations, oral corticosteroid treatment decreased the chance of treatment failure (OR 0.48), improved mean FEV(1) at 72 h by 140 ml and improved arterial blood gases, but increased the risk of drug-related adverse events (OR 2.3). Thus, treatment of stable and acute exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroids results in statistically significant average benefits, but at an increased risk of adverse events. In stable COPD, there is little support for the use of systemic corticosteroid treatment, as data on long-term outcomes are lacking. For acute exacerbations, the evidence to support the use of systemic corticosteroids is stronger, but further research is required to define the optimum dose, route and duration.

BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) often leads to hospitalization and is associated with a high mortality rate. AECOPD episodes lead to accelerated decline in lung function and have negative impact on physical activity and quality of life. Furthermore, AECOPD implies high socioeconomic costs. For decades, systemic corticosteroids have been a cornerstone in management of moderate to severe AECOPD. However, the optimal approach as regards the duration of treatment is unknown. The REDUCE study concluded that a 5-day course of systemic corticosteroids is noninferior to 14-days of treatment. Based on this, the recent GOLD strategy document recommends five to seven days of systemic corticosteroid treatment for patients with AECOPD.

### Medication regimens for managing COPD exacerbations [^9c4b48d2]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are a hallmark feature of COPD and contribute to morbidity and mortality. There is general agreement that the pharmacotherapy of COPD exacerbations includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Strong evidence exists for the benefit of corticosteroids for exacerbations and of antibiotics in the acute hospital setting. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, in the best drug selection, dose, route, and duration of treatment. This article reviews the evidence base and expert recommendations for drug treatment of COPD exacerbations in the out-patient and in-patient settings.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^f9b201f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admission and mortality. They contribute to long-term decline in lung function, physical capacity and quality of life. The most common causes are infective, and treatment includes antibiotics, bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and to compare the efficacy of parenteral versus oral administration.

Search Methods

We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and checked references of included studies and trials registries. We conducted the last search in May 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally with an appropriate placebo, or comparing oral corticosteroids with parenteral corticosteroids in the treatment of people with acute exacerbations of COPD. Other interventions (e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics) were standardised for both groups. We excluded clinical studies of acute asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met inclusion criteria for the comparison systemic corticosteroid versus placebo and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met inclusion criteria for the comparison oral corticosteroid versus parenteral corticosteroid and three studies contributed data (n = 239). The mean age of participants with COPD was 68 years, median proportion of males 82% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) per cent predicted at study admission was 40% (6 studies; n = 633). We judged risk of selection, detection, attrition and reporting bias as low or unclear in all studies. We judged risk of performance bias high in one study comparing systemic corticosteroid with control and in two studies comparing intravenous corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid.Systemic corticosteroids reduced the risk of treatment failure by over half compared with placebo in nine studies (n = 917) with median treatment duration 14 days, odds ratio (OR) 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.67). The evidence was graded as high quality and it would have been necessary to treat nine people (95% CI 7 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure. There was moderate-quality evidence for a lower rate of relapse by one month for treatment with systemic corticosteroid in two studies (n = 415) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). Mortality up to 30 days was not reduced by treatment with systemic corticosteroid compared with control in 12 studies (n = 1319; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.66).FEV1, measured up to 72 hours, showed significant treatment benefits (7 studies; n = 649; mean difference (MD) 140 mL; 95% CI 90 to 200); however, this benefit was not observed at later time points. The likelihood of adverse events increased with corticosteroid treatment (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.43). Overall, one extra adverse effect occurred for every six people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.86 to 4.19). For general inpatient treatment, duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment (MD -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18), with no difference in length of stay the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.Comparison of parenteral versus oral treatment showed no significant difference in the primary outcomes of treatment failure, relapse or mortality or for any secondary outcomes. There was a significantly increased rate of hyperglycaemia in one study (OR 4.89; 95% CI 1.20 to 19.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence to support treatment of exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroid by the oral or parenteral route in reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and relapse by one month, shortening length of stay in hospital inpatients not requiring assisted ventilation in ICU and giving earlier improvement in lung function and symptoms. There is no evidence of benefit for parenteral treatment compared with oral treatment with corticosteroid on treatment failure, relapse or mortality. There is an increase in adverse drug effects with corticosteroid treatment, which is greater with parenteral administration compared with oral treatment.

### Optimizing treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an assessment of current therapies [^b7cc9fe0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Bronchodilators are the mainstay of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) therapy. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists generally have a more rapid onset of effect and shorter duration of action than short-acting anticholinergic agents, and are usually prescribed as "rescue" medication to relieve acute bronchospasm. For patients with persistent symptoms, maintenance therapy with inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists is preferable to short-acting beta2-agonists because long-acting beta2-agonists provide more predictable, longer-lasting improvements in lung function. Long-acting anticholinergic agents can provide similar prolonged improvement in lung function with once-daily dosing. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and are recommended for patients with severe COPD and frequent exacerbations. Combining different classes of bronchodilators or combining a bronchodilator with a corticosteroid provides greater improvements in lung function and symptoms than the individual agents given alone. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and surgery, can benefit patients at various stages of disease. A treatment algorithm that combines both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of COPD is presented.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^f310acaf]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^de0dd63b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

COPD is a common condition, mainly related to smoking. Acute exacerbations of COPD, usually related to superimposed infection, occur commonly and systemic corticosteroids are widely used in their management in combination with other treatments including antibiotics, oxygen supplementation and bronchodilators.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcomes of acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Strategy

Searches were carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register with additional studies sought in the bibliographies of randomised controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies. The last search was carried out in August 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, with appropriate placebo control. Other interventions e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics were standardised. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data measured but not reported were sought from authors of included studies. Trials were combined using Review Manager for analyses.

Main Results

Eleven studies (n=1081) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 10 studies contributed data for analyses (n=1051). There were significantly fewer treatment failures within thirty days in patients given corticosteroid treatment, Odds Ratio (OR) 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 0.69 and Hazard Ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97. It would have been necessary to treat 10 patients (95%CI 7 to 16) with corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure in this time period. Duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment, mean difference -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18. For FEV1 there were significant treatment benefits with mean differences at the early time point (to 72 hours), 140 ml; 95% CI 90 to 190 ml and at end of treatment (up to 15 days) 80 ml; 95% confidence interval 10 to 160. There was a significant improvement in breathlessness and blood gases at both time points. There was no significant effect on mortality but an increased likelihood of an adverse event associated with corticosteroid treatment, OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.60 to 3.40. Overall one extra adverse effect occurred for every 5 people treated (95% CI 4 to 9). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased, OR 4.95; 95% CI 2.47 to 9.91.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of an exacerbation of COPD with oral or parenteral corticosteroids significantly reduces treatment failure and the need for additional medical treatment and shortens hospital stay. It increases the rate of improvement in lung function and dyspnoea and the improvement continues during treatment, but there is a significantly increase in the risk of an adverse drug event occurring. The optimal dose and length of treatment regime needs to be better defined.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^86860bba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much controversy. Major international guidelines recommend selective use of ICS. Recently published meta-analyses have reported conflicting findings on the effects of inhaled steroid therapy in COPD.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids in stable patients with COPD, in terms of objective and subjective outcomes.

Search Methods

A pre-defined search strategy was used to search the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register for relevant literature. Searches are current as of July 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of inhaled steroid with a placebo control in patients with COPD. Acute bronchodilator reversibility to short-term beta(2)-agonists and bronchial hyper-responsiveness were not exclusion criteria. The a priori primary outcome was change in lung function. We also analysed data on mortality, exacerbations, quality of life and symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use, exercise capacity, biomarkers and safety.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.

Main Results

Fifty-five primary studies with 16,154 participants met the inclusion criteria. Long-term use of ICS (more than six months) did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) in COPD patients (generic inverse variance analysis: mean difference (MD) 5.80 mL/year with ICS over placebo, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 11.88, 2333 participants; pooled means analysis: 6.88 mL/year, 95% CI 1.80 to 11.96, 4823 participants), although one major trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference. There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 8390 participants). Long-term use of ICS reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: MD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14, 2586 participants; pooled means analysis: MD -0.19 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.08, 2253 participants). ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (MD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60, 2507 participants). Response to ICS was not predicted by oral steroid response, bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD patients. There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.65, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.46, 5586 participants) and hoarseness. In the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group compared to placebo, in studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86, 6235 participants). The long-term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over three years.

Authors' Conclusions

Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life and possibly reduced rate of decline in FEV(1)) against the potential side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness, and risk of pneumonia).

### Role of corticosteroids in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^09b5443b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Evidence supporting or refuting the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has only recently become available, and evidence is still missing for a number of important clinical issues. Results from four large studies on the long-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids on COPD and other controlled studies on the more short-term effects of inhaled corticosteroids provide evidence that regular treatment with these drugs is only appropriate for a limited group of patients with COPD. These include symptomatic COPD patients with documented spirometric response to inhaled corticosteroids or those with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) less than 50% predicted and repeated exacerbations requiring treatments with antibiotics or oral corticosteroids.

### 'Exacerbation-free time' to assess the impact of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a prospective observational study [^4985ddc6]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience exacerbations, which are defined as 'sustained worsenings of the patient’s condition from the stable state, and beyond normal day-to-day variation, that are acute in onset and necessitate a change in regular medication'.Exacerbations lead to accelerated decline in lung function,, worse health status, and increased health care utilisation,and are the main cause of COPD-related hospitalisationsand mortality.In order to decrease the burden of exacerbations, prevention and prompt treatment of exacerbations are important goals in COPD patient management.

Intervention studies in COPD often assess exacerbation frequency (i.e. a simple count of the number of exacerbation episodes within a certain time frame, usually a year) as a primary outcome measure. However, measuring just the frequency of exacerbations has limitations. First, the definitions and algorithms used to calculate exacerbation frequency vary considerably between studies, and the choice for a particular definition or algorithm may influence the results substantially. Also, exacerbation frequency may not be the most appropriate measure in every study. For example, interventions that focus on improving exacerbation self-management are not so much designed to prevent the occurrence of exacerbations, but to shorten the duration of an exacerbation and prevent its further escalation by early recognition and prompt treatment. Furthermore, exacerbation frequency is used in clinical settings to categorise COPD severity or to select patients for particular treatment options (for instance inhaled corticosteroids or long-acting bronchodilators), but is only moderately related to patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life.

### Duration of corticosteroid use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: improving prescribing practices on clinical teaching units with peer-to-peer teaching [^3ebb3e51]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (COPDE) contribute to long-term decline in lung function and cause serious morbidity and mortality.Systemic corticosteroids (CS) are the mainstay of therapy and are associated with shorter recovery, improved lung function and reduced hospital stay.The most recent Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease consensus recommends a total duration of 5 days of CS for the treatment of COPDE.Since inappropriate duration of CS use is associated with adverse events,we aimed to optimise the duration of CS therapy (5 days) in adults hospitalised for COPDE on medical clinical teaching units (CTUs) of an academic medical centre with peer-to-peer teaching.

### Inhaled drugs to reduce exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^5d1c3a88]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Most patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receive inhaled long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Conventional meta-analyses established that these drugs reduce COPD exacerbations when separately compared with placebo. However, there are relatively few head-to-head comparisons and conventional meta-analyses focus on single comparisons rather than on a simultaneous analysis of competing drug regimens that would allow rank ordering of their effectiveness. Therefore we assessed, using a network meta-analytic technique, the relative effectiveness of the common inhaled drug regimes used to reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and searched existing systematic reviews and electronic databases for randomized trials of >/= 4 weeks' duration that assessed the effectiveness of inhaled drug regimes on exacerbations in patients with stable COPD. We extracted participants and intervention characteristics from included trials and assessed their methodological quality. For each treatment group we registered the proportion of patients with >/= 1 exacerbation during follow-up. We used treatment-arm based logistic regression analysis to estimate the absolute and relative effects of inhaled drug treatments while preserving randomization within trials.

Results

We identified 35 trials enrolling 26,786 patients with COPD of whom 27% had >/= 1 exacerbation. All regimes reduced exacerbations statistically significantly compared with placebo (odds ratios ranging from 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 0.80) for long-acting anticholinergics to 0.78 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.86) for inhaled corticosteroids). Compared with long-acting bronchodilators alone, combined treatment was not more effective (comparison with long-acting beta-agonists: odds ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.84 to 1.04] and comparison with long-acting anticholinergics: odds ratio 1.02 [95% CI 0.90 to 1.16], respectively). If FEV1 was </= 40% predicted, long-acting anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, and combination treatment reduced exacerbations significantly compared with long-acting beta-agonists alone, but not if FEV1 was > 40% predicted. This effect modification was significant for inhaled corticosteroids (P = 0.02 for interaction) and combination treatment (P = 0.01) but not for long-acting anticholinergics (P = 0.46). A limitation of this analysis is its exclusive focus on exacerbations and lack of FEV1 data for individual patients.

Conclusion

We found no evidence that one single inhaled drug regimen is more effective than another in reducing exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids when added to long-acting beta-agonists reduce exacerbations only in patients with COPD with FEV1 </= 40%.

### Inhaled drugs to reduce exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^1c44171c]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become a leading cause of death worldwide and its management requires an enormous amount of human and financial resources. Reduction of exacerbation rates is one of the main treatment goals in COPD management since exacerbations bear heavily on the patient's health-related quality of life and prognosis as well as on COPD-related costs. Several conventional meta-analyses provided evidence that long-acting beta-agonists, long-acting anticholinergics and inhaled corticosteroids reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD when compared with placebo [-]. The conventional meta-analyses are, however, less informative about the comparative effectiveness of long-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergics or about the additional value of inhaled corticosteroids when added to long-acting bronchodilators. The comparative effectiveness is of great interest to physicians because the predominant question in clinical practice is to choose between treatments rather than deciding whether to treat or not to treat.

Opinions differ about whether a long-acting bronchodilator alone is sufficient or if an inhaled corticosteroid provides additional benefits at least for some patients. Any added benefit of corticosteroids, if present, should outweigh the associated risk for adverse effects and their additional costs. Conventional meta-analyses [-,,] do not provide enough support to solve this debate because evidence from randomized head-to-head comparisons is often unavailable. Also, conventional meta-analyses cannot provide effect estimates for comparisons of more than two treatments at the same time, so that a ranking of competing treatments is not available. Finally, conventional meta-analyses cannot assess subgroup effects reliably although such information is very valuable for clinicians. Theoretically, a single very large trial would overcome these three limitations of conventional meta-analysis. However, the sample size would need to be a multiple of that of the recently published TORCH trial (more than 6000 patients) if subgroup effects were to be investigated.

Since such a trial is very unlikely to become available, a network meta-analysis or individual patient data meta-analysis can be very informative. Such pooled analyses unify evidence from all randomized trials while fully preserving randomization [-]. Therefore, our aim was to assess the relative effectiveness of competing inhaled drug regimens for the prevention of exacerbations in patients with stable COPD in a pooled analysis of randomized comparisons. In addition, we assessed whether the effectiveness depend on the severity of COPD, treatment duration, or the definition of an exacerbation (event based or symptom based).

Evidence-Based Answer Treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD with a shorter course of systemic corticosteroids is likely to be as effective and safe as treating with longer courses. There is no significant difference in adverse effects between shorter and longer courses.
1. Practice Pointers COPD is a chronic, progressive lung condition resulting in airflow limitations. Patients with COPD are at risk of acute exacerbations, which may present as dyspnea, increased cough, and sputum production. Systemic corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment, but the necessary duration of treatment is debated.

The authors of this review assessed whether a shorter course of systemic corticosteroids was as safe and effective as the more conventional 10- to 14-day course. Five studies used oral prednisolone, one study used intravenous methylprednisolone, and two studies used a combination of oral and intravenous corticosteroids. Shorter courses of corticosteroids ranged from three to seven days of treatment; longer courses ranged from 10 to 15 days. This review did not discuss whether three days of treatment is equivalent to other courses of up to seven days of treatment. The studies included only patients with severe to very severe COPD, although the criteria for this were not well-defined or consistent among studies. Three studies used pulmonary function testing diagnostic criteria, but even those criteria were not uniform. Primary outcomes included treatment failure, relapse after treatment, and adverse drug effects.

There was no difference in any primary outcomes between patients who were treated with systemic corticosteroids for seven or fewer days and those who were treated for more than seven days. The investigators rated the evidence for primary outcomes as moderate, with imprecision as a reported limiting factor. As noted, the studies did not specifically address outpatient therapy for COPD exacerbations and excluded patients with mild or moderate COPD. Current guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommend treating acute exacerbations of COPD with oral prednisone, 40 mg per day for five days in most patients. 2 The practice recommendations in this activity are available at http: //www. cochrane. org/CD006897.

### Effect of corticosteroids on exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^d92a27a9]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Periodic exacerbations of disease severity, which may lead to hospitalization, are a characteristic feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), becoming more prevalent as disease severity increases. Oral corticosteroids increase the rate of resolution of these episodes in both diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids are much less effective at conventional doses and are not recommended as a primary treatment for exacerbations of either disease. Maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids significantly reduces the chance that a further exacerbation will occur in asthma. In general, increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than placebo therapy in preventing exacerbations, at least until patients become persistently symptomatic and regular users of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Thereafter, the gains from doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy are modest and generally inferior to those that result from adding other antiinflammatory or bronchodilator agents to the treatment regime. The reduction in the incidence of exacerbations with inhaled corticosteroids, compared with placebo, ranges from 15 to 20% in COPD versus almost 50% in severe asthma. However, given the impact of exacerbations on overall quality of life in COPD, even this modest reduction is likely to be clinically important.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^85b38545]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2007). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial. Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, medication withdrawal studies, and observational reports have examined this question, with mixed results. Observational studies have been subject to criticism because of study design involving immortal time bias. Some randomized controlled trials suggest small benefits in lung function and health status, and a reduction in the rate of acute exacerbations of COPD and mortality, but their incomplete follow-up and statistical methods have been criticized. The greatest benefits of ICS in COPD have been reported with use of ICS and long-acting beta-agonist combination therapy, although no benefit was found for the primary outcome studied under the most rigorous methodology by the recent TORCH and Optimal randomized trials. Thus, although future randomized trials will need to be conducted with the most rigorous methodology for all outcomes, much uncertainty remains regarding the potential benefits of ICS in COPD.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^ea0b0d5a]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) was published by Jörg D Leuppi and colleagues in 2013 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the trial question was: is short-term systemic corticosteroid therapy noninferior to conventional corticosteroid therapy in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD? In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the population was: 311 patients (123 female, 188 male). The inclusion criteria were patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation. The key exclusion criteria were history of asthma, ratio of FEV1 to FVC > 70% as evaluated by bedside postbronchodilator spirometry, radiological diagnosis of pneumonia, estimated survival < 6 months due to severe comorbidity, pregnancy or lactation. In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the interventions were: n=156 short-term treatment (40 mg of prednisone daily for 5 days) n=155 conventional treatment (40 mg of prednisone daily for 14 days). In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in recurrent COPD exacerbation at 6 months (35.9% vs. 36.8%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.29). In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in need for mechanical ventilation (11% vs. 13.6%; OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.63) Significant increase in hospital stay (8 days vs. 9 days; HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.59). In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension. significant differences in mean cumulative prednisone dose (379 vs. 793 mg, p < 0.001). In the REDUCE (short-term corticosteroids) study, the conclusion was: in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, short-term treatment was noninferior to conventional treatment with respect to recurrent COPD exacerbation at 6 months.

### Five-day steroid treatment effective for acute COPD (...) [^46c617ec]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is a five-day course of systemic glucocorticoids effective in the treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bottom Line A five-day course of systemic glucocorticoids is at least as effective as a 14-day course in the treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD. . Synopsis Glucocorticoid therapy reduces the length of hospital stay in adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, but the optimal dose and duration of treatment are unknown. These investigators identified adults who presented to one of five emergency departments in Switzerland and who met standard clinical criteria for acute exacerbations of COPD.

Eligible patients randomly received five or 14 days of systemic glucocorticoids, beginning with 40 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on day 1, followed by 40 mg of oral prednisone daily for days 2 through 5, and then 40 mg of oral prednisone daily or matched placebo for days 6 through 14. Individuals assessing outcomes remained masked to treatment group assignment. All patients received antibiotic therapy for seven days and an inhaled, nebulized, short-acting bronchodilator as clinically indicated during hospitalization. Additional standard treatments included inhaled glucocorticoids, beta agonists, and tiotropium given throughout the study duration. Approximately 8% of patients in each treatment group were discharged directly from the emergency department; the remaining patients were hospitalized. Complete follow-up occurred for 99% of patients at six months.

Using intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in recurrent COPD exacerbations between the short-term and conventional treatment groups:

35. 9% vs.
36. 8%, respectively, met the primary end point of no exacerbations within 180 days. The median time to exacerbation was 43. 5 days in the short-term treatment group and 29 days in the conventional group. In subgroup analyses, the authors found no differences in results by differing severities of COPD. There were also no treatment group differences in the need for mechanical ventilation, quality-of-life assessments, hypertension or hyperglycemia worsening, infection rates, gastrointestinal bleeding, or all-cause mortality. Study design: Randomized controlled trial.

### Should you recommend inhaled corticosteroids for this patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?: grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^6507defa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 12 million adults in the United States receive a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) each year, and it is the fourth leading cause of death. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow obstruction and a constellation of symptoms, including cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, but other environmental exposures also may contribute. The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 2020 Report aims to provide a nonbiased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COPD. To date, no conclusive evidence exists that any existing medications for COPD modify mortality. The mainstay of treatment for COPD is inhaled bronchodilators, whereas the role of inhaled corticosteroids is less clear. Inhaled corticosteroids have substantial risks, including an increased risk for pneumonia. Here, 2 experts, both pulmonologists, reflect on the care of a woman with severe COPD, a 50-pack-year smoking history, frequent COPD exacerbations, and recurrent pneumonia. They consider the indications for inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, when inhaled corticosteroids should be withdrawn, and what other treatments are available.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^28bd512e]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and rationale

Current guidelines recommend that systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (n = 1700) assessed the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo in treating COPD exacerbations. Most of the studies from the meta-analysis were based on hospitalised patients. The meta-analysis showed that corticosteroids shorten hospital stays by approximately 1 day and have a moderately positive effect on pulmonary function tests and 30-day re-exacerbation rate, but do not seem to have any influence on survival. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in treating AECOPD are temporary, lasting only 3–5 days. The risk of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or re-exacerbations after the first month appears to be unaltered. Corticosteroids affect the expression of various genes, especially those regulating the innate and the adaptive immune system, leading to a variety of beneficial and harmful effects such as increasing the risk of acute or chronic infections, the onset or aggravation of diabetes mellitus, and osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, minimising the unnecessary exposure of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations to systemic corticosteroids is crucial. To date, two RCTs have investigated how such unnecessary exposure can be minimised, without attenuating the documented beneficial effects. In the REDUCE trial, patients hospitalised for AECOPD were randomly assigned to either 14 days (standard) or 5 days (intervention) of treatment with 40 mg of daily prednisone. The CORTICO-COP trial randomly assigned patients to 5-day (standard) or eosinophil-guided (intervention) therapy, with the latter regimen resulting in a median of 2 days of treatment with prednisolone.

However, it remains unclear whether 14-day or 2–5-day regimens would result in shorter admission durations and changes in mortality risk. We explored this by analysing the number of days alive and out of hospital based on two trial populations with different dosing regimens.

### Current and future pharmacologic therapy of exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma [^f88a1017]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Exacerbations are an important cause of the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Newer therapies include long-acting beta(2)-agonists, which are more effective than short-acting bronchodilators. Inhaled corticosteroids and, in asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists may have roles in the early phase of exacerbation as an alternative to or added to oral prednisolone. In the future, combinations of long-acting beta(2)-agonists and anticholinergic bronchodilators may offer additive clinical benefits. However, although the treatment and prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma have been improved by using combinations of known therapies, further research addressing the underlying etiology as well as molecular and pathophysiologic mechanisms of exacerbation is needed to better target novel therapies to the appropriate patient populations and to develop new therapeutic strategies.

### Inhaled corticosteroids with combination inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^ff81efaa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly involves a combination of long-acting bronchodilators including beta2-agonists (LABA) and muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). LABA and LAMA bronchodilators are now available in single-combination inhalers. In individuals with persistent symptoms or frequent exacerbations, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are also used with combination LABA and LAMA inhalers. However, the benefits and risks of adding ICS to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers as a triple therapy remain unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adding an ICS to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers for the treatment of stable COPD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase up to 30 November 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP up to 30 November 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials of three weeks' duration or longer that compared the treatment of stable COPD with ICS in addition to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers against combination LABA/LAMA inhalers alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were acute exacerbations of COPD, respiratory health-related quality of life, pneumonia and other serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes were symptom scores, lung function, physical capacity, and mortality. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for studies that contributed data to our prespecified outcomes.

Main Results

Four studies with a total of 15,412 participants met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of study participants ranged from 64.4 to 65.3 years; the proportion of female participants ranged from 28% to 40%. Most participants had symptomatic COPD (COPD Assessment Test Score ≥ 10) with severe to very severe airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 50% predicted) and one or more moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations in the last 12 months. Trial medications differed amongst studies. The duration of follow-up was 52 weeks in three studies and 24 weeks in one study. We assessed the risk of selection, performance, and detection bias to be low in the included studies; one study was at high risk of attrition bias, and one study was at high risk of reporting bias. Triple therapy may reduce rates of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers (rate ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.81; n = 15,397; low-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis stratifying by blood eosinophil counts showed there may be a greater reduction in rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations with triple therapy in participants with high-eosinophils (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.75) compared to low-eosinophils (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.93) (test for subgroup differences: P < 0.01) (high/low cut-offs: 150 eosinophils/µL in three studies; 200 eosinophils/µL in one study). However, moderate-to-substantial heterogeneity was observed in both high- and low-eosinophil subgroups. These subgroup analyses are observational by nature and thus results should be interpreted with caution. Triple therapy may be associated with reduced rates of severe COPD exacerbations (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.84; n = 14,131; low-certainty evidence). Triple therapy improved health-related quality of life assessed using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) by the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) threshold (4-point decrease) (35.3% versus 42.4%, odds ratio (OR) 1.35, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.45; n = 14,070; high-certainty evidence). Triple therapy may result in fewer symptoms measured using the Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.57; n = 3044; moderate-certainty evidence) and improved lung function as measured by change in trough FEV1 (mean difference 38.68 mL, 95% CI 22.58 to 54.77; n = 11,352; low-certainty evidence). However, these benefits fell below MCID thresholds for TDI (1-unit decrease) and trough FEV1 (100 mL), respectively. Triple therapy is probably associated with a higher risk of pneumonia as a serious adverse event compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers (3.3% versus 1.9%, OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.18; n = 15,412; moderate-certainty evidence). In contrast, all-cause serious adverse events may be similar between groups (19.7% versus 19.7%, OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; n = 15,412; low-certainty evidence). All-cause mortality may be lower with triple therapy (1.4% versus 2.0%, OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90; n = 15,397; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that triple therapy may reduce rates of COPD exacerbations (low-certainty evidence) and results in an improvement in health-related quality of life (high-certainty evidence) compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers, but probably confers an increased pneumonia risk as a serious adverse event (moderate-certainty evidence). Triple therapy probably improves respiratory symptoms and may improve lung function (moderate- and low-certainty evidence, respectively); however, these benefits do not appear to be clinically significant. Triple therapy may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers (low-certainty evidence). The certainty of the evidence was downgraded most frequently for inconsistency or indirectness. Across the four included studies, there were important differences in inclusion criteria, trial medications, and duration of follow-up. Investigation of heterogeneity was limited due to the small number of included studies. We found limited data on the effects of triple therapy compared to combination LABA/LAMA inhalers in patients with mild-moderate COPD and those without a recent exacerbation history.

Treatment setting for COPD exacerbations—the goals of treatment are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and prevent the development of subsequent events. Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

### What is the optimal treatment strategy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations? [^9997e33a]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The present study aims to determine whether treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations with intravenous steroids and aerosol bronchodilators (group I) is superior to oral steroids and multiple dose inhaler (MDI) bronchodilators with a spacer (group II). Group I received 40 mg methylprednisolone x day(-1) intravenously with a decrease to 20 mg after 10 days and a further decrease of 4 mg x 4 days(-1). Aerosol therapy consisted of 10 mg salbutamol and 1 mg ipratropiumbromide x day(-1). Group II received 32 mg methylprednisolone orally for 1 week followed by 24 mg x day(-1) for 4 days and a subsequent decrease of 4 mg x week(-1). Duovent MDI with a spacer was given at a dose of 1.6 mg fenoterol and 640 microg ipratropiumbromide x day(-1). In group I (n=19) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) rose from 0.82+/-0.46 to 0.91+/-0.47 L and average dyspnoea decreased from 6.0+/-1.9 to 4.1+/-2.6 within 10 days. The Chronic Respiratory Disease Index Questionnaire (CRQ) score increased from 78+/-24 to 90+/-24 points after 4 weeks. In group II (n=18) FEV1 increased from 0.70+/-0.27 to 0.90+/-0.29 L, dyspnoea regressed from 6.2+/-2.4 to 2.7+/-2.6 and CRQ from 67+/-17 to 86+/-20. Both groups showed similar results in dropout rate, length of hospital stay and patient satisfaction. In conclusion, the two treatment strategies appear equally effective in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, although oral steroids and metered dose inhaler bronchodilators appear associated with a higher risk of hospital re-admission.

### The effects of inhaled corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^0d9c3238]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Although inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used to treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), their effect on clinical outcomes such as exacerbation and mortality is unknown. This systematic review was conducted to determine whether inhaled corticosteroids improve clinical outcomes for patients with stable COPD. All placebo-controlled randomized trials of inhaled corticosteroids given for at least 6 months for stable COPD were identified by searching MEDLINE (1966-2000), EMBASE (1980-2001), CINAHL (1982-2000), SIGLE (1980-2000), the Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry, and the bibliographies of published studies. We independently extracted data from each of the studies using a specified protocol, and determined the summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for exacerbations and deaths. Nine randomized trials (3976 patients with COPD), including four with a systemic steroid run-in phase, were identified. Use of inhaled corticosteroid therapy reduced the rate of exacerbations (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.84), with similar benefits in those who were and were not pretreated with systemic steroids. Inhaled corticosteroid therapy was also associated with increased rates of oropharyngeal candidiasis (RR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.5 to 3.1), skin bruising (RR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.6 to 2.8), and lower mean cortisol levels. No effects were seen on all-cause mortality (RR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.18) in the five trials that measured this outcome. This systematic review demonstrates a beneficial effect of inhaled corticosteroids in reducing rates of COPD exacerbation. Further research is required to define the long-term effects of these medications and the benefit/risk ratio for patients with COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^006a2899]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD exacerbations—systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids: Data indicate that systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations shorten recovery time and improve lung function, and also improve oxygenation, the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and the length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisolone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended; therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration, and nebulized budesonide alone may be a suitable alternative that provides similar benefits to intravenous methylprednisolone. Observational and safety data note that even short bursts are associated with subsequent increased risk of pneumonia, sepsis and death and use should be confined to patients with significant exacerbations, and longer courses are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and mortality. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (STARR2), prednisolone therapy guided by blood eosinophil count during acute COPD exacerbation was non-inferior to standard care including systematic prednisolone treatment (30 mg per day for 14 days) and allowed a 33% reduction in the proportion of patients receiving prednisolone; the authors concluded that blood eosinophil-directed prednisolone can be used to safely reduce systemic glucocorticoid use in clinical practice.

### Guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians (...) [^c2ebe239]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice • Systemic corticosteroids prevent clinical failure in COPD exacerbations. Treatment for 10 days or longer increases adverse effects and may not be more effective than treatment for three to five days. • Antibiotics for seven days increase clinical cure in COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 7. • Magnesium, theophyllines, and mucolytics do not improve outcomes in COPD exacerbations, and bronchodilators had no benefit in limited studies. From the AFP Editors. Corticosteroids In acute exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids reduce exacerbations with a number needed to treat of 3 to prevent clinical failure. Clinical failure is defined as the lack of significant clinical improvement or the need for additional therapy. This is based on only two randomized controlled trials with 286 patients, yet there were no clinical failures in the corticosteroid group of either study.

The evidence is low quality due to the high risk of bias and imprecision in both studies. Adverse events are not significantly increased with corticosteroid therapy. Treatment for 10 to 14 days may not provide greater benefit over treatment for three to five days. A large retrospective study of more than 10, 000 patients demonstrated small increases in hospitalization for pneumonia and mortality with longer corticosteroid courses. Antibiotic Therapy Antibiotic therapy also improves outcomes in acute exacerbations of COPD. Moderate quality evidence suggests that antibiotic treatment increases the rate of clinical cure at the end of treatment with an NNT of 7 and reduces the rate of clinical failure with an NNT of 9. Evidence is insufficient to suggest the superiority of any one antibiotic. Antibiotics used in trials included doxycycline, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin/ clavulanate. Antibiotics were most often administered for seven days.

All agree on the usefulness of corticosteroid therapy in exacerbations and cast doubt on magnesium and mucolytics. Although all agree that antibiotics appear to reduce treatment failure, the VA/DoD are ambivalent about their use because antibiotics have not been shown to reduce recurrent exacerbations. The GOLD and AHRQ reports support the AAFP recommendation for antibiotic use. —Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs): We suggest considering withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD without moderate to severe exacerbations in the last two years (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). Supporting evidence includes moderate to high quality findings from an SR of eight RCTs showing ICS withdrawal did not differ from ICS continued for risk of exacerbations and time to exacerbation, with those weaned having significant improvement in quality of life by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, other studies reporting a small but clinically insignificant decrease in FEV1 and no change in adverse events or rates of exacerbation, and evidence from two RCTs suggesting increased risk of exacerbation in participants with higher baseline absolute blood eosinophil levels with threshold (≥300 cells/µl).

### Inhaled and systemic corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^e4158ea0]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Systemic and local inflammation is central to the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Increased levels of inflammation have been linked to a more progressive course in COPD and have been shown to be present during an exacerbation. Decreases in inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein, and inflammatory cells have been observed with corticosteroid use, suggesting a possible mechanism for a therapeutic benefit of steroids. No available data support the routine use of systemic corticosteroids in stable COPD; however, short courses during exacerbations are likely to improve length of hospitalization, lung function, and relapse rate. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) decrease the rate of exacerbation and may improve the response to bronchodilators and decrease dyspnea in stable COPD. No study shows that ICS reduce the loss of lung function; however, recent data suggest a possible survival benefit when combined with long-acting beta agonists. There are limited data on the use of ICS in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and its role in this setting must be more clearly defined. The empiric use of systemic corticosteroids perioperatively represents another area of uncertainty. The role of pharmacogenetics in the metabolism of corticosteroids in COPD is evolving but may be partially responsible for the observed variability in patient responsiveness. The potential benefits of systemic or inhaled corticosteroid use must be weighed against the risk of known toxicities.

### Oral corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^c897eeda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic lung disorder, usually related to cigarette smoking, representing a major and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality. It is defined "as a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases". The use of corticosteroids for their anti-inflammatory effects has been suggested.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids on the health status of patients with stable COPD.

Searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and MEDLINE were carried out in December 2003 and 2004. Review articles and bibliographies were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled prospective studies in adults with stable COPD ( post-bronchodilator FEV1 <80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC <70%) and a history of smoking, excluding known asthmatics, in which oral steroid use was compared with placebo and use of co-interventions was matched in both groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted independently by two reviewers. All trials were combined using Review Manager (version 4.2.7).

Main Results

From 459 titles 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Treatment lasted three weeks or less in 19 studies, high dose oral steroid was used in 21 studies and subjects had moderate or severe COPD in 15 studies. There was a significant difference in FEV1 after two weeks treatment, WMD 53.30 ml; 95% confidence interval 22.21 to 84.39 favouring oral steroid use compared to placebo when 14 studies with available data (n=396) were combined, with no significant heterogeneity. There was a significant increase in odds for individual patient FEV1 response greater than 20% from baseline with high dose oral steroid treatment compared to placebo, OR 2.71; 95% CI 1.84 to 4.01 (9 studies) . It would be necessary to treat 7 patients (95% CI 5 to 12) with oral corticosteroids to achieve one extra case of increasing FEV1 by more than 20%, with a placebo group risk of 0.13. All differences in health-related quality of life were less than the minimum clinically important difference. There were small statistically significant advantages for functional capacity and respiratory symptom of wheeze with oral steroid treatment but no significant difference in risk of withdrawal from study due to an exacerbation or rate of serious exacerbations over 2 years with low dose oral steroid treatment. There was an increased risk of adverse effects, including increased blood glucose, adrenal suppression and reduced serum osteocalcin.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the long-term use of oral steroids at doses less than 10-15 mg prednisolone though some evidence that higher doses (>/= 30 mg prednisolone) improve lung function over a short period. Potentially harmful adverse effects e.g.. diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis would prevent recommending long-term use at these high doses in most patients.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: a comprehensive care framework [^0424f736]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of disease, reduction of risk factors, the management of stable COPD, and the prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and health-care professionals. Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life. Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD. Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at prevention and management of exacerbations. In addition to controlled oxygen therapy, antimicrobials, brief courses of systemic corticosteroids and, on occasion, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation may play a role. The role of respiratory therapists in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of stable COPD and exacerbations is absolutely essential if the goals of the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines are to be attained.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^2c18b2cd]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological management uses a separate follow-up algorithm based on two key treatable traits—persistence of dyspnea and occurrence of exacerbations—and is designed to facilitate management of patients taking maintenance treatment(s), whether early after initial treatment or after years of follow-up; these recommendations incorporate evidence from clinical trials and the use of peripheral blood eosinophil counts as a biomarker to guide the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy for exacerbation prevention.

### Inhaled corticosteroid withdrawal in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can IMPACT help? [^d0d409fc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1. 
Rate ratio and 95% confidence interval of moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations comparing inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) withdrawal with ICS continuation from the WISDOM (Withdrawal of Inhaled Steroids during Optimized Bronchodilator Management), INSTEAD (Indacaterol: Switching Non-exacerbating Patients with Moderate COPD from Salmeterol/Fluticasone to Indacaterol), and IMPACT (Informing the Pathway of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Treatment) trials, with the latter computed among all 7,360 users of ICSs and among the 2,406 users of triple therapy at baseline.

What could explain these large differences? First, the patient populations were different. WISDOM enrolled patients with an FEV 1 of less than 50% predicted and a history of at least one COPD exacerbation in the previous year, which is identical to the first type of patients selected in IMPACT. However, IMPACT also included a second type of patients, with an FEV 1 of 50% to 80% predicted and two or more moderate exacerbations or one severe exacerbation in the previous year. Thus, 100% of this GOLD 2 subgroup in IMPACT were frequent exacerbators compared with an expected 22%, as observed in the ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints) cohort. Moreover, a history of asthma was permitted in IMPACT, but no such information was provided in WISDOM.

The INSTEAD trial included patients with an FEV 1 of 50% to 80% predicted, no exacerbation in the previous year, and no history of asthma, whose ICS-based treatment for more than 3 months was not recommended. In contrast, for patients with this degree of airway obstruction, the IMPACT trial required frequent exacerbations and allowed a “history of asthma,” a significant risk factor for moderate and severe COPD exacerbations (–). A second explanation for the differences is the abruptness of ICS withdrawal in IMPACT compared with the gradual ICS dose reduction over the first 12 weeks of follow-up in WISDOM. The INSTEAD trial also had an abrupt withdrawal, though the patients did not have prior exacerbations and had been inappropriately treated with ICS.

A promising aspect of the IMPACT trial is its varied patient population. Indeed, the presence of moderate to very severe airway obstruction, frequent and less frequent exacerbations, history of asthma, and blood eosinophil counts are all significant risk factors for COPD exacerbations, thus allowing the identification of profiles of patients who would benefit from ICS withdrawal or continuation (–).

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^f3fd9619]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Combination inhaled therapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and long-acting β2-agonists (LABA): these are basically longer-acting variations with a 12- or 24-h administration regimen, respectively; and 12- and 24-h inhaled corticosteroids, and each agent, singularly or in combination, has been shown to improve lung function, relieve symptoms, and improve health-related quality of life and exercise endurance. Existing national and international COPD guidelines have recommended that if COPD symptoms are not well controlled with single agents, the combination of two or more agents in a stepwise manner is reasonable. GOLD grades disease severity using the number of exacerbations and recommends combination therapy for patients with two or more exacerbations (categories C and D). The combination includes primarily an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist, although potential use of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist plus a long-acting β2-agonist is also recommended based primarily on consensus. In patients with more severe COPD (GOLD category D), triple therapy is considered appropriate.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^b8ad6e8d]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our data do not support using 14-day systemic corticosteroid regimens to treat hospitalised patients with COPD exacerbations. Patients who were randomly assigned to 2–5-day systemic corticosteroid regimens showed more favourable primary outcomes; a result driven by the substantially shorter admission durations. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these results are due to factors other than corticosteroid dose.

### Do chronic inhaled steroids alone or in combination with a bronchodilator prolong life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients? [^9209bfd4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonists are commonly used to treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to attenuate symptoms and to prevent exacerbations. Whether these medications prolong survival is uncertain.

Recent Findings

Inhaled corticosteroids attenuate airway and systemic inflammation, reduce airway hyperreactivity, improve patient symptoms and prevent exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. The data on mortality are mixed. A pooled analysis of published randomized controlled trials indicated that inhaled corticosteroids reduced mortality by around 25%; however other studies have failed to show a beneficial effect on mortality. The addition of long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonists to inhaled corticosteroids enhances the clinical effectiveness of these medications and confers incremental mortality benefits to patients. Interestingly, these medications appear to be especially beneficial in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, though large randomized controlled trials powered specifically on these endpoints are needed to confirm these early findings.

Summary

Inhaled corticosteroids, especially with long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonists, reduce airway inflammation and appear to prolong survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. They may be particularly effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of patients, pending confirmation by additional clinical studies powered specifically on these endpoints.

### Duration of corticosteroid use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: improving prescribing practices on clinical teaching units with peer-to-peer teaching [^3b20cb87]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The most recent Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease consensus recommends a 5-day course of corticosteroid (CS) therapy for acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (ACOPDE). As inappropriate use of CS therapy is associated with adverse events, we implemented a peer-to-peer education intervention to improve adherence to guidelines for patients with ACOPDE admitted to a medical clinical teaching unit at a tertiary care university centre.

Methods

Our study was a before-after design study with a concurrent control of a 15min peer-to-peer educational intervention targeting medical residents at the beginning of a 4-week rotation for 12 consecutive months. Another medical teaching unit within the same university network, but at a different site, served as a concurrent control. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received appropriate duration of CS therapy (5 days) for ACOPDE during the intervention period as compared with the 12-month preintervention period at the intervention and control hospitals.

Results

Following the intervention, there was an increase in the proportion of patients receiving appropriate duration of CS therapy (34.2% to 51.3%, p=0.02) at the intervention hospital and no significant difference at the control hospital (22.8% to 34.1%, p=0.15). This effect was maintained at the intervention hospital 3months postintervention period.

Conclusion

A short peer-to-peer educational intervention targeting medical residents on a clinical teaching unit improved adherence to appropriate duration of CS therapy for ACOPDE.

### Dual combination therapy versus long-acting bronchodilators alone for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c93bdf15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

We will use end‐of‐study data for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we will categorise the timing of outcome assessments as follows: short‐term (up to three months), medium‐term (three to six months), and long‐term (beyond six months). These time points have been chosen based on the typical progression and impact timelines of the intervention under study. Moderate exacerbation is defined as worsening of respiratory status that requires treatment with systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics; severe exacerbation is defined as rapid deterioration that requires hospitalisation.

Critical outcomes

Mortality
COPD exacerbation (moderate to severe and severe)

Important outcomes

St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score
SGRQ responder: a decrease in SGRQ score of ≥ 4 units
All‐cause serious adverse events (SAEs)
Pneumonia

If we exclude studies based on outcomes, we will ascertain that the relevant outcomes are genuinely unavailable because they have not been measured, rather than merely not reported, in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We will identify studies from searches of the following databases and trial registries using the guidance provided in Chapter 4 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. This review will update the Cochrane network meta‐analysis conducted in 2018 ; therefore, the search strategies will include date limits from 2018 onward.

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), via the Cochrane Register of Studies; 2018 to date
MEDLINE (Ovid); 2018 to date
Scopus, which indexes everything in Embase along with additional content; 2018 to date
US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (www.clinicaltrials.gov); 2018 to date
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (trialsearch.who.int/); 2018 to date

The proposed MEDLINE search strategy, which uses the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials, except in CENTRAL, is provided in Supplementary material 1 and will be adapted for use in other databases. There will be no restrictions on language or publication type.

Searching other resources

We will check the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references. We will search relevant manufacturers' websites for trial information. We will search for errata or retractions from the included studies published in full text on PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), and will report the date this was done within the review. Additionally, we will search the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) websites for relevant information.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^e64463b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

COPD is a common condition, mainly related to smoking. The burden of the disease is increasing and it is projected to rank fifth in 2020 for the world-wide burden of disease. Acute exacerbations of COPD, usually related to superimposed infection occur commonly and systemic corticosteroids are widely used in their management in combination with other treatments including antibiotics, oxygen supplementation and bronchodilators.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcome in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Strategy

Searches were carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register with additional studies sought in the bibliographies of randomised controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies. The last search was carried out in August 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, with appropriate placebo. Other interventions e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics were standardised. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted independently by two reviewers. Outcome data was sent to authors for verification. All trials were combined using Review Manager (version 4.2.4) for analyses.

Main Results

Ten studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There were significantly fewer treatment failures within thirty days in patients given corticosteroid treatment, odds ratio 0.48; 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.68 and Hazard Ratio 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.97. It would have been necessary to treat 9 patients (95%CI 6 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure in this time period. There was no significant difference in mortality. The early FEV1, up to 72 hours, showed a significant treatment benefit, weighted mean difference 140 mls (95% confidence interval 80-200 mls), although this benefit was not found for later time points. There was a significant improvement in breathlessness and blood gases between 6 - 72 hours after treatment. There was an increased likelihood of an adverse drug reaction with corticosteroid treatment, odds ratio 2.29; 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 3.38. Overall one extra adverse effect occurred for every 6 people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased, odds ratio 5.48; 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 18.96.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of an exacerbation of COPD with oral or parenteral corticosteroids significantly reduces treatment failure and the need for additional medical treatment . It increases the rate of improvement in lung function and dyspnoea over the first 72 hours, but at a significantly increased risk of an adverse drug reaction.

### Inhaled corticosteroids versus long-acting beta (2)-agonists for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^fc594662]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting beta(2)-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids can be used as maintenance therapy by patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These interventions are often taken together in a combination inhaler. However, the relative added value of the two individual components is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the relative effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared to long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABA) on clinical outcomes in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (latest search August 2011) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists in the treatment of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and then extracted data on trial quality, study outcomes and adverse events. We also contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We identified seven randomised trials (5997 participants) of good quality with a duration of six months to three years. All of the trials compared ICS/LABA combination inhalers with LABA and ICS as individual components. Four of these trials included fluticasone and salmeterol monocomponents and the remaining three included budesonide and formoterol monocomponents. There was no statistically significant difference in our primary outcome, the number of patients experiencing exacerbations (odds ratio (OR) 1.22; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.67), or the rate of exacerbations per patient year (rate ratio (RR) 0.96; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.02) between inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists. The incidence of pneumonia, our co-primary outcome, was significantly higher among patients on inhaled corticosteroids than on long-acting beta(2)-agonists whether classified as an adverse event (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.73) or serious adverse event (Peto OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.93). Results of the secondary outcomes analysis were as follows. Mortality was higher in patients on inhaled corticosteroids compared to patients on long-acting beta(2)-agonists (Peto OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.42), although the difference was not statistically significant. Patients treated with beta(2)-agonists showed greater improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) compared to those treated with inhaled corticosteroids (mean difference (MD) 18.99 mL; 95% CI 0.52 to 37.46), whilst greater improvements in health-related quality of life were observed in patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids compared to those receiving long-acting beta(2)-agonists (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) MD -0.74; 95% CI -1.42 to -0.06). In both cases the differences were statistically significant but rather small in magnitude. There were no statistically significant differences between ICS and LABA in the number of hospitalisations due to exacerbations, number of mild exacerbations, peak expiratory flow, dyspnoea, symptoms scores, use of rescue medication, adverse events, all cause hospitalisations, or withdrawals from studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Placebo-controlled trials have established the benefits of both long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy for COPD patients as individual therapies. This review, which included trials allowing comparisons between LABA and ICS, has shown that the two therapies confer similar benefits across the majority of outcomes, including the frequency of exacerbations and mortality. Use of long-acting beta-agonists appears to confer a small additional benefit in terms of improvements in lung function compared to inhaled corticosteroids. On the other hand, inhaled corticosteroid therapy shows a small advantage over long-acting beta-agonist therapy in terms of health-related quality of life, but inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of pneumonia. This review supports current guidelines advocating long-acting beta-agonists as frontline therapy for COPD, with regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy as an adjunct in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations.

### Inhaled drugs to reduce exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a network meta-analysis [^38f8acbc]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and selection

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Oxford, United Kingdom, 2007, Issue 2), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (last search on November 20 th 2007) and the Health Technology Assessment database (last search November on 20 th 2007) for randomized trials included in existing systematic reviews (see Additional file 1 for systematic reviews used to identify relevant studies). We based our searches on existing systematic reviews in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of previous work. The existing systematic reviews used extensive search strategies that included several databases such as Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS as well as websites of regulatory bodies. In addition, drug companies were approached for unpublished trials. We complemented these searches by entering all included studies into the 'related articles' function of PubMed (last search for trials on November 20 th, 2007).

We included randomized trials without any language restrictions that were ≥ 4 weeks in duration, included patients with stable COPD, and assessed the effects of long-acting beta-agonists, long-acting anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, or combination treatment (long-acting beta-agonists plus inhaled corticosteroids) on exacerbations with or without placebo control. We included all trials where the proportion of patients with at least one exacerbation during follow-up was reported. We did not include trials where only the mean number of exacerbations per patient year was reported because meta-analysis of such data is prone to bias without individual patient data.

We retrieved all full reports of potentially eligible trials. Two reviewers (research fellows with medical doctor degrees and one and three years of research experience, respectively) independently assessed them and determined their inclusion or exclusion. If the two reviewers disagreed even after discussion, a third reviewer (epidemiologist with MD and PhD degree) arbitrated. Out of 56 trials identified initially, we excluded 20 (Figure 1, see also Additional file 2 for excluded studies). Another trial met the inclusion criteria but it could not be included in the analysis because the treatments (combination of long-acting beta-agonist, long-acting anticholinergic and inhaled corticosteroid versus one or two components), were dissimilar to those in the included trials. We included the remaining 35 randomized trials in the analysis [,-]. One trial was republished together with another trial. We considered the data from both trials as published in the second report.

### Eosinophil-guided corticosteroid therapy in patients admitted to hospital with COPD exacerbation (CORTICO-COP): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^0905abdf]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Background

Treatment with systemic corticosteroids in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with debilitating adverse effects. Therefore, strategies to reduce systemic corticosteroid exposure are urgently required and might be offered by a personalised biomarker-guided approach to treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether an algorithm based on blood eosinophil counts could safely reduce systemic corticosteroid exposure in patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Methods

We did a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial at the respiratory departments of three different university-affiliated hospitals in Denmark. Eligible participants were patients included within 24h of admission to the participating sites, aged at least 40 years, with known airflow limitation (defined as a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /forced vital capacity [FVC] ratio ≤0·70) and a specialist-verified diagnosis of COPD, who were designated to start on systemic corticosteroids by the respiratory medicine physician on duty. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either eosinophil-guided therapy or standard therapy with systemic corticosteroids. Both investigators and patients were aware of the group assignment. All patients received 80 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone on the first day. The eosinophil-guided group were from the second day given 37·5 mg of prednisolone oral tablet daily (for a maximum of up to 4 days) on days when their blood eosinophil count was at least 0·3 × 10 9 cells per L. On days when the eosinophil count was lower, prednisolone was not administered. If a patient was discharged during the treatment period, a treatment based on the last measured eosinophil count was prescribed for the remaining days within the 5-day period (last observation carried forward). The control group received 37·5 mg of prednisolone tablets daily from the second day for 4 days. The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment, assessed by intention to treat (ITT). Secondary outcomes included treatment failure at day 30 (ie, recurrence of acute exacerbation of COPD resulting in emergency room visits, admission to hospital, or need to intensify pharmacological treatment), number of deaths on day 30, and duration of treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The non-inferiority margin was 1·2 days (SD 3·8). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02857842, and was completed in January, 2019.

Findings

Between Aug 3, 2016, and Sept 30, 2018, 159 patients in the eosinophil-guided group and 159 patients in the control group were included in the ITT analyses. There was no between-group difference for days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment: mean 8·9 days (95% CI 8·3-9·6) in the eosinophil-guided group versus 9·3 days (8·7-9·9) in the control group (absolute difference -0·4, 95% CI -1·3 to 0·5; p=0·34). Treatment failure at 30 days occurred in 42 (26%) of 159 patients in the eosinophil-guided group and 41 (26%) of 159 in the control group (difference 0·6%, 95% CI -9·0 to 10·3; p=0·90). At 30 days nine patients (6%) of 159 in the eosinophil-guided group and six (4%) of 159 in the control group had died (difference 1·9%, 95% CI -2·8 to 6·5; p=0·43). Median duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy was lower in the eosinophil-guided group: 2 days (IQR 1·0 to 3·0) compared with 5 days (5·0 to 5·0) in the control group, p<0·0001.

Interpretation

Eosinophil-guided therapy was non-inferior compared with standard care for the number of days alive and out of hospital, and reduced the duration of systemic corticosteroid exposure, although we could not entirely exclude harm on some secondary outcome measures. Larger studies will help to determine the full safety profile of this strategy and its role in the management of COPD exacerbations.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^a40eb953]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in COPD—general considerations—indicate limited steroid responsiveness and uncertain long-term safety: “In vitro evidence suggests that COPD-associated inflammation has limited responsiveness to corticosteroids. Moreover, some drugs including beta2-agonists, theophylline or macrolides may partially facilitate corticosteroid sensitivity in COPD. The clinical relevance of this effect has not yet been fully established.” In vivo data “suggest that the dose-response relationships and long-term (> 3 years) safety of ICS in people with COPD are unclear and require further investigation.” Additionally, “both current and ex-smokers with COPD benefit from ICS use in terms of lung function and exacerbation rates, although the magnitude of the effect is lower in heavy or current smokers compared to light or ex-smokers.”

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^0f74e2e7]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This two-study meta-analysis showed that patients randomly allocated to the 2–5-day corticosteroid dose group had more days alive and out of hospital within 14 days after recruitment than those randomly allocated to the 14-day dose group. In addition, data recorded for the lengths of hospital stay and time to discharge favoured treatment with 2–5-day dose corticosteroids. Although there was no difference between the groups in the risks of ICU admission or death and new or aggravated hypertension, there was a trend towards poorer outcomes in the 14-day dose group. These observations are consistent with previous observational studies that have shown greater risks of infection and mortality when patients are treated with corticosteroids for 10 days rather than 5 days. As in this analysis, the REDUCE trial found that the median length of hospital stay in the 5-day group dose group was 1 day shorter than in the 14-day dose group. Other studies have reached similar conclusions regarding the duration of treatment. A recent meta-analysis compared short-term (≤ 7 days) with longer-term (> 7 days) systemic corticosteroid treatment of patients with exacerbation of severe or very severe COPD and found no differences in the likelihood of treatment failure, risk of relapse, change in lung function tests or adverse effects. Several studies suggest that an even shorter duration of systemic corticosteroid treatment (e.g. 3 days, 5 days or 7 days) may be as effective as longer courses in hospitalised patients with AECOPD. These results are similar to those of previous systematic reviews and support the use of shorter systemic corticosteroid treatment regimens.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to combination therapy, ATS 2020 guidelines recommend to consider stepping up to ICS/LABA/LAMA triple therapy in patients with COPD complaining of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite LABA/LAMA dual therapy and with a history of ≥ 1 exacerbation in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral corticosteroids or hospitalization.

### Dual combination therapy versus long-acting bronchodilators alone for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^355758c8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting bronchodilators such as long-acting β-agonist (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and LABA/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combinations have been used in people with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to control symptoms such as dyspnoea and cough, and prevent exacerbations. A number of LABA/LAMA combinations are now available for clinical use in COPD. However, it is not clear which group of above mentioned inhalers is most effective or if any specific formulation works better than the others within the same group or class.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of available formulations from four different groups of inhalers (i.e. LABA/LAMA combination, LABA/ICS combination, LAMA and LABA) in people with moderate to severe COPD. The review will update previous systematic reviews on dual combination inhalers and long-acting bronchodilators to answer the questions described above using the strength of a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Search Methods

We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register, which contains several databases. We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and manufacturers' websites. The most recent searches were conducted on 6 April 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people aged 35 years or older with a diagnosis of COPD and a baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of less than 80% of predicted. We included studies of at least 12 weeks' duration including at least two active comparators from one of the four inhaler groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

We conducted NMAs using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We considered a study as high risk if recruited participants had at least one COPD exacerbation within the 12 months before study entry and as low risk otherwise. Primary outcomes were COPD exacerbations (moderate to severe and severe), and secondary outcomes included symptom and quality-of-life scores, safety outcomes, and lung function. We collected data only for active comparators and did not consider placebo was not considered. We assumed a class/group effect when a fixed-class model fitted well. Otherwise we used a random-class model to assess intraclass/group differences. We supplemented the NMAs with pairwise meta-analyses.

Main Results

We included a total of 101,311 participants from 99 studies (26 studies with 32,265 participants in the high-risk population and 73 studies with 69,046 participants in the low-risk population) in our systematic review. The median duration of studies was 52 weeks in the high-risk population and 26 weeks in the low-risk population (range 12 to 156 for both populations). We considered the quality of included studies generally to be good.The NMAs suggested that the LABA/LAMA combination was the highest ranked treatment group to reduce COPD exacerbations followed by LAMA in the both populations.There is evidence that the LABA/LAMA combination decreases moderate to severe exacerbations compared to LABA/ICS combination, LAMA, and LABA in the high-risk population (network hazard ratios (HRs) 0.86 (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.76 to 0.99), 0.87 (95% CrI 0.78 to 0.99), and 0.70 (95% CrI 0.61 to 0.8) respectively), and that LAMA decreases moderate to severe exacerbations compared to LABA in the high- and low-risk populations (network HR 0.80 (95% CrI 0.71 to 0.88) and 0.87 (95% CrI 0.78 to 0.97), respectively). There is evidence that the LABA/LAMA combination reduces severe exacerbations compared to LABA/ICS combination and LABA in the high-risk population (network HR 0.78 (95% CrI 0.64 to 0.93) and 0.64 (95% CrI 0.51 to 0.81), respectively).There was a general trend towards a greater improvement in symptom and quality-of-life scores with the combination therapies compared to monotherapies, and the combination therapies were generally ranked higher than monotherapies.The LABA/ICS combination was the lowest ranked in pneumonia serious adverse events (SAEs) in both populations. There is evidence that the LABA/ICS combination increases the odds of pneumonia compared to LAMA/LABA combination, LAMA and LABA (network ORs: 1.69 (95% CrI 1.20 to 2.44), 1.78 (95% CrI 1.33 to 2.39), and 1.50 (95% CrI 1.17 to 1.92) in the high-risk population and network or pairwise OR: 2.33 (95% CI 1.03 to 5.26), 2.02 (95% CrI 1.16 to 3.72), and 1.93 (95% CrI 1.29 to 3.22) in the low-risk population respectively). There were significant overlaps in the rank statistics in the other safety outcomes including mortality, total, COPD, and cardiac SAEs, and dropouts due to adverse events.None of the differences in lung function met a minimal clinically important difference criterion except for LABA/LAMA combination versus LABA in the high-risk population (network mean difference 0.13 L (95% CrI 0.10 to 0.15). The results of pairwise meta-analyses generally agreed with those of the NMAs. There is no evidence to suggest intraclass/group differences except for lung function at 12 months in the high-risk population.

Authors' Conclusions

The LABA/LAMA combination was the highest ranked treatment group to reduce COPD exacerbations although there was some uncertainty in the results. LAMA containing inhalers may have an advantage over those without a LAMA for preventing COPD exacerbations based on the rank statistics. Combination therapies appear more effective than monotherapies for improving symptom and quality-of-life scores. ICS-containing inhalers are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia.Our most comprehensive review including intraclass/group comparisons, free combination therapies, 99 studies, and 20 outcomes for each high- and low-risk population summarises the current literature and could help with updating existing COPD guidelines.

### Oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a4290dfc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are widely used in the management of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, in combination with other treatments.

Objectives

To determine the effect of corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, on the outcome in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Strategy

An initial search was carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group COPD RCT register with additional studies sought in the bibliographies of randomised controlled trials and review articles. Authors of identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids, administered either parenterally or orally, with appropriate placebo. Other interventions were standardised e.g. bronchodilators, antibiotics. Clinical studies of acute asthma were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted by one of the reviewers and sent to authors for verification. All trials were combined using Review Manager (version 4.1) for analysis.

Main Results

We have identified 7 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were varied and few were common to all studies. The most commonly reported outcome, the FEV1 between 6 - 72 hours after treatment, showed a significant treatment benefit for corticosteroid over placebo treatment, weighted mean difference 120 ml 95% confidence intervals: 5, 190 ml. There were significantly fewer treatment failures in patients given corticosteroid treatment, but the number of studies reporting this outcome was smaller and there was significant heterogeneity between them. There was an increased likelihood of an adverse drug reaction with corticosteroid treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Treatment with oral or parenteral corticosteroids increases the rate of lung function improvement over the first 72 hours of an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but at a significantly increased risk of an adverse drug reaction. There is no evidence that this benefit is maintained after 72 hours, or that other outcomes are improved.

Studies of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) withdrawal in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

However, a meta-analysis of the WISP, COPE, and COSMIC trials indicated that ICS withdrawal was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of exacerbations. The definition of exacerbation differed between these early studies and the use of other medication was not reported. A more recent and robust meta-analysis concluded that ICS discontinuation did not significantly increased the overall rate of COPD exacerbations, although an increased risk of severe exacerbations was detected. The increased risk of all types of exacerbations following ICS withdrawal observed in early studies was most likely due to a lack of alternative COPD medications.

Evidence from more recent RCTs and real-life studies supports the hypothesis that the ICS therapy can be safely withdrawn in patients with stable COPD (Table 1). In the Withdrawal of Inhaled Steroids During Optimized Bronchodilator Management (WISDOM) trial, in which the safety of gradual ICS withdrawal in patients previously on ICS/LABA/LAMA triple therapy was evaluated, there was no significant difference in the risk of moderate or severe COPD exacerbation over 12 months after ICS withdrawal compared with ongoing triple therapy. Although a significantly greater decrease in FEV 1 was observed at 18 weeks after ICS withdrawal (mean difference 38 mL vs continued ICS; p < 0.001), this was less than half of what is considered as the minimum clinically important difference. A post hoc analysis of WISDOM showed that patients who stopped ICS experienced a similar disease course with regard to lung function to those who continued ICS therapy. Although deterioration of lung function was observed after ICS withdrawal, these changes were small, not progressive and not predictive of clinically important changes over the duration of study follow-up.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and FEVdecline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review [^7d170662]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease characterized by the chronic obstruction of airflow in the airways and lungs. Evidence based clinical NICE guidelines recommend the use of inhaled bronchodilators such as long-acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists (LABA) or long-acting muscarinic-receptor antagonists (LAMA) for COPD maintenance therapy. Currently, the addition of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is reserved for those who remain breathless or exacerbate despite taking short-acting bronchodilators (SABA) following NICE guidelines. GOLD guidelines suggest initial treatment of ICS should be reserved for patients in GOLD group D alongside LABA if blood eosinophil levels are greater than 300cells/μl. In addition, combination ICS (ICS/LABA) should be considered in patients who exacerbate if blood eosinophil levels are greater than 300 or 100 if they experience at least 2 moderate exacerbations or a hospitalization from AECOPD or remain breathless. However, the use of ICS for the treatment of COPD has been debated.

FEV 1 is a common measure used to assess lung function and multiple studies show FEV 1 declines at a faster rate in smokers compared to non-smokers. Randomised control trials (RCTs) have found that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce the rate of FEV 1 decline in people with COPD. However, the rate of FEV 1 decline is heterogeneous and can vary depending on factors such as smoking status, exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), and season. Most RCTs compare COPD patients on a specific ICS to those on a placebo, have specific inclusion and exclusion criteria and commonly exclude participants based on age, comorbidities and severity of disease. In addition, most studies have short follow-up periods of less than 1 year. Therefore, most RCTs are not easily generalisable to the wider COPD population over the longer term.

### Optimizing bronchodilation in the prevention of COPD exacerbations [^11f4aeb1]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The natural trajectory of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is punctuated by exacerbations, defined as an acute worsening of symptoms that results in additional therapy. In many cases, exacerbations are triggered by respiratory tract infections (predominantly viral, but also bacterial) and environmental factors such as air pollution, yet in approximately one third of cases, the cause remains unknown.

COPD exacerbations have a marked negative effect on both the patient and underlying disease processes, and can result in hospitalization and readmission, an increased risk of death and a significant reduction in health status. Exacerbations are also associated with long-term decline in lung function and a high socioeconomic cost. Thus, optimizing the prevention and management of COPD exacerbations is an important clinical issue.

A key step towards meeting this goal is to identify patients at greatest risk of exacerbation. The ‘frequent exacerbator’ phenotype (≥2 exacerbations/year) describes patients who are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, in contrast to infrequent exacerbators. The exacerbator phenotype, which remains relatively stable over time, has a complex pathophysiology and is prevalent across all disease severities, but is more common in patients with worse lung function.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) provides treatment recommendations for patients who are at high risk of exacerbation: a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/LAMA combination are recommended as primary choice treatment for these patients. Although the GOLD strategy document was developed with an international audience in mind, some countries and regions (e.g. Spain, UK, South America, and Canada) follow guidance outlined in their own recommendations as well.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended for patients at high risk of exacerbation with concomitant asthma, or who experience further exacerbations following initial bronchodilator treatment. However, there is widespread evidence of inappropriate use of ICS in patients at low risk of exacerbation. Considering the known risks associated with long-term ICS use, only patients carefully considered as suitable candidates should receive treatment with the appropriate ICS and associated dose, such that treatment benefit will outweigh any potential risk.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^293afcfd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Standard pharmacological therapies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—Lung function is improved and the frequency of acute COPD exacerbations is reduced by long-acting β-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), combined LABA/ICS, and long-acting antimuscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), and health-related quality of life is also improved by ICS, LABAs, LABA/ICS, and LAMAs. The rate of decline of lung function might be reduced by inhaled medications based on subgroup analyses, with one analysis suggesting that LABAs alone, ICS alone, and LABA/ICS may reduce the rate of decline but that the effect was modest, as the reduced rate of decline of lung function achieved with inhaled medications was only about half that achieved with smoking cessation and sustained abstinence; another analysis suggested that LAMAs may reduce the rate of decline among patients with moderate COPD (i.e., GOLD stage 2), even though the randomized trial found no such effect among the entire population. Some treatments were found to prevent exacerbations preferentially in patients with a history of chronic bronchitis and a history of exacerbations, and patients with a history of two or more exacerbations during the previous year responded better to preventative therapy in some studies. As an as-needed inhaled short-acting β-agonist is generally the first medication initiated, often with a standing dose of an inhaled long-acting bronchodilator, the optimal long-acting bronchodilator regimen is unknown. In a systematic review of seven randomized trials directly comparing a LAMA (tiotropium) with LABAs, meta-analyses found that the LAMA had a greater effect on reducing COPD exacerbations, exacerbation-related hospitalizations, and adverse effects, with no differences in mortality, all-cause hospitalizations, symptoms, or lung function, although the meta-analyses were limited by heterogeneity suggesting potential influences of the specific LABA, population studied, or genetic predisposition.

### COPD exacerbations: the impact of long versus short courses of oral corticosteroids on mortality and pneumonia: nationwide data on 67 000 patients with COPD followed for 12 months [^f5aa9415]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality.Patients with COPD are also at greater risk of developing pneumonia, mainly due to the impairment of lung defence mechanisms and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).In addition, patients hospitalised for COPD and pneumonia exhibit substantially higher rates of intensive care admission, mortality and longer length of hospital stay compared with persons without COPD.

Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendation for treatment duration of systemic corticosteroids (oral corticosteroids, OCS) for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) has changed over the last decades, ranging from treatment durations of 10–14 days,7–10 daysand is currently 5–7 days. The last reduction was based on a robust randomised controlled trial.

OCS are recommended to patients with COPD during acute exacerbations, and most COPD exacerbations can safely be managed in the outpatient setting.OCS have been found to shorten the length of hospital stays, improve lung function, and reduce the risk of early relapse and treatment failure in patients with non-pneumonia exacerbation. No effect has been observed regarding longer-term lung function, length of stay at intensive care unit and 30-day mortality.Most clinical trials investigating OCS for exacerbations were performed on patients who require hospitalisation, and only a few have described the effect of OCS in the outpatient setting.

OCS use is associated with a number of adverse effects including hyperglycaemia, ﬂuid retention, weight gain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, adrenal suppression, deep vein thrombosis, osteoporosis and increased fracture risk.Even short courses of OCS (median days=6) have been associated with adverse effects, and they increase with increased number of OCS courses.In addition, OCS have been shown to cause severe infections due to their immunosuppressive activity, which impairs phagocyte function and suppresses cell-mediated immunity.This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of 71 pooled controlled trials that showed a relative risk of 1.6 for infectious events in the prednisolone group (n=2111) compared with the controls (n=2087).However, the risk of severe infections and death following the use of OCS is in general unknown and mainly short-term follow-up endpoints have been reported in patients with COPD. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide, observational cohort study to determine the association between duration of OCS treatment in outpatients with AECOPD and the risk of pneumonia hospitalisation and all-cause mortality during a 1-year study period and to explore how the timing of the exposure affects the risk estimates.

### Effect of different corticosteroid regimes for hospitalised patients with exacerbated COPD: pooled analysis of individual participant data from the REDUCE and CORTICO-COP trials [^dbf7dcdd]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid administration for severe acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) reduces the duration of hospital stays. Corticosteroid-sparing regimens have showed non-inferiority to higher accumulated dose regimens regarding re-exacerbation risk in patients with AECOPD. However, it remains unclear whether 14-day or 2–5-day regimens would result in shorter admission durations and changes in mortality risk. We explored this by analysing the number of days alive and out of hospital based on two randomised controlled trials with different corticosteroid regimens.

Methods

We pooled individual patient data from the two available multicentre randomised trials on corticosteroid-sparing regimens for AECOPD: the REDUCE (n = 314) and CORTICO-COP (n = 318) trials. In the 14-day regimen group, patients were older, fewer patients received pre-treatment with antibiotics and more patients received pre-treatment with systemic corticosteroids. Patients randomly allocated to the 14-day and 2–5-day regimens were compared, with adjustment for baseline differences.

Results

The number of days alive and out of hospital within 14 days from recruitment was higher for the 2–5 day regimen group (mean 8.4 days; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.0–8.8) than the 14-day regimen patient group (4.2 days; 95% CI3.4–4.9; p < 0.001). The 14-day AECOPD group had longer hospital stays (mean difference, 5.4 days [standard error ± 0.6]; p < 0.0001) and decreased likelihood of discharge within 30 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5; 95% CI 0.4–0.6; p < 0.0001). Comparing the 14-day regimen and the 2–5 day regimen group showed no differences in the composite endpoint ‘death or ICU admission’ (odds ratio [OR] 1.4; 95% CI 0.8–2.3; p = 0.15), new or aggravated hypertension (OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.9–2.7; p = 0.15), or mortality risk (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.4–1.5; p = 0.45) during the 6-month follow-up period.

Conclusion

14-day corticosteroid regimens were associated with longer hospital stays and fewer days alive and out of hospital within 14 days, with no apparent 6-month benefit regarding death or admission to ICU in COPD patients. Our results favour 2–5 day regimens for treating COPD exacerbations. However, prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^419b1319]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance, we recommend long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy over LABA or LAMA monotherapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

In patients with COPD who complain of dyspnea or exercise intolerance despite dual therapy with LABA/LAMA, we suggest the use of triple therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/LABA/LAMA over dual therapy with LABA/LAMA in those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

In patients with COPD who are receiving triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA), we suggest that the ICS can be withdrawn if the patient has had no exacerbations in the past year (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

We do not make a recommendation for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom we suggest ICS as an additive therapy (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

In patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, we advise against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

In individuals with COPD who experience advanced refractory dyspnea despite otherwise optimal therapy, we suggest that opioid-based therapy be considered for dyspnea management, within a personalized shared decision-making approach (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence).

Treatment-emergent adverse events

Two studies (n = 247) assessed the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events. The list of adverse events included (but was not limited to) hyperglycemia, hypertension, secondary infection, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute psychiatric illness requiring a consultation, an invasive procedure, or initiation of a specific therapy. The studies revealed a statistically significant increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use versus no oral steroid (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16–2.34; P = 0.006). There was low certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 174 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 43 more to 359 more).

Summary

Based on the five critical outcomes using RCT evidence and completion of the GRADE evidence table, the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be “low” and this certainty was assigned to the final recommendation as per GRADE guidance.

Committee discussion

The panel believed that maintenance oral steroid therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to improve clinical outcomes, and the available evidence suggests that chronic oral steroid therapy has a potential for harm. Two RCTs revealed an increased risk of adverse events with oral steroid use, suggesting excess adverse events (harms) in patients who are prescribed daily oral steroids. However, this recommendation was based on RCTs that had small sample sizes, a small number of events, short durations, and broad CIs around the point estimates. In addition, these studies occurred when there was a paucity of medications available for maintenance therapy. The quality of the underlying evidence was poor, and therefore the panel believed that a recommendation in favor of maintenance oral steroid use would be problematic given the concerns surrounding patient safety. The panel also believed that well-informed patients would place a greater value on avoiding the potential harms of adverse events and less value on the uncertain benefits of decreased dyspnea and hospital admissions.

After considering these issues and the low certainty of the evidence, the panel concluded that in patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations, the balance of benefits of maintenance oral steroid therapy did not outweigh the risks when compared with no steroid use. Given that the panel recommended against the intervention, issues related to feasibility, acceptability, and health equity were not discussed.

Research needs

Well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes should be conducted in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia. These studies should stratify patients by eosinophil levels and exacerbation risk. It is unclear whether different threshold values for blood eosinophilia would affect outcomes, and we recommend further research to define the most predictive threshold values. Finally, research is needed to determine the relevance of measuring changes in blood eosinophil counts as a dynamic parameter, and whether this may correlate with treatment response.

Question 5: In Patients with COPD Who Have a History of Severe and Frequent Exacerbations despite Otherwise Optimal Therapy, Is Maintenance Oral Steroid Therapy More Effective than and as Safe as No Maintenance Oral Steroid Therapy?

Recommendation

In patients with COPD and a history of severe and frequent exacerbations despite otherwise optimal therapy, we advise against the use of maintenance oral corticosteroid therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking mortality, exacerbations, dyspnea, hospital admissions, bone fractures, QOL, and treatment-emergent adverse events as critical outcomes.

Summary of the evidence

The expert medical librarian initially identified 1,500 citations in MEDLINE (n = 777), Embase (n = 664), and the Cochrane Library (n = 59), with deduplication resulting in n = 932 warranting abstract screening. The majority (98.8%) were ineligible either because of a nonrigorous study methodology or lack of relevance to the PICO question, resulting in the screeners identifying 11 studies for final review inclusion. Four of the 11 studies were RCTs (–). The total sample size for the four RCTs was 477 patients; 290 (60.8%) of these patients were in the treatment/intervention arms and 187 (39.2%) were in the control (comparator) arms. The four studies were a combination of single- and multicenter designs.

We initially analyzed both RCT and observational (nonrandomized) evidence for this question given the available evidence, while recognizing that nonrandomized evidence can be affected by selection bias and residual confounding (e.g. confounding by indication). After the analysis, we judged the RCT evidence to be the optimal evidence on which to base this recommendation. As such, for the application of GRADE methods, we used the RCT evidence in determining the certainty of evidence, and we present the RCT evidence for the respective patient-important outcomes.

### Withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in people with COPD in primary care: a randomised controlled trial [^b97563fe]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Most COPD patients are managed in primary care and receive ICS long-term and irrespective of severity. The effect of withdrawing ICS from COPD patients in primary care is unknown.

Methods

In a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 31 practices, 260 COPD patients stopped their usual ICS (median duration of use 8 years) and were allocated to 500 mcg fluticasone propionate twice daily (n = 128), or placebo (n = 132). Follow-up assessments took place at three monthly intervals for a year at the patients' practice. Our primary outcome was COPD exacerbation frequency. Secondary outcomes were time to first COPD exacerbation, reported symptoms, peak expiratory flow rate and reliever inhaler use, and lung function and health related quality of life.

Results

In patients randomised to placebo, COPD exacerbation risk over one year was RR: 1.11 (CI: 0.91–1.36). Patients taking placebo were more likely to return to their usual ICS following exacerbation, placebo: 61/128 (48%); fluticasone: 34/132 (26%), OR: 2.35 (CI: 1.38–4.05). Exacerbation risk whilst taking randomised treatment was significantly raised in the placebo group 1.48 (CI: 1.17–1.86). Patients taking placebo exacerbated earlier (median time to first exacerbation: placebo (days): 44 (CI: 29–59); fluticasone: 63 (CI: 53–74), log rank 3.81, P = 0.05) and reported increased wheeze. In a post-hoc analysis, patients with mild COPD taking placebo had increased exacerbation risk RR: 1.94 (CI: 1.20–3.14).

Conclusion

Withdrawal of long-term ICS in COPD patients in primary care increases risk of exacerbation shortens time to exacerbation and causes symptom deterioration. Patients with mild COPD may be at increased risk of exacerbation after withdrawal.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^327d42ee]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids—acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and readmissions: “Systemic oral corticosteroids for the long-term treatment of COPD are not recommended (GOLD guidelines), but their use is recommended for treating acute exacerbations of COPD (GOLD guidelines).” They “have been shown to improve symptoms and lung function, reduce treatment failure, and shorten length of hospital stay.” Across trials, pooled data indicate systemic corticosteroids used to treat an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) “can reduce 30-day readmission rates due to recurrent AECOPD (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.91).” Examples include Aggarwal et al using 2 weeks of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone with “no difference … (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.01-3.85)”; Niewoehner et al randomized to 8 weeks vs 2 weeks plus 6 weeks placebo vs 8 weeks placebo with 30-day readmissions “(4% vs 5%), leading to a nonsignificant OR of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.10-2.88)”; Ställberg et al gave “30 mg prednisone daily … for 2 weeks,” with hospitalizations “5.6%” vs “1.8%” and OR “1.02 (95% CI, 0.06-16.71)”; and Aaron et al used “prednisone 40 mg daily … for 10 days,” reducing a combined end point “27% vs 43%, P = .05,” with hospitalization odds “0.40; 95% CI, 0.16-0.99.”

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^ba53484b]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations—definition is symptom- and treatment-based: increased dyspnea above day-to-day variability with or without change in sputum amount or color; moderate to severe exacerbations are those that require antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids; patients with exacerbation within the past six months would be considered to have “severe COPD.”

### Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) plus long-acting β-agonist (LABA) versus LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^46e20b22]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Three classes of inhaler medications are used to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). When two classes of medications are required, LAMA plus LABA (LAMA+LABA) and LABA plus ICS (LABA+ICS) are often selected because these combinations can be administered via a single medication device. The previous Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidance recommended LABA+ICS as the first-line treatment for managing stable COPD in high-risk people of categories C and D. However, the updated GOLD 2017 guidance recommends LAMA+LABA over LABA+ICS.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of LAMA+LABA versus LABA+ICS for treatment of people with stable COPD.

Search Methods

We performed an electronic search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (2 February 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (4 June 2016), and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal (4 June 2016), followed by a handsearch (5 June 2016). Two review authors screened and scrutinised the selected articles.

Selection Criteria

We included individual randomised controlled trials, parallel-group trials, and cross-over trials comparing LAMA+LABA and LABA+ICS for stable COPD. The minimum accepted trial duration was one month and trials should have been conducted in an outpatient setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR), and continuous data as mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence interval (CI) using Review Manager 5. Exacerbations were measured by counting the number of people experiencing one or more exacerbation.

Main Results

We included 11 studies comprising 9839 participants in our quantitative analysis. Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD, without recent exacerbations. One pharmaceutical sponsored trial that included only people with recent exacerbations was the largest study and accounted for 37% of participants. All but one study were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, thus we rated them as having a high risk of 'other bias'. The unsponsored study was at high risk of performance and detection bias, and possible selective reporting.Five studies recruited GOLD Category B participants, one study recruited Category D participants, two studies recruited Category A/B participants, and three studies recruited participants regardless of category. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 52 weeks.Compared to the LABA+ICS arm, the results for the pooled primary outcomes for the LAMA+LABA arm were as follows: exacerbations, OR 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.96, P = 0.01, I 2 = 17%, low quality evidence); serious adverse events (SAE), OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.05, P = 0.18, I 2 = 0, moderate quality evidence); St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score change from the baseline, MD -1.22 (95% CI -2.52 to 0.07, P = 0.06, I 2 = 71%, low quality evidence); and trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) change from the baseline, MD 0.08 L (95% CI 0.06 to 0.09, P < 0.0001, I 2 = 50%, moderate quality evidence). Compared to the LABA+ICS arm, the results for the pooled secondary outcomes for the LAMA+LABA arm were as follows: pneumonia, OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79, P = 0.0006, I 2 = 0%, low quality evidence); all-cause death, OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.67, P = 0.88, I 2 = 0%, low quality evidence); and SGRQ total score change from the baseline of 4 points or greater (the minimal clinically important difference for the SGRQ is 4 points), OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.44, P = 0.002, I 2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

For the treatment of COPD, LAMA+LABA has fewer exacerbations, a larger improvement of FEV 1 , a lower risk of pneumonia, and more frequent improvement in quality of life as measured by an increase over 4 units or more of the SGRQ. These data were supported by low or moderate quality evidence generated from mainly participants with moderate to severe COPD in heterogeneous trials with an observation period of less than one year. Our findings support the recently updated GOLD guidance.

### Systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic use in hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [^614550db]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective inpatient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management is critical to appropriately manage health care resources. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines provide recommendations on appropriate systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic use, in select patients, for COPD exacerbation.

Objective

To determine the impact of GOLD guideline-recommended systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy in the hospital setting on clinical outcomes in patients with COPD exacerbation.

Methods

This was a noninterventional, retrospective, single-center study. Adults admitted to a non-intensive care unit internal medicine service with documented COPD exacerbation were included. Two analyses were conducted evaluating systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy.

Results

A total of 220 patients were included in the systemic corticosteroid cohort. No difference in 30-day readmission rates was demonstrated for the standard (⩽200 mg prednisone equivalents [PEs] for exacerbation course) and high-dose groups (>200 mg PEs; 20.5% vs 13.1%, respectively; P = 0.15). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was significantly shorter for patients prescribed standard-dose therapy (3 days [2-4.5] vs 4 days [2-6]; P < 0.001). A total of 174 patients were included in the antibiotic cohort. For the appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic use groups, no significant differences were observed between 30-day readmission rates (15% vs 18.4%, respectively; P = 0.57) and hospital LOS (4 days [2-5] in both groups; P = 0.97). Conclusion and Relevance: Hospital LOS was shorter for patients prescribed standard-dose systemic corticosteroids; however, no differences in other clinical outcomes were found in either cohort. Use of guideline-recommended systemic corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy is recommended for hospitalized patients with COPD exacerbation.
