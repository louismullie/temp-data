## Question

Management for acute upper respiratory infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of acute upper respiratory infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and its usual course. Then, I should verify the core principle of antibiotic stewardship and when antibiotics are actually indicated. Next, I will examine symptomatic therapies with the best evidence, including saline nasal irrigation and analgesics. After that, I need to check the role of NSAIDs and other adjuncts, and clarify what to avoid. Finally, I will consider special populations, red flags, and a practical algorithm, while continuously checking the strength and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and natural history. Acute upper respiratory infection, also called the common cold or acute rhinopharyngitis, is typically a viral, self-limited illness characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and malaise, with symptoms peaking around days 3–6 and resolving within about 7–10 days, though cough can persist longer, especially in children [^bf3247ca] [^9247cf2d]. Hold on, I should verify the etiologic mix: most cases are viral, with picornaviruses such as rhinovirus predominating during peak seasons, reinforcing that antibiotics are usually not helpful [^7ead12b7].

> Next, I should review the core principle of antibiotic stewardship. For nonspecific URIs, antibiotics do not improve illness resolution and are not recommended; they increase adverse effects without benefit, so I need to ensure I do not overcall bacterial disease in uncomplicated cases [^efe8f51f] [^4d67ecec]. Wait, let me verify real-world practice patterns: antibiotics are still overprescribed for viral URIs, with studies showing substantial inappropriate use, which underscores the need to adhere to guidelines and communicate clearly with patients [^6ca9c7b5] [^708a17f0].

> I will now examine when antibiotics are actually indicated, and I need to be precise. Antibiotics are reserved for documented bacterial pharyngitis (e.g., streptococcal), acute bacterial rhinosinusitis with persistent symptoms beyond 10 days without improvement, severe onset with high fever and purulent discharge for at least 3 days, or worsening after initial improvement ("double sickening"), and selected otitis media scenarios; they are not indicated for the common cold or laryngitis [^3b365ed9] [^5600ca63] [^531f14e3]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric specifics: the AAP defines pediatric acute bacterial sinusitis using the same persistent, worsening, or severe-onset criteria, and advises against imaging to distinguish from viral URI in uncomplicated cases, which helps avoid overtreatment [^bf3247ca] [^65977d58].

> Let me consider symptomatic therapies with the best available evidence. Saline nasal irrigation shows modest benefit for rhinologic symptoms in children and may reduce use of other medications; it appears safe, though tolerance can vary in infants, so I should tailor technique and expectations [^88fb7d95] [^cfa7155d]. I should double-check adult data: the Cochrane review found limited evidence of benefit in adults, including a small reduction in time off work, but heterogeneity and risk of bias limit confidence, so I will present it as optional with low-certainty benefit [^cfa7155d].

> Next, I should review analgesics and antipyretics. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen are appropriate for fever, headache, and myalgia; I need to ensure dosing is correct and counsel on safety, especially in those with hepatic or renal disease or GI risk, but these are standard, evidence-concordant recommendations for symptomatic relief [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify whether NSAIDs are broadly contraindicated in viral URIs; current reviews suggest NSAIDs can be used judiciously for symptom control, though some expert narratives propose early NSAIDs to blunt inflammation, which remains investigational and should not override individualized risk assessment and guideline-based care [^c9e7ff86].

> I need to check the role of over-the-counter cough medications. Evidence for antitussives, expectorants, and antihistamine-decongestant combinations is mixed and often of low quality; small studies show occasional signals, but overall there is no consistent benefit, so I should avoid routine use and prioritize hydration, honey for children older than 1 year, and nonpharmacologic measures [^98393ab6]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric guidance: many pediatric societies discourage routine OTC cough-cold meds due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects, reinforcing a conservative approach [^notfound].

> Let me think about what to avoid. Antibiotics should not be prescribed for uncomplicated viral URI, and I should explicitly address patient expectations to reduce demand-driven prescribing, which has been shown to influence inappropriate use without improving satisfaction when education is prioritized [^9551c87b]. I should also avoid routine imaging, labs, or specialty referrals for straightforward URIs, reserving diagnostics for atypical or severe presentations or suspected complications [^notfound].

> Now, I should review special populations and contexts. In children, saline nasal irrigation is reasonable, and I must distinguish viral URI from acute bacterial sinusitis using persistent, worsening, or severe-onset criteria before antibiotics; watchful waiting is appropriate in many cases, and I should avoid unnecessary imaging [^bf3247ca] [^65977d58]. In older adults, I need to be cautious: a large cohort suggests antibiotic prescription for URI is associated with higher odds of subsequent pneumonia, likely reflecting confounding by comorbidity and frailty, so I should individualize decisions and avoid reflex antibiotics [^3d0cbedf]. In patients with asthma, URIs commonly trigger exacerbations; activating a yellow-zone plan early, including increased controller therapy and short-acting bronchodilators, is recommended, but routine antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of bacterial infection [^b5b1b96b] [^686e8cab].

> But wait, what if the presentation is not a simple URI. I should screen for red flags that warrant escalation: severe dyspnea, chest pain, focal lung findings, altered mental status, immunocompromise, or systemic instability suggest lower tract disease or complications and merit chest radiography and broader evaluation; likewise, persistent focal sinus symptoms beyond 10 days or severe facial pain raise concern for bacterial rhinosinusitis and may justify antibiotics per criteria [^8587317e] [^3b365ed9]. I should confirm that imaging is not recommended for uncomplicated URI or early sinusitis, reserving CT for suspected complications or refractory cases after maximal therapy [^65977d58] [^9ff8dfe9].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm. For a typical viral URI, provide reassurance, advise rest and hydration, and offer acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain; consider saline nasal irrigation for comfort, and avoid antibiotics. If symptoms persist beyond 10 days, worsen after initial improvement, or are severe at onset with high fever and purulent discharge, reassess for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and treat with narrow-spectrum antibiotics if criteria are met. If cough persists beyond 3 weeks, evaluate for postinfectious cough or alternative diagnoses rather than repeating antibiotics [^3b365ed9] [^9247cf2d]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with high-quality guidance: yes, ACP/CDC and AAO-HNS endorse watchful waiting and strict criteria for antibiotics in acute rhinosinusitis, which fits this approach [^3b365ed9] [^5600ca63].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient education and shared decision-making are embedded. I should explain the viral nature of URIs, the lack of benefit from antibiotics in uncomplicated cases, the potential harms of antibiotics, and the expected course of illness, while offering a safety-net plan if symptoms evolve. This strategy reduces inappropriate prescribing and maintains satisfaction when paired with clear return precautions [^9551c87b] [^708a17f0]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that providing a delayed prescription is always beneficial; I should correct that: delayed prescribing can reduce use but must be framed carefully to avoid reinforcing antibiotic expectations, and it is best reserved for selected scenarios where bacterial disease remains possible but not certain [^b1cfe7fa].

Acute upper respiratory infections (URIs) are predominantly viral and self-limited, so **management is supportive** [^efe8f51f] with analgesics, antipyretics, and hydration; **antibiotics are not indicated** unless bacterial infection is confirmed or strongly suspected [^531f14e3] [^4d67ecec]. Saline nasal irrigation can relieve nasal symptoms [^88fb7d95], and **over-the-counter cough remedies may help adults** but are not recommended for children under 6 years [^98393ab6]. Educate patients on the typical 7–10 day course, red flags, and when to seek care; avoid unnecessary antibiotics to reduce adverse effects and resistance [^bf3247ca] [^6ca9c7b5].

---

## Symptomatic management

### Analgesics and antipyretics

Use **acetaminophen or ibuprofen** for fever, headache, and body aches; ibuprofen is preferred for inflammation, but avoid in patients with GI ulcers, renal disease, or bleeding disorders.

---

### Nasal congestion and rhinorrhea

- **Saline nasal irrigation**: Reduces nasal symptoms and may shorten illness; safe for adults and children [^88fb7d95] [^cfa7155d].
- **Topical decongestants**: Short-term use (≤ 3 days) of oxymetazoline or phenylephrine can relieve congestion; avoid in children under 6 years.
- **Antihistamines**: Limited benefit for colds; may help if allergic symptoms are present.

---

### Cough management

Adults may use **dextromethorphan or guaifenesin** for short-term relief; evidence is mixed, so use cautiously [^98393ab6]. Avoid **cough medications in children under 6 years** due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects.

---

### Hydration and rest

Encourage **adequate fluid intake** and rest; evidence for forced fluids is limited, but hydration supports comfort and recovery [^78deb6c5].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Antibiotics

Routine **antibiotics are not indicated** for uncomplicated viral URIs because they do not improve outcomes and increase adverse effects [^4d67ecec] [^efe8f51f]. Reserve antibiotics for confirmed bacterial infections (e.g. streptococcal pharyngitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, otitis media) [^531f14e3] [^3b365ed9].

---

### Antiviral medications

Antivirals are **not indicated** for uncomplicated viral URIs; consider only for influenza or other specific viral indications.

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

- **Patient education**: Explain the viral nature, expected course (7–10 days), and red flags (dyspnea, chest pain, high fever, confusion) [^bf3247ca].
- **Infection control**: Hand hygiene, masking, and social distancing reduce transmission [^2577b6a2].
- **Environmental modifications**: Humidified air may ease nasal congestion and cough.

---

## Special populations

| **Population** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|
| Children | - Avoid cough/cold meds under 6 years <br/> - Use saline irrigation and acetaminophen/ibuprofen <br/> - Monitor for otitis media or pneumonia [^98393ab6] [^88fb7d95] |
| Elderly | - Higher risk of complications <br/> - Lower threshold for evaluation <br/> - Use caution with NSAIDs [^3d0cbedf] |
| Immunocompromised | - Lower threshold for antibiotics and specialist input <br/> - Monitor closely for complications |

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **hand hygiene**, **respiratory etiquette**, and **vaccination** (influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcus) [^2577b6a2] [^87140e61]. Vitamin D may reduce URI incidence in deficient patients, but routine supplementation is not universally recommended [^c1bf0216].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Emphasize the **self-limited nature** of URIs, the lack of benefit from antibiotics, and warning signs that require reassessment. Arrange follow-up if symptoms persist beyond 10 days, worsen, or new red flags appear [^bf3247ca].

---

Acute URIs are managed with **supportive care**, with antibiotics reserved for confirmed bacterial disease. Saline irrigation, analgesics, and selective OTC cough remedies can relieve symptoms, while education and infection control are essential to optimize outcomes and limit unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Advising patients to increase fluid intake for treating acute respiratory infections [^78deb6c5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory infection is a common reason for people to present for medical care. Advice to increase fluid intake is a frequent treatment recommendation. Attributed benefits of fluids include replacing increased insensible fluid losses, correcting dehydration from reduced intake and reducing the viscosity of mucus. However, there are theoretical reasons for increased fluid intake to cause harm. Anti-diuretic hormone secretion is increased in lower respiratory tract infections of various aetiologies. This systematic examination of the evidence sought to determine the benefit versus harm from increasing fluid intake.

Objectives

To answer the following questions. (1) Does recommending increased fluid intake as a treatment for acute respiratory infections improve duration and severity of symptoms? (2) Are there adverse effects from recommending increased fluids in people with acute respiratory infections? (3) Are any benefits or harms related to site of infection (upper or lower respiratory tract) or a different severity of illness?

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to July Week 1, 2005), EMBASE (1974 to Week 29, 2005), Current Contents (current 5 years) and CINAHL (1982 to July week 3 2005). Reference lists of articles identified were searched, and experts in the relevant disciplines were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effect of increasing fluid intake in people with acute respiratory infections.

Data Collection and Analysis

Each author assessed the identified studies to determine eligibility for inclusion.

Main Results

No RCTs assessing the effect of increasing fluid intake in acute respiratory infections were found.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence for or against the recommendation to increase fluids in acute respiratory infections. The implications for fluid management in acute respiratory infections have not been studied in any RCTs to date. Some non-experimental (observational) studies report that increasing fluid intake in acute respiratory infections may cause harm. RCTs need to be done to determine the true effect of this very common medical advice.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^c0511b27]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are among the most common diseases encountered in primary medical care. Recurrent URTIs (RURTIs) considerably affect patient health and quality of life. Recent evidence indicates that increased attention is being paid to symptom improvement in clinical practice. However, the therapeutic opportunities associated with using a vector for improving the immune status of patients remain underestimated. As the most common sources of URTI are viral infections, antiviral agents with the potential to enhance host immune responses can be considered auxiliary, effective, and safe for children and adults with URTIs and RURTIs. This review reports the current evidence and expert opinions on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral URTIs. Undelayed diagnosis and initiating treatment in the early stages of URTIs are crucial elements that can significantly improve disease evolution and the overall health of patients of any age group. An immunomodulatory remedy would be optimal for facilitating the healing of acute infections, reducing recurrence and complications, antibiotic consumption, and the consequences of antibiotic overuse. Maintaining and protecting the intestinal microbiota is also an important step toward effective URTI treatment. The findings of this review provide valuable insights into the effective management of URTIs and RURTIs based on the latest clinical evidence.

Managing recurrence and complications in URTIs

Current strategies for the management of acute URTI aim to alleviate symptoms and prevent the transmission of URTI viruses. Early intervention, administered before the peak of viral shedding, can drastically increase the effectiveness of these strategies. This decreases the likelihood of a full-blown acute URTI developing, reduces the severity of symptoms and viral transmission.

Recurrent respiratory infections constitute a significant challenge from both therapeutic and preventive perspectives because of their effect on quality of life and medical and social expenditures. Firstly, it is crucial to determine whether RRTIs are caused by host-derived or environmental factors. Recently, as antibiotic resistance has increased, interest in treatments with preventive approaches has also increased. These treatments should be capable of preventing RRTIs, thereby reducing the use and unreasonable consumption of antibiotics.

Although antimicrobials play a major role in medicine, their use is becoming increasingly common, especially when administered as a preventive measure. The efficacy of antibiotics is reduced by the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria. Therefore, reducing the use of antibiotics is a top priority among healthcare authorities worldwide to avoid the subsequent effects of overuse, such as increased antibiotic resistance and impairment of the mucosal microbiome. Several alternative treatment options to antibiotics use will now be reviewed.

Microbiota

Microbiota play a key role in the introduction, training, and functioning of the host immune system. In response, the immune system has evolved to maintain a symbiotic relationship between the host and the highly diverse and evolving microbes.

At optimal operation, this alliance of the immune system and microbiota induces pathogen-protective responses and the upkeep of regulatory pathways associated with maintaining and tolerating innocuous antigens.

If the gut microbiota is modified by an increase in the use of antibiotics, the severity of viral respiratory infections such as influenza increases. In contrast, the opposite effect is expected when the microbiome is stimulated by a diet high in fiber.

Clinical Question

Is the use of procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic decisions in patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with usual care?

Bottom Line

Among patients with varying types and severity of acute respiratory infection, using procalcitonin to guide decisions about antibiotics is associated with lower rates of antibiotic exposure, antibiotic-related adverse effects, and mortality.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^f753ae8f]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunomodulation needs to be discussed as it holds the potential of preventing the development of severe viral infections alongside their complications, primarily relating to microbial infections, as demonstrated in randomized clinical trials evaluating its preventive efficacy in populations with recurrent respiratory infections. This consensus paper has its strengths and limitations. The main strength of the present paper is that a board of international experts reviewed existing clinical literature and formulated a list of consensus statements that are scientifically and clinically relevant and valid. Additionally, the diverse clinical backgrounds of the expert group was another strength of this review, as the clinicians' expertise provides reliability to the consensus provided. The recommendations by this review are valuable as they have the potential to guide clinicians in their daily clinical practice to optimize treatment and thereby likely improve outcomes. The limitations of this review are that we reviewed and summarized a specific number of studies, no complete Cochrane-type literature search or AI analysis was performed. Furthermore, no animal experiments or in vitro studies were reviewed.

### Characterizing acute respiratory infections in primary care for better management of viral infections [^60118515]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are the most frequent community acquired infections with 0 to 6 episodes per person per year. The prevalence in the whole population remained unspecified although frequent and costly. It has been estimated that there are about 25 million cases of rhinopharyngitis and 10 million cases of bronchitis per year in France and have caused from 20% to 40% of hospitalisations in the young population. In the US, the cost of common cold and influenza has been estimated at 40 billion dollars. Although bacteria and viruses both cause ARI, respiratory viruses have been shown to be the main factor behind various upper and lower tract infections in children, because the younger you are, the more likely you are to contract viral infections. In adults, upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) have been also recognized as frequent virus-related diseases. However, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic has rekindled interest in the responsibility of viruses for lower respiratory tract infections, which have also emerged as major causes not limited to the influenza epidemic. Understanding, treating and preventing respiratory viral infections are therefore major challenges, as they cause a high level of morbidity (acute bronchiolitis, asthma exacerbation, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or subsequent bacterial pneumonia). By contrast, the difference between bacterial and viral infection might be difficult to define with the clinics, imaging and biological point-of-care test. We previously showed that a younger age was associated with viral codetections, and that the rate of negative samples (with no viral aetiology found) increased with age. Thus, antibiotics are still prescribed inappropriately in general practice and emergency carewith the known consequences' on the bacterial resistance.

Given that general practitioners manage most of ARIs, knowledge of virus-associated ARIs remains a major clinical challenge in the community. Health authorities have developed various epidemiological surveys on specific viruses, limited to RSV, influenza and SARS-CoV2, all three of which are associated with severe illness and hospital admissions. However, ambulatory studies with the identification of an extensive panel of viruses linked to the clinical features and outcome are limited, because they included only children or elderly. We therefore conducted a prospective study in general practice, which assessed a panel of 15 viruses and 3 bacteria in patients of all ages visiting their GP for any ARIs. The aim of the study was to depict ARI in primary care according to patient age, clinical course after GP consultation and prescribing according to the viruses highlighted in nasopharyngeal swabs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in the primary care setting [^ce5dc767]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infections such as acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), acute otitis media (AOM), and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) account for approximately 75% of antibiotic prescriptions written and are among the leading reasons for physician office visits in the United States. Resistance of the predominant pathogens in respiratory tract infections (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) to available antibiotics has led clinicians to reevaluate the diagnosis and management of these infections.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide primary care practitioners with an accessible combined resource for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS.

Methods

This review was based on discussions from a roundtable meeting (sponsored by an educational grant from GlaxoSmithKline) that convened clinicians versed in the management of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, primary articles were identified by a MEDLINE search and through secondary sources.

Results

To reduce the prevalence of resistance, judicious and appropriate use of antibiotics must be implemented in clinical practice. With accurate diagnosis of bacterial and nonbacterial conditions, and patient education on antibiotic use and misuse, the excessive use of antibiotics and ensuing resistance can be reduced. The incorporation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data with minimum inhibitory concentration values can provide a more comprehensive assessment of antibiotic activity in vivo. Stratification of patients with AECB according to patient characteristics and frequency of exacerbation can be used to determine which patients will benefit from antibiotic treatment and to guide clinicians in their choice of antibiotic. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group has issued recommendations on the management of AOM based on prior antibiotic therapy, which is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance. The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership guidelines for the treatment of ABRS in adults and children are based on the predicted efficacy of various antibiotics as well as patient age, severity of disease, likelihood of bacterial infection, likelihood of spontaneous resolution, and in vitro susceptibility of the predominant pathogens based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic breakpoints.

Conclusions

Guidelines for the management of AECB, AOM, and ABRS emphasize the importance of differentiating between bacterial and nonbacterial infections, choosing an antibiotic based on the likelihood of infection with resistant pathogens, and providing coverage against the predominant pathogens. The judicious use of antibiotics also has been identified as an instrumental part of controlling unnecessary antibiotic use and subsequent resistance.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^531f14e3]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections account for millions of visits to family physicians each year in the United States. Although warranted in some cases, antibiotics are greatly overused. This article outlines the guidelines and indications for appropriate antibiotic use for common upper respiratory infections. Early antibiotic treatment may be indicated in patients with acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, epiglottitis, or bronchitis caused by pertussis. Persistent cases of rhinosinusitis may necessitate the use of antibiotics if symptoms persist beyond a period of observation. Antibiotics should not be considered in patients with the common cold or laryngitis. Judicious, evidence-based use of antibiotics will help contain costs and prevent adverse effects and drug resistance.

Recurrent respiratory infections

Recurrent respiratory infections in children

Recurrent respiratory infections are common in children. Nearly 25% of children experience RRTIs during their first year of life and approximately 6% of children under 6 years of age experience RRTIs. In most cases, these infections pass with mild symptoms and the frequency of infection tends to reduce over time, with a complete resolution typically around 12 years of age. Nonetheless, RRTIs can significantly negatively impact the quality of life of the child and family and have important medical and social costs. In some cases, URTIs can cause acute complications such as otitis media, pneumonia, glomerulonephritis, and myocarditis.

There is a lack of universal consensus on the definition of RRTIs. A consensus was published proposing an up-to-date definition and recommendations to guide physicians in the complex process of diagnosing, managing, and preventing pediatric RRTIs. For example, childhood respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are considered recurrent if within a year a child aged 6–12 years has three or more RTIs (one of which can be pneumonia, including severe pneumonia) or two mild cases of pneumonia confirmed by X-rays and/or clinical criteria.

The widespread presence of recurrent URTIs is not considered a global phenomenon. However, several cohort studies have attempted to estimate the prevalence of recurrent URTIs. The prospective, observational birth cohort study Steps to the Healthy Development and Well-being of Children (STEPS) observed 1,089 children from their birth until they turned 2 years old, tracking RTIs using a daily symptom diary. Recurrent RTIs were defined as more than 98 days of respiratory illness per year and was reported in 10% of the participant cohort. Approximately 60% of the participants with RRTIs were diagnosed with a minimum of three episodes of acute otitis, 73% received at least three courses of antibiotic treatment and 21% had been hospitalized with an acute form of RTI. By the time the children turned 2 years old, 12% had been diagnosed with asthma. Therefore, the authors concluded that RRTIs are a risk factor for asthma in children.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients: 2024 update [^8587317e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory illness is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality amongst infectious diseases worldwide and a major public health issue. Even though most cases are due to self-limited viral infections, a significant number of cases are due to more serious respiratory infections where delay in diagnosis can lead to morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a key role in the initial diagnosis and management of acute respiratory illness. This document reviews the current literature concerning the appropriate role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of the immunocompetent adult patient initially presenting with acute respiratory illness. Imaging recommendations for adults presenting with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations are discussed. Finally, guidelines for follow-up imaging in suspected pneumonia cases to ensure occult malignancy is not overlooked. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics to this patient with persistent upper respiratory symptoms? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^b8cf83b4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published advice for high-value care on the appropriate use of antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections. They conducted a narrative literature review of evidence for antibiotic use in this setting that included recent clinical guidelines from professional societies supplemented by randomized, controlled trials; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews. They concluded that clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis in patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, high fever and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or worsening symptoms after a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days and had initially improved ("double-sickening"). In this Grand Rounds, 2 prominent clinicians debate whether to initiate antibiotic treatment in a 62-year-old man with a history of recurrent sinusitis who presents with persistent upper respiratory symptoms. They review the data on which the ACP/CDC recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of prescribing antibiotic therapy in this setting.

### A narrative review and expert opinion on immunity-targeted approaches in the management of viral upper respiratory tract infections [^ab3725f5]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and recommendations

Viral URTIs considerably affect the health status and quality of life of patients of any age as well as their families, owing to physiological changes, frequent medical visits, school/work absenteeism, antibiotic overuse, bacterial resistance, weakening of lung function, greater risk of asthma development, and financial burden.

Identifying those at risk of recurrence and complications (such as patients with chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular or metabolic diseases, children and older adults) and prompt management can have a positive impact on a patient's well-being and financial welfare. Any reasonable solution that can result in the reduction of antibiotic consumption among the population is indisputably important; using antibiotics only when needed and respecting the indicated dose and regimen are vital for tackling growing antibiotic resistance.

Considering a remedy with the potential to modulate a patient's immunity is reasonable to facilitate the healing of acute infections, decrease recurrence and complications, antibiotic consumption, and the global consequences of antibiotic overuse. IP, an antiviral remedy with immunomodulatory properties, is a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for patients with impaired immunity and recurrent infections in the upper part of the respiratory tract. The further collection of information on "inosine through IP as stabilizing microbiotic agent" based on the latest publications and data from potential present-day studies can be beneficial for both scientific discussions in the medical community, as well as transforming prescription patterns.

Methodology

This narrative review and expert opinion paper is based on a comprehensive review of the literature combined with the clinical experience and interpretation of the contributing authors, who are recognized experts in infectious diseases, immunology, and respiratory medicine. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, covering publications from January 2010 to March 2025. Keywords included 'upper respiratory tract infections', 'immunomodulation', 'innate immunity', 'inosine pranobex', and 'recurrent URTIs'. Studies were selected based on relevance, scientific quality, and applicability to immunity-targeted strategies. In addition, reference mining of key articles ensured comprehensive coverage. The findings represent a synthesis of current evidence and expert clinical judgment.

Limitations of current vaccination strategies for upper respiratory tract infections

While vaccination is a cornerstone in preventing URTIs, several limitations hinder its comprehensive efficacy. One significant constraint is the limited induction of mucosal immunity by traditional intramuscular vaccines. These vaccines primarily stimulate systemic immune responses but may not elicit robust immunity at mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa, which are primary entry points for respiratory pathogens. This limitation can result in reduced effectiveness in preventing initial infection and transmission of respiratory viruses. Additionally, the specificity of vaccines to pathogens means they may not protect against the wide array of viruses responsible for URTIs. For instance, while vaccines exist for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, there are currently no approved vaccines for common URTI-causing viruses like rhinoviruses and certain coronaviruses. This gap leaves individuals susceptible to infections from these prevalent pathogens. Furthermore, vaccine efficacy can be compromised in certain populations. Elderly individuals and those with immunocompromising conditions often exhibit diminished immune responses to vaccination, leading to lower levels of protection. This is particularly concerning given that these groups are at higher risk for severe outcomes from URTIs. These limitations underscore the need for complementary strategies to enhance protection against URTIs.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of URTIs are vital components that have a significant impact on the evolution of diseases and overall health conditions in patients of all age groups. Receiving an immunity enhancer with an antiviral effect early has the potential to not only reduce the risk of recurrence and complications, but also help reduce antibiotic consumption. Any reasonable solution that can result in a reduction in antibiotic consumption among the population is considered favorable. To tackle this growing resistance, it is vital to use antibiotics appropriately at the necessary times, including the use of suitable dose intervals and for the relevant duration.

Therapeutic approaches targeted at improving and modulating immunity are appropriate not only for the effective treatment of persisting infections of the upper respiratory tract but also for the prevention of recurrence and upcoming complications. The use of antibiotics in an irrational manner not only leads to antibiotic resistance but may also have negative and even occasionally irreversible effects on the intestinal microbiota. Maintaining and protecting the intestinal microbiota and avoiding its alteration are crucial steps toward effective URTI treatment.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare.3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a primer for emergency physicians [^2577b6a2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic.

Objective

This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19.

Discussion

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine.

Conclusion

This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.

### Upper respiratory tract infections (including otitis media) [^979da3da]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections (including otitis media) are the most common illnesses affecting children. Most illnesses are mild and resolve completely without specific treatment, but the frequency of infection and association with fever and constitutional symptoms creates significant distress for the child and the family. By understanding the evidence available from high-quality studies, the clinician can advise the families on appropriate action. The goal of this article is to support clinicians in answering the following questions: (1) What happened to children with these conditions when no additional treatment was provided? (2) Which interventions have been assessed in well-designed studies? (3) Which interventions have been shown to improve outcomes? (4) How large is the overall benefit?

### Management of suspected acute viral upper respiratory tract infection in children with intranasal sodium cromoglicate: a randomised controlled trial [^e65e6265]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Upper respiratory tract infection in children is one of the most frequent reasons for visiting a family doctor, and antibiotics are often prescribed inappropriately. Sodium cromoglicate inhibits the ICAM-1 molecule, which is the receptor for human rhinoviruses. We aimed to investigate whether intranasal cromoglicate shortens duration of infection of the upper respiratory tract.

Methods

We randomly assigned 290 children diagnosed with suspected acute viral upper respiratory tract infection by their family doctor (137 boys, 153 girls; mean age 5.2 years [SD 3.39]) either intranasal 4% sodium cromoglicate spray or intranasal normal saline spray. Follow-up was by daily symptom diary for 2 weeks and by telephone. Canadian Acute Respiratory Illness and Flu Scale (CARIFS) score was the primary outcome measure.

Findings

195 patients returned symptom diaries, and 20 of these could not be included in the main analysis. 246 patients completed the telephone interview at week 1. There was no difference in recovery rate over the first week between the two groups, with the estimated difference in slope of log (CARIFS) being -0.01 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.03). There were no differences between the two groups in side-effects or re-consultation rates. 43 (17%) of 246 children with suspected acute viral upper respiratory tract infection went back to see their family doctor, and 220 (89%) of 246 were managed without prescription of antibiotics.

Interpretation

Intranasal sodium cromoglicate is not a useful additional treatment for this infection. Our results further clarify the role of prescribed drugs for children with these frequent illnesses.

### NSAIDs for early management of acute respiratory infections [^c9e7ff86]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) have a significant morbidity and mortality burden worldwide and represent a global health concern. Throughout the world, more than 50% of ARTIs are caused by viruses, including, but not limited to, human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Bacterial and viral ARTIs are often clinically indistinguishable and, even though the majority are of viral cause, they are by far the most common reason for prescribing an antibiotic in primary care. In outpatient practice, these infections are mostly self-limiting and do not require antimicrobial therapy, but rather symptomatic treatment, keeping in mind that the symptoms are caused by a local and systemic inflammatory response. In recent years, the experience with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has strongly underlined the importance of etiological diagnosis of infections and suggested that a prompt control of inflammation with antiinflammatories may limit viral infections and prevent complications. Nowadays, the etiological diagnosis of respiratory infections is made more accessible thanks to the availability of specific diagnostic kits that allow the identification of different viruses and the discrimination between bacterial and viral etiology, simplifying the choice of the most appropriate therapy. Even though symptoms typically last less than 10 days, they may be troublesome and therefore treatment should be timely.

The host reaction plays a major role in the pathogenesis of viral ARTI symptoms and the similarities in their clinical presentation suggest a common inflammatory and immune response pattern to different etiologic agents. Once again, the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to increase and consolidate our notions about the pathophysiology of respiratory infections. The primary concept is that every infection induces an inflammatory response. Therefore, switching off the inflammation at the very first symptoms could be a winning strategy in the management of ARTIs.

In this article, we discuss the rationale for an early approach to viral ARTIs with NSAIDs as the most appropriate to switch off the inflammatory cascade resulting from the infection before the inflammatory process becomes complicated; this could help to limit the development of clinical complications and the excessive and inappropriate use of other classes of drugs, including antibiotics, when there is no specific indication to use them, with their major impact on the growing issue of resistance. We review here the pathophysiology of ARTIs, the subsequent development of a local and systemic inflammatory process, the main NSAIDs and their characteristics, and discuss their potential role in the early treatment of ARTIs.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients [^a35c9fa3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory illness, defined as cough, sputum production, chest pain, and/or dyspnea (with or without fever), is a major public health issue, accounting for millions of doctor office and emergency department visits every year. While most cases are due to self-limited viral infections, a significant number of cases are due to more serious respiratory infections where delay in diagnosis can lead to morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a key role in the initial diagnosis and management of acute respiratory illness. This study reviews the current literature concerning the appropriate role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of the immunocompetent adult patient initially presenting with acute respiratory illness. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Predictors of suppurative complications for acute sore throat in primary care: prospective clinical cohort study [^72bad659]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory tract infections are the commonest acute illnesses managed in everyday practice, and most patients receive antibiotics, whether for a lower respiratory tract infection or acute sore throat. Prescribing of antibiotics in the community is a key driver of antibiotic resistance, which may lead to many untreatable serious infections, and since new classes of antibiotics are not being developed, the key to maintaining the precious resource of antibiotics is to reduce antibiotic use for those who will receive no meaningful clinical benefit.

Although systematic reviews and randomised trials of antibiotics in acute sore throat have shown a modest effect on symptoms, prescribing antibiotics prevents both suppurative complications (quinsy, otitis media, sinusitis, cellulitis) and non-suppurative complications, although non-suppurative complications are probably currently rare in resource rich settings. Thus it is important not to deny those patients at major risk of severe illness or complications the benefit from antibiotics. Both patients and general practitioners are concerned about the danger of severe illness from upper respiratory tract infections, and in the absence of evidence general practitioners currently use a range of ad hoc clinical criteria to justify prescribing antibiotics. A better understanding of those patients who are or are not at risk of poorer outcomes could help tackle such concerns.

### Evaluation of uncomplicated acute respiratory tract infection management in veterans: a national utilization review [^708a17f0]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are overprescribed for acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs). Guidelines provide criteria to determine which patients should receive antibiotics. We assessed congruence between documentation of ARI diagnostic and treatment practices with guideline recommendations, treatment appropriateness, and outcomes.

Methods

A multicenter quality improvement evaluation was conducted in 28 Veterans Affairs facilities. We included visits for pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infections (URI-NOS) that occurred during the 2015–2016 winter season. A manual record review identified complicated cases, which were excluded. Data were extracted for visits meeting criteria, followed by analysis of practice patterns, guideline congruence, and outcomes.

Results

Of 5,740 visits, 4,305 met our inclusion criteria: pharyngitis (n = 558), rhinosinusitis (n = 715), bronchitis (n = 1,155), URI-NOS (n = 1,475), or mixed diagnoses (> 1 ARI diagnosis) (n = 402). Antibiotics were prescribed in 68% of visits: pharyngitis (69%), rhinosinusitis (89%), bronchitis (86%), URI-NOS (37%), and mixed diagnosis (86%). Streptococcal diagnostic testing was performed in 33% of pharyngitis visits; group A Streptococcus was identified in 3% of visits. Streptococcal tests were ordered less frequently for patients who received antibiotics (28%) than those who did not receive antibiotics 44%; P < .01). Although 68% of visits for rhinosinusitis had documentation of symptoms, only 32% met diagnostic criteria for antibiotics. Overall, 39% of patients with uncomplicated ARIs received appropriate antibiotic management. The proportion of 30-day return visits for ARI care was similar for appropriate (11%) or inappropriate (10%) antibiotic management (P = 0.22).

Conclusions

Antibiotics were prescribed in most uncomplicated ARI visits, indicating substantial overuse. Practice was frequently discordant with guideline diagnostic and treatment recommendations.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^9247cf2d]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Post-infectious and other infections causing chronic cough in children: Post-viral cough refers to cough after the acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and in the community cough post viral URTIs is likely the most common cause of chronic cough in children. The mean annual incidence of total respiratory illness per person per year ranges from 5.0 to 7.95 in children aged < 4 years to 2.4 to 5.02 in children aged 10 to 14 years. Following URTIs, acute cough typically resolves within 1 to 3 weeks but 10% may cough for ≥ 20 to 25 days. In the follow-up of 839 children, 627 (75%) coughed for < 7 days and 171 (20%) for > 28 days, and of those with chronic cough (> 28 days), a new and serious illness was found in the 36 of the 117 children who were clinically reviewed. Other infections such as pertussis and mycoplasma can cause chronic cough, and pertussis should be suspected, especially with known contact even if the child is fully immunized.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^a0512e9e]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report — adult cough classification by duration and associated etiologies and evidence are summarized as follows: With respect to acute cough (< 3 weeks), only three studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and all had a high risk of bias; as predicted by the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines, the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral cause, followed by exacerbations of underlying diseases such as asthma and COPD and pneumonia, and the subjects resided on three continents: North America, Europe, and Asia. With respect to subacute cough (duration, 3–8 weeks), only two studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and both had a high risk of bias; as predicted by the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were postinfectious cough and exacerbation of underlying diseases such as asthma, COPD, and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), and the subjects resided in countries in Asia. With respect to chronic cough (> 8 weeks), 11 studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and all had a high risk of bias; as predicted by the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were UACS from rhinosinus conditions, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, combinations of these four conditions, and, less commonly, a variety of miscellaneous conditions and atopic cough in Asian countries, and the subjects resided on four continents: North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Although the quality of evidence was low, the published literature since 2006 suggests that CHEST's 2006 Cough Guidelines and management algorithms for acute, subacute, and chronic cough in adults appeared useful in diagnosing and treating patients with cough around the globe, and these same algorithms have been updated to reflect the advances in cough management as of 2017.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections during influenza seasons [^6ca9c7b5]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are targets for improving antibiotic stewardship for outpatient acute respiratory infections?

Findings

Among 14 987 outpatients with acute respiratory infections enrolled in this cohort study during influenza seasons, 41% were prescribed antibiotics, 41% of whom had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated, primarily viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis; 29% of patients with influenza confirmed through research testing were prescribed antibiotics. Among patients prescribed antibiotics, 38% with pharyngitis tested negative for group A streptococcus and 38% with sinusitis had symptoms for 3 days or less before the visit, suggesting antibiotic therapy was not required.

Meaning

Eliminating antibiotic treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis, improving influenza diagnosis and treatment, and reinforcing prescription guidelines for pharyngitis and sinusitis could improve outpatient antibiotic stewardship.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use: part I. acute… [^0836351d]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assembled a panel of national health experts, including physicians with expertise in internal, family, emergency and infectious diseases medicine, to develop evidencebased guidelines for evaluating and treating adults with acute respiratory illnesses. Joining the CDC were the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The complete treatment guidelines were published in the March 20, 2001 issue of. The goal of the principles is to provide clinicians with practical strategies for limiting antibiotic use to the patients who are most likely to benefit from it. These principles should be used along with effective patient educational campaigns and enhancements to the health care delivery system that facilitate nonantibiotic treatment of the conditions in question. Penicillin resistance to.

Intervention strategies aimed at reducing community use of antibiotics should address the management of acute respiratory infection through physician and patient education at the household and office levels. Acute respiratory infections are the most frequent reason for seeking medical attention in the United States, and they are associated with up to 75 percent of the total antibiotic prescriptions written each year. Antibiotic treatment of a cold, an upper respiratory tract infection or acute bronchitis is usually inappropriate because the majority of these syndromes have a nonbacterial cause. Using antibiotics for treating sinusitis and pharyngitis is justified if it is limited to appropriate subsets of patients. Each article in the CDC series focuses on the major decisions or issues that physicians face during evaluation of patients with symptoms of acute respiratory illness.

These decisions center on establishing a diagnosis, estimating the likelihood of a bacterial cause and determining if antibiotic therapy is needed. For each condition, an evidence model was developed to frame specific questions to be addressed. To determine which, if any, patients with bronchitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis or nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection are likely to benefit from antibiotic treatment, depends on accurate diagnosis and assessment of the likelihood of a bacterial cause. The panel avoided detailed discussions of specific antibiotic treatments because the information is available in other publications and local resistance patterns continue to evolve. The principles are intended to be recommendations based on an evidence-based analysis and interpretation of current scientific literature. The panel's conclusions do not necessarily reflect those of the original studies.

These principles apply to immunocompetent adults who do not have significant comorbid conditions. Physicians are advised to use caution in the elderly, because persons older than 65 years were often underrepresented in or excluded from treatment trials.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^72938921]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised.1. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. 2. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever.3. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. 4. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### Management of respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19 infection [^35b1f809]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and its clinical manifestation as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an unparalleled worldwide public health problem. As reported on July 14, 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 has already infected 12,964,809 patients and provoked 570,288 deaths (mortality of 4.39%). The disease introduces a unique pathophysiology and clinical course that puzzles the efficacy of the currently existing therapeutic approaches. This editorial presents an overview of the clinical experience gathered thus far from different centers around the world, and is not meant to constitute a guideline nor a standard of care for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, given that the level of evidence behind the clinical approach to these patients is rapidly evolving.

### Respiratory illness caused by picornavirus infection: a review of clinical outcomes [^7ead12b7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory infections result from invasion of the respiratory tract, mainly by viruses, and are the leading cause of acute morbidity in individuals of all ages worldwide. During peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold), the most frequent manifestation of acute respiratory infection, and produce more restriction of activity and physician consultations annually than any other viral or bacterial source of respiratory illness.

Objective

This article reviews the clinical impact and outcomes of picornavirus-induced respiratory infections in specific populations at risk for complications. It also discusses the potential economic impact of the morbidity associated with picornavirus-induced respiratory infection.

Methods

Relevant literature was identified through searches of MEDLINE, OVID, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Lexis-Nexis. The search terms used were picornavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, viral respiratory infection, upper respiratory infection, disease burden, economic, cost, complications, asthma, COPD, immunocompromised, elderly otitis media, and sinusitis. Additional publications were identified from the reference lists of the retrieved articles.

Conclusions

Based on the clinical literature, picornavirus infections are associated with severe morbidity as well as considerable economic and societal costs. Future research should focus on identifying patterns of illness and the costs associated with management of these infections. New treatments should be assessed not only in terms of their ability to produce the desired clinical outcome, but also in terms of their ability to reduce the burden of disease, decrease health care costs, and improve productivity.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^f46e784f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — viral shedding kinetics and timing of specimen collection: In most persons, infectious influenza virus levels in the upper respiratory tract of persons with uncomplicated influenza peak during the first 1–2 days after illness onset, and decline to undetectable levels within 1 week. Collection of upper respiratory tract specimens from immunocompetent outpatients with influenza > 3–4 days after illness onset may yield negative results because of substantially decreased influenza viral shedding, especially in older children and adults, although influenza viruses might be detectable in upper respiratory tract specimens for longer periods in some patients, particularly when molecular assays are used. Infants and young children and adults hospitalized with severe lower respiratory tract illness often shed influenza viruses for ≥ 1 week, and immunocompromised patients may have prolonged influenza virus replication and shed infectious influenza viruses for weeks to months, even when asymptomatic or without fever. The appropriate respiratory tract specimen to collect depends upon which influenza test is used and patient acceptability.

### Acute sinusitis in children [^c85542fa]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^bf3247ca]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosis in children emphasizes differentiating it from uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection (URI): Uncomplicated viral URIs typically last 5 to 7 days, with respiratory symptoms peaking by days 3 to 6, fever and constitutional symptoms disappearing in the first 24 to 48 hours, and some resolving signs persisting after day 10. Persistence without improvement of nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough (which may be worse at night), or both, suggests acute sinusitis, yet only a minority (~6%–7%) of children with URI symptoms meet criteria for persistence. An alternative presentation is worsening ("double sickening") with substantial acute worsening of respiratory symptoms or a new fever often on the sixth or seventh day after initial recovery. A severe-onset presentation is concurrent high fever (temperature > 39°C) and purulent nasal discharge for the first 3 to 4 days of an acute URI. Bad breath, fatigue, headache, and decreased appetite are not specific indicators, and physical examination, sinus percussion, and transillumination are not helpful; nasopharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the etiology.

### Upper respiratory infections [^5a66eba3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is estimated that > 24 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis occur annually in the United States. Recently, a number of medical societies have issued guidelines to aid in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Although these guidelines serve to aid practitioners in the proper use of antibiotics, confusion remains regarding the disparity of guideline recommendations as well as some recommendations being outdated. This review presents 3 illustrative case studies designed to provide some clarity with regard to these guidelines. Case 1 is a typical presentation of a patient with worsening sinus conditions over the previous 2 weeks. Case 2 is a more challenging case of a patient with a sinus condition accompanied by a penicillin allergy that ultimately requires referral to an otolaryngologist. Case 3 is an atypical case with symptoms of a sinus infection accompanied by a normal sinus computed tomography scan. It is hoped that the presentation and discussion surrounding these cases will provide some helpful insights into the management of patients with URIs.

### Expert consensus statements for the management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure using a Delphi method [^c5adaa4b]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Using a Delphi method, an agreement among experts was reached for 27 statements on the respiratory management of C-ARF, addressing important decisions for patient management in areas where evidence is either absent or limited. Strong evidence from high-quality clinical trials is needed to clarify the remaining uncertainties. While these expert clinical practice statements provide clinical direction with C-ARF, some of these general principles may help with the management of other viral pneumonias or future variants of the SARS-CoV-2 strain.

### Feasibility of establishing acute respiratory infection treatment units (ATU) for improvement of care of children with acute respiratory infection [^d4224a2a]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

We did not do baseline statistics to document impact of ATU on outcome of management of ARI. This is one of the limitations of the study. However, in present study success rate for diagnosis, case fatality and use of antibiotics were significantly better as compared to historical documentation in literature from similar setting. In the present study, we enrolled, prescribed treatment, did follow up and recorded outcome in 90% of our patients. Majority (90%) of the children were managed on ambulatory basis, only 10% required hospitalization. Only 16 (0.25%) children who were initially on ambulatory treatment required admission. A study from Pakistan comparing ambulatory with in-patient management for non-severe pneumonia reported hospitalization in the ambulatory management arm ranging from 1.7–2.8%. Only 12% of the children with URTI were treated with antibiotics. This proportion varied between centres ranging from 44.2 to 5.9%. Mortality of hospitalized children varies between 10 and 50% and is dependent on the type of hospital. Case fatality rate amongst severe pneumonia cases in our study was only 2%. This could possibly be because of focused approached to appropriate diagnosis of pneumonia along with adequate management in terms of hospital admission and antibiotic usage along with aggressive follow-up. Exclusion of children with underlying diseases/ co-morbid conditions would have also contributed to lower case fatality. The concept of dedicated ATU facilitated the decision making and implementation in both diagnosis and management of ARI in children. Also, our observations suggest that possibly viral infections causing severe ALRI were responsible for mortality in younger children below 18 months of age.

A recent report suggests that almost 75% of patients with upper respiratory infection were getting antibiotics. As majority of URI are due to viral infections, antibiotics are not required. Unnecessary antibiotic prescription is one of the major factors for acquired drug resistance. Encouragingly in our study, only 12% of children with no pneumonia received antibiotics.

This study is a preliminary endeavor to evaluate the feasibility and impact of acute respiratory infection treatment units in improving care of children with acute respiratory infection. Results suggest that it is feasible to develop ATUs and the outcomes are encouraging. Our deduction is based on comparison of data from literature. We did not collect baseline data from individual sites to objectively document impact of ATU. Reasons for not collecting data before intervention were multiple: duration of project was 24 months and ARI data may be affected according to season, we did not have enough time to collect 12 months of data before and after intervention.

### Severe acute respiratory syndrome: clinical features, diagnosis, and management [^571fff71]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In November 2003, a new, life-threatening, respiratory illness named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) arose from Guangdong Province in China. The illness spread across the globe, caused many major outbreaks, and had an overall mortality rate of 11%. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of SARS, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathogen.

Recent Findings

SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus that primarily affects the lower respiratory tract. It starts with an influenza-like illness characterized by nonspecific, systemic symptoms. This is followed by the rapid development of a non-specific bronchopneumonia associated with lower tract respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Most patients recover after a week or 2, but some go on to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no proven treatment, although cocktails of broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral, and immunomodulatory therapy have been tried. Secondary spread can be prevented and outbreaks brought under control provided that staff wear personal protective equipment and pay close attention to good personal hygiene, and patients are isolated. The most urgent needs at present are to develop a vaccine, to develop rapid, inexpensive, accurate diagnostic tests that can give results early in the illness and within a few hours of sampling. Other needs are to investigate which therapies have the lowest adverse event/efficacy ratios.

Summary

Up-to-date knowledge of SARS should help in early detection, isolation of high-risk patients, to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to prevent a new global epidemic arising.

### Management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [^4f8c94e1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has rapidly spread throughout the world since December 2019 to become a global public health emergency for the elevated deaths and hospitalizations in Intensive Care Units. The severity spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to severe clinical conditions. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 disease is correlated with multiple factors including host characteristics (genetics, immune status, age, and general health), viral load and, above all, the host distribution of the airways and lungs of the viral receptor cells. In this review, we will briefly summarize the current knowledge of the characteristics and management of coronavirus disease 2019-pneumonia. However, other studies are needed to better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms induced by SARS-Cov-2 infection, and to evaluate the long-term consequences of the virus on the lungs.

### Antibiotic use for emergency department patients with upper respiratory infections: prescribing practices, patient expectations, and patient satisfaction [^9551c87b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Physicians often prescribe antibiotics to patients even when there is no clear indication for their use. Previous studies examining antibiotic use in acute bronchitis and upper respiratory infections have been conducted in primary care settings. We evaluate the factors that physicians in the emergency department (ED) consider when prescribing antibiotics (eg, patient expectations) and the factors associated with patient satisfaction.

Methods

Ten academic EDs enrolled adults and children presenting with symptoms consistent with upper respiratory infection. Enrolled patients were interviewed before their physician encounter and were reinterviewed before discharge and 2 weeks later. Physicians were interviewed about factors that influenced their management decisions, including their perceptions of patients' expectations. Patients with a single diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis or upper respiratory infection were included for analysis.

Results

Of 272 patients enrolled, 68% of bronchitis patients and 9% of upper respiratory infection patients received antibiotics. Physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics when they believed that patients expected them (odds ratio [OR] 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9 to 9.6), although they were able to correctly identify only 27% of the patients who expected antibiotics. Satisfaction with the ED visit was reported by 87% of patients who received antibiotics and 89% of those not receiving antibiotics. Satisfaction with the visit was reported by 92% of patients who believed they had a better understanding of their illness but only by 72% of those who thought they had no better understanding (OR 4.4; 95% CI 2.0 to 8.4).

Conclusion

Physicians in our academic EDs prescribed antibiotics to 68% of acute bronchitis patients and to fewer than 10% of upper respiratory infection patients. Physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who they believed expected them, although they correctly identified only about 1 in 4 of those patients. Patient satisfaction was not related to receipt of antibiotics but was related to the belief they had a better understanding of their illness.

### Virus-induced asthma attacks [^f69b496b]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections are a common cause of asthma attacks. Study of this phenomenon has revealed multiple mechanisms and contributed to understanding of the increase in airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction observed in this context. Changes in the neural control of the airways contribute to bronchoconstriction, which is reflected in an increased efficacy of anticholinergic medications during acute asthma attacks. The ability to prevent or treat viral respiratory tract infections is currently limited. However, as more effective antiviral treatments and vaccines become available, such therapies are likely to be effective in patients with asthma. Clinical management of this problem is illustrated in this article by the case of a 40-year-old woman with history of mild asthma who was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe bronchospasm and an upper respiratory tract infection.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^bd06ba88]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Upper airway disorders in children — rhinosinusitis and cough: Cough is included in the symptom complex of both acute (> 10 days) and chronic (> 90 days) rhinosinusitis, and in both conditions the recommended first-line treatment is antibiotics (amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate) for 7–10 and 20 days, respectively; however, to date no studies have undertaken FB in children with acute or chronic sinusitis to determine if chronic cough is related to lower airway infection. Pediatric reports of 'upper airways cough syndrome' were not randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and most used antibiotics, and a RCT in adolescents and adults with allergic rhinitis (n = 245) showed a significant daytime cough difference between mometasone furoate and placebo (P = 0.049) with no difference in nighttime cough.

### Expert consensus statements for the management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure using a Delphi method [^f7871cdc]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a pandemic, resulting in unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems globally. Although most patients present with mild symptoms including fever and malaise, 8–32% of patients presenting to hospital may require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), depending on the admission criteria and available resources, with an ICU mortality of 34–50%.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) who are admitted to the ICU with hypoxaemia typically require some form of respiratory support. COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may differ from other causes of ARDS, since patients may present with profound hypoxaemia accompanied by a wide range of respiratory compliance. However, whether ARDS due to COVID-19 is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS remains a matter of debate. Consequently, there is no uniform agreement on the optimal management of respiratory failure, including the most appropriate oxygenation and ventilation strategies that limit or prevent additional lung injury or other complications in these patients.

There are few published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) related to the respiratory management of C-ARF. As a result, clinical practice variations in the management of C-ARF exist, making the optimal therapeutic management unclear. Given the dearth of evidence, we aimed to achieve agreement on the respiratory management of C-ARF using a Delphi process, defined by at least 70% agreement among experts who met pre-specified qualification criteria.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^3d4a9bbd]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review synthesises two decades of studies incorporating economic evaluation of Strep A prevention and treatment modalities. The cohort of these studies are notable for their scope. Though, the vast majority evaluated clinical diagnostic or therapeutic strategies to manage acute disease and focused on near-term outcomes. For example, the largest number of included publications addressed primary prevention (n = 19), particularly diagnostic strategy for acute pharyngitis (n = 5). These studies largely found that performing RADTs in all patients presenting with pharyngitis was cost-effective in reducing antibiotic consumption compared to other diagnostic and management strategies. Use of RADT was also a favourable strategy for diagnosing and managing pharyngitis when considering the reduction in risk of ARF and other sequelae in studies that did, and did not, include reductions in duration of infection as a benefit. However, few, if any, studies considered the implications of diagnostic tests detecting upper respiratory tract carriage of Strep A among cases of viral infection, which might lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment.

The number of studies focusing on diagnostic strategies may suggest to decision-makers that this is the key clinical or public health question in addressing Strep A burden; i.e. the area with the most evaluation is the impost important or impactful. However, studies which identify cost-effective strategies for pharyngitis management do not necessarily translate into studies for cost-effective strategies to reduce the population-level burden of post-infection sequalae, including ARF and RHD. Only seven studies evaluated strategies to reduce the incidence of ARF and/or RHD among the general population. and four studies evaluated strategies to prevent worsening of established disease –. While these studies indicate that improving the coverage of existing or introducing new prevention strategies are economically justifiable, the body of existing literature does not clearly meet the needs of decision makers targeting the population-wide reduction in post-infection sequelae.

### Characterisation of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections in Danish general practice: a retrospective registry based cohort study [^8c82776d]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

During the study period (2012–2013), the Danish national guidelineon antibiotic use recommended penicillin V as empirical first choice for AOM, acute tonsillitis, acute rhinosinusitis, and pneumonia. In case of penicillin allergy, a macrolide was recommended. The recommendation for AECOPD was co-amoxicillin. In case of penicillin allergy, a tetracycline was recommended. Uncomplicated acute bronchitis is considered a self-limiting disease and no antibiotic is recommended.

We assumed that recommended empirical first-line treatment should account for at least 80% of prescriptions in order to adhere to guidelines.

No specific guidance regarding diagnostics were included, however a general recommendation regarding use of C-reactive protein was adopted in general practice (the C-reactive protein speedometer).

Analyses

A dataset consisting of clinical indications and antibiotic prescriptions was created by merging datasets by their unique practice identification numbers. The following six age groups for each specific indication were used; < 5 years; 5–14 years; 15–44 years; 45–64 years; 65–74 years, 75+ years.

When assessing the clinical indications for antibiotic prescribing, we chose to include the full range of acute respiratory tract infections; all R codes in the International Classification of Primary Care, second edition. As a result, both upper and lower respiratory tract infections were included. Furthermore we chose to include AOM to the group of respiratory tract infections in primary care. This was due to the fact that the clinical picture of AOM rarely presents as an isolated disease entity, but most often is accompanied by additional common cold symptoms.

The clinical indicators on the most common acute respiratory tract infections in primary care were grouped and analyzed: AOM, acute tonsillitis, acute rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and AECOPD. Descriptive analyses of antibiotic use were performed, such as percentages, cumulated percentages, no. of treatments per 1000 inhabitants for each acute respiratory tract infection.

In addition, the accordance of GPs' antibiotic management of patients with acute respiratory tract infections was assessed by comparing to national guidelines. Danish national guidelines on antibiotic use recommends narrow-spectrum penicillin (penicillin V) as first-line agent for most respiratory cases, except AECOPD, where the recommendation in 2012–2013 was co-amoxicillin. All calculations were done in SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC, USA).

### Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data [^c1bf0216]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Risk of bias assessment for individual studies

We used the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias toolto assess sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, staff, and outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; and evidence of selective outcome reporting and other potential threats to validity. Two investigators (ARM and DAJ) independently assessed study quality, except for the three trials by Martineau and colleagues, which were assessed by CAC. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Definition of outcomes

The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was incidence of acute respiratory tract infection, incorporating events classified as upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, and acute respiratory tract infection of unclassified location (ie, infection of the upper respiratory tract or lower respiratory tract, or both). Secondary outcomes were incidence of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, analysed separately; incidence of emergency department attendance or hospital admission, or both for acute respiratory tract infection; use of antimicrobials for treatment of acute respiratory tract infection; absence from work or school due to acute respiratory tract infection; incidence and nature of serious adverse events; incidence of potential adverse reactions to vitamin D (hypercalcaemia or renal stones); and mortality (acute respiratory tract infection related and all cause).

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^9ff8dfe9]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections… [^b1cfe7fa]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

|When not to treat with an antibiotic: nearly all cases resolve without antibiotics. Antibiotic use should be reserved for moderate symptoms that are not improving after 10 days or that worsen after five to seven days, and severe symptoms. |. If an antibiotic is prescribed, first-line therapy for patients with nonsevere illness is high-dosage amoxicillin. Patients with nonsevere illness in whom amoxicillin therapy has failed should switch to high-dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate. For patients with symptoms of severe infection, first-line therapy is high-dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate. Alternative therapies for patients allergic to penicillin are shown in Table 1.
5.

For children, treatment options include high-dosage amoxicillin, high-dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, cefdinir, or ceftriaxone. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, or clindamycin is recommended if the patient has a history of type I hypersensitivity reaction to betalactam antibiotics. For adults, treatment options include high-dosage amoxicillin, high-dosage amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, gatif loxacin, levof loxacin, and moxif loxacin. TMP-SMX, doxycycline, azithromycin, or clarithromycin is recommended if the patient has a history of type I hypersensitivity reaction to betalactam antibiotics. Targeted symptomatic relief can be provided with antipyretics, decongestants, antihistamines, and antitussives.

Having prescription pads with a preprinted checklist of medications for symptomatic relief and patient education is useful. Several studies have indicated that giving patients an antibiotic prescription and telling them not to fill it unless their symptoms worsen or do not improve after several days has been shown to reduce antibiotic use.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^5600ca63]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^a676b4b2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or long coronavirus disease (COVID) is an emerging syndrome characterized by multiple persisting or newly emergent symptoms following the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For affected patients, these prolonged symptoms can have a relapsing and remitting course and may be associated with disability and frequent health care utilization. Although many symptom-driven treatments are available, management remains challenging and often requires a multidisciplinary approach. This article summarizes the emerging consensus on definitions, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of long COVID and discusses what is understood about prevention, evaluation, and treatment of this syndrome.

### Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^88fb7d95]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Acute upper respiratory tract infections are the most common infections in infants and children. Saline nasal irrigation (SNI) is widely prescribed and recommended. We conducted a systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of SNI in infants and children with acute rhinopharyngitis.

Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Medline, Embase and clinicalTrials.gov. Two authors selected randomized control trials (RCTs), including infants ≥ 3 months and children ≤ 12 years, comparing the use of isotonic saline solutions, whatever their mode of administration, with one therapeutic abstention, or a therapy deemed less important for nasal lavage. Trial quality was assessed independently by two authors, who, with a third author, extracted and analysed data. Statistical analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. The standard difference in means (SMD) between groups and its 95% confidence interval were estimated.

Results

Four RCTs (569 participants) were included. The analysis showed a benefit of SNI for certain clinical rhinological symptoms (SMD = -0.29 [-0.45; -0.13]) but no significant improvement of respiratory symptoms (SMD = -0.19 [-0.70; 1.08]) or health status (SMD = -0.30 [-0.68; 0.07]). Its use appeared to limit the prescription of other treatments, whether local or systemic, and particularly antibiotics. Long-term use led to a decrease in the incidence of acute rhinosinusitis and its complications. SNI appeared to be a safe treatment.

Conclusions

SNI is beneficial for rhinological symptoms but not respiratory symptoms. Further research is needed to address the full benefits/risks of this treatment.

### Clinical reasoning: a 47-year-old man with an upper respiratory infection, acute confusion, dysarthria, and ataxia [^1dad6c01]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

A patient presenting with acute confusion, dysarthria, and appendicular ataxia with gait instability warrants a broad differential including emergent consideration of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Moreover, in acute to subacute presentations, a wide array of etiologies including infectious causes, toxins, or autoimmune conditions may be considered. This article features a 47-year-old man who presented acutely with confusion, severe dysarthria, left upper extremity dysmetria, and unsteady gait. In this case, these neurologic signs were preceded by symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. In addition, MRI brain without contrast demonstrated a small focus of hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging in the splenium of the corpus callosum with apparent diffusion coefficient match. The article illustrates a diagnostic approach in evaluating a patient with this constellation of clinical and radiologic findings, as well as pertinent management considerations. A comprehensive overview of other potential causative factors of the imaging findings is described to augment the reader's differential diagnosis. Finally, a literature review pertaining to the revealed diagnosis highlights the epidemiologic relevance and important clinical pearls.

Adult sinusitis guideline — acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) diagnosis and differential state that clinicians should distinguish presumed ABRS from viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). Strong recommendation.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^29c44215]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis — history of rhinosinusitis identifies that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is suspected in patients whose upper respiratory infection (URI) has persisted beyond 7 to 10 days or is worsening after initial improvement, and symptoms lasting 5 to 10 days are the most difficult to assess because they may reflect an ongoing viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or the beginning of a bacterial infection. In adults, prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, obstruction, anterior and/or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure, and a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea and facial pain appear to have some correlation with increased likelihood of bacterial disease; in children, symptoms often also include increased irritability, even more prolonged cough, and vomiting that occurs in association with gagging on mucus. In contrast to ABRS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and can be subdivided into CRSsNP and CRSwNP; patients with CRSwNP generally present with periodic exacerbations with increased facial pain or pressure and increased drainage, and fever is absent or low grade with persistence of some sinonasal symptoms between episodes that distinguishes CRS from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS), in which the patient is asymptomatic between ABRS episodes.

### Antibiotics for the common cold [^4d67ecec]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is considered to be caused by viruses and it has long been believed that antibiotics have no role in treating this condition. In many countries doctors will often prescribe antibiotics for the common cold in the belief that they may prevent secondary bacterial infection and in some cases to respond to patient demand. There is also increasing concern over the resistance of common bacteria to commonly used antibiotics. A crucial step in reducing the use of antibiotics for the common cold is to examine the evidence to see if there is any benefit or if there is benefit for some subgroups or symptom constellations.

Objectives

(1) To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in comparison with placebo in the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) in terms of the proportion of patients in whom the clinical outcome was considered to be a reduction in general symptoms and specific nasopharyngeal symptoms. (2) To determine whether there are significant adverse outcomes associated with antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute upper respiratory tract infection.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Family Medicine Database, and reference lists of articles, and we contacted principal investigators. The most recent search was in May 2001 SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute upper respiratory tract infections with less than 7 days of symptoms

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

All analyses used fixed effects unless otherwise stated Main results: Nine trials involving 2249 (2157 analysed) people aged between two months and 79 years (and adults with no upper age limit) years were included. The overall quality of the included trials was variable. People receiving antibiotics did not do better in terms of lack of cure or persistence of symptoms than those on placebo (odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.59 to 1.08). Only one study Taylor et al (1977) specifically reported persistence of clear rhinitis with a small benefit to those on antibiotics. Two studies found a significant benefit for antibiotics compared with placebo for runny nose (clear) odds ratio 0.42 (0.22–0.78). Two studies also found a significant benefit in patients with sore throat odds ratio 0.27 95% CI (0.10–0.74). Only one study reported work time lost with 22% of those on antibiotic treatment and 25% of those on placebo but this was not significant. Adult patients treated with antibiotics had a significant increase in adverse effects (odds ratio 3.6 95% CI 2.21 to 5.89) while there was no significant increase in children odds ratio 0.90 95% CI (0.44–1.82).

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence of important benefits from the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections with antibiotics to warrant their routine use in children or adults and there is a significant increase in adverse effects associated with antibiotic use in adult patients.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^c78ecc05]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Viral infections in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis — Adults have an average of 2 to 3 viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) annually and children have 3 to 8, and during viral URIs, computed tomography (CT) shows sinus mucosal thickening in 39% to 90%. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is reported after URIs in 0.5% to 13% of patients. Polymerase chain reaction studies in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) detected respiratory syncytial virus in 4 of 20 (20%) sinus mucosal specimens and rhinovirus in 8 of 39 patients with CRS (21%), while in acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) biopsy samples 50% had RNA evidence of rhinovirus; evidence thus supports the clinical observation that a significant number of ABRS infections is caused by viruses but that viruses are less likely to play an important role in CRS compared with ABRS.

### Assessing the impact of national guidelines on the management of children hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis [^36ec6197]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis is a common illness accounting for $500 million annually in hospitalizations. Despite the frequency of bronchiolitis, its diagnosis and management is variable. To address this variability, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published an evidence-based practice management guideline for bronchiolitis in 2006.

Objective

Assess for changes in physician behavior in the management of bronchiolitis before and after publication of the 2006 AAP bronchiolitis guideline.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed at two academic medical centers of children < 24months of age admitted to the hospital with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Pre-guideline charts were gathered from 2004 to 2005 and post-guideline charts from 2007 to 2008. Evaluation and therapeutic interventions prior to and during hospitalization were analyzed. Data were analyzed using chi-squared analysis for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney testing for continuous variables.

Results

One thousand two hundred thirty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Diagnostic laboratory testing rates did not decline after guideline publication. The number of chest X-rays obtained decreased from 72.9% to 66.7% post-guidelines (P = 0.02). Fewer children received a trial of racemic epinephrine (17.8% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.006) or albuterol (81.6% vs. 72.6%, P < 0.0001) post-guidelines, and physicians more often discontinued albuterol when documented ineffective in the post-guidelines period (28.6% vs. 78.9%, P < 0.0001). Corticosteroid use in children without a history of RAD or asthma dropped post-guidelines (26.5% vs. 17.5%, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

A modest change in physician behavior in the inpatient management of bronchiolitis was seen post-guidelines. Additional health care provider training and education is warranted to reduce unnecessary interventions and healthcare resources use.

### Saline nasal irrigation for acute upper respiratory tract infections [^cfa7155d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation, and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and mucolytic drugs, and often antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for chronic or allergic sinusitis, but little is known about its effect on acute URTIs.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of saline nasal irrigation in treating the symptoms of acute URTIs.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), EMBASE (1974 to May 2009), CINAHL (1982 to May 2009), AMED (1985 to 2009) and LILACS (May 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical nasal saline treatment to other interventions in adults and children with clinically diagnosed acute URTIs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (DK, GS) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. All data were analysed using Cochrane Review Manager software.

Main Results

Three RCTs (618 participants) were included. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, there was limited evidence of benefit with nasal saline irrigation in adults. One study showed a mean difference of 0.3 day (out of eight days) for symptom resolution, but this was not significant. Nasal saline irrigation was associated with less time off work in one study. Minor discomfort was not uncommon and 40% of babies did not tolerate nasal saline drops.

Authors' Conclusions

Included trials were too small and had too high a risk of bias to be confident about the possible benefits of nasal saline irrigation in acute URTIs. Future trials should involve much larger numbers of participants and be rigorously designed and controlled.

### Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^98393ab6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Many health practitioners recommend non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines as a first-line treatment for cough, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral over-the-counter cough preparations for acute cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the UK Department of Health National Research Register and reference lists of articles. We wrote to study investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information on further published or unpublished studies. There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes (such as frequency and severity, continuous and categorical data, using different ways of measurement). The second outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators screened potentially relevant citations independently. Any differences at any stage of the review were resolved by discussion. We also extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. We contacted investigators for additional information and performed quantitative analysis when appropriate data were available.

Main Results

Twenty two trials (16 on adults, eight in children) involving 4199 people (3716 adults and 483 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS 1. Antitussives Five trials compared antitussives with placebo. Codeine was no more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms. One study favoured dextromethorphan over placebo, whereas a second did not show an effect. Moguisteine was no more effective than placebo apart from a reduction of cough in a subgroup of participants with more severe night cough. 2. Expectorants Two trials compared guaifenesin with placebo. In the larger study, 75 per cent of participants taking guaifenesin stated that the medicine was helpful compared to 31 per cent in the control group (p less than 0.01). In the second study, both groups showed improvement with respect to cough frequency and severity, with no statistically significant differences between groups. 3. Mucolytics One trial compared a mucolytic with placebo. Active treatment reduced cough frequency and symptom scores on day four and eight. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations Two studies compared antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo. Antihistamine-decongestant were significantly more effective than placebo (p less than 0.01). 5. Other drug combinations Three studies compared combinations of drugs other than antihistamine-decongestant with placebo. Two studies were effective in reducing cough symptoms, and one study showed relief at night but not during the day. 6. Antihistamines Three trials compared antihistamines with placebo. Antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN 1. Antitussives Antitussives were no more effective than placebo (one study) 2. Expectorants No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. 3. Mucolytics The results of one trial favoured active treatment over placebo from day four until day 10 (p < 0.01) 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations Two studies showed no difference between anthistamine-decongestant combinations and placebo. 5. Other drug combinations One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups. Compared to placebo, both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46 per cent and 56 per cent of children compared to 21 per cent of children in the placebo group. 6. Antihistamines In one trial that tested antihistamines active treatment was no more effective than placebo.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes between studies. The numbers of studies in each group were small, and studies often showed conflicting results. Effect sizes in many studies were unclear and it is questionable as to whether all of the positive results are clinically relevant.

The combination of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and malaise is the symptomatic profile that constitutes an uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection (URI), also known as the common cold. Because no known cure exists for a URI, numerous products are available, each marketed with the promise of alleviating the associated symptoms and/or shortening the duration of illness. The evidence supporting these claims is variable and is the focus of this article, with an emphasis on complementary and integrative therapies.

### Advances in the pathogenesis and personalised treatment of paediatric asthma [^6112f5b9]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Management of non-allergic wheeze associated with infection

About 75% of preschool age children with wheeze have non-allergic wheeze associated with infection that does not respond to ICS. Recurrent wheezing in preschool children with non-allergic wheeze is most commonly triggered by viral upper respiratory infections, with many children being completely well between episodes. Parents of these children are often therefore reluctant to use daily preventive treatment, which in any case is unlikely to be effective.

Unbiased assessment of lower airway inflammation in preschool children with wheeze has shown a cluster who have predominant neutrophilia, are steroid refractory, and are distinct from those with aeroallergen sensitisation. They also have lower airway viral infection (predominantly rhinovirus) and bacterial infection associated with neutrophilia, even when they are clinically stable. This group might benefit from a prolonged course (2–6 weeks) of targeted antibiotics. The antibiotic azithromycin also has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.

The Early Administration of Azithromycin and Prevention of Severe Lower Respiratory Tract Illnesses (APRIL) trial (n = 607) showed a significant reduction in number of upper respiratory infections that progressed to acute wheeze with the early use of azithromycin compared with placebo. However, time to next episode was unaffected and bacterial macrolide resistance was concerning. A second trial (n = 72) in children aged 1–3 years showed a significant shortening of acute episodes, especially with early initiation of treatment. However, a third trial (n = 300) that assessed the usefulness of azithromycin on presentation to the emergency department with an acute wheeze attack showed no benefit of azithromycin over placebo. All these studies, however, relied only on clinical phenotyping, so whether a particular cluster would benefit cannot be determined. The evidence suggests that early azithromycin might prevent progression to a severe attack, but clinical benefits must be balanced against concerns for antimicrobial resistance.

### Association between antibiotic prescriptions for acute upper respiratory infections and pneumonia among older adults: a nationwide cohort study [^3d0cbedf]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering that viral pathogens primarily cause acute URIs, antibiotics are generally ineffective, and their overuse can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Governmental efforts to manage resistance, such as Antimicrobial Stewardship campaigns and assessments of antibiotic prescribing appropriateness, have led to a decline in antibiotic prescribing rates. Nonetheless, antibiotics are still prescribed for acute URIs, often to prevent potential clinical deterioration.

Unlike studies involving younger populations, relatively few investigations have evaluated the association between antibiotic prescriptions and specific clinical outcomes in older adults. A systematic review of patients with sore throats reported reductions in symptoms and suppurative complications among those prescribed antibiotics, although the sample size was limited. Conversely, other studies have suggested that antibiotic use may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and higher incidence rates among patients frequently prescribed antibiotics. One study reported that the odds of pneumonia were 1.26 times higher in those who received antibiotics. In our study of older adults with acute URIs, antibiotic prescription was independently associated with higher odds of pneumonia diagnosis (OR = 1.30).

Our results differed from a retrospective cohort study of primary care patients in the United Kingdom, which investigated the relationship of the incidence of pneumonia and serious infectious diseases with antibiotic prescription, including conditions such as otitis media, lower respiratory tract infections, and URIs. Although pneumonia incidence in patients aged ≥ 65 years prescribed antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections was relatively low 1 month later (1.5% vs. 4.0%), our study observed a higher rate of pneumonia diagnosis in patients with acute URIs who received antibiotics (8.1% vs. 6.6%). This discordance may be due to differences in the inclusion criteria; that is, URIs versus lower respiratory tract infections.

COPD is a significant risk factor for pneumonia, with patients having a 2.18-fold increased risk compared to those without COPD. Heart failure is also an independent risk factor, with a 4.11 times higher pneumonia risk. Cancer was associated with a 2.18 times higher risk of combined pneumonia compared to individuals without cancer. Similarly, we found that comorbidities such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, COPD, diabetes, and cancer were associated with higher odds of pneumonia diagnosis in patients with acute URIs. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for underlying chronic conditions when assessing antibiotic use in this population and support the need for more cautious prescribing practices in older adults, who often present with multiple comorbidities.
