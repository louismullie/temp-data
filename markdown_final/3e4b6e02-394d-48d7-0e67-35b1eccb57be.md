## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statements about the GDP deflator are true: whether it is used to calculate inflation, whether it is an alternative to the CPI, and whether it is more accurate than the CPI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definitions and what each index measures. Then, I should verify how inflation is typically computed and whether the GDP deflator is used for that purpose. Next, I will compare the GDP deflator and CPI conceptually to see if one is an alternative to the other. Finally, I need to assess the claim about accuracy and whether one is inherently "more accurate" than the other, given their different scopes and purposes.

> Let me first confirm the basics. The GDP deflator is a price index that reflects the prices of all goods and services produced domestically, whereas the Consumer Price Index reflects the prices of a fixed basket of goods and services purchased by consumers; these are different constructs measuring different things, so I should be careful not to conflate them.

> Now, I will examine Statement I: "is used to calculate inflation rates". Wait, let me verify the standard practice. In macroeconomics, inflation is commonly measured as the percentage change in a price index; both the GDP deflator and the CPI can be used to compute inflation, so the GDP deflator is indeed used to calculate inflation, albeit it yields a different inflation concept than CPI-based inflation. So Statement I is true.

> Next, Statement II: "is an alternative to the CPI". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Because the GDP deflator and CPI measure different baskets and different scopes of economic activity, analysts often treat the GDP deflator as an alternative inflation metric when the question is about economy-wide price changes rather than consumer-facing price changes; thus, in practice, the GDP deflator functions as an alternative to the CPI for inflation measurement, even though they are not interchangeable for all purposes. So Statement II is also true.

> Statement III claims the GDP deflator is "more accurate" than the CPI. Hmm, wait a minute — accuracy depends on what you are trying to measure. The GDP deflator is broader and includes investment, government, and net exports, and it uses a changing basket that reflects current production patterns, which can be advantageous for some analyses; the CPI, by contrast, uses a fixed basket and focuses on consumer prices, which is better for cost-of-living adjustments. Neither is universally "more accurate"; they are accurate for their respective purposes, so calling the GDP deflator "more accurate" is misleading and overgeneralized. I should double-check that I'm not overstating this, but yes, the correct conclusion is that Statement III is false.

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final tally. Statements I and II are true, and Statement III is false, which corresponds to Option B. I initially wondered if III might be true because the GDP deflator's broader coverage could seem "better", but that would conflate scope with accuracy; after reconsidering, the answer is B.

The GDP deflator is used to calculate inflation rates and is an alternative to the CPI, but it is **not inherently more accurate** than the CPI. The GDP deflator covers all domestically produced goods and services, while the CPI covers only consumer goods and services, so each is more accurate for its specific purpose. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. I and II are true**.

---

## Statement I: the GDP deflator is used to calculate inflation rates

The GDP deflator is a **price index** that measures the average change in prices of all goods and services produced domestically. It is calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, multiplied by 100. By comparing the GDP deflator across different time periods, economists can determine the rate of inflation or deflation in the economy. Thus, this statement is **true**.

---

## Statement II: the GDP deflator is an alternative to the CPI

The CPI measures the average change in prices of a fixed basket of consumer goods and services, whereas the GDP deflator measures price changes for all domestically produced goods and services. Because both indices measure price changes, the GDP deflator is often used as an **alternative to the CPI** for calculating inflation, especially when analyzing economy-wide price changes rather than consumer-specific price changes. Thus, this statement is **true**.

---

## Statement III: the GDP deflator is more accurate than the CPI

Accuracy depends on the specific context and purpose of measurement. The GDP deflator is **more comprehensive** than the CPI because it includes all domestically produced goods and services, including investment goods, government purchases, and net exports. However, the CPI is more accurate for measuring changes in the cost of living for consumers because it focuses specifically on consumer goods and services and accounts for substitution effects. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the GDP deflator is inherently more accurate than the CPI; each index is more accurate for its specific purpose. Thus, this statement is **false**.

---

## Conclusion

The GDP deflator is used to calculate inflation rates and is an alternative to the CPI, but it is **not inherently more accurate** than the CPI. The correct answer is **B. I and II are true**.

### Increased plasma concentrations of lipoprotein (a) during a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet are associated with increased plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein C-III bound to apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins [^2e96f538]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Low-fat, high-carbohydrate (LFHC) diets have been shown to increase plasma concentrations of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and of triacylglycerol- rich lipoproteins (TRLs).

Objective

We tested whether increases in plasma Lp(a) induced by an LFHC diet are related to changes in TRLs.

Design

Healthy men (study 1; n = 140) consumed for 4 wk each a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet (HFLC; 40% fat, 45% carbohydrate) and an LFHC diet (20% fat, 65% carbohydrate). Plasma lipids; lipoproteins; apolipoprotein (apo) B, A-I, and C-III; and Lp(a) were measured at the end of each diet. In a second group of men following a similar dietary protocol (study 2; n = 33), we isolated apo(a)-containing particles by immunoaffinity chromatography and determined the concentrations of apo C-III in ultracentrifugally isolated subfractions of apo B-containing lipoproteins.

Results

In study 1, plasma concentrations of Lp(a) (P < 0.001), triacylglycerol (P < 0.001), apo B (P < 0.005), apo C-III (P < 0.005), and apo C-III in apo B-containing lipoproteins (non-HDL apo C-III) (P < 0.001) were significantly higher with the LFHC diet than with the HFLC diet. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that the association of changes in Lp(a) with changes in non-HDL apo C-III was independent of changes in body mass index, apo B, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein changes were similar in study 2, and we found that both total apo C-III and the apo C-III content of apo(a)-containing particles were increased in a TRL fraction consisting predominantly of large VLDL particles [TRL-apo(a)].

Conclusions

The increase in plasma Lp(a) with an LFHC diet is significantly associated with an increase in non-HDL apo C-III. Enrichment of TRL-apo(a) with apo C-III may contribute to this dietary effect on Lp(a) concentrations.

### Phase III evaluation of treatment combinations in three-arm trials [^4a063eb6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Phase III trials that randomly assign patients to a control treatment (C), an experimental treatment (A), or a combination treatment (AB) should be designed with the goal to recommend the best treatment: AB (if it is better than A and C), A (if it is better than C, and AB is not better than A), or C (if neither AB nor A is better than C). However, this goal can be challenging to achieve with statistical confidence. We performed a survey of cancer trials published in five journals from January 2018 to May 2024 to assess the trial designs being used in this setting and found that three quarters of them did not have a provision for a formal comparison of the AB treatment arm with the A treatment arm, a possible shortcoming. A limited simulation evaluates two analysis strategies that incorporate an AB versus A comparison and is used to formulate some recommendations for designing these types of trials.

III. Clearance Calculations:

Aliquots (1 mL each) of plasma and urine from each collection period
are counted in a standard gamma-ray scintillation well detector.
All counts are corrected for background activity.
Glomerular filtration rate is calculated by the formula C = UV/P, in which:

 C = glomerular filtration rate in mL/min

 U = urinary concentration of radioactivity in net counts/min/mL

 V = urinary flow rate in mL/min

 P = plasma concentration of radioactivity in net counts/min/mL
Average glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is calculated from the rates
for the individual collection periods. GFR can be expressed in terms of body
weight (mL/min/kg) or body surface area (mL/min/m2).
Unilateral glomerular filtration rates can be determined by the same
technique by utilizing ureteral catheterization.

### Diagnosis, management, and treatment of female genital mutilation or cutting in girls [^f1e8bbe8]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) types and classification: The WHO has classified FGM/C into four distinct types, with type III associated with the most significant long-term morbidity. To better delineate findings, the WHO has also included subtypes of FGM/C, categorized as Ia and Ib, IIa–IIc, and IIIa and IIIb. Type I FGM/C is classified as cutting of the glans or part of the body of the clitoris and/or prepuce; type II includes excision of the clitoris and labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora; type III, infibulation, includes cutting and apposing the labia minora and/or majora over the urethral meatus and vaginal opening to significantly narrow it and may include clitoral excision; and type IV includes piercing, scraping, nicking, stretching, or otherwise injuring the external female genitalia without removing any genital tissue and includes practices that do not fall into the other three categories. Prevalence of FGM/C subtypes is mainly influenced by ethnicity and region, and surveys of girls and women older than 15 years reveal that approximately 10% of cases are FGM/C type III, or infibulation.

### Prevalence of comorbid factors in patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in ECOSPOR III, a randomized trial of an oral microbiota-based therapeutic [^fa7f6efd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The study ECOSPOR III (post-hoc analysis) was published by Charles S Berenson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Clostridioides difficile infection. In the ECOSPOR III (post-hoc analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of an oral microbiota-based therapeutic in patients with comorbidities and other risk factors for recurrent C. difficile infection? In the ECOSPOR III (post-hoc analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ECOSPOR III (post-hoc analysis) study, the population was: 182 patients (109 female, 73 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with recurrent C. difficile infection. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; toxic megacolon and/or small bowel ileus; admitted to or expected to be admitted to an ICU for medical reasons; major gastrointestinal surgery; active IBD. In the ECOSPOR III (post-hoc analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 89 VOS (4 oral capsules of VOWST oral spores once daily over 3 consecutive days) n = 93 placebo (4 oral placebo capsules once daily over 3 consecutive days). In the ECOSPOR III (post-hoc analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients with Charlson comorbidity index score ≥ 5 (20% vs. 45.7%; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.93). In the ECOSPOR III (post-hoc analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients with baseline CrCl > 80 mL/min (4.7% vs. 32.6%; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.59) Significant decrease in recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients with prior C. difficile infection episodes ≥ 4 (17.9% vs. 46.9%; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82) Significant decrease in recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients with acid-suppressing medication use at baseline (9.1% vs. 48.8%; RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.57). In the ECOSPOR III (post-hoc analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with recurrent C. difficile infection, VOS was superior to placebo with respect to recurrence of C. difficile infection in patients with Charlson comorbidity index score ≥ 5.

### A principle-based framework to determine countries' fair warming contributions to the paris agreement [^d1e8a131]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our first interpretation (Interpretation I) relies on equality and the polluter-pays principle. Here we consider all living persons having an equal right to pollute, but inheriting country-based historic emissions extending back to two distinct starting years, 1850, and 1990. 1850 is chose as a common proxy year for the beginning of the industrial revolution and from which good data is available. Yet, some people may argue that society was unaware of the connection between CO 2 emissions and warming at that time, and ignorance may mitigate moral duties in some ethical frameworks. We therefore include 1990 as an alternative starting year. This is the publication year of the first assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), marking a clear global consensus on the impact of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. We determine the remaining warming from this start year to our target temperature, be it 1.5 °C or 2 °C, allocate this to individual countries, and subtract from this allocation countries' respective historic contributions to warming until 2021, thereby determining the remaining budget to net zero with due consideration of our interpretation of CBDR&RC.

Our second interpretation (Interpretation II) expands our first interpretation with consideration of the ability-to-pay principle, placing weight on different national circumstances. Ability to pay for mitigation is modelled as a function of the government bond yield (a proxy for government capacity to invest) (Interpretation II-A) and GDP per capita (Interpretation II-B). These indicators are used to scale the per-capita distribution of our first interpretation (Fig. 1).

Our third interpretation (Interpretation III) replaces the ability-to-pay with the beneficiary-pays principle, placing emphasis on the unequitable benefits that nations derived from their past emissions. We use total historical fossil fuel sales in present dollars attributable to the population in each country from the year 1900 to 2021 as a proxy indicator to reflect benefits, beyond historical contributions to warming. Also here, we scale the per-capita allocations from our first interpretation with this indicator before proceeding with the subtraction of historical contributions.

### Treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^3a1797a8]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Stage III non-small cell lung cancer — platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (stages I-III) showed benefit over surgery alone (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.97; P = 0.022), corresponding to an absolute benefit of 6% to 7% in stages IB to IIIA and 3% to 5% in IIIB. When European intergroup trial data were added, significance was lost (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–1.01; P = 0.07), and restricting to stage III yielded an HR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.51–1.07; P = 0.1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that surgery as the primary therapy for preoperatively identified N2 involvement is inferior to approaches involving neoadjuvant treatment.

### Apolipoprotein C-III and the metabolic basis for hypertriglyceridemia and the dense low-density lipoprotein phenotype [^e1150fca]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Here, we aim to identify defects of apolipoprotein (apo) B lipoprotein metabolism that characterize hypertriglyceridemia, focusing on apoC-III and apoE.

Methods and Results

We studied the transport of plasma apoB within 21 distinct subfractions as separated by anti-apoC-III and anti-apoE immunoaffinity chromatography and ultracentrifugation in 9 patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia and 12 normotriglyceridemic control subjects. Hypertriglyceridemia was characterized by a 3-fold higher liver secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) that had apoC-III but not apoE and a 50% lower secretion of VLDL with both apoC-III and apoE (both P < 0.05). This shift in VLDL secretion pattern from apoE to apoC-III resulted in significantly reduced clearance of light VLDL (-39%; P < 0.05), compatible with the antagonizing effects of apoC-III on apoE-induced clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In addition, rate constants for clearance were reduced for apoE-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in hypertriglyceridemia, associated with increased apoC-III contents of these particles. LDL distribution shifted from light and medium LDL to dense LDL in hypertriglyceridemia through a quartet of kinetic perturbations: increased flux from apoC-III-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, a shift in liver LDL secretion pattern from light to dense LDL, an increased conversion rate from light and medium LDL to dense LDL, and retarded catabolism of dense LDL.

Conclusions

These results support a central role for apoC-III in metabolic defects leading to hypertriglyceridemia. Triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism shifts from an apoE-dominated system in normotriglyceridemic participants characterized by rapid clearance from circulation of VLDL to an apoC-III-dominated system in hypertriglyceridemic patients characterized by reduced clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and the formation of the dense LDL phenotype.

### Meta-reinforcement learning via orbitofrontal cortex [^5e6956df]. Nature Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

Before training mice in the probabilistic reversal learning task, we trained mice in three different pretraining tasks (pretask I: 2–3 d, pretask II: 2–5 d and pretask III: ~2 weeks). In the pretask I, all the choices mice made during the answer period were rewarded with 100% probability. Licking during the ready period was not punished in this pretraining phase, and the mean ITI was gradually increased from 1 to 6 s (± 1 s jitter in the duration of every trial). Mice learn that they can collect rewards by licking lickports during the answer period in the pretask I. In the pretask II, reward was delivered alternately from left and right lickports following either choice during the answer period. From this pretask II, licking during the ready period was punished by 500 ms white noise alarm sound and trial abort with an extra 2 s ITI. Mice learn that they can collect rewards from either lickport and need to withhold licking during the ready period in the pretask II. In the pretask III, a choice was rewarded only when the choice was opposite to the choice in the immediately preceding trial. Mice were encouraged to choose from both lickports in this pretask III. Training in the pretask III was terminated when their correct choice rates reached 70%. Through these three pretraining tasks, mice learned the general task structure, including that only their first lick during the answer period is associated with outcome, rewards are available from both lickports and, they need to withhold licking during the ready period.

### Endpoints used in phase III randomized controlled trials of treatment options for COVID-19 [^33408a79]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies to identify potential drugs effective in treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently ongoing at a rapid pace, although no drug has yet shown improved mortality outcomes in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Whether the ongoing RCTs are using endpoints that matter remains unknown. Here we provide a summary of the endpoints used in the actively recruiting phase III RCTs for the treatment of COVID-19.

We extracted clinical trial information, including the primary endpoint, on treatment trials for SARS-CoV-2 fromusing the search keyword "COVID-19″ or "SARS-CoV-2″. We excluded clinical trials which were not listed as Phase III/Clinical, not randomized and not actively recruiting as of April 23rd, 2020. We focused primarily on the use of endpoints only for the phase III RCTs. Phase I and II trials and their endpoints inform phase III trial design, while phase III trials change practice. Hence it is important to assess the nature of endpoints being used in these trials. Furthermore, mortality outcomes are best assessed in phase III RCTs. We also excluded trials studying prophylaxis or treatment in the outpatient setting.

Forty-nine phase III RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The most common endpoint used was ordinal scales in 42.9% (21/49) which could be a 6-point, 7-point or 8-point scale. For example, a commonly used 7-point ordinal scale was: 1. Death 2. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation 3. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen 4. Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen 5. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise) 6. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer required ongoing medical care 7. Not hospitalized.

Other endpoints include viral clearance (6.1%, 3/49) and clinical remission or stability (4.0%, 2/49). Only 2.0% (3/49) of trials had overall or all-cause mortality as primary endpoint. Only 57.1% (28/49) of trials were placebo controlled (Table 1).

### Phase II study of fosaprepitant + 5HT3 receptor antagonist + dexamethasone in patients with germ cell tumors undergoing 5-day cisplatin-based chemotherapy: a hoosier cancer research network study [^3edaf65a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

A phase III study adding aprepitant to a 5HT3 receptor antagonist (5HT3-RA) plus dexamethasone in germ cell tumor (GCT) patients treated with 5-day cisplatin combination chemotherapy demonstrated a significant improvement in complete response (CR) (J Clin Onc 30:3998–4003, 2012). Fosaprepitant has demonstrated non-inferiority compared to aprepitant in single-day cisplatin chemotherapy and is approved as a single-dose alternative. This single-arm phase II study is the first clinical trial evaluating fosaprepitant in patients receiving multi-day cisplatin regimen.

Methods

GCT patients receiving a 5-day cisplatin combination chemotherapy were enrolled. Fosaprepitant 150 mg was given IV on days 3 and 5. A 5HT3-RA days 1–5 (days 1, 3, and 5, if palonosetron) plus dexamethasone 20 mg days 1 and 2 and 4 mg po bid days 6, 7, and 8 was administered. Rescue antiemetics were allowed. The primary objective was to determine the CR rate-no emetic episodes or use of rescue medications. Accrual of 64 patients was planned with expected CR > 27%.

Results

Sixty-five patients were enrolled of whom 54 were eligible for analysis. Median age was 33. Fifty-one patients received bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) chemotherapy. CR was observed in 13 (24.1%) patients (95% Agresti-Coull binomial C. I. 14.5%, 37.1%).

Conclusion

The data in this phase II study, in contrast to our prior phase III study, appears to indicate a lower CR rate with the substitution of fosaprepitant for aprepitant. It is unknown whether the substitution of fosaprepitant for aprepitant provides the same benefit in multi-day cisplatin that was achieved with single-day cisplatin. Trial registration Clinical trial information NCT01736917.

### Structural basis for caactivation of the heteromeric PKD1L3 / PKD2L1 channel [^c3cbcb13]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Scrutiny of the maps of the apo and Ca 2+ -loaded complexes reveals an unconventional Ca 2+ -binding site in the VSD of PKD2L1-III only. A spherical density is found in the extracellular cleft of VSD III only in the Ca 2+ -loaded complex, but missing in other VSDs or in any of the VSDs in the apo complex (Fig. 4a, left and Supplementary Fig. 7a). Therefore, a Ca 2+ ion was assigned to this density in the pocket formed by S1 III, S2 III, and S3 III (Fig. 4a). The Ca 2+ is predominately coordinated by carboxylate of Glu356. The neighboring hydroxyl groups of Tyr344 and Tyr438 and C = O of Leu117 also contribute to ion coordination (Fig. 4a).

The different local conformations among the three VSDs of PKD2L1 provide a plausible explanation for the lack of Ca 2+ ion in VSD I and VSD II. In VSD III, which is adjacent to the PMD and PD of PKD1L3, Arg343 reaches out to interact with Ser1761 and Asn313 at PMD PKD1L3 and PMD III, respectively. However, Arg343 points into the interior of VSD I and VSD II likely owing to repulsion from His213 in the neighboring PKD2L1 subunit. The positively charged Arg343 thus impedes Ca 2+ binding (Fig. 4a).

The unconventional site in VSD III may be responsible for Ca 2+ activation

To investigate the functional significance of this VSD III -unique Ca 2+ -binding site, we carefully analyzed the relatively minor conformational changes of the complex upon Ca 2+ loading and performed structure-guided mutagenic characterizations accordingly.

Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) analysis of the apo and Ca 2+ -loaded structures shows that the VSD III exhibits a larger degree of conformational changes than the other three VSDs (Fig. 4b). In the presence of Ca 2+, VSD III undergoes a downward and lateral motion that pushes S4–S5 III toward S5 and S6 of PKD1L3 (PD 1L3) (Fig. 4c). This motion, although does not directly lead to the opening of the gate in the solved structure, suggests that conformational changes on the extracellular side of VSD III can be transmitted to the intracellular gate of the PD, thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for Ca 2+ -induced channel activation.

### Effect of protein, unsaturated fat, and carbohydrate intakes on plasma apolipoprotein B and VLDL and LDL containing apolipoprotein C-III: results from the omniHeart trial [^21ab0a09]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Plasma apolipoprotein B (apo B) and VLDL and LDL with apolipoprotein C-III (apo C-III) are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Dietary intake affects lipoprotein concentration and composition related to those apolipoproteins.

Objective

We studied differences in apo B lipoproteins with and without apo C-III after 3 healthy diets based on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial diet.

Design

Healthy participants (n = 162) were fed each of 3 healthy diets for 6 wk in a crossover design. Diets differed by emphasis of either carbohydrate (Carb), unsaturated fat (Unsat), or protein (Prot). Blood was collected at baseline and after diets for analysis.

Results

Compared with the Carb diet, the Prot diet reduced plasma apo B and triglycerides in VLDL with apo C-III (16%, P = 0.07; 11%, P = 0.05, respectively) and apo B in LDL with apo C-III (16%, P = 0.04). Compared with the Unsat diet, the Prot diet reduced triglycerides in VLDL with apo C-III (16%, P = 0.02). Compared with baseline (subjects' usual diet was higher in saturated fat), the Prot diet reduced apo B in LDL with apo C-III (11%, P = 0.05), and all 3 diets reduced plasma total apo B (6–10%, P < 0.05) and apo B in the major type of LDL, LDL without apo C-III (8–10%, P < 0.01). All 3 diets reduced the ratio of apo C-III to apo E in VLDL.

Conclusions

Substituting protein for carbohydrate in the context of a healthy dietary pattern reduced atherogenic apo C-III-containing LDL and its precursor, apo C-III-containing VLDL, resulting in the most favorable profile of apo B lipoproteins. In addition, compared with a typical high-saturated fat diet, healthy diets that emphasize carbohydrate, protein, or unsaturated fat reduce plasma total and LDL apo B and produce a lower more metabolically favorable ratio of apo C-III to apo E.

### CIRSE standards of practice on management of endoleaks following endovascular aneurysm repair [^699bcafe]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Type III Endoleak

Definition

Type III ELs arise from a structural defect of the stent graft, either secondary to a modular disconnection of its components (IIIA), a fabric tear (IIIB) or a junctional separation of fenestrated or branched stent grafts (IIIC). It may occur due to inadequate overlap of stent graft components, device migration or material fatigue.

Type III EL is relatively uncommon with a reported incidence of 0.7–4.5%. First- and second-generation stent grafts are associated with a significantly higher incidence of type III EL when compared with more recent third generation devices, 12.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Most fabric failures have been found to be associated with specific graft materials and designs, which have subsequently been modified or withdrawn from the market. A recent example is the earlier generation of the AFX device (Endologix, USA) that was withdrawn in 2016 after unacceptable rates of type III EL were reported and the US Food and Drug Administration intervened.

The reported incidence of type III EL in fenestrated or branched EVAR is more variable. A higher degree of device modularity and procedural complexity does not appear to increase the incidence of type III EL as demonstrated in a large multicentre retrospective cohort study of over 4,000 cases. Type III EL remained relatively uncommon at 4% and the majority were primary ELs identified around the time of the index procedure. This contrasts with the findings of single-centre series of complex EVAR where type III EL was seen in as many as 12% of patients, the majority of which were secondary EL, and type III EL was identified as the most frequent indication for re-intervention. Fenestrated EVAR (F-EVAR) with large diameter devices (34–36 mm) appear to have an increased risk of type III EL and the need for re-intervention.

Indication for Treatment

Type III EL leads to increased pressure within the aneurysm sac and are associated with a risk of aneurysm rupture. They therefore warrant prompt treatment once detected.

### WHO-led consensus statement on vaccine delivery costing: process, methods, and findings [^65eea7d3]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The recommended costing principles include the following.
Definitions of terms used in studies of vaccine delivery costing should conform closely to the recommended definitions in this Consensus Statement.
The study scope in terms of its purpose, audience, target population, time horizon, and service/output should be clearly stated. It should also state whether data collection will be prospective or retrospective, and whether the analysis will be retrospective or a cost projection.
The perspective of the cost estimation should be stated and justified.
Types of costs to be generated should be clearly defined in terms of start-up/introduction or non-start-up/introduction (sometimes called operating costs), recurrent and capital, undepreciated financial, financial or economic, and incremental or full. Capital costs should be appropriately annualized and depreciated for financial and economic costs and the discount rate justified.
The scope of the inputs to be estimated should be defined, justified, and if needed referenced. For example, do the costs include national and sub-national costs or only facility-level service delivery costs? Are non-immunization costs included?
The "units" in the unit costs for strategies, services, and interventions should be defined, e.g. cost per dose administered.
If incremental costing is conducted, any assumptions made regarding existing health system capacity should be described (see GHCC reference case, pg. 64).
The selection of the data sources, including any adjustments to price data (e.g. inflation or currency conversion) should be described and referenced.
The methods for estimating the quantity of inputs should be described — whether top-down or bottom-up, methods of allocation, use of shadow prices and the opportunity cost of time, and methods for excluding research and evaluation costs.
Costs should be mapped and reported as either inputs or activities: i. Resource inputs include, for example, personnel time, vaccines, injection and safety supplies, vehicles, fuel, per diem and travel allowances, cold chain equipment, stationery, laboratory equipment, and buildings; ii. Program activities include, for example, vaccine procurement, service delivery, training, micro-planning, social mobilization, and advocacy and communication, monitoring and evaluation, surveillance, adverse event following immunization monitoring, and supervision.
Some boundaries around costs included in the analysis may be employed to keep the costing scope feasible and will depend on the purpose of the costing study, with the rationale for any exclusions provided; use discretion about including one-time costs that are unique or unlikely to be replicated or transferable across settings (for example, new vaccine launches with the President). Clarify definition and threshold for including or excluding small costs that have expected small contribution (e.g. < $25) to total costs in aggregate across all sampled units, such as the use of existing office supplies by health facility staff.
The sampling strategy employed should aim for internal and external validity of the data 3. Sampling strategy should be stated, described, and justified, depending on the workstream and costing objectives. Sampling of different service delivery units is desirable as it provides a more representative picture of costs and highlights cost variation and cost drivers for a strategy or vaccine.
Variation in the cost of the intervention by site/organization, sub-population, or by other drivers of heterogeneity should be explored and reported for retrospective analyses when possible.
The uncertainty around the cost estimates should be appropriately characterized when feasible, (e.g. sensitivity analyses; ranges of results for different input parameter scenarios for cost projections; mean and standard deviation for non-representative samples with multiple units; and confidence intervals or credible intervals for retrospective analyses).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria: "stopping rules" 4 should be defined, explaining which costs are included and the respective rationale.
Cost estimates should be communicated clearly and transparently to enable decision-makers to interpret and use the results relevant to the original policy and/or programmatic question.

### The impact of changing diagnostic criteria in posttraumatic stress disorder in a Canadian epidemiologic sample [^f38d15fa]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Since its inclusion in DSM-III, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has undergone a number of changes in its diagnostic criteria, including the expansion of Criterion A (traumatic stressor), the addition of symptom duration (none specified in DSM-III), and the requirement for impairment or distress (Criterion F, DSM-IV only).

Method

This study examined the impact of changes in PTSD diagnostic criteria using a Canadian PTSD epidemiologic sample. The rates of PTSD and its correlates were evaluated in a nationally representative random sample of 3,006 adults. DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and ICD-10 criteria were employed. DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and ICD-10 rates were re-evaluated, substituting specific DSM-IV criteria (A-F).

Results

The prevalence rates of lifetime PTSD ranged from 13.4% (DSM-III) to 13.0% (ICD-10) to 12.2% (DSM-III-R) to 9.2% (DSM-IV); all rates differed significantly from each other (P < .001). Regardless of diagnostic criteria, most people reported more than 1-year duration of symptoms, although rates were significantly higher in those with DSM-IV PTSD (68.2%, P < .0001). Rates of comorbid major depressive disorder and alcohol and substance abuse and dependence were also significantly higher (P < .05) using the DSM-IV PTSD criteria, and those with DSM-IV PTSD reported significantly higher rates of help-seeking (P < .001). When Criterion F was added to earlier versions, lifetime PTSD rates became much closer to those obtained using DSM-IV criteria: 10.6% (DSM-III), 10.2% (DSM-III-R), and 9.9% (ICD-10); however, rates fluctuated when operational definitions of Criterion F were modified. DSM-III PTSD was also substantially affected by DSM-IV Criteria A and C.

Conclusions

DSM-IV PTSD may identify a more severe disorder. The addition of the clinical significance criterion (F) appeared to affect the greatest change in prevalence rates. Defining Criterion F as having both clinically significant psychological distress and functional impairment lowered the diagnostic threshold to a greater degree than did either distress or impairment alone. This information may be useful for future revisions of PTSD diagnostic criteria.

### Deconvolution of subcellular protrusion heterogeneity and the underlying actin regulator dynamics from live cell imaging [^08e9477e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We observed CyD treatment tended to reduce the overall protrusion velocities. Therefore, we visualized the data distributions using t-SNE with denoised protrusion velocities instead of ACFs to further investigate the effects of CyD on Cluster III in terms of regulation of protrusion velocity. This t-SNE analysis revealed high-density regions of the subcellular protrusion velocities which are highly susceptible to the CyD and CK666 treatment (the dotted circles in Fig. 7a, b). Overlaying the cluster assignments in these t-SNE plots showed that Cluster III contained a substantial portion of the CyD and CK666-susceptible regions (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Notably, the t-SNE plots of Cluster III of the control cells (Supplementary Fig. 9b) suggest that Cluster III can be largely grouped into two, which may have differential susceptibilities to CyD and CK666. Therefore, we further divided Cluster III into two sub-clusters (Fig. 7c, d) based on denoised protrusion velocities pooled from CyD and CK666 data sets by a community detection algorithm(Supplementary Fig. 9c–e). While both Cluster III-1 and III-2 (Fig. 7g, h) maintained similar temporal patterns, Cluster III-2 had substantially stronger accelerating activities compared to Cluster III-1 (Fig. 7g, DMSO (Cluster III-1)/DMSO (Cluster III-2) and Fig. 7h, CK689 (Cluster III-1)/CK689 (Cluster III-2)). Intriguingly, the t-SNE plots revealed that "strongly accelerating protrusion" (Cluster III-2) was preferentially affected by the CyD (Fig. 7c) and CK666 (Fig. 7d) treatment. The quantification of the proportion of these sub-clusters (Fig. 7e, f) confirmed that strongly accelerating protrusion (Cluster III-2) was significantly reduced by the CyD treatment in comparison to DMSO treatment in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.024 for 50 nM, < 0.0001 for 100 nM, bootstrap sampling) (Fig. 7e, Cluster III-2), whereas the weakly accelerating protrusion (Cluster III-1) was increased (p = 0.006 for 100 nM, bootstrap sampling) (Fig. 7e, Cluster III-1). Therefore, the average protrusion velocities in Cluster III in CyD treatment were significantly reduced to be comparable to Cluster III-1 in DMSO treatment and was significantly lower than Cluster III-2 (Fig. 7g). Consistently, the proportion of strongly accelerating protrusion (Cluster III-2) was significantly reduced by the CK666 treatment (Fig. 7f, p = 0.0026, bootstrap sampling) and the average velocities of Cluster III in CK666 treatment were also reduced to those of weakly accelerating protrusion (Cluster III-1) in CK689 treatment (Fig. 7h). These data demonstrate HACKS allowed us to successfully identify the drug-susceptible sub-phenotypes, where strongly accelerating protrusion is specifically affected by inhibition of Arp2/3 or VASP.

### Adalimumab [^7d295bd3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis

The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in patients ≥ 18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV).

Study RA-I evaluated 271 patients who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.

Study RA-II evaluated 544 patients who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks.

Study RA-III evaluated 619 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at 52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years.

ASCO stage III NSCLC sequential chemoradiation versus radiation alone — strong recommendation and supporting evidence: Recommendation 5.3 states patients not candidates for concurrent chemoradiation but candidates for chemotherapy "should be offered sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy over radiation alone" (Type: Evidence based; benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). A meta-analysis and systematic review of 13 randomized controlled trials (1,936 patients) showed higher overall survival (pooled HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.84; P < .001) and higher progression-free survival (pooled HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.89; P = 0.002) with chemotherapy plus radiation versus radiation alone. In randomized trials, Dasgupta et al assigned 103 patients to radiation alone (65 Gy in 30 fractions) versus chemotherapy plus radiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions) with additional chemotherapy, and the chemotherapy-containing radiation arm had a decrease in distant metastases (48.6% v 62.5%). Kim et al randomized 101 patients to induction platinum-based chemotherapy followed by radiation versus radiation alone (60–65 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy fractions), with a trend toward improved overall survival (median 13.8 v 8.5 months) and, in stage IIIB nonsquamous, median survival 11.6 months with sequential chemoradiotherapy versus 8 months with radiotherapy alone (P = 0.046).

### 2015 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on optimal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator programming and testing [^7c4adb56]. Europace (2016). Medium credibility.

Duration criteria for ventricular arrhythmia detection — across PREPARE, RELEVANT, MADIT-RIT, ADVANCE III, and PROVIDE, prolonged detection reduced therapies and adverse outcomes without increasing syncope. Programming a prolonged detection duration (30 of 40 beats) was first reported in PREPARE, and in RELEVANT the study group had a significantly reduced intervention burden with an 81% reduction without increasing syncope. In MADIT-RIT, the delayed-therapy strategy used a 60-s delay for rates between 170 and 199 bpm, a 12-s delay at 200–249 bpm, and a 2.5-s delay at 250 bpm (Arm C), and after a mean 1.4-year follow-up this arm achieved a 76% reduction in the primary endpoint of first inappropriate therapy (P < 0.001). ADVANCE III reported that long detection produced a highly significant reduction of overall therapies, inappropriate shocks, and all-cause hospitalizations; with the extended detection duration (30 of 40) not negatively impacting syncopal events and no significant difference in mortality between programming groups. PROVIDE randomized 1670 patients to conventional 12-beat detection in each of 2 zones versus experimental programming requiring 25, 18, and 12–18-beat detection and showed reduced mortality (HR: 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50–0.98; P = 0.036). In ADVANCE III secondary-prevention patients, who comprised 25% of the cohort, long detection reduced overall therapies, driven by a 36% reduction in appropriate shocks. Meta-analyses reported a 30% reduction in the risk of death across six studies and a 50% reduction in inappropriate shock without increased syncope or appropriate shock.

### Association of chemoradiotherapy with outcomes among patients with stage I to II vs stage III small cell lung cancer: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^c23503da]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

There is limited evidence to guide stage I to II small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treatment.

Objective

To examine the characteristics and outcomes among patients with stage I to II SCLC treated with modern chemoradiotherapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this post hoc secondary analysis of the Concurrent Once-Daily vs Twice-Daily Radiotherapy Trial (CONVERT), a multicenter phase 3 trial conducted in patients with limited-stage SCLC from April 7, 2008, to November 29, 2013, patients with TNM stage I to II SCLC were compared with those with stage III disease. Data analysis was performed from November 1, 2017, to February 28, 2018.

Interventions

In CONVERT, patients were randomized to receive twice-daily (45 Gy in 30 fractions) or once-daily (66 Gy in 33 fractions) chemoradiotherapy. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was offered, if indicated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary trial end point was overall survival (OS). TNM staging information was collected prospectively; this was an unplanned analysis because stratification was not performed according to TNM stage.

Results

A total of 509 (277 [54.4%] men; mean [SD] age, 61.5 [8.3] years) of 543 patients (93.7%) with TNM staging information were eligible for this subgroup analysis, and 86 of the 509 (16.9%) had TNM stage I to II disease. The median gross tumor volume was smaller in patients with stage I to II disease (38.4 cm3; range, 2.2–593.0 cm3) compared with patients with stage III disease (93 cm3; range, 0.5–513.4 cm3) (P < .001). No other significant differences were found in baseline and treatment characteristics and chemoradiotherapy adherence between the 2 groups or the number of patients with stage I to II disease (78 [90.7%]) and stage III disease (346 [81.8%]) who received PCI (P = 0.10). Patients with stage I to II disease achieved longer OS (median, 50 months [95% CI, 38 to not reached months] vs 25 months [95% CI, 21–29 months]; hazard ratio, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.44–0.83]; P = 0.001) compared with patients with stage III disease. In patients with stage I to II disease, no significant survival difference was found between the trial arms (median, 39 months in the once-daily arm vs 72 months in the twice-daily arm; P = 0.38). Apart from lower incidence of acute esophagitis in patients with stage I to II disease compared with patients with stage III disease (grade ≥ 3, 9 [11.3%] vs 82 [21.1%]; P < .001), the incidences of acute and late toxic effects were not significantly different.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with stage I to II SCLC in CONVERT achieved long-term survival with acceptable toxic effects after chemoradiotherapy and PCI. This study suggests that patients with stage I to II small cell lung cancer treated with modern chemoradiotherapy have better outcomes compared with patients with stage III disease, providing information that practitioners can potentially give their patients to aid clinical decisions.

### Management of stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: ASCO guideline [^51286d25]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASCO stage III non–small-cell lung cancer — consolidation durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiation: Patients with stage III NSCLC receiving concurrent chemoradiation without disease progression during the initial therapy should be offered consolidation durvalumab for up to 12 months (Type: Evidence based; benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: high; benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: strong). There is insufficient evidence to alter this recommendation for molecularly defined subgroups (namely, patients with an oncogenic driver alteration or those with low or no expression of programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]). In the phase III randomized PACIFIC trial, consolidation durvalumab for 1 year versus placebo in 713 patients after definitive platinum-based chemoradiotherapy improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); patients were randomly assigned within 42 days of completing thoracic radiation. Median PFS was 16.8 months (95% CI, 13.0 to 18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.8) with placebo (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P < .001), and grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% in the durvalumab arm. With a median follow-up of 34.2 months, OS (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89) and PFS (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.68) benefits persisted, with median OS 47.5 months versus 29.1 months, 5-year OS 42.9% versus 33.4%, and 5-year PFS 33.1% versus 19.0%, favoring durvalumab. A post hoc analysis of patients with PD-L1 data (63% of the trial; PD-L1–negative 20%) suggested a lack of benefit in PD-L1–negative tumors (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.62) and in EGFR-mutated patients (6% of the study population, n = 43; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.40 to 2.33), and certain authorities outside of the United States have restricted consolidation durvalumab to PD-L1–positive patients only.

### Design issues in randomized phase II / III trials [^fae62be1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Phase II trials are used to show sufficient preliminary activity of a new treatment (in single-arm designs or randomized screening designs) or to select among treatments with demonstrated activity (in randomized selection designs). The treatments prioritized in a phase II trial are then tested definitively against a control treatment in a randomized phase III trial. Randomized phase II/III trials use an adaptive trial design that combines these two types of trials in one, with potential gains in time and reduced numbers of patients required to be treated. Two key considerations in designing a phase II/III trial are whether to suspend accrual while the phase II data mature and the choice of phase II target treatment effect. We discuss these phase II/III design parameters, give examples of phase II/III trials, and provide recommendations concerning efficient phase II/III trial designs.

### Chromatin remodeling by pol II primes efficient pol III transcription [^bd18a217]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is the largest of the three usual eukaryotic RNA polymerases and is specialized in the synthesis of abundant and mostly short ncRNAs named class III genes, which includes the entire repertoire of cytosolic tRNAs. The increased size of Pol III results from the fact that it contains stable integral subunits that are homologs of transcription factors in the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) system. These "built-in" factors participate in all steps of the transcription cycle and partly explain the lower number of independent actors in the Pol III system. In addition, they also allow efficient recycling of the polymerase at a given locus. At tRNA genes, Pol III initiates transcription at internal promoters and is recruited by TFIIIB, which itself is recruited by TFIIIC bound to A and B DNA boxes. These two elements overlap with distinctive features of the mature tRNAs. Other Pol III promoters show variations on that theme. Maf1 was isolated in yeast as a global repressor of the Pol III machinery and is regulated by several signaling pathways, notably during starvation –.

The idea that Pol III is a constitutive polymerase has been challenged by the finding that the relative abundance of tRNA vary across tissues, in response to stressesand in pathologies. In fission yeast, the expression level of the tRNA-ome is a key determinant of the activation of the TORC1 pathway and links nutrient availability to growth.

The high chromatin occupancy of Pol III was proposed to be sufficient to compete out the installation of a nucleosome at the target loci but the still expanding range of exquisite regulations of Pol III turns down this hypothesis and raises the question of how Pol III handles chromatin remodeling, especially upon de novo initiation seen during exit from starvation. In addition, repressing Pol III by nutritional starvation does not result in a local gain of nucleosome, which suggests that the remodeling of chromatin may be independent of the high level of Pol III.

In a second study [NSABP-C-08 (NCT00096278)], patients with stage II and III colon cancer who had undergone surgery with curative intent, were randomized to receive either bevacizumab administered at a dose equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/week with mFOLFOX6 (N = 1354) or mFOLFOX6 alone (N = 1356). The median age was 57 years, 50% were male and 87% White. Seventy-five percent had stage III disease. The main outcome was DFS among stage III patients. The HR for DFS was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.10). OS was not significantly improved with the addition of bevacizumab to mFOLFOX6 [HR 0.96 (95% CI: 0.75,1.22)].

14.3 First-Line Non–Squamous Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer

Study E4599

The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab as first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent non–squamous NSCLC was studied in a single, large, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter study [E4599 (NCT00021060)]. A total of 878 chemotherapy-naïve patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non–squamous NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21-day cycles of paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC 6) with or without bevacizumab 15 mg/kg. After completing or discontinuing chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive bevacizumab continued to receive bevacizumab alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology (mixed cell type tumors only), CNS metastasis, gross hemoptysis (1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood), unstable angina, or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. The main outcome measure was duration of survival.

The median age was 63 years; 54% were male, 43% were ≥ 65 years, and 28% had ≥ 5% weight loss at study entry. Eleven percent had recurrent disease. Of the 89% with newly diagnosed NSCLC, 12% had Stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion and 76% had Stage IV disease.

### Fundus changes in type III membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: a case report [^c1ec1064]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is characterized by mesangial cell proliferation and is classified into types I, II and III based on structural changes in the glomerular capillary walls. The drusen-like deposits of MPGN type II have been studied, but the fundus changes in MPGN type III have yet to be clarified. We report a case of MPGN type III with multiple deposits in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).

Case Presentation

A 40-year-old Japanese woman with MPGN type III developed numerous yellow-white patches in the central macula of both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed deposits between the RPE and Bruch's membrane. Fluorescein angiography showed choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and OCT confirmed it as type 1 (sub RPE) CNV with fibrin tissue and subretinal fluid in the right eye. After 12 months, the CNV and subretinal fluid resolved spontaneously but the RPE deposits remained in both eyes. Her final visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/16 in the left eye.

Conclusion

We report a case of MPGN type III with multiple deposits in the RPE and CNV, suggesting that various fundus changes occur in MPGN type III and careful fundus follow-up is necessary to prevent vision loss.

### Type III interferons are expressed by coxsackievirus-infected human primary hepatocytes and regulate hepatocyte permissiveness to infection [^635648f4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis is a common and potentially fatal manifestation of severe Coxsackievirus infections, particularly in newborn children. Little is known of the immune-mediated mechanisms regulating permissiveness to liver infection. It is well established that type I interferons (IFNs) play an important role in the host innate immune response to Coxsackievirus infections. Recent studies have highlighted a role for another IFN family, the type III IFNs (also called IFN-λ), in anti-viral defence. Whether type III IFNs are produced by hepatocytes during a Coxsackievirus infection remains unknown. Moreover, whether or not type III IFNs protects hepatocytes from a Coxsackievirus infection has not been addressed. In this study, we show that primary human hepatocytes respond to a Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection by up-regulating the expression of type III IFNs. We also demonstrate that type III IFNs induce an anti-viral state in hepatocytes characterized by the up-regulated expression of IFN-stimulated genes, including IFN-stimulated gene (ISG15), 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (OAS2), protein kinase regulated by dsRNA (PKR) and myxovirus resistance protein 1 (Mx1). Furthermore, our study reveals that type III IFNs attenuate CVB3 replication both in hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes. Our studies suggest that human hepatocytes express type III IFNs in response to a Coxsackievirus infection and highlight a novel role for type III IFNs in regulating hepatocyte permissiveness to this clinically relevant type of virus.

### Sharing the effort of the European green deal among countries [^e6f38248]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Calculation of potential country budgets to 2030 occurs in four steps. The first step is determination of the total EU budget to 2030, given an assumed reduction target compared to historical emission levels, and assumptions on the share of (non)ETS emissions in total EU emissions.

Given an EU effort-sharing sector budget to 2030, the distribution of that budget across countries can be determined based on any number of desired allocation approaches. We develop a number of interpretations, based on (and designed to address) one of the three following equity components: (i) Responsibility, (ii) Capability, and (iii) Equality. We assume that any budget distribution will take into account one interpretation from each equity component, to a varying degree, allowing for combinations of the interpretations. However, before combining them, their individual impact is calculated, as discussed in the section "Description and calculation of interpretations" below.

We first calculate a distribution of emissions as a result of each interpretation, as though the interpretation were the only factor being considered. We then combine the interpretations as described above (using a single interpretation for each equity component) in a weighted combination, with weights of the three chosen interpretations summing to 100%.

In the final step, for each of the possible combinations of interpretations of the equality, responsibility, and capability dimension (i.e. one interpretation from each equity component) we determine the weights among the three that would result in the least deviation from a given reference point. One such reference point is the set of emission reduction targets suggested in the 2018 EU Effort Sharing Regulation (meant to reflect path dependency), the other is a country's upper bound of equity-compatible emissions (the maximum that still could be considered equitable under at least one combination of interpretations across the three dimensions). It should be noted that a common feature for all interpretations is a zero-restriction. A zero-condition is imposed, wherein a country is prohibited from having a positive change in emissions compared to 2005. If the result of a raw interpretation is a positive change, the relevant country is allotted no reduction compared to 2005, and the additional positive allowance initially allocated to it is distributed to all other countries on an equal-per-capita basis. Similarly, we assume that net-negative emissions in 2030 are infeasible, and as such set the maximum required reduction to be 100% of 2005 emissions.

Unless otherwise specified, data was obtained from the EU's EUROSTAT database.

### Short-chain ceramide regulates hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase expression [^dd679e41]. Journal of Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The metabolism of methionine plays an important role in regulating hepatic cellular function. Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is the enzyme that catalyses the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) from ATP and methionine. Liver-specific MAT I/III levels are down-regulated in the regenerating rat liver after partial hepatectomy. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are two cytokines fundamental for liver regeneration. TNF-alpha stimulates sphingomyelin metabolism and ceramide generation in a variety of cell systems.

Aims

The role of exogenous cell-permeable ceramide in modifying MAT I/III mRNA levels and its association with TNF-alpha and IL-6 actions were investigated in rat hepatocytes and H35 hepatoma cells.

Results

C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine) at 1–10 microM decreased MAT I/III expression. The effect was maximum after 2 h of treatment and it was maintained up to 24 h. MAT I/III protein levels also decreased. IL-6 (1–10 ng/ml) potentiated C2-ceramide effects in cultured hepatocytes while decreasing by itself MAT I/III levels with a similar time-response curve in both cell types. C2-ceramide actions were not associated with an increase in cell death. TNF-alpha was also a potent antagonist for MAT I/III expression, at 1–20 ng/ml decreased MAT I/III levels and induced endogenous ceramide generation. The decrease of MAT I/III mRNA levels (in all the cases) was not due to a decrease in mRNA half-life which suggests a regulation at the transcriptional level. Finally, the decrease in MAT I/III mRNA levels correlated to a decrease in MAT activity.

Conclusion

This work demonstrates that short-chain ceramide can be used as a novel exogenous agonist that can modulate hepatic methionine metabolism in association with cytokines.

### Glycogen storage disease type III-hepatocellular carcinoma a long-term complication? [^178bb1d7]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Glycogen storage disease III (GSD III) is caused by a deficiency of glycogen-debranching enzyme which causes an incomplete glycogenolysis resulting in glycogen accumulation with abnormal structure (short outer chains resembling limit dextrin) in liver and muscle. Hepatic involvement is considered mild, self-limiting and improves with age. With increased survival, a few cases of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been reported.

Methods

A systematic review of 45 cases of GSD III at our center (20 months to 67 years of age) was reviewed for HCC, 2 patients were identified. A literature review of HCC in GSD III was performed and findings compared to our patients.

Conclusions

GSD III patients are at risk for developing HCC. Cirrhosis was present in all cases and appears to be responsible for HCC transformation There are no reliable biomarkers to monitor for HCC in GSD III. Systematic evaluation of liver disease needs be continued in all patients, despite lack of symptoms. Development of guidelines to allow for systematic review and microarray studies are needed to better delineate the etiology of the hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with GSD III.

### Clinical imaging guidelines part 1: a proposal for uniform methodology [^9f4b3141]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Inappropriate imaging can lead to unnecessary medical radiologic exposures and cost and may not answer the clinical question. Imaging referral guidelines inform the justification of radiologic procedures and facilitate the choice of the best test first, but their acceptance by referrers, use, and value may be limited by shortcomings in the methodology of development. Focusing on common, essential elements of methodology will help guideline developers. In 2012 and 2013, the International Atomic Energy Agency hosted Technical Meetings on Radiation Protection of Patients Through the Development of Appropriateness Criteria in Diagnostic Imaging. Participants identified and agreed on issues concerning development of imaging referral guidelines. Items based on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument were amended with additional items including development and consensus group composition. Consensus was sought on 28 items, 18 of which were agreed should be uniform, and 10 should allow for regional differences. Further work is required to encourage, provide, and identify higher quality evidence and to agree on a grading system for recommendations. Many key areas are common to guideline developers globally, opening the way for international collaboration to help demystify, simplify, and justify.

### Gefitinib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase III trial – INTACT 1 [^cd99a085]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839; AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) to standard first-line gemcitabine and cisplatin provides clinical benefit over gemcitabine and cisplatin alone in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Gefitinib has demonstrated encouraging efficacy in advanced NSCLC in phase II trials in pretreated patients, and a phase I trial of gefitinib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin showed favorable tolerability.

Patients and Methods

This was a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable stage III or IV NSCLC. All patients received up to six cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) on day 1 and gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 of the 3-week cycle) plus either gefitinib 500 mg/d, gefitinib 250 mg/d, or placebo. Daily gefitinib or placebo was continued until disease progression. End points included overall survival (primary), time to progression, response rates, and safety evaluation.

Results

A total of 1,093 patients were enrolled. There was no difference in efficacy end points between the treatment groups: for the gefitinib 500 mg/d, gefitinib 250 mg/d, and placebo groups, respectively, median survival times were 9.9, 9.9, and 10.9 months (global ordered log-rank [GOLrank] P = 0.4560), median times to progression were 5.5, 5.8, and 6.0 months (GOLrank; P = 0.7633), and response rates were 49.7%, 50.3%, and 44.8%. No significant unexpected adverse events were seen.

Conclusion

Gefitinib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC did not have improved efficacy over gemcitabine and cisplatin alone. The reasons for this remain obscure and require further preclinical testing.

Gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nivolumab — In previously untreated unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a multinational, phase III study compared nivolumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin to gemcitabine-cisplatin alone in 608 patients, with maintenance nivolumab allowed for up to 2 years. After a median follow-up of 33.6 months, nivolumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin showed longer median overall survival (OS) than chemotherapy alone (21.7 vs. 18.9 months; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63–0.96; P = 0.02). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was similar (7.9 vs. 7.6 months; P = 0.001), and at 12 months PFS was 34.2% with the nivolumab combination versus 21.8% with chemotherapy. The overall response rate (ORR) was 57.6% with the nivolumab combination versus 43.1% with chemotherapy, complete responses occurred in 21.7% of patients receiving the combination, and grade ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 61.8% versus 51.7% with chemotherapy. Based on this phase III trial, the NCCN Panel designated the regimen a category 1 recommendation as first-line therapy.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^d36142b7]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibition in HFrEF — in patients with HFrEF and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to III symptoms, the use of angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality; if ARNI is not feasible, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) is beneficial to reduce morbidity and mortality, and in those who are intolerant to ACEI because of cough or angioedema and when ARNI is not feasible, the use of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality; in chronic symptomatic HFrEF NYHA class II or III who tolerate an ACEI or ARB, replacement by an ARNI is recommended to further reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Bosniak classification for complex renal cysts reevaluated: a systematic review [^c06511fb]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

We systematically evaluated the Bosniak classification system with malignancy rates of each Bosniak category, and assessed the effectiveness related to surgical treatment and oncologic outcome based on recurrence and/or metastasis.

Materials and Methods

In a systematic review according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) criteria, we selected 39 publications for inclusion in this analysis and categorized them into 1) surgical cohorts-all cysts treated surgically and 2) radiological cohorts-cysts with surgical treatment or radiological followup.

Results

A total of 3,036 complex renal cysts were categorized into Bosniak II, IIF, III and IV. In surgical and radiological cohorts pooled estimates showed a malignancy prevalence of 0.51 (0.44, 0.58) in Bosniak III and 0.89 (0.83, 0.92) in Bosniak IV cysts, respectively. Stable Bosniak IIF cysts showed a malignancy rate of less than 1% during radiological followup (surveillance). Bosniak IIF cysts, which showed reclassification to the Bosniak III/IV category during radiological followup (12%), showed malignancy in 85%, comparable to Bosniak IV cysts. The estimated surgical number needed to treat to avoid metastatic disease of Bosniak III and IV cysts was 140 and 40, respectively.

Conclusions

The effectiveness of the Bosniak classification system for complex renal cysts was high in categories II, IIF and IV, but low in category III, and 49% of Bosniak III cysts was overtreated because of a benign outcome. This surgical overtreatment combined with the excellent outcome for Bosniak III cysts may suggest that surveillance is a rational alternative to surgery. This will require further study to assess whether surveillance of Bosniak III cysts will prove safe.

Clinical trials provide the foundational evidence that guide many patient-facing decisions; however, the therapeutic effect and safety of an intervention is best evaluated when compared to a control group. We used ClinicalTrials.gov to describe the proportion of registered Phase III and IV cardiovascular clinical trials that contain a control group from 2009 through 2019. Of 1,677 registered Phase III and IV cardiovascular clinical trials, 81.2% contain a control group, and the annual prevalence remained unchanged between 2009 and 2019.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) — biologic agents are now routinely used when one or more traditional systemic agents fail to produce an adequate response, are not tolerated because of adverse effects, or are unsuitable because of the presence of comorbidities; the currently approved biologic agents for the treatment of either psoriasis or PsA include alefacept, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and ustekinumab, with alefacept and ustekinumab FDA approved for psoriasis only and golimumab FDA approved for PsA only; another anti-IL-12/23 antibody, briakinumab, is in the late stages of phase III clinical trials, and phase II and phase III clinical trials are ongoing for numerous other agents including anti-IL-17 antibodies, IL-17 receptor blockers, p-selectin inhibitors, and JAK inhibitors.

### Divergent evolution of male-determining loci on proto-Y chromosomes of the housefly [^abc7033e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

RepeatModeler recognized large blocks of tandem repeats (Fig. 3c, d) located palindromically at the distal parts of M V as interspersed repeats, reminiscent of transposable elements. Moreover, at the ends of the M V locus, we identified Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) and a 9-bp long direct repeat (TTTTAGGTT), which flanks the TIRs and is present as a single copy in the non- M V -contigs (Fig. 3f). This direct repeat sequence thus resembles a target site duplication of a transposition event. Interestingly, by examining 16 independent genomic regions containing a similar stretch of interspersed repeats and palindromic structures, we could identify almost identical TIRs to M V and respective target site duplications (Fig. 3g; Supplementary Fig. 3).

The complex structure of M III

The architecture of M III is distinctive from M V, M III contains only a single functional Mdmd gene, and also a high number of additional truncated copies of Mdmd. We identified two contigs in the M3 genome carrying Mdmd sequences (Contig6762, ~202 kb, referred to as M III -contig-1; Contig7871, ~389 kb, referred to as M III -contig-2; Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 2). The Mdmd sequences scattered across both contigs indicate the large size of M III. We could not determine the exact borders of M III because we did not find corresponding sequences derived from the non- M -containing chromosome III when performing a BLAST search with the terminal sequences of both M III -contigs against the M3 and M5 genomes. Thus, the M III locus might extend beyond the length of the two M III -contigs. As these two M III -contigs share high sequence similarity at one end of each contig (Fig. 4c), they are presumably connected via the overlap. We, therefore, consider both M III contigs as part of one continuous locus encompassing in total ~591 kb, which is more than twenty times larger than M V.

NCCN Bladder Cancer — platinum regimen selection and maintenance: Regimens with lower toxicity profiles are recommended in patients with compromised liver or renal status or serious comorbid conditions, and in patients who are not cisplatin-eligible, carboplatin may be substituted for cisplatin in the metastatic setting for cisplatin-ineligible patients such as those with a GFR less than 60 mL/min. In a phase II/III study in medically unfit patients (performance status 2), the overall response rate (ORR) was 42% for gemcitabine plus carboplatin and 30% for methotrexate, carboplatin, and vinblastine, but rates dropped to 26% and 20%, respectively, with increased toxicity among patients who were both unfit and had renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min). Avelumab maintenance therapy is recommended following cisplatin- or carboplatin-based first-line therapy if there is no progression on first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy.

NCCN Guidelines — Cervical cancer, GOG 204 cisplatin‑doublet comparison: A phase III trial compared four cisplatin‑doublet regimens in 513 patients and was closed early for futility because cisplatin/topotecan, cisplatin/gemcitabine, and cisplatin/vinorelbine were not superior to cisplatin/paclitaxel. No significant differences in overall survival were seen; however, trends for response rate, progression‑free survival (PFS), and overall survival (12.9 vs. 10 months) suggest that cisplatin/paclitaxel is superior to the other regimens. Cisplatin/paclitaxel was associated with less thrombocytopenia and anemia (but with more nausea, vomiting, infection, and alopecia), and while topotecan/paclitaxel was not shown to be superior to cisplatin/paclitaxel, it may be considered as an alternative in patients who are not candidates for cisplatin.

Fixed-dose-rate gemcitabine — infusion rate rationale, outcomes, and panel position: Studies have suggested that the infusion rate of gemcitabine may be important for its efficacy, and clinical studies have shown that administering gemcitabine at an FDR maximizes intracellular concentrations of the phosphorylated forms. In a randomized phase II trial in locally advanced or metastatic disease, FDR infusion led to better survival versus a higher-dose 30‑minute infusion, and in the phase III ECOG-6201 trial median survival was higher with FDR gemcitabine versus standard gemcitabine (6.2 months vs. 4.9 months; P = 0.04) although the superiority criterion was not met. When gemcitabine is considered for advanced pancreatic cancer, the Panel views FDR gemcitabine (10 mg/m2/min) as a reasonable alternative to the standard infusion of gemcitabine over 30 minutes (category 2B) only in patients with poor PS; FDR is incorporated into regimens such as GEMOX and GTX, and FDR gemcitabine plus capecitabine has been found active and well-tolerated.

### Mechanistic insights into lanthipeptide modification by a distinct subclass of lanKC enzyme that forms dimers [^217892d3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

Class III LanKC enzymes fall into two groups with distinct cyclase domains

To unravel the intricacies of Class III LanKC enzymes and to identify potential catalytic residues in their noncanonical cyclase domain, we first performed a sequence analysis. Interestingly, our bioinformatic investigation revealed that Class III LanKCs fall into two major classes that we designated as Class III-a and Class III-b (Fig. 1a) (Supplementary Data 1). The sequence identity between members of these two subclasses is less than 26%. Notably, while the lyase and kinase domains are highly conserved in the two subclasses, the cyclase domains diverge substantially (Supplementary Fig. 2a). A recent study of ThurKC, which falls into Class III-a, identified several catalytic residues in its cyclase domain. However, many of these residues are absent in the recently identified Class III-b enzymes (Fig. 1b).

Within the Class III-b LanKC subgroup, we observed several conserved motifs in the cyclase domain that were previously not identified in lanthipeptide modification enzymes (Supplementary Fig. 2b, top panel). Three highly conserved signature motifs stand out in the cyclase domain: a FPVHYYG motif close to the N-terminus, a QxxQxxRxLPY motif near the middle, and a GxxxAGDxG motif close to the C-terminus (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Importantly, these motifs are absent in members of other LanKC classes, in particular in Class III-a LanKCs (Supplementary Fig. 2b, bottom panel). We therefore propose these motifs to be signatures for Class III-b LanKCs. Our observation also implies that while the cyclase domain in Class III-a and Class III-b LanKCs have the same function, they appear to use different mechanisms.

Furthermore, analysis of the precursor peptide LanA from Class III-b systems showed that these share several conserved features (Supplementary Fig. 2c), including several charged residues and a conserved θxxθxxθ motif within the LP (residues 5–8 in Class III-b LanA peptides)and two tandem SxxSxxxC motifs in the variable CP region that are also present in many other LanKC enzymes. Notably, many Class III-b LanA peptides have a bulky aromatic residue, such as Phe or Tyr, in the position before the first Ser residue in the SxxSxxxC motif (Supplementary Fig. 2c).

### Bleomycin, vincristine, cisplatin / bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin chemotherapy: an alternating, dose intense regimen producing promising results in untreated patients with intermediate or poor prognosis malignant germ-cell tumours [^27087233]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The development of new cytotoxic agents and their incorporation into combination chemotherapy protocols offers another approach to improving survival in this group of patients. Paclitaxel and gemcitabine are two such agents and currently promising data from initial studies of Paclitaxel added to BEP (T-BEP) have resulted in an EORTC randomised study in intermediate prognosis MGCT comparing this regimen to BEP (EORTC protocol 30983).

The inevitable outcome of the studies into high-dose chemotherapy and combinations involving new drugs will be to present a range of treatment options for this group of patients requiring comparison in randomised trials. Determining the true value of dose intense alternating chemotherapy regimens as compared to standard BEP at this point in time could either determine a new standard regimen for this group of patients or remove one of the potential variables from future trials. A Phase III trial comparing C-BOP/BEP to standard BEP is planned in the United Kingdom, which may, hopefully, answer this question.

### RNA targeting and cleavage by the type III-Dv CRISPR effector complex [^eaddd9bd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

RNA cleavage occurs through 2′-O-transphosphorylation

The general strategies for catalyzing phosphodiester bond cleavage by nucleolytic ribozymes include (1) formation of an in-line positioning of the 2′-OH nucleophile with the scissile 5′-O–P bond (α catalysis), (2) the stabilization of the negative charge on the non-bridging phosphoryl oxygens (NPOs, ß catalysis), (3) the activation of the nucleophile by a general base (γ catalysis), and (4) the facilitation of the 5′ leaving group by an acidic group (δ catalysis). Accordingly, the examination of each active site in the CRISPR-Cas type III-Dv complex enabled us to speculate on the role of the chemical groups in the catalysis.

The comparison of the CRISPR-Cas type III-Dv active site structures with other type III complexes reveals several similarities (Supplementary Fig. 9). All type III active sites share a catalytic aspartate crucial for RNA cleavage. Residues in active site 2 of the type III-Dv complex resemble the arrangement observed in types III-A, III-B, and III-E (site 1). Cleavage sites 3 (type III-Dv) and 2 (type III-E) both have a histidine near the RNA 2′-OH. The target RNA geometry at the catalytic sites of type III-Dv resembles that of the hammerhead, pistol, and varkud ribozymes (Fig. 4a, b, f). This geometry enables an in-line nucleophilic attack of the scissile phosphate by the 2′-OH (Supplementary Fig. 10a).

### Palonosetron plus dexamethasone versus granisetron plus dexamethasone for prevention of nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy: a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, comparative phase III trial [^5acca23d]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

Palonosetron is a second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT(3))-receptor antagonist that has shown better efficacy than ondansetron and dolasetron in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and similar efficacy to ondansetron in preventing CINV in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. In this phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, stratified, parallel-group, active-comparator trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of palonosetron versus granisetron for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, both of which were administered with dexamethasone in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

Methods

Between July 5, 2006, and May 31, 2007, 1143 patients with cancer who were receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (ie, cisplatin, or an anthracycline and cyclophosphamide combination [AC/EC]) were recruited from 75 institutions in Japan, and randomly assigned to either single-dose palonosetron (0.75 mg), or granisetron (40 microg/kg) 30 min before chemotherapy on day 1, both with dexamethasone (16 mg intravenously) on day 1 followed by additional doses (8 mg intravenously for patients receiving cisplatin or 4 mg orally for patients receiving AC/EC) on days 2 and 3. A non-deterministic minimisation method with a stochastic-biased coin was applied to the randomisation of patients. Covariates known to effect emetic risk, such as sex, age, and type of highly emetogenic chemotherapy, were used as stratification factors of minimisation to ensure balance between the treatment groups. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a complete response (defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) during the acute phase (0–24 h postchemotherapy; non-inferiority comparison with granisetron) and the proportion of patients with a complete response during the delayed phase (24–120 h postchemotherapy; superiority comparison with granisetron). The non-inferiority margin was predefined in the study protocol as a 10% difference between groups in the proportion of patients with complete response. The palonosetron dose of 0.75 mg was chosen on the basis of two dose-determining trials in Japanese patients. All patients who received study treatment and highly emetogenic chemotherapy were included in the efficacy analyses (modified intention to treat). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00359567.

Findings

1114 patients were included in the efficacy analyses: 555 patients in the palonosetron group and 559 patients in the granisetron group. 418 of 555 patients (75.3%) in the palonosetron group had complete response during the acute phase compared with 410 of 559 patients (73.3%) in the granisetron group (mean difference 2.9% [95% CI -2.70 to 7.27]). During the delayed phase, 315 of 555 patients (56.8%) had complete response in the palonosetron group compared with 249 of 559 patients (44.5%) in the granisetron group (p < 0.0001). The main treatment-related adverse events were constipation (97 of 557 patients [17.4%] in the palonosetron group vs 88 of 562 [15.7%] in the granisetron group) and raised concentrations of serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase: 24 of 557 [4.3%] vs 34 of 562 [6.0%]; alanine aminotransferase: 16 of 557 [2.9%] vs 33 of 562 [5.9%]); no grade 4 main treatment-related adverse events were reported.

Interpretation

When administered with dexamethasone before highly emetogenic chemotherapy, palonosetron exerts efficacy against chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting which is non-inferior to that of granisetron in the acute phase and better than that of granisetron in the delayed phase, with a comparable safety profile for the two treatments.

### Pooled survival and response data from phase III randomized controlled trials for gemcitabine-based regimes in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer [^206211eb]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Although gemcitabine remains current first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, median survival times have not improved significantly since its introduction 15 years ago. Of the phase III trials which have investigated alternative regimens to single-agent gemcitabine, most have used combination regimens as the investigational arm. Accurate data on median overall, progression-free survival and objective response rates is important, for two principle reasons: advising patients about their prognosis and when powering phase II trials and evaluating the results of single-armed trials. This study aims to pool results from published randomized trials to date. Twenty-one randomized phase III trials involving a total of 6348 patients were identified from 1997 to 2010. Only one trial investigating a novel agent in combination with gemcitabine showed a significantly prolonged median and progression-free survival compared with single-agent gemcitabine. Pooled median and progression-free survivals for the single-agent gemcitabine arm involving 3171 patients across all studies were 6.15 and 3.3 months, respectively. Length of survival for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer remains disappointing. Further trials of novel agents to complement or replace gemcitabine are indicated.

### Effectiveness of the innovative Austrian phase III cardiac rehabilitation model on cardiovascular risk factors: a nationwide registry [^4e2c6173]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Unsupervised period of outpatient phase III (OUT-III end –OUT-III refresher)

At OUT-III refresher, that is, the end of the unsupervised phase of OUT-III, exercise capacity slightly decreased by 3 W. The extent of this change is marginal and clearly within the range of daily variability in cardiac patientsand should therefore not be interpreted as a meaningful deterioration. Patients were thus able to maintain an exercise capacity, which was significantly above the level at OUT-III start.

HDL and LDL significantly improved compared with OUT-III start and improved even further relative to OUT-III end. CHOL remained unchanged, as did blood pressure, both variables lying already within the normal range at OUT-III start.

The vast majority (73.9%) of patients reported that they had fully or at least partly achieved their individual rehabilitation goals with the support of a professional, multidisciplinary team. Patients who demonstrate high levels of adherence to the rehabilitation programme appear to be more successful in achieving their goals. Conversely, those who discontinue participation in the rehabilitation programme are less likely to achieve their goals. However, it is at least theoretically possible that the latter group of patients cease involvement due to the rehabilitation programme or setting being unsuitable for them. This aligns with the recent calls for greater personalisation in rehabilitation in order to further enhance rehabilitation outcomes.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^60ed9302]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Other non-platinum based chemotherapy regimens — taxane combinations were evaluated: Taxanes have activity in urothelial bladder cancer, and in a randomized phase III trial comparing GC versus GC plus paclitaxel in 626 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, the addition of paclitaxel produced higher response rates and a borderline overall survival (OS) advantage that was not statistically significant in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; among eligible patients only (92%), there was a small (3.2 months) but statistically significant survival advantage for the three-drug regimen (P = 0.03), with no difference in progression-free survival (PFS), while neutropenic fever was higher with the three-drug regimen (13.2% vs. 4.3%; P < .001). Panelists felt that the risk of adding paclitaxel outweighs the limited benefit, and alternative regimens listed include cisplatin/paclitaxel, gemcitabine/paclitaxel, cisplatin/gemcitabine/paclitaxel, and carboplatin/gemcitabine/paclitaxel.

### Phase I / II study of oral etoposide plus GM-CSF as second-line chemotherapy in platinum-pretreated patients with advanced ovarian cancer [^510735d8]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this phase I/II study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicities of chronic oral etoposide given on days 1–10 followed by rescue with subcutaneous (s.c.) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on days 12–19 as second-line chemotherapy in platinum-pretreated patients (pts) with advanced ovarian carcinoma. Cohorts of three to six pts were treated with doses of oral etoposide from 750 mg m(-2) cycle(-1) escalated to 1250 mg m(-2) cycle(-1) over 10 days, every 3 weeks. Subcutaneous GM-CSF, 400 mug once daily, days 12–19, was added if dose-limiting granulocytopenia was encountered. In total, 18 pts with a median Karnofsky index of 80% (range, 70–100%) and a median time elapsed since the last platinum dose of 10 months (range, 1–24 months), 30% of whom showed visceral metastases, were treated at four dose levels (DLs) of oral etoposide on days 1–10 of each cycle as follows: DL 1, 750 mg m(-2) cycle(-1), without GM-CSF, three pts; DL 2, 1000 mg m(-2) cycle(-1), without GM-CSF, three pts; DL 3, 1000 mg m(-2) cycle(-1), with GM-CSF, six pts; and DL 4, 1250 mg m(-2) cycle(-1), with GM-CSF, six pts. All pts were assessable for toxicity and 16 pts for response. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was reached at DL 4 by three of six pts, showing World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grade 4. One patient died from gram-negative sepsis associated with granulocytopenia grade 4. Two more pts developed uncomplicated granulocytopenia grade 4. Thus, we recommend that DL 3 can be used for further phase II evaluation (i.e. oral etoposide 1000 mg m(-2) cycle(-1), days 1–10, followed by s.c. GM-CSF 400 mug, days 12–19). The clinical complete or partial responses in each patient cohort were: DL 1, one of three pts; DL 2, one of three pts; DL 3, three of five pts; and DL 4, two of five pts. In conclusion, in this phase I/II study, we defined the MTD and the dose recommended for the therapy with oral etoposide given over 10 days followed by s.c. GM-CSF in platinum-pretreated patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Our data demonstrate encouraging activity of this regimen and strongly support its further investigation in a phase II study.
